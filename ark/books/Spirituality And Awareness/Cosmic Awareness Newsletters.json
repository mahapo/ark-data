Dr. Peter Beter (his first and last name rhyme) is a well-known and respected Washington lawyer with many contacts high in government positions who 'It-ak' information to him. During the past four years, ht: has been revealing this information to the public in the form of 'Audio Letters'40 minute tape-recorded cassettes which he mails to subscribers each month. Ilis information mainly is con- cerned with behind-thescenes activities and intriques, power struggles etc. between agents of the United States, Russia etc. The information Dr. Beter reveals seldom appears in the 'controlled' press or television networks. In the past he has uncovered such strange plots as the removal by Rockefeller of the gold from Ft. Knox, the placing of neutron bombs in the freshwater lakes and rivers of the U.S. by the Kussians. Although his information is 'far out' to many, quite controversial and sensational, most of his accusations have never been adequately refuted by his many detractors (mainly publishers who have been 'scooped' by his stories). Much of his information parallals certain information Awareness has been revealing for some time, this mainly about the Illuminati conspiracy (a tentacle of the Beast) and the Rockefeller-Rothschild connection. Information on this is contained in the Gathering Storm readings (No. 79-1). Early in 1979 Dr. Beter revealed the 'Bolshevik plot' taking place behind the scenes in Washington. These were entities expelled from Russia, brought to the U.S. by Kissinger, Rockefeller and Nixon and placed in high positions of authority--their ultimate aim being to take over the governmcn: of the United States and collectivize the entire country, thus creating a totalitarian police state. In the meantime, the 'new guard' in power in Russia, (Christians, who had been waiting 60 years to oust the Bolsheviks) had perfected the art of creating 'doublesJ- trained look-alikes by use of plastic surgery, actors etc. who would quickly replace an official who had been secretly rxecuted, and assume that pretense to the public. In this manner, a revolution took place behind the scenes in Russia, unknown to the public, and the familiar faces in the Kremlin began to gradually change their stance. According to Dr. Beter, the Russians no longer desire a 'cold war' or any war for that maner, for they have developed technology (with the aid of UFOs) that is years ahead of that of the United States. They have developed 'particle beam' laser-type weapons, UFO type aircraft, ('Cosmospheres'), which hover above our nation and which are capable of incinerating an entire city within moments if necessary. In short, according to Dr. Beter, the Russians have not only won the cold war, but are totally in command and fully capable of winning any kind of 'hot' war the US or any other country might try to pull off. The four RockefelIer brothers (who were behind the plot to take over the US) were all executed, according to Dr. Beter and replaced with doubles (all but Nelson's, whose murder was detected and subsequently covered up). When the Bolsheviks in power in the U.S. learned about the doubles being used here and abroad, they became desperate. In order to maintain their positions, they decided to try a 'first-strike' limited nuclear war which would wipe out the missile bases in Russia and destroy that country as a world power. Thus 'Operation Global Shield '79 ' was staged. The plan was to send all SAC bombers and NATO bombers around the world, loaded with nuclear warheads to the Russian boarders (without prior notice), then turn around and come back. This so-called 'exercise' was so planned that the bombers would not turn back at the Soviet borders, but would con- tinue on into Russia and wipe out their missile bases. Fortunately, this did not occur as the Russians had informed Washington that if they proceeded with the plan, they would launch a full response of nuclear warheads against the United States, and a cos- mosphere hovering over Washington DC was ready momentarily to wipe out that city. None of this, of course, appeared in the controlled press. The alarm was being rung by Dr. Beter and by the New Solidarity newspaper, and by Cosmic Awareness. (Please refer to Revel~tz'ons of Awareness No. 79-7 Hotline, 'The Eve of World War 111' and 79-14 Hotline, 'The Passage Perilous' which goes into great detail on all this). One big reason this nuclear disaster was avoided was because the Russian agents in Washington, working behind the scenes to prevent the Bolshevik takeover here in the U.S.,began a campaign of executions. Systematically they executed those in positions of power who had been pushing for war and replaced those entities with 'doubles' or look-alikes. According to Dr. Beter, some of those executed included Jimmy Carter, his entire family, Vice President Mondale, all of Carter's Cabinet, many in the military, the heads of NATO. In Dr. Beter's latest Audio Letter (No. 47) he reveals that the U.S. Supreme Court has been replaced, that the assassins are now moving through Congress and the mass media, eliminating and replacing those who have been 'Hawkish' on containing Russia and promoting legislation and propaganda favorable toward war in the Middle East and elsewhere etc. Heady stuff, this, and if true the citizens of the United States are due for quite a surprise when the plot is finally revealed to them, which it eventually must. (You can't kill off every right-winger and hawk in the U.S. and replace them with doubles without event- ually being caught in the act). When Cosmic Awareness, which in the past had indicated that Dr. Beter was 90% accurate in his revelations, confirmed that these executions were indeed going on behind the scenes, many members of C.A.C. decided that was too much, they could not handle that type of information-so they resigned. Many of Dr. Beter's subscribers cancelled also.If they thought that was too far out to swallow or handle, they should have waited until Audio Letters No. 46 and 47 were released. For Dr. Beter revealed on these two latest tapes that the reason the Russians have successfully executed and replaced so many bigwigs with doubles is that they have been able to create artificial humans (organic robotoids)-grow these creatures from a single cell of the executed person within hours and program them through computers to do and say what they want them to. Having the same DNA as the original, the robotoids retain the same memory, personality and traits as the original entity. Their lifespan, however, is very short (a matter of weeks)so new Robotoids must constantly be grown. Weird, huh! Far-out! Straight out of science fiction, perhaps? Well .... who can say? Being a science-fiction freak and Frankenstein fan, I personally can believe it ... and I dig it. Most of the entities they have 'offed' so far are peopIe, in my opinion, the world can do without-people who promoted war and power for ego and personal gain. When you consider the alternative-billions incinerated in nuclear holocaust-the removal of a few hun- dred entities in Russia and the U.S. is indeed a small price to pay. (It would have been much nicer though if the Russians could have just had one of their UFOs haul them up somewhere in the sky or confined them to another planet or something). But having studied the Awareness readings for some time, death itself is meaningless: you die on one plane, but find yourself being reborn into another, and vice-versa-the soul itself being indestructible. So it stands to reason that if our planet is to survive, those who would violate it and humanity with nuclear war should be removed, one way or another. We owe that, at least, ro the billions yet unborn who would otherwise be denied the experience of life and learning on a physical plane."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"In the Gathering Storm readings, Awareness indicated the strong possibility of a revohtion occurring in this country when the conspiracy was revealed to the public. If Dr. Beter's robotoid stories are true, it is just a matter of time before the Russians will announce on network 'fV and in the mass media, that they have taken over the United States government. They may even dissect a Carter robotoid right there on NBC to prove to millions of stunned Americans that what they are saying is indeed true. I don't know, but I sure hope they do that. That would be the funkiest happening on that medium in many years and just might blow away the laugh tracks programmed into their minds by year's of being hypnotised by the Beast. In any event, it would certainly be a 'mind-blowing' event. In any event, we should all remain watchful as this strange play is acted out before our eyes. I think we should all withhold judgment, keep our minds open to the possibility that all this just might be Fe. And if it is true, what does it mean for Americans ... what does it mean to America? What, if anything, can we do about it? So far I have not been able to find anyone who can answer those questions, but I am certain the future is not fixed, and time will reveal the answers. In the meantime when people ask me whether I personally believe in organic robotoids, I just shrug and say ...' an organic WIAT?' (However, every now and then I give Vikki T. a squeeze in the right places, just to make sure they haven't gotten to her so far). 1 hope this We rap to our new members will encourage them to stay with us for awhile. Actually, this heavy information from Awareness, much of which confirms what Dr. Beter is revealing, has only been coming out during the past year and comprises but a small percentage of the information from Awareness and published by CAC. You are cordially invited to stay, and to grow, and to test yourself as to how well you can handle dynamite information of this type, along with the other more spiritual information being published. If you wish to drop out or cancel your membership, that is okay with us, for we can get along fine without you. But if you opt to stay with us, please do not write and ask us to apologize for Dr. Peter Beter or for Cosmic Awareness or that you now have doubts about the entire Awareness material because you cannot bring yourself to look at the possibility of organic robotoids. If you choose to write off 15 years of Cosmic Awareness material because It maintains Dr. Beter is 90% accurate-then this reflects, in my opinion, exactly where your head is at (in a part of your anatomy not designed to hold the cranium), and you should take a good long look at yourself and that part of the conscious, reasoning mind which is the Lucifer, the Beast, and ask yourself, 'Who is really running my show?' We expect that from time to time, more information on organic robotoids will be fdcoming. Dr. Beta maintains on his latest tape that this concept MUST be understood and accepted, or nothing that occurs in the future in this nation will make any sense at all. For nothing, he claims, will EVER be the same again. In 1963 Cosmic Awareness started the Orgat~ization of Awarenes, and CAC is an extention of that original concept, which was to enable its membership to become AWARE. The digesting and consumption of mind-boggting concepts such as 'organic robo- toids', looking at these concepts without judgment, and accepting the possibility they could exist, is going to put us all to what could be the most severe test of our lives-but it could also help us to become aware ... and be able to move on from there. Also, we should keep in mind that Cosmic Awareness indicates there are two factions (the good Russians and the bad Russians- the Bolsheviks) now manufacturing and using these doubles in a behind-thescene war to take over our country. Somehow we must learn to determine which is which, particularly on that day sometime soon when they make their presence known to the general public. In any event. fasten your seatbelts .... there is some very heavy wearher ahead.

Well ... You DID Ask From a C.A.C. General Reading, June 29,1979 QUESTION: We've received quite a few letters in reference to Dr. Beter's latest tape and the 'Robotoids', and we will probably no doubt get many more unless we print something up. And, probably this letter from M.W. will suffice for the general tone of the letters we've received. I will read the letter, then ask the first of three specific questions tacked onto the letter. \"Dear C.A.C. I think it is absolutely imperative that Awareness comment further on Dr. Beter's lest two tapes, No.'s 45 and 46, concerning the Russians killing top American leaders and replacing them with arganic robotoids. This idea is so completely ridiculous that not even the most open-minded people ere willing to accept it. To me it seems as though Dr. Beter has flipped out and CAC also must be flipped out to support this crazy theory. I admit, Beter had me going with the Bolshevik double theory, but now the robotoid thing is just too far out1 Also I have gotten some issues of the SPOTLIGHT and find them extremely narrow-minded and offensive. And it seems that CAC should not support this type of propaganda. Their support of Anita Bryant, for example, their condemnation of 'left-wing hippie socialist radicals' who protest nuclear energy etc. is simply the same type of narrow-mindedness we should be trying to get away from, NOT SUPPORT! 1 don't even want their newspapers in my house1 And Gary Allen's books, with his support of the John Birch Society, which is one of the most fascist organizations in the world, are also narrow-minded to the point that they begin losing credibility. How can I believe unprovable accusations made by narrow-minded, right-wing, fascist organizations, and how can ANYONE believe that our nation has been taken over by Russia by means of 'organic robotoids' 7 It sounds like nothing more than a paranoid's fantastic fantasy, and CAC's support of these crazy people forces one to question CAC's credibility. IS it possible that Paul has tuned into Dr. Beter's twisted mind? Is it possible that Paul has become lost on a path of right-wing political insanity? I don't know, I hope there is some logical explanation for all this. I don't think CAC can just shrug off the robotoid thing now tholt they've brought it to our attention. I feel Awareness MUST explain this craziness. You can't really expect anyone to believe it, can you ? At least not without some solid evidence. If Shockley is indeed a clear channel for Cosmic Awareness, can't he give us information on how to prove these happenings 7 1 have accepted much of the conspiracy theories up to now. but I now am beginning to feel I've been led down the path of some crazy people's paranoid fantasies. I hope Awareness can satisfactorily explain some of these seemingly crazy theories. At this point, I don't put much faith in anything I've read by Gary Allen, the SPOTLIGHT or heard from Dr. Beter, because their ability to see things clearly and open-mindedly seems suspect. And now I have to say I'm even suspicious of the clarity of CAC's readings. I'm sure a lot of people feel the same way. I hope this can be cleared up.\" And his first question is: \"Awareness, please comment in detail on Dr. Beter's theory of Russian robotoids replacing Carter, Brezinski and so forth, and give some means whereby this seemingly insane theory nay be proven true or false.\" COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that before attending this first question, this Awareness wishes to comment on your letter in general. This Awareness indicates that throughout your letter the question is asked, 'How could anyone expect another to believe such insanity'? , This Awareness has again and again asked entities not to believe.* This Awareness asks entities to discover what is. This Awareness asks entities to discover what is by questioning and doubting-by doubting not only others, but by doubting one's own beliefs. This Awareness suggests that entities in discovering what is must first question themselves and their own beliefs. This Awareness suggests that in terms of the information which this Awareness has given, It did not say to support Dr. Beter, to Support Spotlight, to support the information of the New Solidarity or U.S. Labor Party- this Awareness indicated that these were sources of infomation which could not be found in otherplaces. This Awareness indicates that these sources of information add to one's general understanding of what is occurring. This Awareness did not indicate that the Spotlight was completely true, but char it was partially true. This Awareness suggests that you refer back to that reading where this Awareness indicated these sources as being of value. * * *ED'S Note: this information has even been incorporated in the Letterhead of 'Revelations of Awareness'.(Doesntt anyone read ihat?) ** Ple;lse refer to 'Revelations of Awareness' No. 79-10 (How to Keep Informed Ln Spite of the Controlled Press): $1.50 Fmm rAr"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"This Awareness suggests that iii tams of the conflict between Dr. Betcr's material and the material printed - by the Spotlight, that this information can be evaluated in terms of the overall and long-range information pre- sented by these organizations, rather than over particular articles. This Awareness suggests that in terms of the accuracy of these organs of information, that there are indeed areas wherein there is inaccuracy printed or re- leased, both in the New SoEidgrity-1J.S. Lzhor Party material and in the Spotlight material and also there is some error in the Dr. Beter matevia?. This Awareness has indicated that the Dr. Beter material as being approximately 30% accurate in those areas which it covers. This Awareness indicares this means ther~ is approximately 1C% that is not accurate. This Aw- areness suggests that likewise, there are certain percentages in the SpotZigh publications which are inaccurate. This Awareness indicates that the information being released by the Spotlisbt as that which presents a certain viewpoint, which is part of conscio~tsness. This Awareness indicates the information being released by the New Solidarity is also presenting a certain viewpoint in consciousness. This Awareness indicates that the information released from the controlled press preseqts a certain viewpoint which is prevalent in consciousness. This Awareness indicates that the U.S. Labor Party is generally considered to be left-wing, the New Solidarity newspaper as representing a sorner*~hst 'zftirt approach to political evaluations. This Awareness suggests the Spot- Light as that which generally is seen as representing the conservative point of view. This Awareness indicates rhat if one is of a liberal mind, that entity wiU consider himself or herself to be in the middle of consciousness, and anything to the right of their ovpn attitudes as being conservative or extreme right. This Awareness suggests that if one is in the conservative vein. they would consider the liberal to be a leftist. This Awareness indicates all this is relative. This Awareness indicates that a mind which is truly searching to discover what is, will look at all different opinions, will read all different viewpoints-and that this kind of consciousness will be capable of looking without feeling offended, without feeling violated at the different viewpoints of various entities or various concepts or various opinions, when discovering or when reviewing certain information. This Awareness suggests that the entity who is offended by Anita Bryant, the entity who is offended by certain right-wing concepts, this entity is close-minded to these areas. This Awareness indicates the entity who is offend- ed by left-wing liberal concepts is also close-minded. This Awareness asks entities to become amre, and to be- come aware entities must look at the thing from all sides. This Awareness indicates that your controlled press tends to look at things from a very limited point of view, not to look deeply, but to look from a shallow and very pacifying point of view, with the emphasis given to the political attitude of the party who is in charge of the controlled press at the time. This Awareness indicates that the mass media generally takes the attitude of 'Don't shock the public with anything. Don't let out too much news about anything. Keep the public somewhat ignorant of the facts behind the headlines.' This Awareness indicates that when It recommended the U.S. Labor Party paper, the recommen- dation is not simply on the grounds of its total accuracy, but as much if not more so on the depth of information -that this organizarion has a very profound intelligence system, whereby they look behind the scenes and eval- uate the activities which are going on in a political, economic and socid atmosphere within the world's environs. This Awarneess indicates that this organization, the U.S. Labor Party, gives more information of the world events in one newspaper than you ~ili find in nosr newspapers in a month of reading. This Awareness indicates that the accuracy is not the only thing to consider. This Awareness indicates that this newspaper does have its part- icular slant, its particular point of view. This Awareness suggests that It expects entities to question those slants and those points of view. This Awareness indicates that It does expect entities to have some originality in their thinking and in their evaluation, and not simply to believe this newspaper or to believe every statement presented simply because this Awareness has indicated rhat it was 65% accurate. This Awareness indicates when It indicated 65% accurate, this meant that there is a chance of 35% inaccuracy, and this Awareness suggests that entities may also look for the inaccuracies involved. This Awareness indicates that in terms of the Spotlight information, the information which is given goes into detail in several areas, and again this is slanted from a right-wing point of view which is so obvious that entities may look around the right-wing point of view and see what is happening-recognizing that they are viewing this from the conservative eyes of this newspaper; yet there is information being printed in this newspaper which gives knowledge that is not available elsewhere. This Awareness suggests that this as likened unto looking at an elephant in a stall whereby the entity stands in the front of the elephant and observes this elephant and states what is seen, and dl observers stand around and say, \"That appears to be correct to me; that appears to be the face value in-depth observation of this aeahne\" This Awareness indicates that anorher reporter, or publisher may move over to the right-wing side of the elep- hant, looking through the stall, may describe what is seen. This Awareness indicates this description being pres- ented, the audience standing in fronr. says, \"Oh, that is absurd; that is an extreme and offensive description to me.\" This Awareness indicates that another reporter may move to the left side of this creature and describe the nature of the elephant as viewed from that side, and the entities standing in front looking at face value will say, 2. *"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"\"That is ridiculous, these are idiots on the extreme left side and they do not see clearly.\" This Awareness indic- ates there are others who look in depth and see that which is from the rear of the elephant, and describe this, and those in front simply remark, \"This is totally ridiculous; this man has simply flipped out and has gone insane:' This Awareness indicates that an entity who is attempting to be scientific and truly objective, will consider a11 sides of the elephant rather than simply the face value as indicated by the cor~trolled press. This Awareness indicates that in terms of your evaluation of Dr. Beter's information--you have the right to close your mind at any time you choose-dl entities have the right to close their eyes and not look. This Aware- ness indicates you have the right to refuse to accept the viewpoint of someone on the right or on the left, you may also refuse to believe those who are giving you the information on face value. This Awareness indicates you also can refuse that which is described by those who are observing from all sides. This Awareness indicates if you truly wish to be objeciive, you will listen to everything and not close off any possibilities for information to enter into your consciousness. There is no need for you to make a decision as to whether the elephant is real, unreal, shaped like this, shaped like that, looks like this, or looks like that, has this purpose or has that purpose, -no one is forcing you to reach a conclusion at this time. This Awareness suggests that you may reach your conclusion if you so choose, or you may remain open and wonder whether there is any truth to any of these reports, and allow these reports to continue to come your way and to observe that which you have not seen before, to listen to the reports of others as they see and as they report. This Awareness indicates it becomes absurd not to listen to the reports of others, but to refirse to listen to the reports of others, This Awareness indicates when entities close their eyes, close their ears,'close their minds -then they may be satisfied that they have all the information they need to make a decision, but they have ceased to hear anything more, and they have their decision---but they have lost their curiosity and their quest and search for truth. for they assume they know the truth. This Awareness indicates this has been going on for centuries and many entities prize that attitude of 'I know the truth, I need not be shown anything more.' This Awareness indicates that in your demands, or your request, whichever it may be, that this Awareness or the entity Paul Shockley prove to you that the robotoids exist, you are setting yourself up for a disappointment, for neither this entity nor this Awareness is your servant, nor needs to prove anything to you, but can share whaz is seen, when and if you open your consciousness to receive, to search, and to wonder whether there is anything to this or not. This Awareness indicates that the fact that you wrote the questio1i';'asked the question, indicates that your mind is still searching, and therefore you have not closed your mind to this. This Awareness therefore suggests that the question be asked and that this Awarenmss shall give you indications whereby you may search for better understanding of how these robotoids might be real. ..... ABOUT THOSE ( ahem) ROBOTOIDS ..... 7 QUESTION: \" Please comment in detail on Dr. Beter's theory of Russian robotoids replacing Carter, Brezinski, and so forth, and give some means whereby this seemingly insane theory may be proven true or false?\" COSMIC AWARENESS : This Awareness does not wish to prove this true or false. This Awareness indicates that if It presented the proof of this information, the Interpreter, the staff of C.A.C. and the majority of members in C.A.C. and Dr. Beter, would in fact be jeopardized and endangered by the proof. This Awareness indicates that this infomatjon as being extremely dangerous for this entity to have released--that the only reason why the entity has been allowed to continue serving after the release of this information is because it appeared to be so unbelievable that the public has not responded or reacted in a manner that threatened those who are behind this action. This Awareness indicates that there is no wy and no need for this Awareness to prove these exist in order to be in your good graces. This Awareness indicates it is for you to make this discove y after researching and learning and digging and waiting, and wondering if this is important to you to make a decision as to their reality or not. This Awareness indicates however, that there are ways whereby you may search out further information on the development of these creatures. This Awareness indicates that you research the areas of the DNA (you may begin with the book mentioned by Dr. Beter), that you research areas on cloning, that you research areas on electromagnetic fields, that you research areas in relation to UFOs-for these are all tied together. This Awareness indicates that the electromagnetic fields are used in creating certain atmospheres of an elect- ronic nature, for the transmuting of the DNA. This Awareness indicates that information which may lead to certain possible areas of research in this field, can be found in studies on mice and frogs and other small animals in the early researches of the DNA. This Awareness indicates that the majority of this type of information has been withheld from the public, and is not available. This Awareness suggests that if you wish to spend some be 3."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"moving into these fields of study, you may spend approximately ten years working through various scientific * works and becoming acquainted with different scientists in the fields, to ask questions and research the inform- ation in this manner. This Awareness indicates that otherwise you may seek to explore through contacts with secret services, various entities who have contacts in the CIA or the secret services, and if careful you may become aware through some of these entities of areas wherein certain researches of this type have occurred. This Awareness indicates this may take quite some time in developing friends in these branches of government who will share information with you or refer you to others who would do so. This Awareness suggests thar if working your way up through the scientific academy or working through the secret services or through research in libraries does not appeal to you, this Awareness suggests that you wait for other Dr. Beter tapes and other Awareness messages and other sources to present themselves to you for your further evaluation, and that you shelf your concern for immediate answer to this situation. This Awareness indicates that: essentially 'there are more things in heaven and earth than you have dreamed of in your philosophy'. This Awareness indicates that the magnitude of this area of research and development is so great that entities cannot at present comprehend. This Awareness indicates that this however is but a small portion of information which is withheld from the public. This Awareness indicates that entities ask this Awareness questions-this Awareness, speaking through Its Interpreters, gives information. This Awareness indicates entities are not satisfied with the information given, but want more information, more in-depth information-want to know more about how this or that can be. This Awareness indicates if It gives everything that an entity could ask about, if It answered all the questions in perfect proof and perfect evidence, exposing all secrets that the members would ask about, the Interpreter would be slain and the members hunted down for knowing too much about vital secrets to those who have power and wish to continue holding that power. This Awareness indicates the Project Bluebook * once had twelve hundred employees-there are now thirteen of these entities still alive -for they knew too much. THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY QUESTION : H.N. of El Cerrito, Calif. has a related question, I believe, in relation ro this. She says, \"Some years back, some of the Russian government men were eliminated and were replaced by some of the 'serpent people', who have the power to appear as an exact duplicate of any per? a\" and she was wondering if this could be what is happening that Dr. Beter describes as the 'robotoids'? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that the production of these creatures in Russia has been occurring for approxim- ately ten years. This Awareness indicates that research has been going on for thirty-five years. This Awareness indicates that entities nay be shocked to discover that Russia has advanced so far in rerrns of technology, but this is not so strange when atities realize that the Rockefellers were working with the Russians during the pst thirty-five years and longer. This Awareness indicates these Rockefellers with their various agents and agencies, those familiar in the government - the FDA, the CIA, the AMA, and others - confiscated many inventions, many secret discoveries and placed these in restriction in the United States so that they could not be developed or could not be made public, but sent this information to Russia for development in secret labor- atories and in secret experiments and research centers there. This Awareness indicates the intention was to give all of this high technology to Russia so that Russia, working with the Rockefellers, could take over the United States when the time was right and would assist in setting up the new world government which the Rockefellers and Rothschilds had planned. This Awareness indicates rhe information given by Dr. Beter about the breakdown of that alliance between Russia and the Rockefellers explains how this fell .apart, and why the Russians are now in control of this high technology and the Americans are behind. This Awareness indicates the American scientific and military dev- elopments in terms of this technology are lagging from fifteen to twenty years behind. This Awareness indicates that the colleges teaching science to their students in comparison to the advancement of scientific technology which occurs behind the scenes, particularly in Russia-these colleges are likened unto schools teaching children 4."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"to play with tinker toys-they are given only the basics of science, and in many cases are given information that deliberately is designed to keep them from advancing scientifically. This Awareness indicates this particularly in terms of medical and military, physics and sciences-this last statement to be clarified: this particularly in terms of military and medical sciences, in that these be of use to miIitary purposes or medical purposes. This Awareness indicates that these schools being supplied with text books from those organizations, publishing houses which are controlled by the Rockefellers, which have been controlled by these entities, -these textbooks as determining the level of development in these areas. For 30 Years, Ruuia has been Buying U.S. Patents for Ten Cents Each ('Oil Shortage' a Contrived Result of Rockefeller Greed) This Awareness indicates that the Rockefellers had an arrangement with the U.S. Patent Office, that Russia could have any patent for ten cents per copy. This Awareness indicates that it automatically was to supply these patents to Russia---this has been in existence for some time, approximately thirty years. This Awareness indicates the best brains in America, the greatest inventions, these have been of great value to the Russians along with their own creative and inventive capabilities, whereas the Rockefellers and Roths- childs have hindered these brains and inventors in America to prevent them from bringing forth those inventions which could be of great benefit to the masses. This Awareness indicates the 'oil shortage' is but a contrived result of this and other situations, for there are many inventions at this time which allow free energy--energies which need no oil. This Awareness suggests there are inventors who have created working models of various types of engines or power-producing plants, which need no oil and which can run on free energy. This Awareness indicates for example, the wave turbines which produce electricity from the waves of the ocean, whereby these placed on both sides of the continent in the Pacific and in the Atlantic, could power all electric needs of this nation--from coast to coast, for less than the hydro-electric dams. There are Many Inventions withheld from public (Motors that will run without oil) This Awareness indicates that there are also motors which run on electro-magnetism, on the breaking down of water into hydrogen and oxygen, on the use of vortex energies and motors which run oil air alone by turn- ing this air into gases. This Awareness indicates there are also solar powers, which can be made to produce en- ergy in a much more inexpensive way than the oil or nuclear power plants--there are also thermal energies from beneath the ground, the geothermal energies which can be a cheap source of power. This Awareness ind- icates there is also that which can make fuel for automobiles and for other forms of heating, through the use of wood and organic plant life, by creating alcohols and oils which can be used or by creating gas, which can be used for these purposes-but none of these can be brought forth without the permission of the multi-national oii companies who control the wealth and energies and those of the public and private utility companies and the government which supports these monopolies. American Medical Assoclatlon (AMA) is Suppressing Healing Machines This Awareness indicates there are also healing machines and rnethods which are suppressed by the powers of the unions and associations, that of the American Medical Association. This Awareness indicates there is so much control and power based on the greed force, that the entire network from government, from the corp- orate levels down, through the controlled presses, the me,:cal and the American Bar Association, and even into the trade unions-this Awareness indicates that all of this needs to be cleansed. This Awareness indicates this is occurring and will continue to occur and there is a great power moving through the Illuminati at this time, which is dismantling this organization and all its complexities--taking the Beast apart from the top down. This Awareness indicates entities who want proof of this, may need to wait until it is announced over their television, radio or in their newspapers and magazines. This Awareness indicates that it is not a matter whether entities believe or not; it does not matter to this Awareness whether entities believe or not. This Awareness suggests you not believe-this Awareness asks you to become amre, if you can find any way of becoming aware, this Awareness suggests you do that. This Aw- areness does not indicate that awareness must come through this Interpreter, through Dr. Beter or through any other particular source: This Awareness suggests you find those sources which help you to become aware. (Reading concludes on following page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"(CIosing Message) . This Awareness indicates the word 'awareness' carries with it a hint as to how to become aware. This Aware- ness indicates it is closely related to the word 'beware'. This Awareness indicates it also contains the letters A.W.E. This Awareness indicates when one experiences awe, one is opening his or her consciousness and is taking in, taking in, taking in, receptive-the awesomeness, being in awe of--when one is in awe, one is recep- tive and open and listening. This Awareness indicates when one cease to be in awe, ceases to question, ceases to wondor, ceases to search, ceases to listen--one simply knows and is satisified and therefore, can put the issue to rest and needs not question, and may go back to sleep, or forget. This Awareness indicates when one begins to shut down, close down the shop of mind, close down the awareness, the search, the questioning; when one closes down one's consciousness (no longer seeking), ass- uming to have reached the conclusions and answers needed, one has eaten of the tree of knowledge and knows. This Awareness indicates when one knozus, one no longer is receptive to the energies of life. This Awareness indicates the Tree of Knowledge closes off sensitivity and stops the energies from entering the body, which give it enthusiasm, which give it vitality. This Awareness indicates when one is questioning, wondering, searching, the entity is also absorbing vital energies-the questioning mind, the searching conscious- ness allows an entity to live longer and fuller, and to maintain youthful vigor much longer. I HARD TIMES STILL ARE COMING ( Gathering Storm Infortnation Still Valid) (Opening Meruge. Reading of June 29.1979) This Awareness indicates that the energies at the moment in this latter part of June as that which may be likened unto a peaceful intersection of waters from various channels and sources, whereby one may rest, wait or reside temporarily in time and space but cannot remain permanently. This Awareness indicates there are several directions whereby the movements may go. This Awareness sugg- ests that it appears the movement shall continue on the momentum which has been built, toward that which was indicated last fall in the Gathering Storm information. This Awareness indicates that the probability of severe economic difficulties as that which is rapid approach- ing, that the exact timing given last fall as a probability of October 29th, that this is not necessarily valid as a date, for this as being an economic crisis that cannot be controlled with that exactness. This Awareness indic- ates however, that the effect will be felt on a more gradual downturn. This Awareness suggests that the control of this crisis is not likely to be quite so motivated as was previously indicated to set up the economic conrrols which would enslave the masses. This Awareness indicates however, that there will be other potential controls, for other motives, that can create many hardships for entities. This Awareness indicates thar it appears to be a situation whereby the powers controlling the economy shall experience an influence that comes from many sources which prevents absolute control by any one group or any one organization. This Awareness indicates that in this process, there can be much readjustment and realignment of the responsibilities and rights of individqds and their expect- ations and claims to those rights. This Awareness suggests that there will be many who will suffer, @articularly in the economic sense-that many others will benefit from the time coming. This Awareness suggests that this action has broad scope of purpose in the general sense, and will have an overall beneficial result for humanity even though the immediate effects will be unpleasant for many entities. This Awareness indicates &at more will be released on this infor- mation at a later time. ***** ED'S Note: We su est that any new members who have nor yet done so, order the booklet Saving Fortunes b Sbd Favors, written by Paul shm%ey, .which gives dded information on how to side-step the coming depression.

The one on tho right was shown jogging in Washington D.C. in August. Jogging however, could be dangerous to the health of a robotoid. According to Dr. Beter on his letest Audio Letter (No. 501, the Russians decided they would eliminate Carter once and for all (maybe because he requires so many robotoids), end programmed him in that wall- publicized race, to run until he collapsed and died of a heart etteck. Robotoids, being quite durable creatures however, often do not wish to cooperate, particularly when they receive a program telling them to leave this plane. Carter did eventually collapse, but his legs remained kicking furiously, much to the disgust of the Russians who thought his public demise would put an end to his antics. On the back of this page you will find certain news stories and headlines taken from the controlled press. Some of these concern robotoids. Lillian Carter end Billy, for example. Also, Jimmy's famous statement about 'I'll whip his ass' (Referring to the robotoid Teddy Kennedy). Robotoids seem to have a rivalry among one another. You will also note some of the changes taking place among robotoids Henry Jackson and Henry Kissinger. Robotoid watching is kind of fun. I didn't use to watch the TV news very much. However, now I do occasionally when I want a good laugh. Maybe Parker Brothers will bring forth a Roboid Game this christmas. The Presidential election next year should be a ript.

In many cases, Awareness informed us that if It gave too much information on this subject, and we published it, that the Interpreter and the staff of C.A.C. would undoubtedly be killed. It promised that in time, when the time was right for the release of such material, more would be presented. Over the years, certain questions were answered which Awareness requested to be 'classified' and to be released later when more UFO information was presented. There were many questions which were answered, some of which related to the astounding phenomenon of the cattle mutilations in the Western states, the strange and unexplained booming sounds off the Atlantic coast, questions relating to Bigfoot (the SasquatcN, the Bermuda Triangle, the Hollow Earth etc. All of this material is being compiled into a booklet which will be offered to the membership later on (for some suggested donation). However, this reading comprises the important information about the UFO's in relation to the previous information already published about the Beast and its plan to enslave this planet. This information also ties into certain information on Jehovah, the Immortal Real of Hades etc. which has also been previously published by this organization. Discerning readers will be able to put much of this information together after reading this particular UFO reading. It also will help to make more sense out of what has occurred behind the scenes in Washington D.C. during the Spring of 1979 when the Russian agents begun the dismantling of the Beast structure by executing those in power who were about to launch a nuclear war against the Soviet Union. Much of this information relating to the 'Synthetics' (humanoids being created in the mountains of Nevada and working for the forces of the Beast) was released to certain key people in the United States in the Fall of 1978, with instructions from Cosmic Awareness to release that information far and wide in the event these communications from C.A.C. and the Interpreter, Paul Shockly, should be disrupted (this being the actual tape of the trance information). Cosmic Awareness has now given permission to release this information, particularly since Dr. Beter has revealed the information on the organic Robotoids now masquerading as President Carter and all those others we see on television and read about in the papers who ostensibly are running the government of the United States. Awareness has revealed that the executions are still going on behind the scenes in Washington-the assassins now moving through the military and almost in total control. The plot of the Rockefeller- Rothschild Beast conspiracy to destroy the economy of the United States is being allowed by the Russians to occur. Information on all this has been previously published by C.A.C., the scenario of which can be found in the Gathering Storm material ($4.00 available from C.A.C.) Although this sinister plot appears mainly to be the work of these greedy, power-hungry bankers to enslave humanity with their 'One World Government', it goes much further than that--cosmic implications reaching back thousands of years and 'Star Wars' type battles between,the Dark Forces and the Light Forces for control of the planet earth. The infiltration of these Dark Forces into this plane, working through the Rockefeller-Rothschild banking systems which Awareness refers to as the Illuminati or the Beast, reached its high-point in the Spring of 1979 when the Biblical Battle of Armaggedon was to occur when the United States was about to embark on its planned 'First Strike' nuclear war against the Soviet Union and the oil fields of Saudi Arabia. According to Cosmic Awareness, this battle was fought behind the scenes and the holocaust was prevented. Now it is just a matter of time before the Russians, now completely in power of our government, will make their presence known to the masses. The publication and dissemination of this UFO reading may help to explain these bizarre happenings to the sleeping populace when this revelation by the Russians is made public. According to Awareness, there is still a danger of these UFO agents who work for the Beast, to create problems. For this reason, Awareness has said this information must 'be spread far and wide as quickly as is possible'. This will not only help inform the public of what is occumng, but will probably prevent any harm coming to the Interpreter of this material and C.A.C. There is no benefit in closing the barn doors after the horses have been released. With this in mind, all members are requested to duplicate this material immediately and send copies to friends, newspapers, government personnel etc. SPIRAL organizations are also requested to duplicate and send out this information. We know it sounds weird and bizarre (we have not even got used to the idea of organic robotoids yet), but Cosmic Awareness has been communicating with this plane since 1963, most of which has been deeply spiritual information, and as far as we know nothing Awareness has indicated in these readings has been proven untrue. If for no other reason, it behooves us to pay attention to this information now being releasedand to do what we can to spread it around. I have taken the liberty of culling certain excerpts from previously-published readings and from some not yet published. It is import- ant that if we are to understand the UFO phenomenon and why Russian robotoids are in control of the United States, we need to the Hebrew race, and how the Dark Force used these entities and the banking systems to an enslavement of humanity upon this lane. The role of Jesus in thwarting the sinister plans of K The basic information Awareness as s us to spread far and wide begins after the introductory how UFO aliens have infiltrated our government.

D.W . of Ridgefield, Washington, wants to know if these robotoids have an aura ... ? COSMIC AWARENESS : This Awareness indicates that this around the heart chakra only. QUESTION: Do these robotoids become inhabited by spirits or other entities? COSMIC AWARENESS: This as negative, except in rare instances whereby certain forces might penetrate briefly. This Awareness ind- icates these creatures as not being suitable for the com lete embodiment of a disembodied s irit-that the met- a B abolism of these creatures is such that the disembodie spirit would not enjoy being involve inside such a creature, except very briefly.

QUESTION: CARTER FAMILY AND OTHERS EXECUTED WAS MURDER FOR SELF-DEFENSE (Amy a Victim of Circumstancosl Disregarding the original motive for creating a robotoid of a certain entity, is there any violation anywhere in consciousness to that entity who was removed when the robotoid was created? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates this as having been murder. This Awareness indicates this in the case of many of these entities removed. This Awareness indicates these entities in many cases working for that which would have bret about the death, mahem, genocide, murder of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions upon this earth through the planned nuclear war-cannot be forgotten, and though the death of these entities is a serious violation to them personall , they planted the seeds for this result in their motives prior to their death, and had this not occurred, it woul g have been such that masses would have been sacrificed in order to feed the a petites of those who have been replaced by these organic robotoids; therefore this may be considered as selfde ? ense. This Awareness indicates that in some situations, those replaced were victims of circumstance, such as the ent- ity Amy Carter. This Awareness indicates that the circumstance being that she was a member of the family. This Awareness indicates that the alternative could have been such that entitites now living would have sacrificed their own children to the appetite of those forces which were pushing franticall for nuclear war against Russia as a last desperate-utterly desperate-attem t to gain world power and contro this planet for the Alien Force. This B Y Awareness wishes entities to understan that which this Awareness has referred to as the Beast, that which Dr. Beter has referred to as the Bolsheviks, these forces as being essentiall controlled b Alien Forces not of this world, that the information released on the tape of the synthetics wil explain this Zrther. QUESTION: Y Then when a robotoid burns itself out and essentially dies, is there any form of soulstuff that emerges and goes into consciousness that might be identified with the original entity whom it replaced? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates this as very little-this similar to ectoplasm, or the electromagnetic field of energy that might emit from a hand or finger seen under Kirilian photography. This Awareness indicates there is an energy which is released from these beings, that this also may be similar to energy which is held in plants. This Awareness indicates this may be somewhat stronger in the robotoid. 3."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"ROBOTOIDS ARE CREATURES WITHOUT SOULS ( Not Human Beings 1 This Awareness su ests that the robotoid does not have a complete k development of soul, ut does have certain spirit energies-this similar to what might be termed an elemental.

QUESTION: Is there any longer a threat to entities on this plane by those synthetics? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that the Alien Force will begin evacuting this planet around October of this year- this during the meteor showers from the direction of Onon. This Awareness indicates that these entities use these meteor showers as cover to avoid the Intergalatic Space Confederation, who have quarantined this planet in an effort to contain these entities and to capture and control them. 'The Men in Black' are Evacuating this Planet QUESTION: Then that means that essentially the so-called 'Men in Black' whom the UFO people have written about for so long will no longer be lurking around on this plane? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates this in the affirmative-that this may continue for some time, but that essentiall the forces are being diminished. This Awareness indicates that not all of these forces wi f 1 escape from this planet-these forces essentially resentiy for oition in order to planet in future times.

THE NIGHT MUTILATORS QUESTION: Over the past couple of years there have been quite a few questions that where asked that Awareness said to keep classified that were related to this general area-cattle mutil- ations etc. Is it all right to compile that information and release it along with this reading? ED'S Note: time did not pennit us to include all this UFO info but this will all appear in the UFO booklet being prepared. COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates this in the affirmative. This Aware- ness indicates that essentially the purpose of the cattle mutilat- ions was to gather certain acids from the membranes, particularly those of the li s and soft tissues-these as tirpo* acid, M h is used by space \\ eings to prevent the bones from deterioratir g in outer space. This Awareness indicates that these entities also used the cerebral fluids and the cerebellum for creating certain types of humanoids-these as those reported which have large eyes, white pasty skin, as was presented in the movie,QoseEncounters. This Awareness indicates these essentiall were the products of alien s ace beings, rather than of the G actic Space Confederat- R 9 ion. T ese humanoid types were essentially robots-very similar in essence to the robotoids, being of different ap earance, look- ing much like some strange irnagnative creature,%aving white pasty skin and features that are other than human. This Awareness indicates these creatures created through use of decompression chambers and other electromagnetic energy fields-these created here on earth for urposes of gathering substances and piloting the spacecraft. These creatures as also being of a kind of robotized giological creation that served as servants to those who are the Alien Forces on this planet. This Awareness indicates that there are other types of UFO creatures of beings-that this is but one which has been popularized through the movie Close Encounten-that the eyes of these creatures are cattle eyes, the brain as being the brain from a cow.

ALIENS FROM OUTER SPACE HELPED RUSSIANS CREATE THE ROBOTOIDS QUESTION: Awareness, did the Russians who developed the organic robotoids receive assistance from these space entities who have also been working with synthetics? COSMIC AWARENESS : This Awareness indicates this is in the affirmative-that some inform- ation was received from the Alien Forces and some from the Galactic Space Confederation. This Awareness indicates that the Galactic Confed- eration as having influenced the proper or right use of the information which led to these creations and their deployment."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"RoBoTolDs USED ON OTHE a PLANETS As SLAVES QUESTION: One final question about robotoids. If these creatures were developed scientifically and extended onward in the economy etc. by business etc. to operate assembly lines and do the work of human beings, would this be a violation to do this? COSMIC AWARENESS : This Awareness indicates that there are many other planets who use creatures of this e for much of their f '3 manual labor.

QUESTION: Well, wouldn't something like this from the view from the Godhead be considered by the creator as another type of fooling with creation and consciousness like the original fall? COSIdIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this as in the affirmative-that the action of Jehovah as also fooling with consc- iousness and creating a so-called human being. This Awareness indicates that there have been activities of this level occurring for ame immemorial on the levels of Terrestria. This Awareness indicates that it is only a question of your level of toys, and the games which are intriquing in terms of your consciousness development. Thls Aware ness indicates that to a particular level of consciousness it could appear to be a violation to have an animal give birth to a litter of babies, simply because the owner of the animal wanted more babies. This Awareness indicates that this is an action of fooling with nature. This Awareness suggests that it could be a violation to prevent an animal from giving birth to a litter of babies, because this too is an action of tampering with nature. This Aware- ness indicates that it could be a violation for Jehovah to have created Adam and Eve, and in so doing having started the Hebrew race, for he was not given permission by the Galactic Confederation to do. this. Jehovah Cloning Adam ad Eve Not the Fim to Cram a Ram of Beings This Awareness indicates that Jehovah was not the first to create a race of beings, that the level of consciousness is such that when entities reach such an understanding of the ability to create life from a seed, and so grow a tree or to create life from a cell and so grow a robototoid, or create from a cell an , a living bein suitable for housin a soul whic enti'x may enter- # is is but a matter o f conscious- ness, evaluation, development, and risk as to whether it is proper or not. This Awareness indicates that on one level it may be seen as a violation, on another level it is an ach- ievement; on another level it may be seen as foolish- ness and child's lay. This Awareness indicates that still another leve P beyond that in the Clear Light where all is Essence, it is of no consequence, and does not matter so long as it does not matter. This Awareness indicates this all related to that very profound catch-all word 'relativity'-all is QUESTION: relative. JESUS CAME TO EARTH TO THWART THE PROGRAM OF JEHOVAH It would probably be appropriate to ask this question of A.M. of W. Palm Beach, Florida. The question concerns a reading given by Edgar Cayce as to the incarnations of Jesus, and he said Jesus was Adam. Now Awareness indicated that Jehovah cloned Adam and Eve. Can this be explained by Awareness? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that there is no indication seen that Jesus was Adam. This Awareness indicates that the entity known as Jesus was brought from Celestria into physical form in Terrestria and brought forth into that life for a particular mission-a plan to thwart the program which Jehovah had started. This Awareness ind- icates that information has been given previously regarding the past life incarnations of the entity Jesus. This Awareness indicates that the entity Adam was an immediate creation, that the soul-stuff in Adam was a reflection of Jehovah-that Jehovah himself had rebelled against the Galactic Confederation and the laws thereof, and Adam reflected this rebellion in his denial of the laws of Jehovah and his participation in the indul ences offered by Eden. His desire to seek knowledge through experimentation was but a reflection of Jehov a% 's own scientific efforts, without regard for authority. This Awareness indicates that information on this has been given previously, fi"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":", I) relating to the cloning of Adam and Eve. This Awareness indicates that the term 'cloning' is not exactly accurate, but there is no word in your language which is available at this time. This Awareness indicates the word 'creation' can be used and is suitable. This Awareness indicates that the Jewish people whoever &t may be, generally are followers of the Old Testament, but not necessarily so. This Awareness indicates that essentially the early Hebrews were the clones of Jehovah or the offspring of such clones. This Awareness indicates as has been ind~cated previously, indulged in the action of duplicating entities and duplicated Adam in his own image, duplicated Eve in a kind of feminine counterpart of Adam using a different approach. This Awareness indicates that these entities as having been created on the planet Mars, and brought to earth at the time whereby they were expelled from the Garden of Eden. This Awareness indicates that the action of Jehovah as has been previously indicated, was one whereby he broke certain universal laws of the Galactic Confederation in creating Adam and Eve as servants to tend his garden, and began this race which was a duplicate of his own karmic self. This Awareness wishes to elaborate briefly: The actions of Jehovah created through the DNA duplication a race of Hebrews, who were basically reflections of Jehovah-these entities reflecting the rebellious attitudes of Jehovah and carrying on certain attitudes of superiority, love of power, jealousy, vengeance and a feeling of being righteous and superior to others. This Awareness indicates all this being inherited through the genes from Jehovah. This Awareness indicates the Intergalactic Confederation, or Galactic Man, as it is sometimes called, considered Jehovah to be a renegade immortal and has since curbed Jehovah's behaviour and has sentenced this entity to bring back the energies which he unleashed upon this Earth; and this entity is in the process of reversing the forces which he unleashed, and in so doing, the entity is also making repayment for his own karmic purposes. This Awareness indicates the entity Jesus, as has been explained previously, assisted to reverse the forces which this entity Jehovah began, and Jehovah at present is not in the process of destroying humanity and saving his own, but rather is in the process of balan- cing out the energies of this planet in order to bring about harmony and to undo the harm which he unleashed when began his operations. This Awareness reminds entities that the term 'Jehovah' as likened unto that which applies to a tribe of space people with one named Yahweh as the leader, and this entity as being the force behind this action. This Awareness indicates that these ent- ities are working on this earth to undo some of the energies which have brought about much conflict through the Hebrews and their programming by Yahweh. JEHOVAH PLANNED TO RETURN AND HARVEST~HIS PEOPLE QUESTION: ( Jesus Comes to Thwart this Plan ) In a previous reading about Jehovah, Awareness mentioned that entity Jehovah had planned to harvest those entities and those clones. Would Awareness please explain what It meant by the term 'harvest'? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates the entity Jehovah had intended to return at the proper time and to take those who were his creation away from this planet, to another place, and to destroy the remaining entities upon this planet. It was for this reason that the entity Jesus came from the Intergalactic Confederation, after having moved into Terrestria from Celestria, and through these entities moved into this earth plane, and was born, and remained in contact with these space beings while moving through the various places which Jehd had touched, and fulfilling various prophecies which Jehovah had promised to fulfill and thereby diffusing or duplicating the actions of Jehovah but on a different level. This Awareness indicates the entity Jehovah had promised to come back with great power and slay the enemies of the Hebrews and take them away to the promised land. The entity Jesus came back a babe in the manger, and ended his life on a cross, giving himself for others. This Awareness indicates the entity being King of the Hebrews, rode into Jerusalem on an ass, and was crowned with a crown of thorns. This Awareness indicates this entire action, the mercy and the healings indicated a God of love and mercy, and many of the Hebrews began to believe this entity was indeed a messiah, but a messiah not of power, vengeance and glory but of humanness, love and mercy, and the entity opened the Hebrew religion for Gentiles also, this again diffusing the Jewish or Hebrew religion, diffusing the Hebrew clan. This Awareness indicates Jehovah had created many laws to identify his people, ranging from circumcision to diet and to other forms of behavior, to the action of keeping track of the genealogy. This Awareness ind- icates this entity has intended to mark his people that he might come back and salvage them, but the entity Jesus began an action which diffused and scattered these people all over the earth, and in this manner made this harvest a near impossibility. This Awareness indicates that Jehovah has had to reconsider his plan for harvesting or rapturning his people and destroying those who were not his own. This Awareness indicates the \\3 entity as having to give up on that program. This Awareness suggests there was a deficiency in the gene of Jehovah, which, while helping this entity to be a good scientist, did not dow the entity to understand q~d- ities of mercy and universal oneness. This Awareness indicates the entity as having been vain and self-centered -a megalomania. This Awareness indicates the entity as having passed this on to his followers, to his dupli- cates, Adam and Eve, and through them to others of the Hebrew group, and that many of these entities * 4 while being artistic and adept at dealing with material physics and materialism, did not have certain qualities which linked them to thelmmortal Realm, and therefore many of these entities adopted the philosophy of ?7 l-- atheism, not believing that immortality actually existed. This Awareness indicates that many of these entities intermarried and brounht into that DNA memory chain and the genes the concepts of immortality through In one reading Awareness indicated Jehovah was a space cannibal ..A- ..I,- .-o-A-A +n mu hir rrrarinnz PS food. 7."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"il these memory genes, so that some of the Hebrews have the capacity to believe in immortality from an intuitive level, from an inner memory. This Awareness indicates that this does not mean thanhose who did not have that memory were deprived of immortality, but rather that this was retarded in their consciousness as it was also retarded in the consciousness of Jehovah, because it had so little significance in his consciousness. MUCH OF 'SCIENCE FICTION' IS NOT FICTION This Awareness indicates there are many entities in the Immortal Realms, these being of all types; there are many planets in the Mortal Realm, there are many more in the Immortal Realms-these entities are often capable of moving between realms and through space from planet to planet, and many of these are of very unusual nature, much as have been indicated in your science-fiction movies and stones, and many of these have @eat powers and also have strange ideas. This Awareness indicates this particular planet has been heavily influenced by such a one-the entity Jehovah, and as having been influenced also by Luciferians and those who were associated. This Awareness indicates there was a time when the Natas or Satanists and the Luciferians worked together, but these entities since that time have separated as there has grown a mistrust between these entities. This Awareness indicates that there has been a closer tie between the Luciferians and the Jehovahites, but this also is now changing. This Awareness indicates that in this particular case, both the Luciferians and the Jehovahites, or those who are followers of Jehovah, these are in the process of transmuting and merging back toward the Galactic Confederation, associated with those who are the Galactic Confederation often referred to as the Serpent people, due to the symbol used on their ships. This Awareness indicates that essentially the Luciferians and the Jehovahites as now becoming more humane and less competitive in their behavior-these entities beginning to learn the meaning of the power of Love, for they have experienced repercussions in their efforts to gain control over the lives and energies of others. This Awareness indicates that this is largely due to the intense battle of consciousness which has been raging upon this Earth between the Wanderers, the Luciferians, the Satanists, and the Jehovahites for thousands of years. This Awareness indicates that the Universe is not as most entities have been taught to believe, that the Universe is filed with inhabitants not too unlike entities upon the earth. This Awareness indicates that these entities have been to and from the earth many times. That there have been civilizations upon this earth which have been highly advanced, with spiritual development that superexceeds anything presently known. This Awareness indicates that this earth has been watch visited by many entities from other systems and from other planes. Parting of the Red Sea and other Miracles were the Work of UFOs This Awareness indicates that the gods and lords of old are not mythical characters, nor are these entities supernatural, though they are supernormal, and in many instances superhuman. This Awareness indicates that these entities also have a super technology and often a superconsciousness. This Awareness indicates that many miracles of the Old Testament are recordings of the spaceships which were piloted by the group of space travelers known as the Jehovah. This Awareness indicates that these entities protected their chosen tribes with their technology, their spaceships, which had the capacity, the capabilities of effecting what in those times would be considered as 'miracles'. This Awareness indicates that the parting of the Sea occurred from energies of a particular type of spacecraft which repelled the waters to allow the followers to pass through, but then closed against the Egyptians. This Awareness suggests that entities in reading their Old Testament stories, may, in their imaging, find that when they substitute the word Lord, or Jehovah, wherein this word can be read with an image of a spaceship, there will be much clarification of meaning. This Awareness indicates that such statements regarding entities not touching the Lord as the Lord comes down upon the mountain-that any entity who comes close or touches will surely die-that this is in relation to the radioactive energies and the high vibratory energies of the spaceship. This Awareness indicates that often the pilot or commander, or the lord of the spaceship, was confused with the spaceship itself by the writers.That at times they speak of the Commander, or Lord, walking with a particular person, and at other times the Lord is flying above, creat- ing thunderbolts, earthquakes, fires, or other disturbances of a magnificant and terrible nature. This Awareness indicates that in both cases the term 'Lord'may be used, but the reference may be interchangeable between the meaning of the personality or the spacecraft. This Awareness indicates &is does not in any way detract from the concept of a Universal God, but this does indicate a difference between a personality God and a Universal God. This Awareness indicates the entity Jehovah as being an Immortal being; yet this entity as not the creator of the Universe, but one who was capable of creating through the use of certain cosmic and universal principles, creating forms. This Awareness indicate - - your present scientists are reaching a level whereby they also may soon become capable of creating that which you call clones.This Awareness indicates the entity Jehovah essentially was creating mankind, Adam and Eve, from an action similar to that which your scientists call 'cloning'. This Awareness indicates that Adam, being created in the image of Jehovah, as likened unto that which is related unto cloning, whereby the cell of an entity is taken and the nucleus of that cell is placed within the egg of a female, whereas the nucleus of that egg is removed. This then, is implanted in an incubation system to allow the clone to develop, and that develop- ment will be in the exact image of the entity from which the cell was taken. This Awareness indicates this has been done upon your plane by others than your own scientific establishment, whereby entities have been cloned and created. This Awareness indicates that the entity Jehovah, creating hi special cloning followers for tending his garden and for his personal experiments, this entity then proceeded to attempt to mold and create and direct these clones by using the motivational behavior system of punishment and reward. This Awareness indicates that the entire Western civilization as being reflective of that kind of consciousness. This Awareness indicates that the present spiritual organizations who stress the fear and punishment, particularly wherein the punishment is that from an unknown cause, or what may betermed unknown fears: fears created by concepts which may or may not be valid, such as the annihilation of the soul-that such concepts and such fear-producing ideas being used against entities to keep them in line, to force them into certain levels of obedience-this is but an old way which has been used for eons"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"of time to keep entities enslaved and ignorant. This Awareness suggests that if the entity teaching this can give the clear source for this information, can show entities how they may discover this for themselves, and can assist entities in finding ways whereby the bfhavior of an entity is encouraged rather than enforced-this Awareness suggests that then the teacher is showing responsibility rather than mere reckless control over his or her following. JEHOVAH A GOD OF POWER AND MONEY (The Suffering of the Jewish Culture) This Awareness indicates that the Jewish culture had as its heritage, its religious and ethnic pride and background which it could point to far identification, yet this culture throughout history has felt itself to be in conflict with those who werc not of that particular religion or culture. This Awareness indicates that the conflict between the Muslim and the Jewish, the Mohammedan and the Jewish, the Christian and the Jewish cultures have been emphasized for the last centuries in a manner that allowed the Jewish people to feel a kind of stigma in relation to other cultures. This Awareness indicates that the Nazi movement emphasized this even more greatly, to the point where the Jewish culture began to question and wonder, 'What have we done to deserve this treatment'? Jehod, Cod Bms This Awareness indicates that in this manner, there was a deep examination of the basic quality which the Jewish people and their philosophy and their attitudes expressed toward others. This Awareness ind- icates that these entities took on a kind of sacrificial lamb experience whereby they became the victims of the sacrifice to the forces that followed the god of power. This Awareness indicates that when entities follow the god of power, lust ;4nd grecd, they may serve that god only so long as they themselves continue to feel themselves insensitive to feeling, to mercy, ta Love, +sen#iitive to levels of humanity. This Awareness indicates that the god, Jehovah, as a god of power, favoring oac pe~ple over another, as basically de- fined and described as a god of power which the forces of theJewish or Hebrew culture wonhtped and exemplified as an ideal. This Awareness indicates that Jehovah basically is a money god. This Awareness indicates that the Hebrcw or Jewish culturemoved for these thousands of years through the world using the economic systems in a mannerthat allowed advmcege to those who followed the Lord God Jehovah, the powerful, jealous god which represented the qualities which controlled the material world.This Awareness indicates these forces as that which create the matter in the universe. This Awareness hdicam that the Yod-He-Vau-Heh, (the Shin being the 5th element), ties this back into the Spirit. This Awareness indicates Yod-HcShin-Vauaeh as the spelling for the name Jesus. This Awareness suggests that this Yod-He-Vau-Heh as having been a key to the kingdom of the materid plane, whereas the Yod-He-Shin-Vau-Heh as being the key to the link between spirit and matter. This Awareness suggwts that the crucifixion of Christ as a symbolic action wherein the entity Jesus moved through the passion play and gave hi6 life as a sacrifi&il lamb to the end of the age of Aries, or the age of David, as a fisher of men entering into the Piscean Age. This Awareness indicates this entity, having given his life to create a kind of example for the Piscean Age, was said to have been slain by the Jews. This Awareness indicates that in the story it is said that the Jews said: \"Let his blood be on our heads and on the heads of our children\". This Awareness indicates this statement as that which has assisted in creating hostility toward the Jewish race by those who foUowed the Christian doctrines and teachings. This Awareness indicates that the Jews in Germany as having moved into the gas chambers and other forms of death in a passive, meek manner, likened unto the lambs going to slaughter. This Awareness indicates that this as also an action of a passion play acted out on a grand scale with a cast of millions. This Awareness indicates this as such an unnecessary tragcdy brought on by these philo- sophies that allow nations, people, families, individuals, to slaugher one another or to sacrifice themselves for some belief or cause that is unnecessary, and does not serve the purpose of constructive living. This Awareness indicates that the repncussion of the cruc- ifixion of the entity Jesus as that which has carried down through the ages. This Awareness indicates that the repercussions of the slaughter of the innocents in Germany as that which also carries down through the ages. This Awareness indicates that the Wheel of Karma continues to spin and spin, and to seek revenge after revenge, until entities look carefully and say, \"Enough! I shall not take my revenge. I shall stop the Wheel of Karma right here\". This Awareness indicates that there is certain information regarding the action of World War I1 which can be extremely shocking to many Jewish people, that the U.S. Labor Party presents much of this information. This Awareness indicates that essentially, it boils down to the fact that the persons who began setting up Hitler, and pressed the issues which led to World War 11; the entities who created the environment and who allowed the persecution of the Jewish people, were, to a large extent, of Jewisb origin,in the cult known as Zionism. This Awareness indicates this information can be quite shocking to many entities, and that it will no doubt be rejected by some, and may cause some hostiliry to be directed toward this organization. This Awareness suggests that it is a quest- ion of whether entities wish to believe in Santr Claus, or whether entities wish to explore realities-whether entities wish to be told lies, or whether entities wish to discover wbat is. This Awareness indicates that the Jewish people have suffered much-undue criticism and undue hostility-much of this because certain forces of Zionism have hidden behind the dress, behind the cloak, behind the skirts of the Jewish people. This Awareness suggests that this as, in part, a situation that needs to be balanced and brought into ham- ony, brought into levels of dialogue, brought into discussion, whereby the oppositions may be balanced and reconciled. This Aware- ness suggests that It will give no more on this topic. That entities may discover more information regarding this by writing the U.S. Labor Party for information on the role of the Zionists in World War 11; that entities may read the book, Dope Incorporated. Bigots Bewarel You could Reincarnate Into the Race you Dislike This Awareness indicates that there are still entities who have hostility toward the Jewish people. How many more would you like to see sacrificed before you cease in this stupidity of bigotry? 7lis Awareness indicates that each entity, when reincarnating upon this plane, is potentially capable of reincarnating into any other race, whether this be Oriental, Indian, Jewish, Gypsy, Black, Caucasian, or of the Brown Race, or of Latin nature. This Awareness indicates that any entity has the potential of reincarnating into any culture, any nation, any area, and any status of being, whether of poverty or wealth-the potential as determined by those needs which will give the entity the greatest spiritual growth, according to their ability to grow. This Awareness indicates it behooves entities not to plant seeds of hostility toward any parti& race, culture, status or nation, for indeed they may return to live a life within the skin of that culture which they have directed hostility towards."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"JEHOVAH ENTITIES WORKING WITH RUSSIA TODAY (Guess Where the Idea of Robotoids Came From? J QUESTION: What is Jehovah up to thesese days? Is he still experimenting with genetics and cloning entities or has the Space Confederation piaced some type of restrictions against this? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that at present time, the Jehovah have been put on a kind of probation by the Galactic C~nfcderation. 'Their punishment at present time for the actions of the past, is to undo the energies which had been set in motion md to assist in bringing about greater peace and harmony upon this plane. This Awareness indicates that for this purpose, for this reason, the Jehovah are working with the Russians in their efforts to rid the Luciferians, or the Alien Force, from this planet. Jehovah, being a god of wrath and power, was expected by the Hebrews to return to earth in a UFO and slay their enemies QUESTION: This Awareness indicates that in earlier times, the Jehovah worked hand-in-hand with the Luciferians in their conquest of certain portions of this planet; but generally the Jehovah and the Luciferians did not cooperate with one another for : any long period of time. This Awareneness indicates that likewise, the Luciferians and Natas, or Satanists, once worked closely, hiwing m alliance with one another, but this too, broke down as the Natas found they could not trust the deceptive Luciferians, and the Luciferians were not so caughe up in the sadism of the Natas, but more concerned with wing energies of others for their own purposes (not having such sadistic qualities as the Natas. The Natas bein more concerned with sadism, d finding much pleasure an receiving feelings of power from these energies and these expressions. This Awareness indicates that the Jehovah as being more concerned with vanity and appetite being reaped from their own creation-the Jehovah feeling justified in this action since they were creations from their own cells. This Awareness indicates that this would be much like the concept of raising robotoids for food. QUESTION: Awareness, is the Galactic Confederation keeping an aye on these Jehovahs that are working with the Russians today, to make sure that they have 'gone straight' as it were? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates this as in the affirmative. Galactic Space Confadqrrtion Closely Watching In Russlq In a previous reading about the moon landings, Awareness indicated that NASA had a definite motive f~r landing in the area of the moon that they did. If there was a definite motive, what were they looking for and why? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that much of this information has been release on the Dr. Beter ta es in reference B to the effort b the military of the United States to establish a moon base from which ~t coul essentially cont- rol the earth. &is Awareness indicates that this did begin an establishment of a mllrtary moon base for laser , weapons and for observation systems to watch various areas upon the earth.

This Awareness indicates that before he was able to make this speech, he was stopped and prevented, and therefore this information was never released. This Awareness indicates that essentially, the UFO cover-u is that which has long been a hindrance to under- standing what is occurring upon this plane. Yet the situation gas resolved itself even without the public being a.wa.re of what was occumng, and essentially the earth is being freed from the Alien, Luciferian forces. ?'his Awareness wishes to ex lain briefly that the Satanists and Luciferians are not the same forces. The Satan- ists are those from Natas (whic 1 is Satan s elled backwards). These entities seek to control through mind domin- ation and these entities have a sadistic qu&ty about them.

Who has the Power to Stop the President of the United States from Keeping the People Informed? (Rockefeller, who else) QUESTION: Would Awareness reveal who it was that prevented President Eisenhower from going forth to the public with the UFO information? COSMIC AWARENESS : This Awareness indicates this as related to certain forces which were controlling the President and have con- trolled the President since the time of Franklin Roosevelt. This Awareness indicates this force essentially coming from the Rockefeller powers. This Awareness indicates this working through his agencies-the CIA and the Secret Service, which at that time was controlled b these powers, This Awareness indicates this also relates to the ent- ities in his cabinet who were controlled by t x ese forces also.

The technology required to perform such a feat is far more that it would take to run an automobile on water or to clean up our cities' air and water. Have we, in fact, landed men on the moon and returned them, or are we the victims of a great hoax perpetrated by our government? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that essentially you are the victims of a eat hoax perpetrated by your government; yet, at the same time, the United States and Russia both have lande f men on the moon. This Awareness indicates that these landings occurred as indicated, but that these nations had also been on the moon previously. This Awareness indicates that the United States, Russia, Argentina and Great Britain all have those space ships known as UFO's. This Awareness indicates that the United States has had space ships on the moon approximately ten years prior to the missile shot wherein the men landed on the moon. This Awareness indicates that there are even more unusual as ects to this adventure. This Awareness indicates that the UFO's not being limited to these nations, nor to any o F the known nations of the earth today-that these nations have learned to build these UFOs. This Awareness suggests that these ships may be termed 'flying saucers' or whatever name. This Awareness indic- ates that essentially, in response to this question, the United States has been on the moon with spaceshi s and F that the missile program of NASA for landing men on the moon was but an action to give the people o the nation a belief that the government was progressing technologically without givin away the real advancement F in terms of this technological advancement.

U.S. SPACE SHIPS ALSO HAVE BEEN ON MARS ( UFO Cover-Up to Keep Citizens Ignorant ) QUESTION: A somewhat related question from JD of Brooklyn, N.Y. The following is my question for Cosmic Awareness. A while back I saw a picture taken, I believe from the last Mariner Probe to Mars. It appeared as a huge stone carving of a human face with exacting features lying flat on the planet's surface, but many hundreds or thousands of feet in diameter. Can Awareness please comment as failures in their expression; as indicated in the Book of Genesis, and ex elled these entities from Mars, bringing them to earth. This Awareness indicates that earth had already been in R abited at that time, that these entities were an additional type of creation. This Awareness indicates that more information regarding this will be given at a later time. This Awareness indicates that the United States with its space ships has also contacted Mars--that entities have flown xhere in space ships and have returned. This Awareness indicates that there are ca~abilities by an ultra- secret agency within the government which many top entities are not even aware of, and that this agency as being responsible for these space ships and the development of these craft. This Awareness indicates there also have been contacts with ultra-terrestrials from other vibratory rates, dimensions and planets--that the United States government, in certain agencies, is aware of these contacts; that other agencies are not aware, and therefore deny such information. 13."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES KEPT IN IGNORANCE QUESTION: ( A Caution from Cosmic Awareness on RmImaring this Information) Is information of this nature automatically given to the President of the United States? COSMIC AWARENESS: This as negative. This Awareness indicates this information as withheld in certain secret divisions of the National Security Agency. There are questions being asked which this Awareness is attempting to answer with great care, for there is danger to entities in regards to this information being released, whereby other entities seek to keep this information hidden, and whereby others have been killed for even whispering or considering discussing this type of information. This Awareness indicates that this information being given at this time must be released with this understanding-that three to five years ago entities would have been killed for releasing this kind of inform- ation, and that there is still some danger. This Awareness suggests that if you wish to know the answer, this Awareness will give what It feels you can handle. If you seek the answer for sensationalism or for the thrill of finding out secrets, this Awareness cautions you in releasing this information and finding that sensation, you may also find yourself in jeopardy, in danger. This Awareness suggests that certain of the information relating to the UFO's, to the CIA, to the Kennedy assass- ination, to all of these areas which have been deliberately kept hidden from the masses, that in releasing this inf- amation you are putting yourself on the line for possible annihilation from this plane. This Awareness indicates that wherein you are sensitive to the times, and wherein you see this kind of information being released, then it be- comes less dangerous. This Awareness suggests that you look at what has been happening to the members of Hustler magazine, wherein these entities have been releasing certain information*. That there are forces detrim- ental, and that entities need to be sensitive and protect themselves from these forces, that the sensitivity to the release of information carefully as that which can prevent much harm. This Awareness indicates this as likened unto entities whispering, wherein one whispers the secret which anot- her has wished to keep silent; wherein the secret is circulated through whispers which gradually become louder and louder until everyone, together, is shouting out the secret. That this is a way whereby the one who would like to keep secret a truth cannot find the source to stop the truth from being released. This Awareness indicates for this reason, It suggests that much of this information be kept carefully until it is circulated all together for others to release as previously indicated in the UFO material. This Awareness suggests that wherein small portions are released to answer questions, wherein this information is of such a nature that it does not expose too much too fast, that this can be appropriate. This Awareness indicates you need not answer everything thoroughly in a question, that this Awareness can withhold information for your own safety, if desired, and let small amounts out, according to that which may be printed and released. This Awareness indicates however, wherein entities emanate that kind of desire to know it all, this Awareness finds that this channel opens up to allow all that infor- mation to come out, regardless of the danger. This Awareness suggests that the questioners and the Interpreter discuss this after the reading to determine whether you wish to continue opening up all of these areas, how the information shall be released, or whether you wish this Awareness to withhold some of the information in order to save you from having to determine what should or should not be printed at this time. Hustler Magazine had been releasing puo of the 'Gunstone File' which fmgered Onassis as head of the Mgu and who with Nelson Rockefeller was head of the haoin connection.

MYSTERIOUS BOOMING SOUNDS ON EAST COAST WERE CAUSED BY UFOs (Excerpt from a C.A.C. General reading, Jan. 18, 1978 ) There have been a lot of stories in the paper lately and people are writing in about a series of mysterious • booms or blasts that are occurring on the East Coast. These blasts are denied by the government as being sonic booms, or atomic, or military explosions of any kind. Some claim it's gas from garbage rising from the ocean and others claim it's UFOs. Would Awareness please explain what these mysterious blasts are? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that there are seen patterns of energy originatin beneath the earth's surface and also in the atposphere above. This Awareness indicates-these energy patterns as f eeg created and controlled through electronic.force fields. This Awareness ind~cates this as relaxing unto certain pnnciples used and described in. Eins- teins's Unified Field Theories-that essentially, these are being affected from what may be called a parallel umme.

HOW ALIENS FROM OUTER SPACE HAVE INFILTRATED THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES THE WEB OF CONSPIRACY ....... (Part 2 )"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"* QUESTION: A question from R.K., of St. Cloud, Minn., which came in during June of 1978, and was held in abeyance because at that time Awareness asked that w@ not question into this area. But in light of some of Dr. Beter's material, this particular question might prove enlightening: \"The people at the Summit Lighthouse are being taught about so-called robot people. They are supposedly laboratory-created skull-less humans, who have reproduced themselves since the time of Atlantis, when they were created. According to this source, there is a large percentage of these people in America today, particularly in the government, because they are easily influenced, and therefore manipulated by the Fallen Ones, who are ceaselessly working to overtake the earth for their own use. Would Awareness please comment on this? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this information is basically correct. This Awareness suggests that this be included in that material being released under the heading of UFO Project Reading. This Awareness indicates that essential1 these entities are being associated more with the synthetics this Aware ness has described, than with the robotoi z s described b Dr. Beter. This Awareness indicates that explanations re- garding both of these creations is available in other rea J' ings from C.A.C. This Awareness indicates that essentially this is well-known by certain departments in the government-that many of these have been involved in the govern- ment, and in fact, many of these robot-like creations have taken over certain departments of government. The Movie 'Future World' Describes the Synthetics This Awareness wishes entities to consider that there have been several unusual movie lots durin the ast few years, which are not purely science fiction. This Awareness indicates that the movie P uture ~otfd, wkrein celebrities were taken into a new type of amusement park, and their doubles emerged, this being in the state of Nevada. This Awareness indicates this movie was, in actuality, based on the alien base which was in existence in the mountains above Las Vegas, wherein these synthetics were being created, and released into society after rec- eiving proper training and programming and the necessary money for carrying out their assignments. This Awareness indicates this movie as having had a substance based on reali . This Awareness indicates also that movie, Invasion o the Body Snatchers, wherein entities were being create who became doubles for humans I 7 and took their place. his Awareness suggests you consider this movie in light of the information which Dr. Beter has given on the robotoids. This Awareness indicates also the movie Star Wars as that which depicted in a fiction form, an actual conflict which occurred in an area of Orion approximately 500,000 years ago, related to the planet known as Tyrantor- this don with other planets in that area, wherein certain portions of the Galactic Humanity Force became rebel- d lious an began channeling the Dark Force from the lane of Hades, and this force working through those planets lcnown as the 'Unholy Six were quarantined b the 8 alactic Confederation. This Awareness indicates that this battle of these forces has been continuing for &e past one half million years, up to the present time. The Elohim Plant a Huge Computrr in the Bowel8 of the Earth This Awareness indicates that deep within the bowels of this earth is a computer, which is beyond the under- standing of present science, which was placed here ap roximately one million years ago b a race of entities known as the Els, or Elders, who have since transcen cf ed time and s ace and moved into at which is Celestria. f X This Awareness indicates these entities also known as the Elohim, his Awareness indicates that these entities had the wisdom and understanding and capabilities of creating planets by manipulatin magnetic forces and elec tric fields so that the mass would move into these vertices to create those planets, an follow the magnetic field set up by their forces. d This Awareness indicates that these Elohim arc those mentioned in the Book of Genesis, which in your English translation states, \"In the beginning God created the Heavens and the earth.\" This Awareness indicates the original writing stated, \"In the beginning, Elohim created the heavens and earth 'L Elohim being translated into the word God. This Awareness indicates the word Elohim as being lural, therefore the translation as inaccurate, and the true meaning, \"In the 1 eginning, Gods created the heavens and earth ...\" ' This Awareness indicates that this as a reference to the consciousness, or the unified consciousness of all the entities who were One in the universe, who came from the Universal Cons- ciousness-that, in effect, created the light by joining together, and created the matter by exploding outward. That these entities may be likend unto universal atoms, universal particles of Being, and these entities, or universal atoms are the atoms which make u the body of the Universal God-yet, each as having its own individuality unto itself, even though it is part of the b niversal God. This Awareness indicates that the entity, Jehovah, which appears upon the scene many billion of ears later as a genetics expert, a culturist, a teacher of civilization-this entity, or rather these entities known as Lhovah ent- ities, were represented not as the Universal Creator, but as somewhat petty beings who became jealous, possessive,"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"This Awareness indicates that the entity, however, instead of coming in a spaceship of great power to Jerusalem, this entity rode a donkey into Jerusalem.

This Awareness indicates that the Elohim, being referred to as 'Serpent Peo le', this as a symbol for their space- ships-that the serpent as also seen in many cultures: the Egyptian culture, ti' e Incan culture, wherein the serpent was seen as headress, coming up over the head of the entities. This Awareness indicates this as symbolic of the spinal fluid, the kundalini fire, or kundalini energies rising from the base of the spine unto the pineal and pituitary, moving up the spine into the head. This symbolism of the serpent as related unto higher consclousness, or cosmic consciousness. This Awareness suggests that this not as being a reference to the snake as entities believe from the reading of the Jehovah book of Genesis, wherein the serpent was made to crawl upon his belly. This Awareness indicates that the serpent, known as the snake, is nothing more than an undevelo ed human being-an entity who P has not yet evolved to the point wherein he has seven chakras, organs, arms and egs. This Awareness indicates that in one sense, Jehovah did capture that serpent person, or the entity who was teaching his clone, Eve, and did use genetic influences and experiments upon this entity and removed his arms and legs and made this entity into the form which resembled a serpent, a snake.

That this as an entlty of hi consciousness which was concerned with the experiments and controls and the slaves which were being create through the cloning process of Jehovah entities on mars. !? This Awareness indicates that the Space Confederation had warned the Jehovah entities against this kind of program whereby slaves were created through genetics of the cloning process, but that the Jehovah continued; and that these entities were classed as something on the order of a present day heretic, or what may be presently termed a fringe area scientist. That the Jehovah entities were not concerned with the over-all good of the universe so much as wlth their own projects and creations, and this had a disturbing effect upon many. This Awareness indicates that the Jehovah entities were not related unto the entities of Orion who were creat- ing the extreme ower and control trips of movin from lanet to lanet for conquest; yet the Jehovah entities g were somewhat etween that which may be calle dl' the fo lowers o ! Lucifer and that which would be called the followers of Elohim, or God. This Awareness indicates that these entities, being in between, were simply playing gods in their own way-likened unto renegades or small-scale creations inside a larger creation, wherein the larger creation was being watched by the Elohim, with the Jehovah creating their own small empire within that; and the Atlans or Tyrantians seeking to create a power-hold and base for conquest within that. 'Mark of the Beast' System Originally Used on Tyrantor This Awareness indicates that the civ of Tyre as having become a base for the Tyrantians, who be an to set up their system there. This Awareness ind~cates that in a recent Plain Truth magazine, an article stating iat the present day system which is presently being discussed--whereby the mark or number of each individual is to be tattooed upon their hand for identification, and electronic-fund-transfer being used in lieu of money-that this stem was originally used in the city of T re-whereby entities' hands were marked and th were identified in Z xis manner, and the central bank in Tyre ept tack of them and their service, their work an 7' their eamin s with this mark. This -4wareness indicates that this essentially has been brought from the planet of Tyrantia anfits neighboring star systems to the earth, and there is the attempt at this tune to implant that system upon the earth.\" This Awareness indicates that the Jehovah as having assisted somewhat in this by allowing certain factions of the Atlans to enter and to influence the clones. This Awareness indicates that essentially, however, the influence on these entities as coming from those who are residing under the surface of the earth, still having their ower in those areas and influencing entities on the surface. This Awareness indicates this relates unto the entity own as Ahriman, the AntiChrist. E, This Awareness indicates it matters not whether entities recognize the Elohim, or the Universal God, as the Creator. What does matter is that there is an ancient ast history upon this earth, and there has been a battle dung lace between Forces of Darkness and Forces of Lig R t, in an effort to gain control of this earth in order to use gat computer previously mentioned, which would then give great power in controlling planets nearby. 6 Certain Spiritual Organizations are Beinn Mislead by Entitie$ Communicating from Orion ates that the forces of darkness have be n losin their being driven from this lanet, and the p anet as eing z T= % greater light from the alactic Confederation as it is rmic destiny under the control of the Dark Forces from This Awareness indicates that there are some concerns in regard to the infor- the Unholy Six, whereas certain spiritual groups on this plane rces from Orion are of a high spiritual nature.

Avold Contact with UFO Creatures with Cow-Like Eyes This Awareness indicates that essentially any enti coming in 7 contact with these creatures would be wise to avoid urther com- munication or contact of a close nature. This Awareness indicates that the Galactic Confederation UFO personnel look human in their appearance.

This Awareness indicates that t is is known b certain members of various departments of the pmt, tE R 2 for ere are teams who have been employed during e last two decades to search out certain UFO bases and to attempt to blow up caves in which these were based, or to rid the area of these aliens. This Awareness indicates there essentially has been a very secret battle occurring on this earth regarding UFOs. This has been occurring since the release of the first atom bomb, which began triggering off the Increased activity of these beings. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SYNTHETICS AND ROBOTOIDS QUESTION: Would Awareness expand on that part of the question where it said, \"These entities have reproduced themselves since the time of Atlantis, when they were created.\" Is that correct? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates this as being essentially correct--that these entities as being somewhat more refined than the robotoids or the synthetics. This Awareness indicates that the synthetics as being creations by the alien UFO invaders-the word invaders as not exactly appro riate, as these entities have been here for so long. This P Awareness indicates that the synthetics being created rom parts taken from humans or from animals and certain processes involving decompression chambers and various nutrients and magnetics. This Awareness indicates that the robot-like humans which the Summit Lighthouse is referring to are basically humans or humanoid in ap earance and capability. The eatest difference between themselves and humans is ! I? that they have not been in used with the higher spiritua vibrations, but are more closely aligned to animal vib- rations. This Awareness indicates however that these can mate with the human being and in this manner receive the divine vibrations. This Awareness indicates these also can develop over long periods of time to tune into spirit. ual or divine energies. 19."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"This Awareness wishes to defie the term 'divine energies'-these being energ- ies which allow for identification with universal harmonies as op osed to simply self-oriented vibrations.

This Awareness indicates that essent- ially the earth surface is catacombed with many tunnels, that there are also areas where there is much hot lava-thesi areas of course are not used by these beings and the tunnels avoid contact with such areas. This Awareness indicates that there are tunnels running app- roximately 4,000 miles from the Eastern part of the United States to an area in Arizona and into areas north to Vancouver, approximately 1800 miles.

A GLIMPSE OF LIFE BENEATH THE EARTH'S SURFACE EDITOR'S Note: the following is an excer t from a gen.eral C.A.C. readin geen November 7, 1978. The question tsked concerned an .article one of the rnern%ershrp sent m jaken from a taE1ord whlrh related to an entay who had dled' on the operating table, ex er~enced a horrendous trl to 'Hell' and then was brou ht bock to llfe after heart massage by doctors workin on Rim. I am including part ofthe res onse to the qucstlon%ecaure it leads into a rap by Cosmic Awareness whicf concerns life beneath the surface of tRe earth. COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates the experience of this entity could be explained in two statements: By believing in Hell, and by believing one deserves to go there. This Awareness suggests however, there are more levels to this; for though that answer is complete in itself, it still creates a reality for many entities. 9n"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"This Awareness indicates that there are many creations in consciousness whose energies are real unto themselves. This Awareness suggests that ail is imagination, incluciing that which you call 'reality'-that energies which come together on various vibratory rates create that which may be called matter; yet if these material images are picked apart, one by one, each will be nothing other than sound, heat, light, rays, or mind or gravity. This Awareness indicates these vibrations create that which ap ears to be reality, or matter. This Awareness Indicates that these R vibrations, mingling together, create that wh~c may be called reality' and that wherein an entity is experiencing on one of these particular levels of reality, other levels of reality may seem to be 'unreal'. This Awareness indic- ates that wherein an entity moves into that other reality, the reality which was just left will be unreal, and the new reality is that which 1s real. This Awareness indicates that real means 'realized' and wherein an entity is experiencing something---that is real. This Awareness su ests that wherein an entity dies and moves into a level ot consciousness which believes in hell, which believes 8 at they are to be sent to hell, then that consciousness will realize, or make real, that hell. This Awareness indicates this realization comes from the experiencing, which is imagination; but wherein more than one entity imagines this, that image becomes reinforced ind has greater energy. Wherein countless hundreds, thousands, or millions image a hell, they are indeed creating that hell in that other realm, so that entities may participate in those levels of experience. This Awareness suggests that the purpose of this Awareness in coming at this time is to diffuse extremes in consciousness, to reconcile olarities, to alleviate the suffering, sorrow and tragedies, not on1 on this earth plane, I? but also on other realms. T u Awareness indicates that wherein entities energize concepts o ? hell, fear, hatred and demonic tortures, that these will simply grow stronger. This Awareness wishes that entities not to identify with hell, not to associate their actions with hell, nor to assume that they are going there. This Awareness indicates that this as a gross exa eration, and those entities who exaggerate or have these beliefs and fears, whether con- scious or unconscious,%ex are the entities who will be given that experience in order that they may satisfy the guilt feelings and beliefs that they must be punished for their sins. This Awareness indicates that in another level, this experience as related unto that which is deep into the earth-not the center of the earth, but deep into the shell of the earth. That there are certain subterranean entities who are demented and demonic in their deteriorated states of consciousness. These are the lower realms of humanity. These are described in Richard Shaver's experiences in terms of his ourneys through the caves and into those caver B surface. This Awareness in icates these entities are called Deros. These are who have inspired many legends and other types of philosophies and religions. betrimentrl Rob08 (Derw) Live Beneeth the Earth This Awareness indicates that these so-called Deros are also the basis for certain folklore such as gnomes and elves, oblins, trolls. This Awareness indicates that the folklore relating unto these entities f as changed somewhat and that many of the so-called trolls, elves and imps, that many of these are now projected as being nice little fel This Awareness suggests that this is a way of reconciling, or healing, or diffusing the fear and hostility and so-called evilness of these entities, so that they may cease to be the garbage can for human hostilities, fears and enemies. This Awareness indicates that those so-called Deros, or Detrimental Robots, those entities living beneath the crust of the earth-this Awareness indicates there of entities beneath the earth; that those closer to the center itself are of a who are sub-surface entities, these are somewhat demented by the effects o thousands of years. This Awareness indicates that these Deros, or detrime desire, are human bein s who have regressed through misuse of ower, through excessive and continued self- f ! indulgence, and throug greed, lust, competition, and joy in sa istic expressions. This Awareness indicates that occasionally these entities surface, particularly through certain buildings which are often built in a way to allow an opening into the subterranean levels, and occasionally these entities walk around on the streets of your cities, and occasionally these entities have even been known to kidnap others. This Awareness indicates these entities are not astral beings, are not entities who are being imagined or experienced after death. These entities are as real as you, and in this particular dimension of realrty which is yours. This Awareness indicates that these entities are tools of the Alien Force-that the Alien Force expresses through these entities, that they are essentially slaves of the Alien Force, as also are many of the creatures known as Bigfoot, or of the similar types of hairy monsters. BIGFOOT ENTITIES WERE ONCE HIGHLY EVOLVED This Awareness indicates that these Sasquatch-type entities do not care to move too closely to humans on the outer surface of the earth. This Awareness su ests these entities having great karma to work off, yet fully aware of their karma and ve lonely entities. This wareness indicates these entities having a type of consciousness 2[ f which allows them to now precisely where any other human is within a two mile area of their being and can move away from these humans very easily through that psychic understanding."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"This Awareness indicates these entities as hav- began on Maldek.

Knights of Malta---St. John's Croes of Jerusalem Control Banking Systems----One Tentacle of the Beast Controlled by Aliens from Outer Space This Awareness indicates that the organization known as the Knights of Malta, or the St. John's Cross of Jerusalem, as bein that which is in control of the bank- in systems and as representin one arm of $e Beast with many branches, or tent- ac ! es, attached to that arm an d reaching down into society. This Awareness indicates that this is not, in fact, the head of the Beast. This Awareness indicates that this organization receives its power from aliens. These bein both within the interior of the earth, working upon the surface of the earth, and a aving their origin in the Unholy Six-that area in the vicinity of Orion. This Awareness indicates that this information as relating unto that which will be further discussed in the UFO readings. This Awareness indicates that essentially, approximately 500,000 years ago, the Galactic Confederation cordoned off six planets in the area of Orion, for they were spreading war and violence throughout the inhabited planets; and these planets, over long periods of time, have continued in their struggles to conquer one planet after another. This Awareness indicates that the earth is essentially in the grips of a war between planets, and has been for 12,000 years in an intense level; and prior to that, in a less intense level, for approximately 60,000 years. This Awareness indicates these entities from those other realms have the capability of transcending, or transmuting, certain vibratory rates in the electroma netic spectrum and traveling from place to place in the universe. This Awareness indicates this relating unto t f at which has been termed Hades and Celestria. That those in the vibratory rates known as Celestria as being capable of extending high levels of energy to entities upon this plane for healing et these entities are not allowed to interfere with the destiny of entities upon this plane unless request- ~~-dse~x%ss invited. This Awareness indicates thq the entities from that vibratory rate known as Hades as havin invaded upon Y i this plane and having set up camps in ph sical levels and as having be n using entities both on t e surface and beneath the surface for their purposes o conquerin the Earth as wefas other planets. And these entities as being among the forces which are attempting to present $ controls using the computers and branding of the people for their own slaves. This Awareness wishes entities to understand that the forces of Celestria and the forces of Hades are not comp- eting with each other over the human soul, but rather have an agreement with each other that those who are of a higher vibration, who seek not to be given all that which would gratify their personal lusts and greed and power desires, those who would serve others and love others, are those which, by the agreement, will be allowed to enter into those vibratory realms known as Celestria. Those who are seeking to preserve self at all costs, at the price of concern or love for others, those who seek security, who are willing to become slaves in order to survive: these entities who are willing to harm others in order to save themselves-these are the entities who will be susceptible to the branding action of those from Hades, and these entities shall indeed be given the citizenship of that area known as Hades-that vibratory rate. This Awareness indicates that in the case of children or those who are unable to discern clearly, those who are ignorant of what is occurring, that many of these have already taken upon themselves the attitude and their part- icular course of movement, in terms of their soul, is that which shall be the determining factor of their fate. 7 5"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"I 4)* This Awareness indicates that in relation to the following information, this Awareness asks that this not be given at this timc--$lar when this is released there is to be more information released in an entire package to accompany this. ~<<-<<<-:<:-C<c-cc<-C<4:€u<:-C~-:fO f 25% OF U.

This Awareness indicates that in resent time, there are those UFO's which are from Ce f estria and those which are from Hades, and those which are from Terr- estria. That those from Terrestria are owned by the governments of the United States, Britain, Russia, and Argentina. This Awareness indicates those from Hades come from areas near the surface, but beneath the sur- face of the earth, and are linked with that creature known as Big Foot. This Awareness indicates these creatures as being servants. This Awareness indicates that many of these UFO's are controlled remotely---others by robots, or those which are called 'Synthetics'. SYNTHETICS BEING MANUFACTURED IN MOUNTAINS ABOVE LAS VEGAS This Awareness indicates that these synthetics as being created from an action similar to cloning, yet in part using certain flesh from animals or humans, particularly common is the use of the cerebral and nerve system of the cow.

This Awareness indicates that often there are created sets of synthetics who are identical in appearance, but are placed in various areas so that they are not spotted or recognized as being the same person in two locations. This Awareness indicates these entities generally are operatin from a rather obscure position in society whereby they do not call attention to themselves by their occupation,%ut these entities as generally having vast amounts of money.

That these entities have machines which allow them to isten to the thoughts of others, which allow them to teleport; and whereby, even in vehicles, they can hook their teleportation machine to the vehicle and teleport, or disappear, right before the eyes of others.

This Awareness indicates that t e only way entities of a higher vibratory rate can be harmed b those of a lower vib- Y ratory rate, is if they allow themselves to become frightened, fearful and intimidated to the point o being terrified. This Awareness suggests that in order to avoid this, this Awareness suggests that entities be cautious, careful, loving, disc- erning, and protective of that which is the highest and best, and to avoid careless exposure to those areas and forces which can be harmful without having confidence and protection accompanying that exposure.

The way whereby these forces can best be countered is not through attacking them directly, but through spreading the Light so that others may see those Dark Forces for what they are.

This Awareness indicates that the retrap ing of the tles with the Bolshevik Kussia~ls has previously been #vend That the Bolsheviks essentially were financed t~y the ~nternational bankers, set up, trained in New York shipped to Russia in British ships and the revolution started, overthrowing Nicholas Two, the Czar.

The Karl Rittc.~ writing was that which espoused and led to the Nazi movement, and the Karl Marx writing as that wh1c.h c*spoused and led to the Co~nnlunisi movement.

This Awareness indicates that just prior to the time in which this was to occur, the Rockefellen were shocked to disbelief to discover that their Bolshevik friends in the Kremlin were no longer with them, were no longer in power, for their power had been taken from them by the Sko tsis, a secret group that existed prior to thc 1917 ~olsRevik revolution, and which assisted the Bolsheviks in overthrowing Nicholaa Two, and which thereafter realized that they had made a mistake, and which thereafter s ent yea? attempt- R ing to regain the control of Mot er Rusaa by secretly moving into positions of power.

This Awareness indicates that at that time the Russians essentially, through their Skoptsis were in cantrol of this nation. It was during this period that the SALT treaty between your President Carter and Leonid Brezhnev was signed. This Awareness indicates that shortly thereafter in November, the Russians in the United States, (the Skoytsis who were assisting in theae activities of replacing and guiding the American government), these entities were annihilated, and the Bolsheviks of America again took power. This Awareness ind- icates that this also was accompanied by further attempts to attack Russia, and a schism occurred between these Bolsheviks and the Rockefeller forces when the Bolsheviks attempted to take over the Rockefeller empire. This Awareness indicates that in terms of the present affairs, the conflict between the Bolsheviks of America and the Skaptais of Russia is still raging and there is no alliance between these countries at this tinte. This Awarencse indicates that there are interlocking agents and there are efforts and of course there are certain areas wherein cultural exchange and exchange of technologies still occur.

This Awareness indicates that even corporations have their spies, and some of the moat secret and newest designs are often sold to other corporations hefore the originator has even begun to construct thc instrument. This Awareness indicates that in regard to the summary of the question, the United States did not deliberately give this technology to these Russians for this instrument, it was acquired indirectly by the Soviets through their sources, though it originated in the United States. This Awareness indicates that the writings in Russian and English is of little consequence in terms of its significance or meaning. QUESTiON : Well, it struck me as a little strange that a buoy, a huge buoy bobbing around in the atraits which is designed fa surveillance (that was tracking the nuclear Trident subs and identif ing its underwater sound), it fitruck me that it was a r most flagrantly brazen that they would have this floating around out there with 3 foot letters printed on it that said 'U.S.S.R.'. That there didn't seem to be any secrecy about it, or any body stopping it..(Coast Guard, fishing boats etc.) It just occurred to me that this was qualifying what Awareness said, that the Russians were much more in control around here than entities were led t;o helieve. COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this as having been a deliberate action to inform entities of the presence of the Russian influence. This Awareness indicates that this as likened unto those activities wherein the Russian submarines entered into areas in Norway and Sweden behind the lines of securlty as an action to show these entities the fallibility of their tracking devices. This as a kind of flagrant action to intimidate in a psychological sense, to indicate that the nation's dt4enst.t; anb vu1neraiAe. This Awareness indicates that this as part of an attempt to keep the citizenry of the countries aware and concerned about the military efforts, so that they may become more active and vocal in expressing a desire for disarmament. This Awareness indicates that the rrew pre~xdi?trt of Russia, the new leader of Russia as otle whu is more willing to be assertive in taking the initiative. This Awareness indicates that this may result in some type of peaceful settlement that leads to disarmament, or if not satisfactory, it may lead to actions that result in greater conflict. This Awareness indicates that this appears to be an issue which will turn one way or the other during this summer. THE COALINGA EARTHQUAKES: A WARNING OF WHAT COULD HAPPEN QUESTION : One final question. In the Audio Letter Interim News Alert No. 3 dated May 1983, part of the article entitled \"darthquakes and the Pope's Revolution Plot,\" they make the following state- men t : \"Man-made earthquakes are not restricted to normal earthquake zones and they give no advance warning. Early this month on May 2, the small town of Coalinga, in the Western part of California's San Joaquin valley was smashed by a sudden strong earthquake. It was not preceded by any of the advance warning signals that normally indicate an imminent quake,and Coalinga ie not of the San Andreas fault where quakes normally are centered, but; same 20 to 30 miles away, in an area where quakes ordinarily do not originate. \"Dr. Beter revealed in Sept. 1978, that the type of Soviet earthquake-generating cobalt bombs planted underground in California are designed to produce earthquakes with the usual strenfth of around 6.5 on the Richter scale. The Coa inga quake measured about 6.5. Many earthquake generators have already been set off over the past several years according to Dr. Beter's Audio Letter reports, loosening up the giant San Andreas fault. Coalinga is midway between San Francisco and 140s Angeles, and since the earthquake there, geoloGats have discovered that the San Andreas fault is locked mainly at two remaining points: these points are areas near San Francisco and Los An eles. Should they be unlocked, allowing the f fau t to move, California's two greatest cities could be devastated. Will it happen?\" Since that time there have been two more earth- uakes, at least two, in Coalinga, the lateat two 8ays ago I believe. I'd like to ask Awareness, are these quakes in Coalinga normal, or have the Russians actually med some of these earthquake generating cobalt bombs as a warning to the powers in Washington that they're still in control? ED'S Note: this questian was asked In A ril, By July at least 6 more quake6 were reported in oalinga. E COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates this as the latter. That this is that which is being effected by the Russians in an effort, a secret effort to communicate to those forces which have been preparing for war, th&t there are many ways in which this nation can be devastated or greatly harmed, and that the Russians are willing to da this if it becomes necessary in terms of their interests.

Any society whose educational system perpetuates the myths about and preaches the merits of the supremacy of the military supermen of Israel is destined to deceive its children about other aspects of reality. Such a community whose press and television medh present a near totally biased view in support of Israel is destined to be tragically misinformed and doomed to suffer the consequences of poor judgment in world affairs, This has been the fate of my country because it its developed a \"special relation- ship\" with Israel, a relationship which, defying logic as we11 as ecowmics, makes a sham of the concept of justice. Thus, Mca has become an enslaved society due to the influence of Christians as well as Jews, whose politicaI energies and financial power are grossly disproportionate in numbers to the numerically supezior but politically apathetic majority, and who have had as an indispensable ally the spectre of Hitler, This is our unfortunate Xahy today. .... But if our leaders have failed to give us good msrghts into the problems besetting man, world literature has not. John Stelabeck, m his classic novel, The Pearl, wnting about man's capaclty to know goad and evil, says, \"In this Gulf of uncertain l@t, there were more dltmions than realities.\" Our leaders in the govem- ment and the press either cannot or will not see the evil around them; consequently, they fhster dusions that cannot poisslbly be validated. William Faulkner created a series of novels set in a fic- titious Mississippi county to show how the oppression of others eventually destroys the oppressors by draining them of their humanity and morality. George Orwell in 1984, Alduous Hwdey m Brave New World, and Ray Bradbury in Fahrenheit 451 all deal with the striving of in&viduals to find the truth in socletles total- ly mobilized to ensure that truth never emerges. In ~ts dealings with the Middle East, America is close to becom- mg that kind of society. As insidious journalist Ellsworth Toohey in Ayn Rand's The Fountuinheud revealed the secrets of his rise to power and public acclaim to one of his victims, Peter Keating: If you learn how to de a single man's soul, you can get the rest of m&nd .... The soul is that whjch cannot be ded. It must be broken .... Want to know how it's done! Make man feel small. Make him feel grulty. Kill his aspiration and his integn\"ty. That's d~fficdt. Be worse among you gropes for a idenl in his own twisted way. Kill integrity by internal corruption. Use it against itself. Preach selfishness. Tell man he must live for others. Tell men altruism is the ideal. Not s2 single one of them has ever achteved it and not a singfe one of them ever will, The Israelis, with the help of the U.S. are personifications of Toohey's position. By hanging, one of the greatest guilt trips in history on all mankind for the slaughter of Jews during W.W. II, the IsraeIis have preached the doctrine of altruism to its pinnacie for their self-advantage. .... I thought if ever a people existed who understood the impact of blind hatmi and prejudice, it had to be the Jews because they had been on the receiving end of such calamities. They could have taken the lead in showing the world the senselessness of bigotry, and the world was most ready to follow after W.W. II. They could have shared the dream of brotherhood in a land where Palestinians lived as a majonty and where the rights of all people could have been respected But Z~onism turned the dream into a zllghtmare.

Paul Shockley, Jnterpreter THE BOOK OF ENOCH: THE COSMIC SPACE OPERA f The Fall of the Angels ... Celmrial Lust ... Enter the Dark Force ) QUESTION : There's a very long and very interesting article in the current Heart Magazine, that's called \"Origen's Angel- ology.\" \"Why was this beloved church father of the second century denounced aa a heretic?\" And then it goes into the forbidden mysteries of Enwh, and it appears that this Book of Enoch contains a lot of the keys that explain the story of Creation, and a lot of the problems we face today, and the origin of the Dark Force and so forth, a lot of which correlates with what Awareness has previously given. I'd like to read a little bit of this and ask Awareness to comment on it. \"The book of Enoch, once cherished by Jews and Christians alike; this book later fell into disfavor with powerful theologians precisely because of its controversial statements on the nature and deeds of the fallen angels. Its theme so infuriated the later church fathers, that one of them, Filastrius, actually condemned it as heresy. Nor did the Rabbis deign to give credence to the book's teaching about angels. \"Rabbi Simeon Ben Jochai in the Second Century A.D., pronounced a curse uDon those who believed it. so the book -was denounced, bannhd, cursed, no doubt burnkd and shredded, and last but not least, lost, and conveniently forgotten for a thousand years. But with an uncanny persistence, the 'Book of Enoch' found its way back into circulation two centuries ago. In 1773 rumors of a surviving copy drew Scottish explorer James Bruce to distant Ethiopia. \"True to hearsay, the 'Book of Enoch'had been preserved by the Ethiopic Church, which put it right alongside the other books of the Bible. Bruce secured not one, but 3 copies of the precious book, and brought them back to Europe and Britain. Fifty years later, when the book's fIrJt English translation was produced, the modern world gained its first glimpse of the forbidden mysteries of Enoch. \"The Book of Enoch speaks from the obscure realm where history and mythology overlap.A.ivy to those unfathomable founts of ancient lore, its author draws for the reader a brimming cup of secret wisdom. A primordial drama of good and evil. light and dark unfolds. The book tracks Enoch's footsteps back to antiquity f timlessness; back to the first hint of corruption upon a pristine world,-earth. \"The trouble, according to the 'Book of Enoch', began when the heavenly angels and their leader named Samvaza developed \"As the story goes, one spiteful angel named Azazyel creates unnatural accouterments, like eye makeup and fancy bracelets, to enhance their sex appeal. As for the men, Azazyel teaches them 'every species of iniquity,'including the means for making swords, knives, shields, breastplates, aN the instruments of war. There, millennia ago, someone had explained war, not as a man- invented or god-sent plague, but as a vengeful act of a fallen angel cast out of the glorious spheres of heaven. \"The implication is that man, either through lack of discrim- ination or sheer blindness, eventually latched on to a game of death that is not his own device, but that of the fallen angels. But there it more to Enoch's account of the Watchers. When the men of earth cry out in their destruction, heaven hears them. The mighty archangels, Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Suryal and Uriel appeal on behalf of earth's people before the Most High, the King of Kings ... \" It goes on and on, but there's an awfully lot of very interesting information in this. I'd like Awareness to comment on that? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this Book of Enoch as that which is accurate, but a somewhat confusing portrayal or description of what this Awareness refers to as the Forces of Ahriman: that these likened unto the fallen angels, the roth hers of the Shadow, the Dark Forces, the Forces of Ignorance: those forces which this Awareness has referred to as come from the Unholy 6,--that this is in reference to the Unholy 6 planets of Orion, the star systems of Orion which had been quarantined from the rest of the universe.* Thk Awareness indicates that these fallen angels, in mingling with and interfering with the evolution of entities in various parts or places in the universe; that these so-called fallen angels having fallen from their particular vibratory plane, the frequency on which they were placed, having fallen into the frequency of this physical plane, in which man had been placed, as an action of an experiment,(this in reference to the creation of the so-called garden of Eden); the creation of beings on a particular frequency; the dimension which is known to entities on this particular frequency as Terrestria, or the physical plane .... That the so-called an insatiabie lust for the daughters of men upon earth, and an angels referred to inthe BOOR of Enoch, these fallen irrepressible desire to beget children by these women. Samyaza angels who traverse between dimensions of frequencies, feared to descend alone to the daughters of men, and so he convinced 200 angels, the Two Hundred Club, called 'Watchers', between the different planes and meddle in the affairs to accompany him on his mission of pleasure. Then the angels Othem:this as being an account of this original took oath, and bound themselves to the undertaking by history of the Dark Forces coming upon this earth, 'mutual execrations'-curses. Once such a pact was sealed, betrayal and upon this naive and new being called man. This was punishable by unnamed horrors. \"In their gang-inspired bravado, the angels descended and took as a new genetic creation. wives from among the daughters of men. They taught the women Awareness indicates there were of course sorcery, incantations, and divinations, twisted versions of the earlier people, from the descendants of thcrse who have secrets of heaven. The plot thickens, like that of any good lived prior. ?This Awareness indicates the particular science-fiction thriller. The women conceived giant children story as handed down as part of the history of the from these angels, evil giants, The giants devour all the food that of the group of that enti@ known the men of earth can produce. Nothing satiates their hunger. They kill and eat birds, beasts, reptiles and fish. To their as Jehovah; the entity who, having his garden of clones, gargantuan appetite, nothing is sacrosanct; soon even man referred to as Adam and Eve in the myths; this represents becomes a delicacy. the origin of the history of this Semitic race."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"b This Awareness indicates that this Book of Enoch refers in part to the works of this entity, and how his works were corrupted by these forces from the other dimensions, the dark fallen angels. That many of these stories, while not being totally accurate in conveying the complete picture, are fragments of forgotten legends, are fragments of truth of a forgotten history; that they are often told in allegory, they are often told in drama, they are often told in ways which appear to convey a supernatural story which may seem to be fantasy. Angela With and Without Win@ This Awareness indicates that the basic reality is that there are and were space people persons who travel interdimensionally and through space, who move in and out of this dimension, or on and off of this planet, from the surface and into the inner parts; and these activities are often the basis for various legends and stories which seem to have some form of supernatural, or almost mythical and unbelievable qualities. This Awareness indicates the angels being depicted as having wings in some instances refers to those beings who are capable of flying, yet the entities may not in fact have wings; that in other instances these beings do in fact have wings: they are interdihensional beings whase genetic heredity is different and along different lines from those of the physical body. That the alleged angels with the wings which are often spoken of or depicted in ancient myths, are in fact representatives from certain other frequencies and may actually appear in physical form as beings with wings. However, in many instances, these are simply symbolic in nature and are symbolic representations of entities who have the ability to fly, by use of crafts or flying machines. Abtiman Forcer Sqppreoa the Book of Enoch This Awareness indicates that the Book of Enoch as that which serves as a threat to those fallen angels who are in physical form upon this earth, who prefer to keep such information from being given out to the masses. That the Ahriman Forces prefer that entities think that the UFOs are but a hoax, or that they do not exist, or that if entities do believe they exist, that they come from other planets, that the earth's surface is the only place wherein life exists, and that all of these concepts and stories of interdimensional beings or of angels and fallen angels,-that all of these are false and unreal; for if entities were to suddenly grasp that the Ahriman Forces are interdimensional beings and are popping in, and out of this plane and its dimension at will, and have the ability to influence entities' minds and behavior if they are willing to follow such influence; if these Ahriman forces were to allow such information to be presented, it would destroy a great part of the deception which they weave and use in order to control and direct and entrap the masses on this plane. This Awareness indicates that therefore, they prefer to keep entities thinking in what is called \"practical levels,\" whereby they create a practical statement that maker, no sense, but boggles the mind and serves as a religion to answer those questions which cannot be answered, answering these with an enigma, and then, having set that enigma as the answer to all questions, discourage any further exploration into those areas such as the discernment of frequencies, vibrations, inter- dimensional realities, myths of the past, histories handed down, stories of unusual beings; all of these things which are termed the occult, or the secrets, or the hidden. 3. Wow the Dark Forces Control the Churches (Rewriting the Scriptures ) This Awareness indicates it is the Dark Forces of Ahriman who are the ones who mast want the mysteries to remain hidden, to suppress the occult, to keep the occult or those secret teachings away from the masses, and these Dark Forces of Ahriman use the churches for this purpose and will rewrite scripture as it suits their needs in order to keep these churches from allowing these mysteries to be revealed. This Awareness indicates that entities today are living at a time wherein they can refer to the newly written Bibles and check back on those Bibles which were being used one or two decades ago, and can see how the text have been changed to condemn those who believe or study psychic phenomena, or astrology, wherein the earlier text did not have that same condemnation. That this as an example of how the scriptures are rewritten to serve the purposes of those who would hide truth and use the religious writings to bring about a change, in order to destroy further learning or research into areas which might reveal some of the hidden mysteries. This Awareness indicates that it is also the Ahriman Forces who seek to prevent entities from discovering the true nature and origins of the flying saucers and of interdimensional realities, and of life after death, and of those various mysteries which are, in spit. of the Forces of Ahriman and their efforts, which are in fact coming out and being revealed more and more, each day, each week, each month, each year, each decade. This Awareness indicates that in looking back 30 years, one can ask: \"Where was this information 30 years ago, which now is everywhere?\" This Awareness indicates that more and more people are asking questions because the answers they have been given do not answer, they simply stop thinking. More and more, entities do not want their thinking stopped, they want answers which will satisfy their questions, The Fallen Angels Get More Wicked Every Day FOLLOW- W QUESTION: Awareness, this article on the Book of Enoch, the authors concludes that the book was removed by the church, mainly because they couldn't accept the idea of fornicating angels, or that the angels fell from grace through lust rather than through pride, and their theory is that the genetic code, so to speak, of these fallen angels, that they have propagated themselves and propped themselves up on the social and success ladder throughout the centuries in every race, religion and nation. From the original prototype, they have cloned and carven an oppressive and godless power eIete; and because they fell, God condemned them bacause of this, and they have since just got more wicked and wicked down through the ages, and they in fact are the Alien Force that is present today, and is ingrained in the churches and so forth. Is that information basically correct? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this essentially is correct; this being not necessarily in absolute detail, but in a general sense, the information is correct.

HOW Tarot Cards Work When entities use that name in a kind of sacriligious or profane manner, it creates a discharge of the energies attributed to the name. Likewise, in the creation of a system, a system of numbering, or a system of number- ing with letters and a coding or decoding program assoc- iated with that, whenever this system is charged and en- ergized by masses, over long periods of time, the system takes on a kind of vitality that it would not have if ent- ities had not charged that system. This Awareness indicates it is for this reason that the Tarot cards have certain potential value, because so many entities over such a long period of time have energized this system; thus the system, in following the energy, in carrying the energy, in doing what it is supposed to do, flows through the universe of energies, flows through the Universal Consciousness, in a manner whereby it acts in a prescribed way, even though it may look haphazard when watching one shuffle the cards and throw these cards. This Awareness indicates in the use of the Kaballa and numerology, and whereby this system of the Jewish number and letter evaluation is enhanced and promoted down through the ages of time; wherein entities alter the system at a particular time, to avoid that which they, by their system have created, this alteration is but a make- shift action which can only slightly alter the energies. The alteration is however, effective to some degree; to the degree that all of the people of Israel see this in the new meaning, they will cease to energize the old meaning, and will enhance the new image, thus bringing a greater like- lihood of survival and peace during this time period, than if all of the entities were seeing that which represented destruction. This Awareness indicates that even though the masses may recognize all of these new energies, and energize the new energies of that new arrangement of words, still those who are familiar with the method or system, will be aware of the great danger of the system, even though it has been altered. This Awareness indicates that this is likened unto attempting to change the horoscope of a child by changing the time of birth on the birth certificate.

Paul Shockley , Interpreter WHY DO SOME MEN WITH LOYAL, DEVOTED WIVES CHASE AFTER OTHER WOMEN ? Q77ESTION : A question from Mrs. S.W. in Pennsylvania. There's actually more than one question, but I think the basic question concerns guilt. \"I would like Awareness to comment on things that are happening too often to men lately. My husband was in a truck stop, as far as 1 understand it, and seerned lonely, when a waitress started a conversation with him. Later, after she was off work, she went to his room and satisfied his immediate needs for whicf~ now the guilt has been building. Ile docs not know that I know. I would like to help him get it out of his system so he will not feel guilty anymore. \"1 love him very much. We have been married for about 29 years, and it has not happened before that I know of, but things have been getting worse between the two of us. He has been rejecting me, does not want to have anything to do with me, and he has not com- municated well for the past two and a half to three years. I would like to know why he lets this happen; why he could not trust me enough to tell me about it. Also. this summer, I know he went on the East coast--Delaware, New Jersey, Atlantic City, and so forth. What was he searching for? \"Maybe people would like to know why men do these strange things while their wives stay clean and keep their rnarriage vows? Thanks for hearing me out, but I needed to confide in someone. 1 had suspected something for a long time, and so forth ...\" I think basically what she's asking is that she feels the problem is n~ainly guilt and what can she do to help her husband rid himself of guilty feelings about this situation, COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates there appear to be two ctrncerns in this question. ?'hat the ccncem in regard to why men stray from their wives as that which is of legitimate concern, particularly wherein the wife herself is so devoted and ioyal tu the marriage, and marriage vows; that this can best be understood in regard to the individual malt?, rather than in thinking in terms of the relationship, for even though the male may love his wife dearly, and may have great respect for the marriage itself, there are certain factors the male as an individual may be experiencing which are not exclusiv.e to the marriage partner, crr relationship. The Male Menopause This Awareness indicates that as men begin to age, they also go through that period known as menopause; this as male menopause, whereby they begin to recog- nize that they are losing their youth rather quickly, and looking back on their life, feel much of their ma5culinity slipping away at a rather quick pace, and looking forward see themselves growing more and more impotent as time goes on. That often such an entity, if this masculinity is an important factor in his self-image, may have the psychological need to assert himself, reestablish his masculinity in his own mind. That even when the wife is assuring to the entity, devoted to the entity, giving of her love and affection, even when she may be an ideal wife, the male may still have certain doubts about his masculinity, based upon the realization that he is not what he once was. 'That also, he may begin to feel that perhaps his wife's judgment of him is just not actually as clear as it could be, and that she is prejudiced in his favor, The entity may, in that respect, begin to not only doubt his own masculinity, but doubt his wife's acceptance of him as a man, and feel that she is not a proper judge of his masculinity. This Awareness indicates that wherein a temptation occurs from another female, the entity, looking at the factors, assuming this will not lead to any expos- ing of his inappropriate action, may yield to the tempt- ation of being with another, in order to see how he stands from the viewpoint of another female, other than his own wife. This is an attempt, as an effort on his part to reassess his masculinity which has been slipping away, to reaffirm his self-image which has been eroded by the realization of his own growing inadequacy. In this respect, it must be understood by the wife, that it is not intended as a violation to her, as a slap in her face, or as an affront to the marriage, but rather it is a de~perat~e, insecure and somewhat imm- ature approach to problem-solving. Rather than accepting the aging process gracefully, the entity is attempting to grab something from the past, reaffirm his virility, and is attempting to reestablish his mas culinity. In many instances, this actually leads to separation, whereby the male seeks younger women, or a younger mate, and the entity gives up his life- long love to start another Iife which he feels can reaffirm his self-image of himself as a virile and potent entity."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"This Awareness indicates it is not an attempt to do something sneaky or to violate, but it is, rather, a personal problem which is being dealt with in a manner that is not always appropriate. The wife, under such conditions, should not see herself as a failure, but should see this situation for what it is. The Positive and the Negative Aspects of Guilt This Awareness indicates that the second part of the question, referring to the entity's guilt, the guilt involved; this in part relates to the realization that this has violated a sacred trust, this has broken a loyalty, and also to the realization that this could lead to serious problems. That there is also more than guilt here; there is also the feeling of, \"What have I done? This could destroy my marriage! This could start a totally different lifestyle for me! \", and create within the entity the confusion as to what future directions he may find himself moving toward. This Awareness indicates that there are two imp- ortant realizations in connection with guilt which entities must understand: that there is the positive aspect of guilt as well as the negative aspect of guilt. The purpose and positive aspect of guilt which ent- ities may recognize, is that feeling guilty about some action can help an entity to learn from the experience for future reference. In the event that such might ever occur again, the entity having learned from the past experience, may then be better prepared to make the right decision in the future experience. This as being a positive aspect of guilt, whereby an entity being forewarned, and feeling fuilty of having done something previously, now may avoid that experience in future times. However, the negative aspect of guilt is that wherein an entity, looking back on some action, allows that guilt to erode and destroy the entity's future, relation- ships, activities, or self-image. That the negative aspect of guilt is that which generally tends to dominate, and the positive aspect of guilt generally tends not to be recognized as it should be. That entities in wallowing in the energies of negative guilt often find great personal significance to their otherwise empty life, can, for some entities, become an overwhelming energy that dominates the entity's thinking and approach to all areas of his Iife. As there are pasitive qualities which can dominate an entity's Iife, there are also those negative qualities which can dominate an entity's life, and either of these can be used as an excuse for behavior. That wherein an entity latches onto a negative energy, such as guilt, it can serve as a cop-out, as a kind of excuse to avoid responsibility for other areas of one's life, for one's relationship, for one's responsibilities toward others, or toward oneself, or toward one's career. This Awareness indicates that negative guilt as that which is extremely destructive, or can be extremely destructive, depending on how strong, and how chronic it is. This Awareness suggests that the entity experiencing this sense of guilt essentially recognizes that he has violated his own principles, as well as the trust which was given to him in the relationship and marriage vows, and the entity also realizes that he could somehow be caught, and the entity feels somewhat ashamed and un- worthy of being with his wife, and the entity also feels somewhat torn in relation to what he has done, in such a manner that it obsesses and fascinates his thinking part of the time. What the Understanding Wife can Do. The entit.y also could very likely return to this life, to these kinds of behavior, and continue in this manner, if the entity does not get this clear in the relationship with his wife, and reestablish the ties and loyalties and the connections. This Awareness suggests that this can best be accomplished by the wife, who already under- stands and knows about the action. Wherein she, being an understanding person, can open the subject and talk to him, this may be approached by use of a letter, or in conversation; that it should be on a level whereby she expresses deep love and affection and understand- ing to the situation, understanding what motivated him in that direction, asking what she can do to help him get through the guilt which he feels, and assisting him in seeing that negative guilt is not the answer, and that positive guilt, or learning from the situation, can be very beneficial. That wherein she can assist him in seeing the full ramifications of what this kind of behavior could to to his Iife, to the relationships he has with his friends and family, the entity assisting in helping him to look at this, without using any forms of threat, without threatening him by use of the knowledge of what has occurred, expressing to him that: \"Yes, it does hurt that this occurred, but yes, I understand what happened, and I do not identify with this as being so much my problem as 1 see this being your problem.\" This Awareness suggests that the wife, keeping her self-respect throughout, is more capable of assisting in this action of helping the entity to sort out the confusion, the emotions and the feelings; and in this manner, the wife may remain strong and steadfast, even as the man goes through those emotional storms, confusion and the sorting out of his feelings. That the wife also must make it cleax that she has certain expectations that this will not happen again. That such expectations expressed will serve as a kind of barrier, preventing the man from easily moving back into that type of activity, and those barriers are necessary, particularly when an entity is not clear, is confused, or is not trusting of his own behavior, and wherein the relationship and trust which is mutually shared, is being threatened. This Awareness indicates that jealousy, and restrictions in regard to stable and sacred relationships should not be seen as hindrance to individual's rights, but should rather be seen as protective barriers to the relationship which both share and want to preserve, and wherein one breaks down these restrictions, or barriers, the other party in the relationship shouid bring to attention the realization that he or she recognizes that breaking down of the barrier, and should discuss this sufficiently so as to understand mutually, whether this means the relationship is no longer to be considered sacred and worthy of preservation by these restrictions, rules and barriers, or whether the entity is simply being"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"disloyal, hoping to preserve the relationship, while also straying into other pastures in order to have the best of several situations. That when this is brought into levels of comm- unication, the recognition of values will then be brought into conscious levels for discussion, re- evaluation and clarification, so that mutual agree- ments can be either reestablished, or revised, accord- ing to the wishes of the parties. That it is import- ant that the wife, in this situation, not lose self- respect, not blame herself, and not condemn her husband, but rather that she communicates openly, clearly and lovingly in regard to what has occurred, and that together, clarifying the feelings of each, sharing these feelings, that they then consider future plans and activities together. After the Affai r--Take a Vacation Together This Awareness suggests that it would be of great value for these two entities, after such comm- unication, to embark on an adventure together, such as a vacation, traveling, or doing some act- ivity with a common goal whereby they may re- establish a connection with each other in a some- what different setting, to add a new dimension of activity and memory to their lives. This Awareness suggests that wherein these entities can have mut- ual goals and activities shared tagether, but of such variety as to break away from boredom and tedious and continuous similarities, wherein these entities can move into activities that stimulate excitement, joy and interest in other areas so that both share in these activities and interests; this can stimulate new beginnings, and a new romance to the marriage. This Awareness suggests for example, that these entities could benefit from simply going out some- where, to a different city, and staying in a motel, or hotel, for a day or two, sight-seeing and visiting certain areas of interest which are mutually agree- able to them. This Awareness suggests also that they reacquaint themselves with each other during these times, pretending that they are just meeting ox just getting acquainted all over again. Many ent- ities living with each other for long periods of time not only begin to become so familiar with each other as to take each other's behavior and feelings for granted, but also these entities often begin to develop patterns of relationship, response and communication with each other in such a manner as to indicate that familiarity, and often that famil- iarity leads to a kind of contemptuous expression which entities level toward each other. This Awareness suggests that wherein the famii- iarity can be broken, reestablished in other areas, along other ways of communication, so that a new relationship becomes established,--a new way of communicating, a new way of relating,--then entities may discover things in each other which are not familiar, which are new and fresh, and which lead to a new kind of romantic recognition of each other's finer qualities. That when this occurs, entities may also learn to nourish these finer romantic qualities and bring these out, so that they reestablish a new value, a new sense of affection for each other, based on the recognition of those qualities which have not been fully nourished in each other. Coaxing Out the Beauty in a Person This Awareness indicates that it has long been said that beauty is in the eye of the beholder; that beauty can be brought forth from entities, according to the activities of the beholder, wherein the beholder recognizes beauty, or draws out the beauty from another. That wherein an entity demands another be beautifui, demands anather be loving and lovable, this simply causes any beauty that is present to diminish and hide in fear of failure. That wherein beauty is en- couraged and coaxed out, wherein it is stroked and recognized, this brings forth that beauty within each entity which can then be shared by both. This Awareness indicates that this wife may find herself capable of coaxing out the beauty in her husband, and allowing him to see that he is indeed a beautiful person, one worthy of her love, one who is capable of many great things yet, and one who needs not concern himself greatly with mistakes from the past. In so coaxing out his beauty, and rebuilding his self-image, the wife then can assist this entity in finding his new set of principles and values based not upon his sexual virility, but upon his virility as a man, as one of strong character, as one of strong purpose, direction, devotion and responsibility; as one who is of a caring nature, which provides her with the energies, affection, devotion, and love that she needs for her happiness. This Awareness indicates that wherein he understands he is providing these things in his mind, he can remain a man, a potent force in her life, and needs not doubt his manhood, even though he may not be as sexuallv active as in the earlier stages of his life. -"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"WHAT TO DO WHEN THE HUSBAND REFUSES TO TALK ABOU'T' HIS PHILANDERING (FOLLOW-UP QUESTION) : Awareness, in a case like this, where the husband evidently will not broach the subject of his phil- andering, it therefore falls upon the wife to sit him down and explain she knows about it, and \"let's talk about it\"; is that correct? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that wherein she senses that he would not be willing to discuss the thing even if she brought this up, it would be better that she wrote her entire feelings out on paper, and delivered this to him. That it is import- ant that she have an opportunity to say everything she wishes to say in ~egard to this. That to simply state a few lines, and have him stop the conversat- ion could be very damaging, in that he may never understand that she has such a clear view of the circumstances, and that she understands his actions, and still cares for him. That she needs to be able to express all of her feelings to him, and if he is feeling strongly that she would become greatly upset and threatening to him, he may wish to cut off the communication before she can fully ex- press her clarity of the situation. However, if she feels close enough to the entity, and feels that he would be open to talking about this, this can be worked out through communicat- ion on a verbal level. It does not appear that this will require a heavy kind of showdown, but in some instances, it might occur that a wife and husband would need to have a kind of emotional showdown whereby the husband would be put on the spot to have to account for himself, and the wife then being allowed to express herself during that conversation. In some instances, the husband might use the philosophy that the best defense is the offense, and thus attempt to overwhelm the wife with accusations or verbal abuse when the subject is approached; that such type of action from a husband in a similar situation might require that the wife become very firm and confronting to him, until she is able to communicate more through forcing him to become receptive to that communication. This Awareness indicates this discussion does not of course relate to or approach the subject of infidelity on the part of the wife. This is some- thing which may occur in other circumstances, and many of the emotions involved are the same as in this situation, yet there can also be other circumstances and other emotions regarding the situation of infidelity on the part of a wife. 5 What to do When the Husband Turns his Rejection Toward his Wife (FOLLOW-UP QUESTION): It seems to me it would be pretty hard for a wife in this situation not to see herself as a failure when her husband like she says, has been \"rejecting me, does not want any- thing to do with me, and he does not even communicate for the past two and a half years.\" COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that it can sometimes reach such as state of blockage in the relationship. This entity's sense of guilt and his feelings can be of such a level that the entity, rather than reject- ing himself, turns that rejection toward his wife, having confused the issues in order to preserve his own self-dignity, blames the wife unconsciously; rather than stating to himself that he made a mistake, he will perhaps look at the wife and say to himself: \"She is not attractive to me.\" That if this aspect of the relationship becomes so strong that communication is not possible, and if the wife in her efforts to communicate to this entity, opens the topic for discussion and is not given the space to do so, or if she senses that it would be fruitless to communicate with him on this topic, because he would be so rejecting of her that he would not give her any self-respect anyway; in such an event, or under such circumstances where the wife does not feel he respects her as an individual, then it becomes necessary that the wife take an action that preserves her own self-respect; and in such preservation, causes him to look again at her with greater respect. This Awareness indicates anytime the wife feels that she is groveling, or wherein she feels that her husband sees her as groveling before him, she should immediately cease, and take her leave in one way or another. This is not always necessarily a physical separation, but in some cases an emotional separat- ion will suffice. That there is a saying among women that \"Men should treat a woman like a cat, giving them much affection, and they will stay. That a woman should treat a man like a dog, giving him much abuse, and he will stay.\" As strange as this sounds, it has a certain semblance of truth to it. This Awareness indicates that wherein the woman is treated, or allows herself to be treated like a dog, the man quickly loses respect and the woman finds herself being more and more abused, and any woman who accepts that will not have the relationship which she desires, and it is better that she leave, as a cat would leave if it is abused. That on the other hand, if a man is given too much affection, as a cat might enjoy, the man often begins to feel overwhelmed by that affection, smothered by that affection, and may seek to escape."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"That whereas if the man is treated more as one would treat a dog, more as one would order a dog about, the man feels much more useful, which is his desire, and will often become more dependent on the master of the house, and will be more inclinc to stay around. That of course, if this is taken to extreme, it can lead to all kinds of fights, likened unto dogs and cats yowling and fighting each other for domination of territorial rights. Self-Respect Must Always be Maintained This Awareness suggests however, that it does convey a certain message and understanding which is often not easily grasped in the usual relation- ships between male and females, for they are two distinct species, and not only distinct as species, but also as individuals, so that no general rule will always be valid in every instance. This Awareness indicates that it is absolutely essential that entities in a relationship be allowed by each other to keep their own self-respect, and as an individual it is absolutely essential that whether another allows you to have self-respect or not, that you do so, irregardless of the other party. If you do not respect yourself, even where love exists between entities, the relationship will fall apart, will deteriorate, and the love will be as meaningless as memories. Pride and Vanity is Defined This Awareness is not of course seeking to promote pride and vanity as self-respect. Vanity is that quality which is associated with self-respect, but which is taken to extreme, whereby an entity over-inflates self-worth, based not on reality, but on hopes that others will see them as something special, even though they do not see themselves as something special, and even though they them- selves do not do anything special. That pride is that which is somewhat less extensive than vanity, whereby one feels proud of one's accomplishments and work; this can be somewhat healthy, but wherein one feels proud of oneself simply to be compared to others, this kind of pride is not healthy. How Handwriting Reflects Vanity This Awareness indicates that wherein one can feel proud enough of oneself and one's work to enjoy being oneself, this amount of pride equates to self-respect. That pride and self respect are very close, but wherein one does not respect others, and uses one's self-respect as a measurement of supremacy over others, this is the kind of pride which is damaging. This Awareness indicates that vanity as slightly different; wherein one's pride is so great and one's self-respect is great, but depends and requires constant feedback from others to reassure the entity of his or her self-worth. That in handwriting analysis, pride, vanity and self-respect, or dignity, is revealed in the length of one's \"d\" stem, the stem on the small letter \"d\". Wherein this is excess- ively tall, this indicates vanity. Wherein it is excess- Iveiy short, Iikeried unto the letter \"a\", this ind- icates a lack of pride, a lack of dignity. Wherein it is in the middle, it indicates a healthy degree of personal dignity, self-respect and pride. !d This Awareness indicates that this is important that the dignity, self-dignity, self-respect, is balanced properly and is given as much weight in a relation- ship as the concept of love in that relationship, for love cannot survive where dignity and self-respect are missing. **** THE SINKING OF THE s'TiTANICa' ---WHAT WAS IT ALL ABOUT ? QIJESTXON : Would Awareness explain the significance of the Cunard liner, the Titanic, sinking in the North Atlantic in the early 1900's on its maiden voyage. This ship was billed as 'unsinkable', and it struck an iceberg and sank in an hour on its maiden voyage from England to New York. It was packed with many wealthy and famous people. Many were immensely wealthy Jews, some of whom managed ta survive. I have always felt when reading about the Titanic tragedy, that there was more to this than the unlucky fact that it struck an iceberg. It was cert- ainly a shock in consciousness. I'm asking the question because there's a lot of information coming out now about the Titanic. There's a company that is building a replica of it for millions and millions of dollars, and they're going to let entities mil on it. Also there's been a couple of movies about it, and there's a millionaire industrialist who'se mounted an expedition to try to raise it. For the past several summers they have tried to locate it; this summer they think they will find it and be able to send divers down, even though it lies in water 10 miles deep. Could Awareness give a little more inform- ation on this tragedy of the Titanic?"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"COSMIC AWAR.ENESS: This Awareness indicates that there is seen very little that can be given which has not.already been given; that in terms of significance, this has been given about as much significance as anything of this zlature could be given. That had it occurred on a second, third, or fourth voyage, the significance would have been much diminished; but being as it was its maiden voyage, and filled with wealthy individuals, entities seek to find some form of explanation, such as Divine Wrath, or some other mysterious explanation to describe , the symbolic meaning behind its sinking. This Awareness indicates that it would be some- ' what of a shock to humanity and to the legend, were this Awareness to simply state that \"it was an. act of carelessness, stupidity, or ignorance, in that the entities piloting the ship could have an accident of such magnitude without it having some mythical overtones.\" This Awareness indicates however, it was a large ship which struck an iceberg and sank; and entities can make whatever they wish from this; for, there were many stories, and many energies associated with the passengers, and with the significance of its f essence, its voyage, its publicity, and its shock to consciousness. ! This Awareness wishes, for purposes of drama, that It could find some greater mystery or secret in regard to this event, but A sees nothing more than that of an unprecedented accident. There was no wrath of God; there was that which was a circum- stance that showed entities a different frame of reference, so that those who said it was unsinkable might recognize that it was not. This Awareness indicates that this can be a powerful lesson, if ent- ities can read the lesson; and entities can make this a kind of religious legend, implying the \"hand of God\" teaching ignorant mankind a violent lesson. This Awareness indicates however, all of that is but part of the circumstance which occurred. Fate took a hand in the events, but this was not an aetion of punitive or malicious revenge by a jealous God; this was merely a circumstance based upon events in a period of time, and energies on a course. That this may be considered a karn~ic voyage of destiny, or may be considered merelv a startling, enlightening coincidence. WAS GROUP KARMA BEING WORKED OUT? (FOLLOW-UP QUESTION): The information Awareness gave sometime back on the \"big event\" of the 747 airliner crash that killed so many people; the same would probably apply to this disaster, in that the entities, on a certain level, knew beforehand that this tragedy was going to occur. b that correct? COSMIC AWARENESS: This in the affirmative. This Awareness indicates that there are often those actions which may be termed as a kind of group karma, whereby entities group together in a particular time and space, and experience a certain situation. That this as a very difficult concept to explain in human terms; having much to do with the frequency/vibratory rates, the frequencies of the individuals' vibrations involved. This Awareness indicates that this as extremely difficult to put into words at this time; that there may be an analogy or metaphor which could be used, but this Awareness indicates the energy at present as not sufficient to find proper words for such. (Closing Message) This Awareness indicates that there is seen a bath- tub with water pouring in, the bathtub filling; there is seen that which is soap being added, and bubbles forming; that some of these bubbles cluster together in certain areas. In other areas there are 30 bubbles. That likewise, on the sea in certain areas foam forms, and the bubbles of the foam cluster together; whereas in other areas, the foam is missing. That this foam may be seen as a kind of group karma of the bubbles, and whatever happens to the foam in terms of situation or circumstances, affects the entire group, although certain bubbles may escape to tell the story. This Awareness indicates that this magnetism that holds these bubbles together for a short period of time as that which may be considered as a metaphor or analogy, or aIlegory, for the hand of fate which directs these individual bubbles. *** EU's Note: Although the energy during this closing message was weak (you cvuld hardly hear the voice of the Interpreter), the quest'iner (and later the transcriber) both got the impresswn that Awareness meant to drive home the point that despite the formulation of bubbles and foam and their destiny on the surface of the sea, they are still, in essence, a piece of the sea in that they are composed wholly of water; thus they return to the source, despite various vicissitudes of unknown nature.

Personally, I still think there was more lo the Titanic tragedy than Awareness admits. For one thing, in 1398--14 years before the disaster-a book titled \"The Wreck of the Titan\" lold a fictional story about the world's greatest ocean liner which sank on its maiden voyage after striking an iceberg in t.he North Atlantic. Strange, isn't it?"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"WILL THE POLARIZER HELP GLAUCOMA ? NEW EXERCISE FOR EYE STRAIN) QUESTION: RRcen tiy Awareness gave considerable inform- ation on the problem of glaucoma, and there's one thing I wanted to ask about that which we didn't get around to. It appeared in Dr. Ralph Sierra's book, Power in a Magnet: that by apply- ing the North pole energy field to the outer edge of each eye, for 15 minutes, twice a day, they have noted there was a reduction of pain and pressure in cases of glaucoma. He says: \"We strongly feel #at this indicator may well show us still additional uses for control effects as presented by the North pole of the biomagnet.\" I'd like to ask Awareness if the magnet, or specific- ally the Polarizer invented by Sanl Millar, would have any effect in getting rid of glaucoma? COSMlC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this over a period of time, used in this manner, can be quite effective; this time depending on the condition of the glau- coma, its level or degree of progression. This Aware- ness indicates that \"pdming\" the eyes, wherein the palms of the hands are placed over the eyes for 5 or 10 minutes daily as that which also can be beneficial in healing tired or strained eyes, and to a small degree, in helping the condition of the glaucoma. However, the magnet as that which is more effective for this. YClLlN NAkli: I:, SIIRE1IDBE INONEOFTHESECOMPUTERS The Iln~trd States gc~vcrnment knows you by a numbr.

What are their connection with the World Council of Churches, or the Paeific Institute of Asian Studies? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this appears to be associated with certain forces which do in fact seek to destroy the freedom of religion in the IJnited States, and to create a great breaking down of the Constitution as a viable document;. That once the freedom of religion is broken, the rest of the Constitution as that which would crumble, as this freedom of religion and freedom of speech are two of the more important corner- stones of this document, and that this document as being the base for the judicial and legislative qualities of the nation, and were this to be dis- rupted, this nation's future could be altered by design, according to whoever has the power and control over its economy, administration and communication systems."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"That these organizations as being used by those forces which have previously been ment- ioned as seeking to create a different system in the United States; to set up a dictatorial type of government. ED'S Note: the recent court judgment against the Church of Scientology is probably a good example of how these groups are attacking the churches through the courts. A woman who claimed she was not healed by the church, was awarded 42 million dollars in damages, which, if paid, would destroy the church. QUESTION : There was an article in a tabloid that I'd like to read to Awareness, and then ask some questions about. It's called \"Dead Ringers\": \"Two undertakers with the same name, but not related,-Mike Feeney of Indianapolis, and Mike Feeney of Reading, Pennsylvania, are living proof of the old saying that everybody has a double. Not only do the two Iook alike, but they're both morticians, and even though they're completely unrelated and have never seen each other face to face, their similarities are amazing. \"They're both married, both Roman Catholics, and both active in the Democratic party, and both served in Vietnam in the same capacity. The two have almost identical hairstyles, penetrating eyes, mustaches, and about the same height and weight, and in fact, the two men even sound alike. \"The simiIarities in our appearances are absoIuteIy astounding, right down to our mustaches, the length of our hair, how we part it, and the shape of our faces, \" said the Pennsylvania Feeney ,34, who has exchanged photos with his double. \"Both of their fathers were in the mortuary bus- iness before they were, and passed the business onto them, said the Indianapolis Feeney, age 32; '? spent my service time in Vietnam in the army Quartermaster corps, just like the other Mike did.\" Both Feeneys have run successfully for the Demo- cratic nominations for political offices in their state. The other Feeney ran for the Indiana state legislatur but lost, and the Feeney from Pennsylvania said, \"I just won a primary race for coroner in Burke's County, Pennsylvania, and I will be up for election in November.\" Up until February the two Mike Feeneys had no clue each other existed, and so forth. Now the question is: Sometimes there is a person found to be remarkably similar to another person, even when the two don't have the same birth dates. Is this really just coincidence? Are they what Seth would call \"probable selves\"? Is someone, or some group in another dimension of reality secretly mot- ivating these two men for instance, to do certain things at certain times'? Are tlrey back-ups for each other, in that some soul wished to experience a certain lifestyle, and if one didn't carry out his mission, the soul could gain the vicarious experience through the other? Is this part of an experiment originating in another dimension, and if so, what is the nature of the experiment? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that these entities as essentially what may be termed 'soul twins'; that the concept of entities having multiple personalities or what may be termed 'multi- dimensional personalities' is that which is also involved, whereby in this particular instance, two of these n~ultidimensional personalities of an individual ended up in the same dimension near the same location and time. This Awareness indicates that whereas each entity has counter- parts in other dimensions, it is rare and unusual that these counterparts appear in the same dimension, near the same time. MORE ON THE SYNTHETICS QUESTION: One of the SPIRAL 'eyes' has a question: \"Although Awareness says we can only distinguish synthetics by their auras, I think I may be starting to identify them through photos. If accurate, this would help us all. Enclosed is a photo of two men who appear to me to be synthetics. Would you please ask Awareness if they are?\" And enclosed was a photograph that was printed in some kind of trade or technical magazine, a tool and die magazine I believe, showing two entities who DO look rather strange, evidently weighing huge chunks of gold, which Iook like they may be out of the mint, with treasury marks and so forth on them. I'm holding this photo now in my hand. The gold appears to be bullion. COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this appears to be as this entity perceives it to be."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"CHANTING ... WILL IT BRING PEACE AND ENLIGHTENMENT AND RICHES (MORE ON THE BELIEF STRUCTURE) QUESTION : -_ .. .__ . ... , This question from J.F. of Temperance, Michigan, has been sent in a number of times by different entities, and it's never been asked, so I'll ask it now. \"I have a friend who is a Buddhist. He believes that to chant \"NAM MEYOHO RENGE KYO\" and other chants, is the answer to all your problems. I feel that if your subeonscious (lower self) believes this is true, and you chant, this will work for you. Or perhaps this works the same way people pray. \"However, on the other hand, I could be wrong and would iike tanow how much. power these chants have on the the changing of our every- day environment to a more positive state of mind. In other words, is the chant so powerful that it could be another substitute for getting to know your subconscious?^' COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that the chant as that which is more meaningful to the Buddhist; that it does have its greatest effect on the subconscious when it is believed in. That this as similar to the entity who might go to the Orient and tell Orient- als that their prayers will be answered if they chant the Lord's Prayer; that it is beneficial for the ent- ities who believe it will be beneficial. (FOLLOW-UP QUESTION): By the same token, then, if an entity believe he could sit down at a specific hour every day and chant \"peanut butter, peanut butter,\" over and over, the effect wouId be the same. COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this in the affirm- ative, except that if the entity has an image of what peanut butter means, then the entity will simply hypnotize himself and his subconscious into wanting or becoming identified with peanut butter. That if the entity has no understanding of what peanut butter is, and has been told that the wards \"peanut butter\" will bring forth jewels and riches, or some other benefits, such as health and wisdom, then the entity inchanting this word, may, in time, convince his subconscious that he is worthy of such; and when the subconscious is convinced, it will take steps to assist in bringing about opportunities for health and wisdom, or jewels and riches. (Closing Message) 'This Awareness indicates that the beliefs which entities hold or identify with, are those which do not always create reality, but which create causes which may result in realty,--the effects that become reality. That if you believe in a certain concept, the concept may be false, but your belief that the concept is true will create a cause within you which has its effect outside of you, and leads to manifestations which may be made into a reality; that the ideal, or idea, never quite fits the actualization of that which is manifested. An entity may have an idea of a perfect home; yet when building that home, it never comes out exactly as perfect as the idea; yet, the idea remains,--even when the paint cracks, and shingIes rot, and the windows are broken; the idea of the perfect home remains, That similarly, a belief may be pure in nature, but the result never quite matches that which entities believe. Therefore, it is important that entities recog- nize the discrepancy, and aliow the discrepancy to be, and adjust themselves to function in an actual world wherein things are what they are, and never quite reach the ideal, or that which is believed; the belief as a pattern or blueprint for that which may manifest, if entities have the tools and opportunity, and the capability of bringing that belief into actuality. This Awareness indicates that entities, having the opportunity to bring a belief into actuality, must also have the cooperation, or opening, away from interference, so that the opportunity can be allowed. *** ED'S Note: thmugh the channel of Ralph Duby, Awareness once remarked, that the power of suggestion was the strongest force an this plane.

Would Awareness please give more information on this and indicate whether this computer is still operating today, and if so, what function it is doing? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates there are quite a number of computers placed in various places within the earth in subterranean areas, that many of these have been destroyed between the years of 1947 and present time; this particularly from 1960 up to approximately 1975; that the large computer as that which still has its functioning powers yet is not operating with complete efficiency as when it was operated by the EIs. That these computers do not have moving park but rather relate to crystals which emanate energies, whic h affect certain areas of consciousness and which read and receive impressions from consciousness. This may be understood better by a parallel whereby one considers the concept of music, where a note is struck and many vibrations come forth from that note. This Awareness suggests that wherein this could be registered on a screen entities would see the initial note and see the overtones or vibrations coming from that note and see also further vibrations coming from each of those secondary vibrations, and so forth. This Awareness indicates that the computer works in a similar manner whereby certain energy is emanated which has its effect on certain stress points in the earth's structure, which then emanates certain energies out into certain other points. These relate to leys,--this spelled I-e-y-s, or lines,--these as magnetic Iines and their cross-points with other magnetic lines and the forces then emanate from these leys and cross-points out into consciuusness into the atmosphere, and from there reflect in the cult.ure of the people of that particular areas and in further reflections affects individuals. This Awareness indicates this also has its effect on weather patterns and on temperatures and air- crafts. That this is monitored by forces outside of this planet as well as outside this vibratory rate; that the monitoring can be screened, can be read even from the other dimensions and also can be pragrarnm from other dimensions; that the Els were capable of moving out ot time and space. This Awareness indicates the \"L9' shape is one of 90 degree angle, that this is symbolic of an energy which is moving through time and space, but which suddenly takes n turn and moves out of time and space, the movement being that which enters into pure consciousness away from the third dimensional world of matter and into the world of mind or imag. ination or that which can be equated to vibrations; 11. that the electromagnet,ic spectrum is such that it eventually leads into a biosphere or biospectrum, whereby life itself is permeating all levels of vibration, reaching down into the electromagnetic spectrum but not compelled by that electromagnetic spectrum. This Awareness indicates the Els moved into this biosphere and are not compelled by the electro- magnetic spectrum which is the cause of form and matter. That the term \"El\", or the Elohim or that which is the term used in the original versions of the Book of Genesis, wherein it said, \"In the beginning Elohim created the heavens and earth.\" These Elohim or EIs came from the biospectrum, that which this Awareness has referred to as the realm of Celestria, and brought forth the electromagnetic fields of energy which in turn creates the material world or realm known as Terrestria. That these entities or these energies of the Elohim moved into matter then returned from matter into that which was anti- matter or spirit. This Awareness indicates they do hawever, exist in a parallel type of universe which permeates this universe, occupying what may be termed the same time and space, but in a totally different realm of existence. This may be more easily understood by the analogy of light and heat and sound occupying the same space in a room yet not interfering with each other, or not causing each other to be forced out of that space or time segment. That essentially, light, heat and sound are of different vibratory rates, therefore can inhabit the same spaces, same time zones. Likewise, matter and antimatter are of different vibratory rates and can inhabit the same time and space, yet not be inhibited by the other. That anti- matter is that which essentially is a reflective opposite of matter, that this is extremely difficult for human comprehension as it reflects in a manner similar to the lens of a camera wherein everything is reversed in its polarizations and its time and space expressions. That for this reason, antimatter has the special effect of creating that which is never ending, whereas matter has the special effect of creating that which is finite; that the antimatter creates the infinite space and matter creates the finite point such as the atom, the grain of dust or the particle. IJkewise, the matter creates concepts of time and the movement,--this essentially is relative duration of matter, relative to other material movements or forms or d~arations, whereas antimatter creates concepts of the eternal now, the eternal present, the everlasting experience. These coming together form that which is ed the body and spirit or the physical and the life of an entity, This Awareness indicates that consciousness is anti- matter, and the body is matter, That It does not wish at this time to give further information on the location of these computers, nor the major computer of the Els; that there is still some conflict occurring upon this plane in regards to these, to the location and to the uses and purposes of these computers, that these things will unfold and be unveiled in their proper time. ***"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"HOW TO DEAL ALZHELMER'S UiSEASE guns aaltd creates abscesses and irritations.

Paul Shockley, Interpreter HOW PSIONICS--RADIONlCS ARE USED TO HEAL AND KILL ( THE ROBOTOID--SYNTHET ICS CONNECTION ) I have a few question from one of the SPIRAL people. \"Recently reference was made in the Village Voice newspaper to the subjection of Russian dissidents to E.M.R. (electro-magnetic radiation) emitted from Russian remote sensing instrumentation, which involves 'thought detect- ion studies via scanning micowave holography. Would Awareness please explain the process and tell us if this is related to the production of synthetics and robotoids. Also, is the method now in use for thought detection of U.S. citizens; and if so, how can we protect against it?\" COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this as being an advanced form of radionics, or that which is known as psionics; that this also as related to instruments described in the Shaver mystery material, produced in the early 40's. This Awareness indicates that, the present technology using these devices is that which has its basis from the radionics of vibration, or frequency, whereby the instrument tunes in to the particular frequency of the subject, and from such frequency, can detect as well as send inform- ation. That this as associated with the mind of the operat.or, whereby the operatar can send certain frequency through the machine, while also sending -- -.---.-- ---- - ---- - -- - IN THIS ISSUE How Psionics are Used to Heal and to Ki ll....

How to Lose your Talents 12. certain data from the mind of the operator to the subject, once the subject has been identified and tuned in to by the frequency on the machine. This Awareness indicates that similarly, in the radionics machines, whereby the subject may be contacted by its frequency, either through use of a photograph, or through a part of the subect con- taining the vibration of the subject; (this may also include the signature of the subject); that the machine may be used to locate and identify the frequency of the subject, to send a particular energy or to send a particular message. This Aware- ness indicates that an example being to use a photo- graph of an orchard, whereby every other row is painted with pesticide to kill the pests in those rows in that orchard. This photograph then being placed in the radionics or psionics machine, then sends forth the vibration which tend to kill the pests on those rows marked on the photograph. This Awareness indicates that likewise, this may be used to heal diseased plants or subjects, by giving medicines to the photograph rather than poisons. This Awareness indicates that the principle being that of the Law of Correspondence, wherein that which is a substitaution for another thing carry- ing the vibratians of that thing, may be used for psychic attunernent; this closely associated with principles used in voodoo. This Awareness indicates that what has been described is relatively well- known by entities involved in the radionics field; that the new twist which has been more, recently developed by the Soviets, is that of scanning the mind of entities in order to not send, but receive information from entities whose photographs are available. This Awareness indicates that the principle works the same, except in reverse: rather than send- ing a thought, the operator becomes open to receive a thought by attuning to the frequency of the machine, after the machine has tuned to the freq- uency in the photograph. This Awareness indicates that this is not an ex- clusive machine used by Soviets, that the United States has also use of this type of equipment and it has been in use for some time, -- this in certain segments, particularly associated with the Rock- efeller powers and the agencies under their control."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"IS THIS PRINCIPLE USED IN THE CREATION OF ROBOTOIDS AND SYNTHETICS I (FOLUIW-UP QUESTION): This principle is also used in the creation of the robotoids and synthetics, is it not? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that the principle as particularly developed in the Soviet llJnion for use in gathering information electronically, and implant- ing that information into the robotoid through the attunement of frequency; this as similar to a program which would combine recording techniques with broadcasting techniques. This Awareness asks you to imagine a particular machine that could not only record information, such as on a tape, but take from that recording,--read off the vibrations from the tape by erasing or drawing out that infor- mation without losing the vibrations or frequencies, and implanting that information into another tape. This Awareness indicates this may be difficult to imagine, yet it becomes simple when you consider the transplanting of information from a phonograph record to another phonograph record through the usual process of duplicating records, This Awareness indicates that essentially, these machines through attunement to vibrations, can tap the consciousness of an entity, record the frequencies, and translate and broadcast these energies to other entities through the machines involved. How to Tell When you are Being Monitored This Awareness indicates that you may recog- nize when and if you are being monitored: the feeling is definite, as though you are surrounded by an electronic field, particularly around your head. There occurs a kind of ringing in the ears, which comes on instantaneously, lasts for several seconds, perhaps 5 to 30 seconds. The ringing as that which causes one to stop giving attention to whatever was of interest and to hold steady, or to turn attention to that energy which is surround- ing the head, and causes a definite feeling of being monitored, as though something had been placed over your head, having an electronic vibration. It may feel similar to having a pot or can piaced around your head, cutting off some of the sounds or vibrations outside, while giving a kind of sensation or sound of being inside of some container. This Awareness indicates that when this occurs, and you sense that you are being monitored, there is not much which you can do, but if you are at the time thinking or talking to others about such things as you would not like overheard, this Aware- ness suggests that you simply stop such thoughts and begin doing mathematical problems in your head,--multiplying or dividing numbers until the ringing stops. This Awareness indicates that not all ringing in the ears is of this type, but when this type of monitoring does occur, you can definitely sense that you are being monitored. This generally occurs when entities are involved in some type of conversation or mental level of concern about con- spiracies, or about the intrigues which are hidden from public view, or about UFO's and government intrigues. This Awareness indicates that these monitoring actions are not only from instruments on this plane; that in some instances, entities from another dimen- sions listen in to the thoughts and expressions of entities on this pIane when the conversations are of significance to them. This Awareness indicates that it is little understood by entities on this plane, that those in other frequencies and dimensions also have a need for information, some of which is avail- able from entities on this plane, and which is not necessarily available to them. That this as being similar to efforts by entities on the physical plane . to seek information from spirits or those of the hierarchy system who reside on the Inner Planes. This Awareness indicates that similarly, spirits and entities on the Inner Planes, (other dimensions) often enjoy gathering intelligence and information from entities upon this physical plane. This Awareness indicates that the monitoring system, both on this physical plane and from the other dimensions, feels approximately the same; hut if one is sensitive, an entity can determine whether he or she is being monitored by entities of an aiien nature from other dimensions, or whether these monitorings are from entities on this particular physical plane. This Awareness ind- icates there are also instruments of a security nature whereby entities wishing not to be mon- itored, may create a field about themselves, using these instruments so that their thoughts are not monitored, cannot be tapped by these machines. WILL THE \"RADIATION DETECTOR\" DEVICE PROTECT ENTITIES AGAINST SURVEILLANCE? (FOL1,OW-UP QUESTION): There's a device called the 'radiation detector', put out by a company called Radiation Detection, Inc., out of Tulsa, Oklahoma. They sell it for $29.95 with a money-back guarantee. Part of their literature says, \"What is this radiation detector? It is a high technology instrument that could easily be one of the best investments you will every make. It is durable and simple to use, It requires no batter- ies or AC power. This radiation detector is to rad- iation what a smoke detector is to fire. It is only 2-1/2 inches high, and easily taken along. The detector will warn you of excessive radiation from nuclear reactors, nuclear fallout, medical or dental X-rays, the color W your children watch, micro- wave leakage, industrial waste, radiation transport accidents and so forth.'' I'd like to ask Awareness if this device would be able to detect the type of surveillance just mentioned in this reading?"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that (.his as po.sibIe, but questionable; that it does not appear to be sensitive enough to detect this type of frequency, as it is of a much more subtle nature than hat which the instrument is designed for, This Aware- ness indicates that the most sensitive detector is the entity's own consciousness and the sensitivity which the individual possesses. This Awareness suggests that you cannot miss knowing when you are being monitored in this fashion. (FOLLOW-UP QUESTION): Is this the same type of monitoring that occurred some time ago when the Interpreter was in trance giving a CAC reading and Awareness indicated it was some friend of Dr. Beter's who was checking in on the Interpreter? * COSMlC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates this in the affirmative. * ED'S Note: Neither Vicki or myself will ever forget that night. It was about 2:AM in the morning and we were completing a series of heavy readings which concerned the Illuminati-Beast conspiracy. Everyone was paranoid enough during those days, releasing infornration which Awareness had indicated could be life-threatening if certain forces became aware of what we were doing. It was raining that night, we could hear it pounding on the roof above as Awareness spoke through the Interpreter, Paul Shockley, as he lay on our cottage floor deep in trance, candles at his head and feet, his body covered with a white sheet. I forget the exact rap Awareness was giving at that moment, but right in the middle of a sentence, IT paused for what seemed several long minutes. Paul's head leaned back then turned slowly side to side; he was still deeply in trance.Finally, Awareness quietly announced: \"This Awareness indicates the Interpreter is being monitored.\" 1 glanced at Vicki T., whose face had suddenly paled and lier large blue eyes widened, and just for a moment, I thought I detected panic about to break out in her expression. But then, the reassuring voice of Awareness resumed again and assured us it appeared to be friends of Dr. Beter who were doing the monitoring with these advanced psionic devices described by Awareness in this reading. After about three minutes, the monitoring stopped and Awareness resumed the reading, even to completing the sentence It had interrupted moments before when It detected the monitoring, Earlier that evening, Aware- ness reveaied in one of the readings, that it was time to cool it for awhile, time to stop releasing the heavy infonnation, as the \"Beast was looking in our direction,\" like an animal sniffing the -wind, trying to pick up a vague, uncertain scent. Because of that reading, it was a sort of relief to hear later an that night that it was only friends of Dr. Beter who were tuning in to the reading, or rather were tuning in to check on how Paul was doing. Since the information Paul was channdiny and we were releasing through the CAC newsletters confirmed what Dr. Beter and his sources were gathering, they evidently felt quite protective of Paul and had respwt for his sourw of similar information. (Avaton). HOW ENTITIES ON EARTH AWE MQNlT0RED BY ALIENS Sirice most of the conversations going on here on the earth plane are probably not that inter- esting, is there some kind of system, like on the telephone, if certain key words come up, then it comes to somebody's attention that this is working up to an area that needs to be monitored? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that these instruments are not used haphazardly on the average citizen, unless there is a particular reason to tune in to that entity for purposes of surveillance or for purposes of gathering information. This Aware- ness indicates that the instruments are not so avail- able as to be used for the masses. This Awareness indicates that this may be used for purposes designed by governments for surveillance of individuals who need, according to their standards, to be better understood, to be monitored for sorrie reason, and that this is rather infrequent in terms of the masses. This Awareness indicates however, that fron~ the other dimensions, those entities from the Inner Planes, not using instruments of this type of a physical nature, can conduct similar monitoring actions as previously described, from other dimen- sions, whereby they attune themselves to entities on this plane simply from the vibration of the ent- ities's thoughts. That wherein an entity enters into a certain frequency, such as the atpba wavelength, and another entity un another dimension is also on that frequency; there may be a rapport occur- ring whereby this entity communicates through these vibrations with the mind of the physical entity, and the physical entity may feel himself being monitored. From the viewpoint of the entity on the lnner Plane, or other dimension, that entity may feel as though he has received a message from some spokes- person from another dimension; and the information received from the physical entity may appear to the entity on the Inner Plane to be of significance because it was conveyed in this manner. It is very sirniIar to the entity on the physical plane hearing voices in his head and believing that he has been spoken to by a spiritual being. This Awareness indicates that as it is above, so it is below. This Awareness suggests that these communications which transcend dimensions, or frequency levels, are those which allow informat- ion to flow, or leak between these barriers of con- sciousness; and the leaking which occurs is that which allows for awakening of new concepts and ideas to those areas wherein the teak occurs. This likened unto entities living within the layers of an onion, who somehow manage to communicate with others inside the next layer, and who somehow nlanage to receive information about that next"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"layer which can be valuable to them in their own layer. This Awareness indicates the universe is com- posed of layers of consciousness, likened unto the thousand-petaled lotus. That this as divided by frequencies, or octaves of vibrations; that these octaves may be transcended through frequency simiiarities; wherein an entity attunes to a certain frequency that has sympathetic vibrations to the same frequency on a higher octave, or has harmon- ious chords Iiking to a similar harmonious freq- uency. IS THERE ANY WAY TO PROTECT ONESELF AGAINST PSlONlC DEVICES? (Follow-Up Question--Vicki ): In relation to this protective screening machine that physical entities might want to use, is there information available to someone like us on how to get one, and is there anyone in our circle that would be advised to use one? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness suggests that this not being necessary to entities involved in the Awareness movement. This Awareness indicates that it is advisable that entities involved in the Awareness movement have an openness whereby there is nothing of significance which needs ta be hidden. This Awareness indicates that this as used more for entities involved in secrecy, in conspiracy programs or activities, or in spy systems, or in activities which involve the secret plans of govern- ments. This Awareness indicates that these ent- ities may have certain protective devices to keep away psionic influences. This Awareness indicates that wherein an ent- ity is concerned about psionic influences being used against one, this can be countered by use of psionic machines, whereby the photograph is given its particular dose of positive energy to counter any negative energy which has been given. That this, of course, requires one who is familiar with the proper use of such machines. This Aware- ness indicates that a more appropriate device has been developed in the Portland, Oregon, area, whereby a vibratory rate of 7.8 hertz is available in a kind of device that can be worn on the body to strengthen the aura and to ward off microwave type energies. That this can have certain benefits. This Awareness indicates that the action of wrap- ping oneself in White Light, in keeping one's thoughts and motives pure, so that hostilities are not being emanated; this is the best protection which entities can have. HOW TO DEAL WITH REAL OR IMAGINED \"ENEMIES\" ( THE \"WHITE LIGHT\" APPROACH ) This Awareness wishes to comment at this time on a particular approach to dealing with one's real or imagined enemies. This Awareness suggests that wherein you assume that you have enemies, regard- less of who these might be, or of how despicable these enemies may appear to you, or whether these enemies are physical or of a spirit nature, whether of the Alien Force or of a physical nature, whether demonic or simply troublesome friends, or associates, --that whatever form your enemy may have, what- ever tactics your enemy may use, that the most difficult way of dealing with your enemy is to use force, carry a big stick, become a threat to your enemy. For it will only become more powerful, will gain power one way or another, or the events which ensue will grow in magnitude so that you become overwhelmed. The larger your club, the more power will come to your enemy, or the situation, so that you are eventually overwhelmed by the force which you generate from your big club. This Awareness indicates that the appropriate way of dealing with your enemy, and that which may appear somewhat shocking to many, is not to psychically send daggers of hostility and hatred to your enemy, but rather to wrap your enemy in White Light. This Awareness indicates wrap yourself also in White Light. Visualize yourself being surr- ounded by the White Light, the clear Christ Con- sciousness. Visualize your enemy being surrounded by the protective clear White Consciousness, the clear Christ Consciousness. That this action is that"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"which disarms the enemy, even if this enemy is Satan himself, or of sonie other demonic nrttrrre. The enemy then, being surrounded by White Light: if this entity attempts to attack or send forth hos- tilities to you, the Whitle Light of the Divine wilt simply bounce back the energies which that entity has sent forth. This Awareness indicates that this is likened unto creating a psychic or psionic screen around yourself to protect you from outside attacks; it also protects your enemy from attacks which you might send to your enemy. That surrounding your enemy with White Light protects you from any energies of an Alien Force which might come from that entity and causes the entity who would send such energies to be bombarded with his own host- ilities. The shield of White Light reflects back upon the entity, so that anything emanated returns quick- ly to the sender. In both yourself and your enemy, a protection, a shield occurs. This may be done with the visualization, with collsciousness, with the mind, with one's imagination. The most eff- icient psionics device is the human consciousness, when it is aware of its own capabilities,--(this in reference to these devices on this plane). This Awareness indicates that when one is walking in the Light of Christ, the Christ Consciousness, the Crystal Clear Consciousness of love, peace, harmony to all; this consciousness is that which serves as the highest frequency and wards off other frequencies of a lower vibration. This Awareness indicates that in wrapping your enemy with White Light, you not have as a motive simply to trap the enemy with the White Light so that the enemy's hostilities return to himself; but that your motive be to encase your enemy in White Light so that his vibrations are altered and changed, so that benefits of the Christ Conscious- ness can penetrate the entity and transform the entity into a loving being. This Awareness indicates that this as the appropriate motive; that a second- ary or side-effect is that if the entity does not respond to the energies of the White Light, then the energies which he emanates will reflect back and do more harm to himself than to those who he sends his hostilities toward. This as associated with the commandment that you love your enemies. This Awareness indicates that you need not love their actions in order to love their essences, their being. That you concern yourself not with destroying your enemy, but rather with transforming your enemy into a friend. This Awareness indicates that this may sound easier than it is; for some entities will resist to their death, rather than become your friend. This Awareness does not ask you to become foolish in your efforts to make friends with a madman, with a serpent, or with the tiger; but rather, asks you to use the White Light rather than the Dark Forces in dealing with your enemies; this being much more effective with less repercussion involved. This Awareness suggests that entities wishing to carry this concept into more genera1 areas, should cronsidcr wrapping those forces of the Illum- inati, those forces which are creating and moving the world toward the brink of war,--wrapping these entities in White Light with the thought being that these entities not only need to transform, to become transformed, into more wholesome beings, but also that the White Light affect these entities in such a manner that their hostilities cannot prevail against others, because the White Light shall reflect them- selves back upon themselves, so that they are forced to see themselves, their actions, their hostilities, their motives, their purposes and their manipulations, and that they simply cannot project these actions outside of their own sphere, outside of the White Light which surrounds them. WHY ARE ALL THE GIANT CORPORATIONS SUDOENLY MERGING ? ( WHERE HAVE ALL THE ROBOTOIDS GONE? I QUESTION : Another question from the entity in SPIRAL. \"1s the Eastern establishment encouraging and permitting an increasing number of large corp- orate mergers to occur at this time in a frantic attempt to implement a corporate world-wide dictatorship? And are the Bolsheviks in control in the United States lending to this plan so that their plan of taking over the United States will then be made easier? Large power blocks might be easier to nationalize than many smaller ones, COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this is in the affirmative, particularly in the first part. This Awareness indicates that in reference to the BoI- sheviks allowing this to occur, that this as being allowed with reservation. That wherein the Bol- sheviks find an opportunity to move in and est- ablish control of these corporations, this would be acceptable to these Bolsheviks, even though the total dictatorship had not yet been established."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"This Awareness indicates that essentially, the Bolsheviks have much control of these corporations already, in that many of the heads of corporations are in fact synthetics,-this having been accomp- lished during the past two years. This Awareness wishes to clarify also to entities that there are very few robotoids in the United States; that these ent- ities have been essentially removed and replaced by synthetics. This Awareness indicates that this appears to have been a source of misunderstanding by many entities who still speak of robotoids in the United States. This Awareness indicates there are a few, but the majority have been replaced by synthetics of the Bolshevik system. HOW MANY SYNTHETICS ARE THERE IN GOVERNMENT AND IN CORPORATIONS? (FOLLOW-UP QUESTION) : Would Awareness give an approximate figure of the number of synthetics there are now in the United States in the government. and corporations and other places? Just a ballpark figure ... ? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that it appears approx- imately one-third of the entities in the higher level of government agencies and also in corporations,-- approximately 20?& in the corporation levels,-this in terms of the larger corporations. That this 2Wo being in terms of the higher echelons of the corp- orations, not referring to the lower management levels. This Awareness indicates this including the banking system to some degree also. That this also includes the security agencies of the government, wherein many of these entities are synthetic in nature. This Awareness indicates that this information as that which can become somewhat troublesome in terms of questions from your membership, and may cause you to lose some of your membership. This Awareness suggests that you consider whether you wish to print this or withhold this information. HOW TO DETECT THE NEW SYNTHETICS (FOLLOW-UP QUESTION): Is there any foolproof method that an entity who is non-synthetic can detect the new, improved syn- thetic? For example, legend has it that vampires cast no reflection, no shadow, or ... COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this as a reference to the aura; that these entities who have no aura of magnitude. That the aura as that which is limited in size to a very small close thin aura, or only that which surrounds the heart. This Awareness indicates that with certain machines using processes similar to Kirlian photography, or with paionic machines, ent- ities can distinguish the synthetic from the real ent ity or from the robotoid. That without such, the entities cannot, except through sensitivity or ability to see auras, make such distinctions. This Awareness suggests that entities not become overly curious about things which they can do nothing with or about; or about things which, if they become too involved in, would simply cost them their lives. This Awareness reminds you of the saying that \"curiosity killed the cat.\" This Awareness indicates that it is one thing to become aware, it is another thing to know too much for your own good; for there are those who take great pains at preventing entities from finding out what is happening. This Awareness indicates that in order to continue to function upon this plane, entities must grow in wisdom and knowledge at a pace which is not too rapid, so as to draw too much attention; at a pace whereby entities can not be too outstanding, but whereby they can be on the cutting-edge of con- sciousness without protruding out beyond that edge. This Awareness indicates that It must withhold some information for the right time; that when It gives too much, trouble follows. This Awareness indicates that it is healthy to be curious, but it is also healthy to be patient and to be able to accept that which has been given, knowing that there is more which may come later. This Aware- ness does not intend to chastise anyone for question- ing, but rather wishes to explain why certain inform- ation often must not yet be released. That in retrospect, looking back at the information on the UFOs, wherein for approximately ten years entities were asking questions regarding the UFO's; if entities will recall the information released in that message regarding the UFOs and synthetics, they will now understand why this Awareness did not release this information ten years earlier. This Awareneao ind- icates that even when it was released, it lead to the loss ofapproximately one-third of the CAC member- ship, and to many questions, hostilities and other expressions of disbelief."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"This Awareness indicates that there are many areas which the human mind cannot conceive, refuses to examine, and would not believe, yet wants to know. This Awareness indicates that the area of robotoids, synthetics, and the intrigues of the government are very touchy areas which can cause problems, even though entities may, out of curiosity, wish to find out what they can. This Awareness indicates that curiosity is that which sets the thinking mind apart from the dull and thoughtless mind; yet curiosity, if not checked, can also be fatal. **** ED'S Note1 this particular reading was given in October, 1981, and today huge corporate mergers are still making news almost daily. One can only imagine how far this global plot, instigated by the Bolsheviks (Zionists) to set up their long-planned one-world government, will go. The pIan is to have two basic ciasses: the super-rich and the slaves to do all the work. Here in the U.S. it is becoming more obvious every day that the middle class is rapidly disappearing, millions of jobs are being eliminated, the unions are being broken and those in the working class who are lucky enough to have a job, often must take large wage reductions in order to keep it. Those in the upper, rich class are getting richer every year, according to the IRS statistics, richer mainly because of corporate greed, stomping out the competition and buying up its competitors so it can then charge the public the maximum for the goods it produces with cheap labor, robots and synthetic hwnans. There are many thing such as this that are taking place before our very eyes. One can only wonder what is taking place behind the scenes these days. The scenario which Awareness gave seven years ago appears to be still in motion, -- a credit to those conspirators like Rockefeller and Rothschild and their gangs who set the whole thing into motion many years ago. But if we are to believe Awareness, not to wow! For the head of the Beast has been severed, and what we see and read about daily is merely the wild thrashing of the various tentacles, mindlessly following orders from former ieaders whose heads can no longer give them. For more infonnation on robotoids and synthetics etc. please refer to the various back-issues catalogs published by CAC, starting with 79-1 (The Gathering Storm);S4.00; 79-18 (The Secret Mistory of the Illuminati); $3.00. Note: the staff of CAC and in particular, this editor, have never relished releasing information in regard to these synthetic humans,--the robotoids and the synthetics. One big reason is that it is dangerous to put out such infonnation; those who really hold the power in this nation do not want the public informed of what is going on. Secondly, as Awareness has just mentioned, CAC always loses some members each time we release a little bit more on this subject, and if CAC is to remain in the publishing business, particularly . at this present time, we simply cannot afford to lose anymore members. However, those of you who have been with US through those heavy years of 1979-1982 and who understand the Illuminati scheme and long for more information as to what is going on behind ' the scenes, --this is understandable, and we feel compelled at various times to release a little bit more. At this time we feel that much of the 'heat' has lessened on this subject, for like UFOs it is often dismissed as simply fantasy or indulged in by a small cult of followers. This is okay with us. I hope that you new members who have not bothered to read the \"Gathering Storm\" and subsequent follow-up material on UFOs and the rabotoids and synthetics, will accept the above reading and simlar information as fantasy, science-fiction or simply 'stretching the mind'. Like Awareness has indicated, there is nothing we can do about the situation (if indeed it is really true at ali), but to you many 'Synthetic Watchers' out there, we hope this type of inforrnation will help you to undentand a bit more of what is really happening in this nation today, and hopefully help you to read between the daily headlines of your newspapers or between the scenes on the 6:O'clock TV news. In regard to psionic devices, please refer to the CAC back issues catdogs for more information. More on this subject will be published later also. We also recom- mend the new book\"Psionics 101 \" by Chades Cosimano, published by Liewellyn Publishing Co., St. Paul, Minn. which is also available from CAC (current price $7.95 plus postage). This is a \"how to\" book on basic psionics that can be of much help in grasping and understanding this incredible subject. NEW PSIONICS HEALING PROJECT CAC is starting a specid Psionics Healing Project, by the way, and requests that those of you who are active in research and use of this method, to try to use your device to heal those afflicted with AIDS and other terminal illness, If you know of someone suffering from AIDS, for example, get a photograph of the entity, or use one of the many photos in the newspapers which are running stories and interviews on these unfortunate people, and place the photo in your pionic device, then amplify your thought of the AIDS virus suddenly leaving the entity's body, and glowing robust health returning to him. (It would help if you used one of those illustrations of the AIDS virus, which are published so often, and placing this over the picture of the entity and then whiting out every last one of the viruses in the illustration. This could help to amplify the healing effect.) Results on these experiments should be sent in to CAC which will periodically update the situation and pass any information gathered on to those who are interested in using this new method. Persanally, we feel this could be the answer to cancer and AIDS and other terminal type illnesses which allopathic medicine claims there is no cure. Of course, if karma is running and the entity is not $upposed to be healed of his affliction, even this psionics method, I suspect, will not work. However, this should not be the case with all patients by any means, so let's give it a good try.

Phone (304-659-2301). Gary i$ well-schooled in psionics and has used this method 9 farming and in healing. At one time he was selling a a unit called the Biotron which is used on humans and animals for healing.

Galen Hieronymus, who started it all with his famous Hieronymous black box, and the only place to get the '\"genuine\" Hieronymus device. (There are numerous copies on the market, which also probably work). Roth Agency, 8753 Windom Ave., St. Louis, Mo. 63114 offers a catalogue of hard to find books and unusual items, which includes black boxes and plans on how to buiId them. They also sell a book called ''Black Box and Other Psychic Generators\". Their catalogs will cost you so write first and ask for prices and infonnation. T & A Publications, Box 195, Hancock, Wisconsin, 54943, used to put out a catalog of books and devices available on psionics. Write them, they may still be in business.If not, let us know as we get new info from time to time from these outfits that sell this kind of information. The U.S. government, however, or an agent of the govern- ment, has in the past put these companies out of business on various charges. For obvious reasons there are some in positions of power in this country who do not wish this type of information be distributed to the masses. For one thing, if the method actually works as Awareness claims, it could actually be the long-awaited 'cure' for cancer and other heavy diseases, which of course would panic the entire medical profession and all thae many dmg and related industries that stay fat and rich on those thousands of unfortunate victims who die of these diseases every year. Also, the military, the CIA etc. are well aware of psionics and have been using these devices for years in a negative manner, utilizing the 'black magic' aspect of the Law of Conaopondence to eliminate their enemies and to create various diseases and other problems for various entities, cultures and nations. CAC member Jack Katchmar, has in fact uncovered a type of conspiracy in this field (not surprising). Jack purchased several psionic devices (Black Boxes) several years ago, sending one to the Interpreter Paul Shockley. Later, when Jack tried to contact the entities manufact- uring and selling the devices, they had vanished without a trace. He did an impressive Sherlock Holmes, writing agencies, police departments etc., but all traces of the people involved, including the factory where these were built, had vanished without a trace. Jack is convinced the CIA had them all murdered, which could very well be the case. However, like the Beast conspiracy, it is too late: too many people are aware of what is going on and too many people know about psionics and how to use the Black boxes. Such inform- ation can no longer be supressed and it is just a matter of time before this new technology will be applied to serving humanity, not wasting it in murder and other violations. Please nore: Gary Zuckett and other sources have told us that the best way to learn how to operate a black box in a safe and sane manner is to take the course available fro* those who sell the machines. This particulady from the two outfits in Lakemont, Ga., listed above. When you contaot these people, ask about the course and anything else they recommend for the successful use of a psionic device. According to Awareness, it is not even necessary for some entities to obtain a Hack Box, but can take a printed diagram of one and obtain the same results, placing the photograph of the subject to be healed on the printed diagram and then concentrating and visualizing and amplifying the healing thought, which will then bring about the healing action according to the Law of Correspondence. For CAC members wishing to experiment with the Hieronymus Black Box for healing, we will reproduce the actual patent Dr. Hieronymus was granted on his invention back in 1949. This reprint should act as a miniature 'Black Box' and could result in successful 9* hedings of entities afflicted with terminal illnesses such as AIDS. (We hope that lots of you CAC members will participate in this new healing project and keep us informed of the results of your experiments. Many thanks and best of luck to you all). (Avaton) MQRE ON THE \"LAW OF CORRESPONDENCE\" This Awareness indicates that an ancient axiom of Hermetics states: \"As above, so below.\" This Awareness indicates that in ancient times this Law of Correspondence was clearly understaod by entities because entities were not bombarded by thought, words and ideas to the extent that they are today in this present plane. This Awareness indicates \"As above, so below,\" to the ancient was a clear and meaningful experience. For prior to the multiplication of wards, where few words were used and the words were simple, entities knew how to look beyond the words at the meanings, whereby the words stood halfway between the seeker and the sought, and the words themselves were like signposts pointing toward a city, rather than the final destination for the quest- ioner as in present time, whereby the question is asked and the words are answered, and the answer is the final movement of the mind which perceives no further than the word which was given as an answer. This Awareness indicates that for the present mind, this Awareness shall elaborate on the true meaning of the Law of Correspondence: 'As above, so below.' As it is above, so likewise there is a corresponding action below. As it is within, so likewise there is a correspond- ing action without. As it is in the past, so liewise there shall be a corresponding action in the future and in the present. Yet these correspondences are not exact; are distorted, likened unto a reflective mirror which does not have a perfectly flat surface. This Awareness ind- icates that as the cycle of one level is in correspond- ence to the cycle of another level, so likewise the souls of one entity have a correspondence to the souls of humanity which make up the cells of the body of this ~wareness. - Natr: for an extended rap on this Law of Cwntpwdonco. please refer to (hb Cosmic Awamnnr Spiritual Dewlopmmt Courw.

According to Awareness, it is possible to place photographs on this diagram and amplify your healing thoughts being directed toward the entity in the photograph and effect a healing, without actually using a black box or other psionic type device.

HOW TO LOSE YOUR TALENTS ) QUESTION : There is a book out called New Age Bible Interp- retation, one of a series by Corinne Heline, and in this book she covers what she claims are the various physical results of karma created in a previous lifetime. I'd like Awareness to comment on some of these. She claims that the impediment of speech is the misuse of the sacred life force; an injury or loss of tongue is blasphemy, gossip, or betrayai of a sacred trust. The loss of a finger is the result of unfair and dishonest practices. The loss of hands is committing wanton destruction, as in wars. The loss of feet, walking in paths of wrong doing and leading others therein. Bodily deformity is the perpetration of cruelties, such as hideous punishments in the horror chambers or being one who tortured others during the inquisition and similar situations. Spinal trouble is using spiritual forces for purposes of black magic and so forth. Stomach and digestive troubles stem from gluttonous and debauched appetites. Heart trouble from intense selfish and personal love which failed to regard the welfare of others. Tuberculosis is caused by materidistic thinking and living; loss of sight is not seeing and accepting divine spiritual truths; loss of hearing stems from not hearing and accepting divine spiritual truths; arthritis or rheumatism from continued resentment, anger, and/or hate. That is the major list. Would Awareness please comment on this, and give some information on the karmic repercussions of past lives and the results in physical deformities or problems in another physical life experience that follows? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that these descriptions and definitions are correct in a limited sense; that not in every case however, can these afflictions be used for judging the karmic past of an entity. This Awareness indicates that this can often be associated with such past experience, but there are also other factors involved. This Awareness indicates that ob- viously, an entity who works in certain environmental areas which are dangerous will be, by statistical prob- abilities, more inclined to have an accident of one type or another than one who works in a totally different and more safe environment. That many of those entities in the safety of large offices, in the safety of their homes, who have directed wars and economic collapses, and whose activities have brought about pain and suffering to many,-these entities have neither missing limbs, nor the other problems which might be associated with violence toward others. This Awareness indicates that this appears to be much more complex than the book allows; that wherein an entity has an injury, the injury may occur due to the entity's own personal symbolic substitution for a karmic debt. The entity may, for example, feel a need to be more humble, and in so feeling may associate humility with kneeling and injure one's knee; or the entity may feel a need to be more humble, and in so feeling may sprain an ankle, so that the entity is laid up, unable to run around or move around with ease for a period. This Awareness indicates that an entity may also lose certain abilities by having not used those abilities in previous times when they should have been used. For example, an entity witnessing a fie to one's home, realizing that someone is trapped in one of the bedrooms, may wish to run in and rescue that entity, but may be so paralyzed with fear upon seeing the Names at the door, that they cannot bring themselves to run into that room through those flaming sheets and find the entity and rescue the entity; therefore, the entity may stand paralyzed, unable to move. Years later, or in another lifetime, the entity may find the legs be- coming paralyzed and unable to walk, and may not know why, or it may be attributed to some paralysis-type of disease. This Awareness indicates that another entity may experience paralysis from simply not having walked enough or used the legs because the entity wanted others to do the work for him, and became lazy. That in such an instance, the entity may begin to feel guilty at not doing his own walking and may begin to state that \"I am getting too weak to walk around,\" for this as a better excuse than to get up, walk around, or to have to admit that one is lazy, and also the entity may not wish to advit that he feels guilty; therefore, the entity covers over the guilt by saying, \"I am too weak.\" That as time passes, the entity may begin to believe that his legs are too weak and this becomes a covering for the laziness, and the entity actually becomes paralyzed and weak from the programming. This ~waren'ess indicates that there are different ways whereby entities manage to create limitations for themselves. That an entity may, for example, have a foot or hand cut off, not because of past liabilities or karma, but becautw the entity does not want to be thought of as a capable, and wishes to be afflicted in some way, (subconsciously of course), so that people won't expect too much from him, or from her; therefore, the entity creates an affliction of some type to prevent future expectations which would require performance from the entity when the entity does not wish to give. In such a case, the entity would not be suffering from past karma, but wouid rather be attempting to avoid future karma of work or performance by creating a present karma of losing an arm, leg, hand, or having some other affliction."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"(FOLLOW-UP QUES'rION): In that case just given by Awareness as an example, supposing an entity on a subconscious levei lost a hand or a foot; would there be any karma for this action in the following lifetime for this entity? COSMIC AWARENESS : This Awareness indicates that as the entity begins to wish to have that perfect health again in order to use that afflicted part in a wholesome way, the att- itude of the entity is that which would begin to build and allow the opportunity for regaining that limb, part, or talent. This Awareness wishes entities to understand also this not only relates to physical lirn bs and parts of the body, or general health, but also relates to talents, such as thinking, and to artist- ic, musical, and physical movement abilities. This Awareness indicates that for example, an entity who does not wish to be held responsible for any action, may simply begin \"playing\" dumb, or pretending ignorance, so that all he or she needs to do is follow orders, and pass the buck of responsib- ility to whoever gave the orders. That in continuing this action over long periods of time, the entity not only appears to be ignorant, but will in fact create ignorance in his or her own thinking mechanisms. That likewise, an entity who has a gift, such as the ability to sing, or speak before crowds, the ability to dance or to perform gymnastics or other sports, and the entit.y does not develop these talents or use these taients; then in time, the ability begins to wane, and the entity over a period of time, may lose that ability, --this likened unto having the ability amputated from their consciousnesc; and their expression. That in order to regain that ability, the entity must begin by re-exercising and working those muscles, those parts, those energies and attitudes which would again allow the entity to have strength to perform the talent which was once present, but which had atrophied from non-use. (FOLLOW-UP QUESTION): One other question in reference to the atrophy of talents: Is there any distinction made for the reason why they are not used for some time? For example, if somebody is not making use of some talent because they are otherwise occupied in work that seems more important at the time, as opposed to someone who is just simply lazy and not doing it? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that it takes a great deal of time to develop a talent. It takes a greater deal of time to lose that talent; that talents are not lost easily. They need to be neglected for some time, and may in fact need to be violated in order to rid oneself of a particular talent. This Awareness indicates that an entity may be able to sing well while young. At the age of 50, if the entity has not Oafad JANWIT HUSlLIR I -- - -- --- .1 sung between childhood and that time, the entity's singing voice will still be there, but may not be nearly as good as before. That with practice, how- ever, the entity may again find himself, or herself capable of developing a reasonably good singing voice. This Awareness indicates however, that wherein an entity goes for an entire lifetime avoiding sing- ing out of fear or some other reason, the entity may cakry over into the next lifetime a feeling of avoid- ance toward singing, and if in middle life someone asked the entity to \"get up and sing with us\", and the entity is forced by circumstances to attempt to sing, the entity may simply be so blocked from so many years of not singing, that the entity becomes terrified and fearful, and the event itself can make the future singing activity even more traumatic than it would have been if the event had not occurred. Therefore, talents may be lost by misuse or may be blocked by circumstances which cause the entity to fear the expression of a particular talent. ?'his fear need not be based on justified neasons;This Awareness indicates that particularly a talent which is available to an entity, and wherein the use of that talent can be beneficial to others but it is not used for selfish purposes, or to deny others, in such a manner as to create a subconscious guilt within the entity for not having used that talent: this is the type of action which is most conducive to causing a loss of the ability to perform. For example, an entity who can hear the needs of another, but wants to avoid hearing such, and while remaining with the other may refuse to listen, but feels guilty at not listening, or maybe doesn't feel guilty until something happens to that entity and the happening causes the entity then to feel guilty for not having listened,--this kind of action may lead the entity to subconsciously program himself or herself not to be able to hear, and the talent or ability to hear may be lost in this, or a future lifetime because of the guilt involved. This Awareness indicates that guilt and fear are the two greatest enemies of entitiess expression. *** REVELATIONS OF AWARENESS is r cosmic newlrtter, ublirbd for the mornburhip of Carmlc Awrnnru Communlcrtlanr, L the 6nhnml Church of Awtrd~u.

It is possible for entities to gather energy them- selves, to move into other frequency levels, to some degree, in a kind of astral travel or out-of-body exper- ience in which you inhabit some other plane of existence such as moving into the land of limbo, or moving into some astral plane. or into higher 1eveIs. This Awareness indicates that these travels, even out of body, have certain dangers irivolved and this Awareness does not recommend that entities do this without some clear and precise understanding or guidance in these actions for it is possible for entities to project themselves into an area in which there are negative forces which would be most hazardous to one's being. The Goblin Universe This Awareness indicates that in regard to this which has been called a goblin universe, wherein there are beings on many different levels of existence, or what Jesus spoke of as the many mansions in his Father's house, or what John Keel spoke of as the resonating electromagnetic scale in which these frequencies all inhabit similar space, but do not interfere with each other's existences, so that there are beings inhabiting the same space without the knowledge of each other; there are spacecraft flying through the same space, but on different frequencies so that they do not inter- fere with each other, do not even touch each other though they pass through the same time and space simultaneously. This Awareness indicates that this kind of reality is that which would be totally incon- ceivable to your grandparents in the early part of this century for example, but that humanity is now reach- ing a time in which the mind is capable of perceiving new realities and new understanding, thus the oid philo- st~pii~es whrt ii %err: ao liong rmlid &li, itte bec.i~a:~iilg some- ki.lat c:~irtrcttfed *is the IMIH~ p~iugrt:~es in its urnder- st ;indi~g iilltl 111 d?, k~t*~t+t.q)t iim of rie* realities= 'I'flc oi:i ph:-itcs rtP )anger arlswcrs cjtft?stionb that licwcl plagued manirintl rtrlrf have never properly bt~n arrswered, in regard to such things as ghc>sts and goblins and si~perilalural tlsiligs, for the old philosophy, the old physics was never capable of a~~swexing these quest- icms because they were incomplete; they were based soleIy on the senses, the tree of knowledge, the fruit of the tree of knowledge, and these senses, the organs of perception are not satisfactory to answer the quest- ions relating to the more subtle leveh of reality. This Awareness indicates therefore, as entities become nsore perceptive, looking beyond that reality presented By the senses, that facade, or iilusiun presented by the senses, to those new Ievels of realit,y which have been probed by new technologies, wherein, for example, the microscope points to the reality of minute and tiny beings that lie beyond the sight of humanity, or frequen- cies and sounds that lie beyond the hearing of humanity, wherein these technologies and new devices that extend the senses and perception and knowledge of man, allows new informat.ion to come in to the mind, which in turn requires a different way of looking at reality. Thk Awareness indicates that this new extension brought in through scientific and technological advances is that which is forcing humanity to go beyond the tree of knowledge, the knowledge given by the five senses to see that which is invisible to the eyes, which lies beyond the hearing range, which is beyctnd feeling and touch, to that which is the new reality, ft is in fact the OM reality, but it is new to mankind when mnznakind is used to Ioak- ? ing at the illusion given by the five senses, This Awareness indicates that in lor-king more towards this new reality of the Aqnarian Age, in which the mind yescsives things that are higher and beyond the 5 senseb, those questions vhieh have not been answerable in the past, relating to superr~atural eirerats, supernatural things, become answerable in a manner that appears logical. If one says there is no way Ihat a being can appear and dis- appear in front of you, and it nrust be nothing more than your imagination, and a person believes that his senses are truthful and sees an entity appear or disappear, that entity must conclude, logically, that his mind played a trick on him, but if the entity understands that there are n~ultileveled existences in the universe, and different freq. uencies produce different events for different dimensions in the same time and space, then indeed the disappearance or appearance of a being is no longer an impassibility and the mind may not be playing tricks if one sees such a thing happening. This Awareness indicatt?~ that television is a miracle and is impossible to the mind of the 15th century.

This Awareness suggests that you visualize what may occur in the next 400 years, if not sooner in regard to holograms and the use of techuology."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"The 'Holoph~sre' of the Future *i It may very well be quite possible that it] the future tmme, when you pick up the telephone to speak to your friend, your friend will appear in a holoy.am fcsrm before you, in the room with you, Itlay even sit on a chair in your room, thoirgh the chair would have to be rnatchialg the chair elsewhere in a similar spot, This Aware~less indicates that the entity may still be thousands of n~iles away, but the camesas may project this energy or image of the entity into your home through receiving cameras, so that the entity appears to be there while you speak with them. This Awareness indicates that this is an impossibilitj in your time, but it is dso seen as a possibility in future times, and entities can understand and perceive that possibility, knowing that technology does produce strange things. Technology is much today as magic was in older times. This Awareness indicates that the mind may not he such an outmoded form of technology. The mind may actually be Ear ahead of any technotog- icaI device know at this time in terms of its ability to see and transmit information from a distance, but the mind, if it does not understand its ability to do so, is not likely to do it. You cannot create a full house from a deck of cards if yuu do not know what a full house is, or have a deck of cards to play with; that once you know the rules and you know the definition, and you understand the game, the mind then becomes capable of doing some- thing. It is the same with anything. If the mind does not understand it can do something, it doesn't try, and if it did accidentally do something, it wouldn't recog- nize the significance of its work anvway. That Monkey Eventually Typing Hamlet? This Awareness indicates there has been that state- ment that if you have enough monkeys typing on typtl- writers for long enough, they would eventually come up with a great novel or story or play. They would eventually come up with the story of Hamlet. Well, that may or may not be, for you may be speaking of an eternity of typing to get the monkeys to finally match that story of Hamlet. The odds are enormous that it would not happen for eons of time, however, it is possible that they would conle up wit,h the story of Hamlet eventually, and not recognize it and continue typing so that the story went right on out the window, unoticed. This Awareness indicates so it is if entities do not know what to look for, what they are capable of or what their potentials are, they are not going to recog- nize or know how to create something, or how to value something once it is created, even if it is created by accident. Therefore, it is important that entities be able t.o evolve mentally beyond the perception that relies solely on the five senses and look at energies in consciousness, Looking at these energies in conscjousness, to perceive an energy that is behind an action, behind an event, behind a circumstance, behind a behavior; the energies that lie beyond the present instance, the ener- gies that lead to outgrowth of events, the energies that lie behind the movement or motivation or intent of a person; in looking at these energies that are the cause of the event, entities will become more able to under- stand a new reality, a deeper reality. They become more aware. I,ikewise, as r,~ntities begin to notice patterns, ~adtterris that create, patterns that ape trsad lox creation, patterns that are dt.veloped and reused over and over, to get a rertain effect; In real estate they call this the cookie-cutter; wherein an entity uses a same system time after time to make money, repeating the same system in different real estate deals. There are patterns that. entities can develop to use for creative purposes, for writing, for doing artwork or whatever; there &re patterns of behavior that are used repeatedly in differ- ent scenarios, or different situations, but entities need to become aware of the patterns so they are not just haphazard events or unconscious movements. Why Same Get so Close! to Succeeding--Then Fail ! Entities also need to become aware of those patterns whkh block and hinder their success. Why is it that some entities get SO close to succeeding, only to have it ripped from them at the last moment, and this may become a pattern that repeats itself over and over for the entity. There is something happening subconsciously, some- thing which the entity is not aware of, does not want to look at, does not want to became aware of, a pattern that is occurring in the erncttional or subconscious level, which the entity wishes to avoid looking at, but which causes the entity much loss and failwe. It is important that entities not look only at the outer and surface features of an event or circumstances, but to learn to took behind, at those patterns, whether they are patterns that benefit or patteri~s that hinder, to find out what is going on behind the scenes, and to use thase which dre beneficial, and to undo and unlock and break those patterns which are harmful and find some kind of substitute for these harmful patterns that work more favorably. That in this kind of deeper conscious looking rather than sensual looking, wherein you peer behind the energies, behind the circumstances and see the causal energies rather than just the effects, wherein you look more deeply, this kind of looking, of deeper look- ing, as that which multiplies ycrur awareness levels and gives you insight that is lacking by others, gives you the ability to have the sight to see in the land of the blind. Opening Up the Third Eye This Awareness indicates that this deeper looking is likened unto having new vision, new insight, and it is an advantage. You are likened unto the entity who has one eye in the land of the blind, and it is alright for you to he able to see, It is not that you should feel guilty at having insight when others don't have the insight. It is not right that a person who has one eye in the land of the blind should put out that eye in order to have no advantage over others. What k right is that the enl. ity use that advantage to help thase who cannol see, and to help oneself, not to the disadvantage to the others, but to benefit all. This Awareness indicates that as you become more aware and gain greater insight into reality, you can become an agent for the higher ronsciouslzess, the higher realities, to serve others, to serve them well, and to help them find their insight, to help them open their eye, their third eye, to see beyond the senses, to see beyond the illusion of the five senses. ?'his Awareness indicates that there is no need to fear the goblins of the universe, for they are all just aspects c;f conscious-"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"ness; ewn if they tarrglbie, they are sljDl just aspects *' of' ct~nscioucness, and ilo aspeci hab ucly gredter power than any other unless that oths'r att:il~tibls~ greater power to it.

This Awareness indicates that as your awareness increases, so does your effectiveness as a Universal Being. THE LEGEND OF THE GOLEM: CAN WE ACTUALLY CONJURE Speaking of strange heinks, I ran across a reference I'd like tci read to Awareness on the Goiem and then comment. A galem is a creature, especially a buman being, credted artificially by magic. In the late Jowish form of the legend, as told by Jakob Srimrn in his Jriurntrr! of ficrrriilr (I 9081, the goiem is the f~gure of a man, made of clay or mud, and brought to life when the miraculous name of God is pa- nounced over ir. The golem is dmb (though other versions of fhe leqend do credlt it wlth the power of speech) but ~t can understand orders and 1s used as a servant to do the housework. It must never be allowed to leave the house. On its forehead is written the word cni tth (truth). With every day that goes by, the golem gains weight and it grad- ually becomes bigger and stronger than anyone in the house, until they become afraid of it. They then rub out the first letter of the word on its forehead, altering it to ~ncth (he is dead). The gole~n imnlediarely coiIapses and turr:s back into its eather ciay form once aqaialn. One nidn's golen~. according to Grirnm, grew so tall chat its forehead Bas too high to reach. Its c:;rner ordered tho golem to take off its bcots, so that whel. I* bent down he would be dbie to reach its forehead. The golem did as kt was told, and the owner succeeded in erasing the first fetter but the mass of dead cby fi?:l on top of him and crushed him. The Hebrew word poien; t~t~citrs .me in the Qtd Tat- mrent (Pmirn 5 39, 161, where ~t rneatls a human being which is not yet fully formed, an embryc. In the Talmud (the oldest exrant code of Jewish idw) the word IS used once for Adam's Lady dziriny the first haurs of ~ls existence bur before it wds fixlly endowed mt!i life and consciausness. Elsewhere jn the Talmud the word is used to denote an uncultured, boarish man. In medieval Hebrew the word was used as a technical philosophical term ecpi~Ient to the Greek hll!~. that rs hylic matter, matter vvitilout fm, BnIy at a much later stage was the ward gulem asscxlated wah magical traditicns abaut the pasnbility lrzf creating human and other being by means of formulae, divine names, and permutations and cambinations of Hebrew letters, 'fie refis~ence to the Jrpjtr )IL'~FIT(I~ (the Bouk of Creation) ~nrili:ltes the rdslye crf ideas drici concepts underlying the theory of the magical creation d living beings. These ideas go back 1x1 part to Talmudic notions concerning the creative power of the letters af the name of God or ~f the Hebrew letters in general. In the circle of Jewish mystics of the 12th-13th can- tuies known as the 'Hasidim of Germany' these concept- ions gave rise to a mystical rite of creating a golem. There is little doubt that this ritual, in spite of its magical char- acter, did not serve any materialist purpose (such as creating a robat servant) but was essentially a spiritual experience fraught with symbolic meaning. What was essentially a mystic-symbolic ritual in the circles of the German Hasidim soon became a subject for popular folklore and legend. Concurrently the galem tw became an actual creature serving his master and fulfilling menial and other tasks laid upon him. Leyends of this kind were fairly widespread among German Jews after the 15th century and came also to be known among nonJews; Goethe's Sorcerer's Apprentice is indebted to the golem legend. I'd like to ask Awareness if It would dissertate or expand on this information on the Golem, and if this information is valid? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that the information in general as that which has certain levels of validity; that the Colem was not that which was told in the first part of the story, being made of clay that comes to life. It is more that of the earlier description af the liebrew, whereby it symboiizes the unformed being, the fetus, not fully formed into human shape. This Awareness indicates however, it, also has another meaning that lies beyond that which was of the Heb- rew understanding of the time. you will recall that in earlier readings this Aw arenes spoke of Jehovah as having btwn a space renegade. This Awareness indicates that Jehovah as having been a kind of space renegade ixiveler or wanderer travelling around the uniberse, not being allied with the F:lohim or Gods, hut onc who was what may be termed arr immortal in a sense because the entity did live an extremely long life in comparison to human lives; this being approximately 6000 years. This entity as having come from the Orion area, and the entity as having set up a kind of experimental station on Nlars in which he cloned or created humanoids for replant- ing on the earth. In other words, that which is told of the Garden of Eden as that which took place on Mars and the transplant of Adam and Eve, his clones, on the earth along with other clones as that which is the basis for the stclry of Genesis."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"This Awareness indicates lhi in reference to the d latter part of the Book of Gerresis. The first ICR w erses in the first chapter uf Genesis refers to the Elol-tim, but the latter sections of that chapter and further chapters relates to Jehovah as one who was involved in genetics and experimentation, and the cloning operation. This Awareness indicates that the unformecl clone as that which was not yet completed as a human being or the appearance of a human being, was called by that name. The name then later, in Hebrew was applied to the unfinished or incomplete formation of the fetus. This Awareness indicates that this in the later period, prior to and around the time of the Renais- sance, became a term which took on new meaning, because there was much focus and belief in the power of words for creating and using magic. This Awareness indicates that the magicians and alchemists of t.he time believed in the use of magical words for conducting spells or for manifesting or for bringing good luck, etcetera. This Awareness indicates that indeed this did have its proper effect according to their beliefs, as does most anything work in terms of effective- ness if it is bdieved strongly enough. One person could use such terms and get nothing, whereas a strong believer, using such terms could actually produce some kind of result because the subconscious would have the firm strong belief that the words were powerful . This Awareness indicates that these entities at that time in experimenting with the power of words for manifesting and conjuring, reached further than they were capable of reaching in terms of such power. Of course this belief was not strong enough to actually conjure up a real being, but it was sufficient to create the legend and the stories of conjuring-up beings by the use of certain names and these stories, just as do many legends today, were repeated by others as fact. This Awareness indicates that it is simply the nature of the mind, that when some new technology comes along, whether it be magical words or computers, that entities extend their imagination as far as possible in that technological field in the belief that someday, if they work in this direction far enough, they will be able to do certain things that are beyond normalcy. This Awareness indicates that there has always been the question of how things came into existence, and therefore, the belief from Biblical teaching that God took and molded man from clay, along with the belief that certain words were powerful and could accomp- lish magical feats, combined to give this story its existence and foundation. This Awareness indicates actually, it has no found- ation in fact. This Awareness suggests however, that it is possible for entities to conjure up beings, just as was proven in the light-energized effort of the group who conjured up Phillip as has been mentioned in previous discussions by this Awareness. It is possible, that in conjuring up Phillip, had these entities put more enexgy and sustained the energy over periods of time, such as perhaps years, that Philip would actually be able to materialize before them, for psychic energy creates thought-forms and those thought-forms create magnetic centers, md those n~agnetii: centers draw eaergyfY, and if there is desciriptlue energy given in tlne thought-fi)rri>s, tllat de~criptike energy begins to form shapes end appar- itions which can be evenl.uallv seen bg those who, strongly enough, wiIl their vision into existence. 'Phi Awareness indicates thst in earlier times, there was much more of this than naw. It was not uncommon for entities to see spirits and ghosts and apparitions, because entities in earlier times had greater psychic energy and had more time and had more simp- licity in their lives to devote more time and more energy to these things, and wherein there was great emotional focus, such as the emotional love for a person or the great guilt one might have in having harmed ar killed another; such entities might very easily see the loved one or the violated one and see them clearly as apparitions. This Awareness indicates that these things can take form. It is possible for entities to conjure up beings. It is rare and it is not advised. This Awareness indicates that in thest, more modern times this has become less common, because entities have been taught that it is a31 superstition, that it is unreal; that there are no ghosts. If your mind does not believe these things, it will not put forth the effort to bring these things about. That in many ways, this has been a blessing; that entities whose, minds are blocked in terms of creating super- natural essences, are more fortunate than those whose! minds ;ire involved in such action but act without; full understanding of the dangers and obligations involved in such conjuring, This Awareness iatdicatss that wherein an entity conjures something into existence in his or her Iife, he or she had better know what they are doing and have enough personal discipline and not conjure up something that would he harmful to themselves, that could turn on them or on their loved ones. This Awareness ind- icates today there are many who conjure up images of Satan and they think that this is fun. They think that they have some kind of control over this image of Satan which they conjure up, but too often, that which ent- ities conjure up, as in the story of Frankenstein, turns on them and they become victims of their own con- juring' It You Must Conjure, Conjure the Highest & Best This Awareness suggests that if you are going to conjure something, it had better be that of the highest and best. This Awareness has indicated to people there are those who come to this Awareness with the belief that they can somehow devour this Awareness, but even as they seek to devour this Awareness, they find them- selves being devoured by levds of Awareness. It is in this manner, if erttities seek to devour Awareness that they themselves can grow into higher levels of aware- ness, but this Awareness warns entities to be most cautious about trying to devour those lower beings, those lower essences; that the entities who tamper with and seek to devour energies of the socalled myth of Satan will find t.hemse1ves being devoured by those energies. This Awareness indicates that Satan does not exist as reality, but as myth, but entities can use those myth- ical energies and can be caught by the mythical energies, even as much as an entity can imagine a ghost and be"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"7 terrified by the ghost imagjned and in that terrifying experience may suffer real consequences. This Awerret- ness indicates that the mind needs much understanding. It is a tool of much greater versatility than anyone has yet imagined, and it has been limited by the influence and structure of the teachers in philosophy, religion, political and educative fields, for thousands of years, to be held in a kind of mold, so that it does not expose its full potential, because it is so far undiciplined and its full potential is capable of creating monsters or creating gods. The mind needs to have direction, needs to have discipline before it gets involved in creating in itsf uli potential. WILL AWARENESS TELL US HOW TO TO DO IT? (FOLLOW-UP QUESTION): Is Awareness going to suggest some simple beginning training exercises along this line at some point? COSMIC AWAREWm: This Awareness is not at this time planning to give this kind of information, because entities are not yet ready to understand and express the creative energies capable of the mind. Entities need fist to discipline themselves in such a manner as to be able to discern what is Highest and Best in their lives and in that dis- cernment, to relate the Highest and Best to the needs of others as well as to themselves. This Awareness wishes at this time simply to allow entities to understand that there is a great potential out there, when they are disciplined, mentally, spirit- ually, emotianally, This Awareness can work with individuals who are ready. This Awareness indicates that too many entities are looking for the results and are not ready to put forth the discipline that is necess- ary to properly reach those results. This Awareness indicates that this discipline, the self-discipline, wherein one surrenders WH to that which is Highest and Best without expectation; this prepares the entity for that future use of the mind. This Awareness reminds you of the entity who wrote, asking that this Awareness give them the great psychic powers to read, to understand, to know every- thing, and to have healing powers and to become a spiritual master, and the entity indicated: \"I have sent in my money for this reading, and I want this, and I want it NOW!\" This Awareness indicates there are too many entities who have this kind of attitude. It does not come in this manner. You cannot pay for this kind of understanding. It is not something this Awareness can give you. It is something that develops, as you give yourself to this Awareness. *** ED'S Note: In reference to 'the new reality' in physics; for a more practicaI exploration into this subject, we recommend the book, \"The Goblin Universe,\" by Ted Holiday, with introduction by Colin Wilson, published by Llewellyn Publications, St. Paul, Mn. 55164.

This Awareness indicates that the aliens have made greater and greater demands over the years and much of the money from different projects of a secret nature has been given to the aliens for their own projects; that even a considerable amount of the drug money and money which was raised through clandat- ine means by that which has been termed the Shadow Government, was used to support the aliens and their projects. There is essentially, a considerable number of underground bases, a network of tunneis; there are also underseas bases belonging to the aliens, some of these having both human and alien personnel involved. This Awareness has given some of this informati061 previously during the late 70's; that you may wish to refer back to some of those earlier readings. This Awareness suggests that in recapping and refocusing on this information regarding the aliens, entities can gain a clearer understanding of what in fact is occurring in the world today that is causing this great change to occur around the globe, leading to an almost immediate global community of democratic reforms throughout those countries of the Eastern nations and leading to a greater unification of all countries. It is of such mag- nitude that entities are in awe. All of this having occurred in but a few short weeks of time. This Awareness indicates that it is due to a crisis that has been hidden from the masses which calls for extreme concern by your leaders, the concern being realized when those new aliens traversed from the pass- ing craft to the earth during the summer of '89, and the realization that the asteroid was not an asteroid in fact, but a small planetoid housing individuals from another culture. This Awareness indicates these entities being from the area of Orion; that details relating to these entities and their particular planet as being discussed in earlier readings of this Awareness, approximately 10 years ago; that also the work of Cooper recently released, gives further reference to their origin. This Awareness indicates that because of this, you are likely to see a greater and greater prosperity and harmony on this plane among humans, earthlings, as the governments become more mobilized and prepaxd for the potential of conflict with the aliens if this should erupt. This Awareness wishes to comment on the sugg- estion of a possible reconciliation, but this Awareness does not see this as being without considerable difficulty because of the extremes in the diiferences between these cuitures and also because the cultures are inherently reliant on forces for solving conflicts; however, this Aware neas suggests also that there are seen other factors that This Awareness indicates another factor which may be of significance in the future has to do with the aliens having the ability to create underground eities with their devices and technology so that they could move large populations under the earth's crust and hardly be noticed by those of the surface level, which could be another way of avoiding conflict with humans on the surface. The problems with this have to do with the concerns that aliens have a certain reliance on the use of substances available only from humans and animals and preferably humans, as the food supply; this in reference to blood. Certain of these entities, partkularly the insect-based types which rely hrgely on the use d blood for their energies, along with the intake of light in forming chlor- ophyll, these entities have a specific and absolute need for some blood for their health and vitality levels. This Awareness indicates that the entities do not need to extract, nor are they of such bestial levels as to extract all d the blood from an individual, except in rare cases, therefore, they often perform certain medical examin- ations and alm extract mall amounts of blood for their own purposes, then returning the abductae after erasing the memory of the event. The entity, having lost a small amount of blood would not even be aware of the loss of blood. This Awareness indicates that there are also those cattle mutilations in which all of the blood is drained from the animal and the animal left dead. The use of cattle blood as that which has to do with certain emer- gency supplies these entities require and use. This Aware- ness indicates that all of this is understood by entities within your government, certain agencies and individuals. It is information that your government has prevented the masses from knowing, and there have been entities who have been kid for disclosing portions or threaten- ing to disclose even portions of such information, This Awareness indicates that tbe fear is that the people would panic and the government could not respond to the fears of the peaple having no weapons of effectiveness to counter the alien threat, particularly at the time when this all began. This Awareness ind- icates however, that there has, in recent times, been a realization by those within these agencies that they cannot handle the problem themselves and some of them beiieve it is time the public understood. Some believe it is time the masses were told. Others feel the masses would be hostile and furious with the govern- ment agencies for not revealing the information sooner, and therefore, they still think perhaps they could keep the information secret awhile longer and deal with the I. aliens undercover without the masses knowing any- thing was happening,"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"0 Sornle even beilevt: tlrdf. cl:ej c vtiltJ he ,xvrei sd~ with the aliens without the art,is~.~,fis rter avea krrosi 2316 d if, if it bwaxne necetss;sr.y Tlth %~i'arr%~it?~ irdirates that during the next few months, after February, more information will be allowed to be released to the public and the danger of having such information or disclosing such information will be much less risky and dangercjt~s.

The Deros being from an ancestrd stock that goes back several thousands of years to a time prior to Atlantis, wherein Orion, having had its great computer in the area known as the Unholy Six, also had created on earth a computer in the subterranean levels, which served to link the civil- ization counterparts together. Those entities in the subterranean levels on earth became more and more demented and resulted in what were later termed the Dero types.

This then will add greater clarif- ication to the William Cooper material and vice versa. For even more understanding, It suggests entities read the previous material given regarding the Unholy Six and the underground subterranean information which this Awareness gave in the Iate 70's and early 80's. This Awareness indicates that this may also include those readings relating to the robotoids and synthetics; that these were the product of genetic engineering, which was a technology available through the aliens, given to humans; that even the robotoids and synthetics and that information, wiil now have some better found- ation when recognized its origin as that of a technology from these entities. This Awareness indicates that it should also be noted that much of the high technology of the com- puterized systems received some wistance from the technology of these aliens, and that there are also certain other technologies received from aliens which have not been brought out publicly as yet. AIso, entities who have a copy of the Stan Deyo book, Cosmic Conspiracy, as those entities who will gain a new understanding of that information in light of this alien factor. This Awareness indicates the book Cosmic Conspiracy of Stan Deyo as that which has been most difficult to find, and may yet be unavailable except through sheer luck. ED'S Note: Information on the Unholy Six and robtoids and synthetics can be found in the following 'Revela tion of Awareness' newsletters: 79-18 (Cosmic History of the Zlluminati); 79-25 (Secret of the UF&),$4.00; 80-14; 81. -9;85-1; each $3.00 from C.A.C.

Anyone interested, please contact Vikki T. or send in your This Awareness indicates that this could be pub- lished, presented more for those who wish to pursue this further. This Awareness indicates that there is very little value in that infarmation except as satisfy- ing those who are a bsessed and curious about the ent- ities; that essentially, the general information regard- ing robotoids as that which has already been released, except in regard to the link between the aliens and the robotoid factor. This Awareness indicates that many entitias who have not been with your organization for a long period of time will find this to be quite unusual and disturbing perhaps. These entities could be referred to the Dr. Beter information for further information on robotoids. There is very little real value in pursuing this, and this Awareness does not encourage entities to pursue research that only satisfies curiosity in regard to its having to do with bizmian. However, because these things have some effect on the potential future of individuals, this Awareness-brings out the infarmatian in a general sense. This Awareness prefers that entities have the gend overview and not become obsessed with details regarding rabotoids or synthetics or any of this bizarre information just because it is biearre and may have some curiosity to know all the details, such as: \"What do robatoids eat for breakfast?\" and so forth. That these things are of little significance. What is of significance is that there is an influence acting upon the affairs of humans which entities know little or nothing about which have many ram- ifications and is behind much of what you see in the news which is never mentioned, and it is this factor of this unseen hand or unseen influence that this Awareness wishes entities to become aware of. It does not wish to engage in disputes, arguments or questions dealing with the miniscule details of some bizarre aspect here or there, just to satisty some mental curiosity, or obsession that an entity might devdop. There are certain mentalities that tend to focus not on the overview or on the significance of something but an some miniscule detail and they become obsessed with knowing everything about that particular detail, in order to become some kind of expert or something, and this is not the purpose this Awareness has for giving this information. This Awareness does not particularly wish to deny information, but It does not wish to focus on information that is irrelevant to the main purpose ox Itti commun~cation on this plane.

Whether this @an occur or not will depend livgely on flexibility, This Awareness indicates that many of the movies on television today are play- ing out different potential scenarios for the future. For example, the Alien Nation series as that which is playing out the potential far a coexistence of aliens and humans working together. The War of the Worlds series is playing out the pot- ential for conflict with the aliens, and represents a rather valid approach in describing the nature of the aliens, referring not only to their strange appearances, their living underground, but also to their use of creating replicas of humans.

Awareness just indicated this body was deposited by aliens, and therefore it must have no relation to that battle. Is that correct? COSMIC AWARENESS: This as in the affirmative; that the Battle of the Harvest Moon as that which took place approximately 8 to 9 years later. This Awareness indicates however, that there were colonies oil the moon prior to 1969 and that this entity was a member of one of those colonies. The entity alsa having been in military garb; that the entity was an engineer. This Awareness ind- icates it appears the entity as having been one who, as an engineer, was not a willing participant, saw him- self as a prisoner and was uncooperative in many ways, and because of this, was seen as a trouble-maker and removed and slain and his body taken elsewhere. This Awareness indicates that during that first flight, the flight which landed on the moon, there was some accompaniment by a UFO spacecraft of these aliens, accompanying the craft, part of the way. It was instructed to watch the craft and if necessary to assist, to make sure the mission was successful. THE LAW OF EXAMPLE ----- --.---- TIiE LAW OF EXAMPLE states that any person, concept or thing which is placed in a position of significance, may serve as an example for others to foIlow. Those who have served as examples of power, lust and greed, have helped to create the tragedies which they and their followers have spawned. Those who have served as examples of love, service, and the sharing of their better parts, have helped to bring about freedom, joy, beauty and peace that has been allowed upon this plane. Entities who wish a better world are cautioned to exemplify and portray only those better qualities of love, joy, peace and service to others, particularly to the children who are searching for examples in their world.

MORE FLESH FOR THE SKELETON (PART 2 (C.A.C. General Reading, April 4,1990) WHAT IS MAKING THOSE MYSTERIOUS CIRCLES IN THE FIELDS OF ENGLAND 7 QUESTION: This is a question sent in by quite a few people. 1'11 read this one from T.H. in Wisconsin: \"A story that appeared in the September 18, 1989, issue of TIME magazine tells of 'strange, circular depressions, up to 100 feet in diameter' that have appeared in crop fields in the farmlands of southern England. The first recorded sighting of these circles took phce in 1976. Since 1980, when serious research into the mystery began, more than 600 occurrences have been reported in Britain, including almost 250 this year. In addition, there have been reports of circles from as far away as the Soviet Union, Japan and New Zealand, but by far the greateqt number have appeared in an area d southern England that is near to Stone- henge and Avebury. Dr. Terence Meaden, a physicist, who has been tracking the formation since 1980, spec- ulates that the circles come from a previously unknown form of atmospheric disturbance with associated elec- trical effects. He contends that a 'spinning ball of airt that is highly charged with electricity hits the crop field and marks out circle. But, the TIME reporter asks, how could wind produce such carefully scu2pted creations? Others have speculated that these circular formations are being caused by UFOs. Would Aware- ness please look at this situation and explain what is causing these circles and why?\" I- IN THIS ISSUE ----' * *-I . . What is Making Those Mysterious Circles in England? Page 2.

This Awareness reminds you that gome several years ago, this Awareness indicated that the United States, Britain, and Russia as well as Argentina and Brazil had UFO craft available to them.. To a much lesser degree the Brazilian government as having had some effort in this direction from a captured ship; that there is not seen any military holding of such in terms of a flyable or usable craft. Robert Lazar and His Experiences in Area 51 This Awareness indicates that in the past few months considerable information has been released by the entity Robert Lazar relating to his involvement as a scientist working in Area 51 in Nevada, wherein he was engaged and involved in the facilities of the government testing alien space craft; that this indeed was aired on Nevada television news in which this entity described not only the works in which he was involved, and the location and the activities that were occurring there, but he also explained why he was telling this to the public; that he Pelt it was essential that people knew what was going on. He also felt it was extremely important that scientists be involved in this work; that he himself was less qualified than many others for the work, but he felt that he was hired because he had few close relatives and could be controlled. The entity, describing the kind of controls they used on their scientists as being very heavily into brainwash techniques, frightening them, such as holding guns to their head to intimidate them and keep them from discussing anything other than what they were supposed to discuss; the entity, being fairly young, became rebel- lious and upon leaving, began telling the world. This entity then, in giving out the information, even took others to the area, this private property overlooking the area, to show them the spacecraft being tested at one o'clock in the morning, knowing the approximate"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"times when these tests would cxtcuu, Wilhlrn a few days there were several hundred people sitting out khure on that hi11 waiting fc~r the tirant?, r,j.~can ~rbiaiciirsie: rEle itcct'ur- rence of the tests.

This Awareness suggests that the entity became aware at this point that he was bein made into a non-person for the purpose of being e f iminated as a threat or as a viable source of information. However, further evidence by the reporters invest.ig, ating his story turned up his name in the records of the company where it had not been taken out; this in refer- ence to newspaper articles or the newsletter relating to the company; that there is a video of much of this in- formation as it was broadcast on televsion and that this as circulating in certain UFO circles* \"ED'S Note: CAC has a copy of this video, which consists of a nightly series of UFO stories researched and presented by the staff of KLAS-TV (Channel 8), Las Vegas, Nevada, on their 6 o'clock evening news, I wrote to George Knapp, the anchorman who put the series together, asking him if it is possible to obtain on video that entire series for sale to the CAC membership. I mentioned that after 16 years of gathering information in this field, that series was the most accurate I had ever seen and was amazed the series was allowed on the air, that hundreds of people had been kiUed for releasing much less in the past. ( I have yet to recieve a response. I suspect that the heavy hand of the secret government came dawn on them for presenting that series, which included a very revealing interview with Bob Lazar). This Awareness indicates that essentially, the nature of these craft being used by the powers of governments for further experimentation, testing, as that which allows for not only alien activities and use of the spacecraft, but also certain of the government representatives. Foy this reason, there are often reports of humans inhabiting the space- craft.

Two Types of UFO Prapulsian This Awareness indicates that there have also been those laser-cut extractions of land wherein portions of earth have been cut out and lifted up and lkloved out of place; that these too are the result of UFO technology.* It is an unusual technology that is not colnnlorl lo the laws of Newtonian physics. It makes use of space and lime warping that is such +s to allow for teleporbtion as well as travel; that these craft use two different modes of traversing time and space: one being a more con- ventional high speed travel through electromagnetic and gravitational forces, the other being a kind of teleportation by the warping of time and space so that it can appear at one place, have a contact in ahother place, and warp the space with certain kind of energy to allow it to instantly be in the other place when the time-warp is reversed or turned off. * For an accourtt of these lasercut extractions, please refer to 'Revelations of Awareness' No. 90-3 (The Mystery of the Giant Divot in a Washington State Wheat Field); $3.00 from C.A.C. This Awareness indicates that this is not something that can be easily explained though there are efforts in certain books that are available to explain this kind of traversing, These are also being tested in Great Britain and also in Russia; that the testing in the United States occurs in more than one place, but in conjunctidn with aliens in supplying technological assistance; that the information as that which can be found in various writings and books and material on the market or in UFO circles. This is not exposing any goverriment secrets, A is simply giving forth inform- ation that is available. WHY SO MANY CIRCLES NEAR STONEWENGE ? These circles in &e fields of England have attracted a lot of media attention. They have had hundreds of people, including scientists out there trying to dup- licate these circles, and they couldn't do it, and they've had scientists with cameras that would stay there all night long and not detect anything, but they would hear a humming or something, so evidently these UFOs can become invisible. My question is: Awareness ind- icated that the divot that was taken out, lifted up from a field here in Washington State, was done by a single entity who was being mischievous. Is this what is happening in England, or is there a specific reason there's so many of these ships landing in these fields, and does the fact that Stonehenge is nearby have any- thing to do with it?

We just had lunch with a member from Australia who tells us that there are the 'good-guy' aliens, and the 'bad-guy' alien, and they're both implanting entities on this plane. Could Awareness go into this subject of implants a bit and explain what the purpose of these are and how entities can detect them and how they can get rid of them, if possible? COSMIC AWARENESS. This Awareness indicates that often entities are implanted by these aliens with an implant that is either inserted up through the nostril into an area near the optic nerve, or will be given an implant in the back of the head near the medulla oblongata, or it will be near the back of the head in the area of the right ear, behind the ear; that these can be detected by certain means as described by Whitley Strieber in his lectures, wherein he shows certain scan pictures of his own head where the implants were, and entities can see their location. This Awareness indicates that there is also a kind of standing rule that anyone who has such an implant should not go near military bases because these imp- lants can be monitored by military guards and they are under orders to shoot anyone coming near with an implant; that this as being expressed or explained in the Cooper material. There is, in some cases, the poss- ibility of removing implants through operations; these, of course, can be costly and dangerous. This is in reference to these material implants that are imp- - 33 Y lanted by the physical aliens. This Awareness indicates that your friend today referred to the use of these implants as being able to cause pain, and this was correct. They are also able to cause disorientation, and to cause an entity to hear voices, or to get directions or instructions. It is likened unto having some kind of radio contact with an entity, with the contacts being implanted in the head so that the entity thinks these are his own thoughts. These also serve as monitoring devices, whereby the entity can be located at any time. Ethereal Implant Us& by the Plmadian Aliens (The Evolution of Nomo Sapim) This Awareness indicates that this is in reference to the physical implants by those physical aliens on earth. The so-called good-guy aliens, those entities from the Pleiades, also have their way of monitoring and comm- unicating ethereally and psychically with humans, and that they also have a kind of implant that they produce but it does not take the form of a physical implant. It is an ethereal or astral type of implant. This Awareness indicates generally, this would be more like an ethereal implant into the ethereal body, and it is for those who are especially open to receive instructions from higher spiritual guides so that there can be a closer communication and link between them and the higher spiritual guides; that the aliens from the Pleiades have a direct link or quality relating to beings of a higher dimension.

How to Override a Physical Implant This Awareness indicates that so long as your motives, intentions and purpasee are of the highest, and your qualitik are truly spiritual, these entities remain in contact and keep the lines of contact open in a protect- ive manner. It is important that you do not move into grossness in your behavior, or it will shut down the contacts. This Awareness indicates that the question of COMMON PLACES FOR IMPIANTS-- Both by U.S. Government and by aliens. One most often used is right near the pituitary gland. COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that these entities are inspecting individual, human individuals, in part for their own scientific research. In part they have been carrying on long experiments in trying'h Create a kind of new being which will allow their race to fnerge with humans, because their race is deteriorating from excess- ive repeated cloning. Each generation or each clone becomes less vitd, losillg its vitality an$ they are seek- ing a way to recharge their race by somehow comming- lirig with the new vital energy of humans in a kind of genetic recreation for the purpose df bringing about a new creation, a new being. That this, however, is not what this Awareness has referred to as the New Being of the New Age, for this would bring about certain benefits to the offspring, having the benefit of much of the intelligence of the aliens. It would benefit the aliens in giviqg them mu& of'the compassion and passion and feelings of humans which they lack, therefore, it would be a new race ' or a new being but it would not add greatly to the spiritual aspect. The new being would not gain that much spiritually. This Awareness indicates the need for humans to have some kind of spiritual upliftment is essential if there is to be any merging with aliens toward the creation of another species of beings; that for this reason, the need to move toward those beings of a higher spiritual nature is imperative and entities should be most cautious about any allegiance or alliances formed with those aliens who do not have the higher spiritual values. This Awareness suggeets that the question be restated, if this has been clarified; that there appears to have been an..."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Well, is It correct then that there was something intrinsic in the experience; that the aliens imposed a sense of spiritual evolvement in those they abducted? COSMIC AWARENESS. This Awareness indicates that it appears the aliens have, in the experience of abducting individuals, intro- duced a certain sense of confusion and have taken away their feeling of free will and personal destiny, and that many entities will transfer this feeling into a need for greater spiritual dependency on something higher than themselves, and they will interpret this as though the aliens have given them something spiritual. Othdrs will recall or will feel from the experience, that they have been greatly violated at having had their own free will tampered with; that they were essentially raped by aliens, which in fact, is more close to the truth for many, and these entities will tend to be more fearful of aliens and will have many disturbing days, weeks, years of confusion that follow abductions, Foods Ihe Aliens Don't Want You to Eat There are many entities whose lives are totally ruined from having been abducted.

You will recali that Strieber was told by the aliens, in fact, chastised severely, for having eaten chocolate. This Awareness indicates that these entities do not like the glandular substance taken from entities who have eaten chocolate. It is disturbing to them. The entity did not have his glandular substances.taken from him, and therefore was not violated, did not have the serious repercussions that many others would have in a similar situation. This Awareness indicates that &her foods that disturb the glandular substance as far as the aliens are concerned are sugar, sweet foods, and spinach and rhubarb, hot spicy foods, such as chili peppers; that the aliens do not like certain of these energies affect- ing the glandular substances ands therefore, do not gain the benefits, tw they are less likely to bother with the glandular extractions from such entities. This Awareness indicates that the need for entities to be cautious in regard to any ~q~t~ct with UFOs cannot bg oversstated, for these entifes are not here as p,ydisn aels. This was fhe reputation earned by the Pleiad~~type, not those from Orion or the Zeta ~eticuli,-&hese entities being more interested in what they can get from humans for their own benefit. DO THOSE ABDUCTED HAVE A PREVIOUS AGREEMENT WITH THE ALIENS FOR THIS? ( DESCRIPTIONS OF LIKELY CANDIDATES FOR ABDUCTION) (FOLLOW-UP QUESTION): In regard to these abductions, is there a factor in- volved where there is agreement on some level given to these aliens? Fok exanlple, our friend Michael had an abduction experience as a child, and he's questioned this. He was lifted UD bv this blue beam, I believe it was, and he's positive they have returned many times, or at least several times since, now that he's grown up. , We have discussed this with him, and he wonders whether he gave some sort of agreement originally as a child, or was it necessary to give agreement for this experience to happen. He seems to think it was a violation, but he says it was a great experience and he wouldn't have missed it for anything, because he feels that there was some kind of illumination given. COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that indeed there is a kind of exchange that occurs in which the glandular sub- stances are taken, but at the same time there are certain influences; this as difficult to explain; that there are certain psychic or psychological influences that are returned to the entity in a manner that works aome- what like osmosis, in which the entity's intellect can be enhanced by such a contact. This Awareness indicates that generally, these entities tend to look for those who are either lonely or confused, who are not clearly or strongly grounded in any particular ind- ividuality. In other words, that wherein an entity has a strong individuality, they are less likely to Ire a candidate for abduction, but wherein an entity is relatively open and receptive to environmental in- fluences of a wide order, in other words, one who is in need of help, in need of friendship, in need of clarity or in need of something stable in his or her life; these are tho types that are more likely cand- idates for abduction and these entities will tend to look for those types. Beware of the Hunting P8rty This Awareness indicates it is best to see these entities, these aliens ah, being hunters; that essentially they are out hunting for sources of glandular substances, and do not want to experience any personal harass- ment from the action, so they generally will pttempt to find entitie6 who are @ope, or to themselv*, of. the type that is more unbaIanced or unstable or mially digqriented at the time. This aware,^^ ind- icates that by these terms 'uniplanced, disabled or disoriented,'It does not imply this to be a permanent state of mind, It is referring to perhapa only a temp- orary state of mind. If an entity, for example, is walking through the park, that entity is alone. If the entity, walking through the park is monitored by the aliens and is sensed to have a great number of friends who are waiting for ,him or a family, this would tend to hold off the alien gbductio~ moreso than if the entity is going home to his own place and no one would redly miss him if he disappeared for an hour or two. This Awareness indicates that they are able, by their devices, to determine such things, and these things 1 are often considered in an abduction.

(How the Aliens Scramble Brainwaves) It would seem that any abdbctee would almost have to define their experience in the best possible light, such as spiritual enlightenment, in order to live with it psychologically; but does the event itself, encourage spiritual growth because of its intensity?"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"COSM~C AWARENESS: a. This Awareness indicates that this will depend on the individual and how the individual wishes to relate to the event. In most cases the individual does not recall much of the event because the event is usually of such a nature that the aliens wipe out the memory on ti qonscious level through the use of chemicals or drugs and also through the use of certain trauma involved in the event. They also have the benefit of frequency programming, whereby certain frequencies are used thah can totally distort the memory or an event, so that while the event is occurring, the brainwaves are being scrambled simul- taneously so that the brain does not record the event clearly. This Awareness indicates that because some of the events of the abduction m&y be interesting, consciously remembered and even pleasant or intriguing, entities may remember only that part and parts that are more of a violative nature may be repressed into subconscious levels and not remembered at all. That for some, they are not recorded deeply in the subconscious, or they are recorded deeply in the subconscious and still have a kind of gnawing effect on the entity's'emotibns, causing a feeling of dread or fear or anxiety in regard to the event, and depending on the individual and the degree of memory, dread, fear or anxiety, each, in&- idual will have a slightly different attitude toward the abduction.

This Awareness indicates that there appear to be other substances that can be beneficial, but these are not seen clearly at this time; that this may become' clear and available at a future time. DO THE ALIENS USE HOLOGRAPHIC LASERS TO IMPLANT HUMANS 7 QUESTION: B.A. sent in a copy of a question and answer session with Dr. Fred Bell who is a pretty well-known UFO expert who goes around lecturing, and he claims that these neuro-implant transmitters in the brain are planted by the Greys, using holographic laser equip- ment. Is that true? Is that the method they use? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this appears to be a good description of the method used. It is a kigd of projection and creation at the same time. It is not an action so much as making a hole and asking it in; it is more likened unto creating a l,aqq$ized incision or hole between the molecules to the place for implant, and then projecting on that light or laser track the information or coding that creates the implant in that spot; that it is first created in a kind of holograph- ic vision and then it materializes as a substance.

This Awareness indicates that the surgical removal of im- plants is on occasion possible, especially that which is implanted behind the right ear. An implant by the medulla as that which would be nearly impassible to remove, and an implant near the optic nerve would be quite difficult, if not impossible, to remove with- out serious damage to the individual. This Awareness indicates that it would appear that the use of germanium over a period of approximately This information comes from a question and answer seasion with this Dr. Fred Bell, and the questioner says: \"Didn't you mention in Hawaii that you had been in Dulce and you were going to take videos of . level 7 and 82\" And Dr. Bell says: \"Yes, I've been to ' Duice.

This Awareness indicates the Alternative 003 scenario has little merit in light of the realization of greater forces aoming toward the earth for future invasion, therefore, the only<reai option available to the governmevt is to-either work with the Greys, with the present aliens against the invading aliens, or to oppose not only the present aliens, but to prepare for the invading aliens. This Awareness ind- icates that to prepare for the invading aliens with present technology would be of littler value, for earth lags behind. Earth needs all of the technology avaiIable through the Grey aliens, if it is to hope for survival in the future. THE GREAT FLU EPIDEMICS THAT KILLED OFF MILLIONS: WERE THE ALIENS RESPONS1BCE? (PREPARING POR THE HARVEST BY WEEDING ~(JT THE CROP) 10 of husbandry of animals, the same principle may apply; that if the animals began reproducing too quickly and the pen becomes overcrowded before its time, some of the animals may be removed and killed in order that the others grow according to the plan to that status that is desired for the best quality desired. The aliens are essentially looking for certain breed- ing stock as well as certain benefits from the glandular secretions or glandular substances, and in order to get that which is of the highest quality for their purposes, humanity needed to evoIve to a certain stage. This Awareness indicates that humanity is at a place where they could now gain good stock for their cloning purposes, that is, part of humanity is. There have been times in which the mass of humanity exceeded the production of the earth to provide for the masses, and the humans were yet not as well evolved in a quality sense, such as during the time of the Black Plague and during other times, and therefore, these things were introduced to help wipe out some of the weaker or overcrowded areas of humankind. The Time for Harvest Approrchea (ACriman's Soul Eaters to Dine Also) It is again, a similar situation, wherein the aliens are,preparing for these times of harvest in which the energies of entities have reached a certain stage, requir- ing a kind of purification or purging, in accordance with their way of thinking. That those who survive will inevitably create a stronger stock and this is to their intention. This Awareness indicates that there are, of course, far more sinister forces in terms of human souk inyolved in these plagues, and that has to do with the other dimensional beings, those forces of Ahriman, in their havest oi souls, who collect the energies of entities who have not yet evolved spirit- ually to their satisfaction and who are still caught in and locked in to the vibratory rates that are satisfactory to Ahriman and those forces, and therefore, these plagues help to feed the appetites or purposes of the Ahriman influences.

To be more technical, the Zeta Greys tend to.be more like the Ahriman types, and the Orion types tend to be mpre Lucjferian in their nature; Luciferian being more involved in deception and in political maneuver- ings, coercion and influencing others, while the Zetas, or the Ahriman-types being more brutal and sadistic in their natur,es. Thk Awareness indicates that in the underworld, thpse known as the Deras are even more exemplary of the Ahriman-type energies, extremely sadistic in nature, creating torture for fhe pleasure of seeing torture.Tbese entities are, however, enemies of the Zeta Greys..

As a result, we have at least two complete readings explaining all this, which have not been published. Griffith's material is scary and leads ent- ities &to believing that after they pass over, all hell is going to break loose, with all sorts of goblin-like creatures pur- suing them through time and eternity in an attempt to eat their soul. Essentially, Awareness is telling us that although this qrt of thing may occur on the very lowest of the astral levels, that entities like the CAC reem, who are into more spiritual inttests and who obey the Laws and Precepts as glven, need not worry nor pay attmtion tcr nor energize these concepts, for they will move through these lower levels on their way up to the higher etheric levels, including those 'heaven' levels and CeIestria. Those entities who spend their lives vidating others, making money their god, slaughtering others in lives of crfme, wasting their lives on drugs etc. have very low vibrations, and like Oscar Wiides' famous story of the 'Picture of Dorian Grey,\" which graduqfly shows the erosion of that entity's soul, although his physical featutes did not show them an, all entities, in passing ovhr, can only go to that highest vibration they are capable of reaching; and in these cases, the highest vikation they are capable of reaching is some of the very lowest of vibrations, and it is in theoe realms where the dictators and violators go, with only reflections of themselves do they see in all the others, will you find those creatures of Ahriman who rely on the soul substance vitality and energy of others.

This includes the possibility of various 'raptures', including one for the Light Workers, if hngs get reallygheavy. This editor recommends you ings based on Kyle Griffith's works,and I can only reply that such information is a very low priority item and probably would only worry some pple and pdmpt more questions. It is possible we will never puhlish the inform- ation, at least for some tim8. (I personally do not even like to energize those concepts; they are too creepy and give one the:feelings,that very very low spirits are hanging around, licking their chops and saying: \"Watch out. One day we will get you, too.\" Perhaps.) WILL THE LIGHT WORKERS BE UNDER ATTACK BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGHER VIBRATION ? WHAT IS THAT PROTECTIVE \"SOMETHING\" HUMANS HAVE THAT THE ALIENS DON'T ? (CA.C. General Reading, April 4,1990) (Continued from last reading) COSMIC AWARENESS: QUESTION: This Awareness indicates that it does appear there There's a few questions left on the subject of aIiens, one of them from this report I was reading in the last session that B.A. sent in, of an interview with Dr. Fred Bell, He was asked: \"We received information this week that within the next three years, the Light bearers, because of their higher frequency rate, were going to be under attack by the Greys,\" and Dr. Bell replies: \"You're right on with that information.\" Would Awareness explain what exactly they were discussing there? is considerable concern by these aliens in regard to those entities who are sensitive and who have a more, spiritual outlook toward life, that they will not be as easily controlled by the manipulative powers which these entities are hoping to install. It does appear that the energies will be more of a psychological nature and so~ial pressure, whereby those who are classed as New Age metaphysical types will come under consider- able criticism by others whose philosophies differ and that this will serve in ,the interest of the Greys in an effort to create more problems for these entities."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"12 It appears also that Greys may try to make use of some government influence$, in targeting and focus- ing harassing activities on sQme of ,thbse New Age groups, This Awareness suggests however, that this does not appear to be something which will have much effect and that in fact, it may serve in the reverse whqeby these groups may tqq~ out to be more helpful in reversing the power of the Greys and help- ing humanity. It is seen that elements of the govern- ment are having second thoughts about working with the Greys and may indeed in time ap9reciate any help from those in society who are prepared and who are able to serve in a more spiritual capacity to leqd to new attitudes and approaches toward spiritual directions fot humanity. Thir: Awareness indicates that it appears there is much in regard to this entity's response to that state- ment, this entity Bell, which had some particular detailed understanding which he was aware of, that he perceived from his analysis that may have also been intended by his statements that this is not seen as altoggther aCcuraC9 in assesspent. It does have a certiiin degree of validity, that these groups and ind- ividuals are perceived to some degree as threats to the aliens. The aliem do not like psychics, for peychics and people who are'sensitive, can feel emanations from the alieps which give warnings as to their true nature, and this disturbs them. They do not know how to deal with this kind of energy. They are used to using telepathy to influence, rather than ajlowing themselves to be read by others. -This Awareness indicates it is seen that if the Greys had the opportunity to cause harm to the more enlight- ened ones on earth, they would attempt to do so; how- ever, it appears that this is because they have less con- trol on them and the more enlightened ones tend to have a certain degree of protection that the Greys cannot fully comprehend and do not quite know how to overcome. I$ is that spiritual quality that the Greys catmot understand, being that they do not themselves have any background in such energies. This Awareness indicates that in understanding the Greys you must realize that they are very much likened unto a robot-type of creation, having an insect base in the genetic structure of their being, They e(re .simply not quite able to deal with the kind of energies that entities who are into spiritual essences, who can call on spiritual energies, who are in effect emanating Divine Energy in their aura. They have some difficulty in dealing with these entities. This Awareness indicates that there is greater safety in the spiritual energies than danger. PROTECTIVE DEVICES QUESTION: THATPREVENTATTACKS Evidently Bell had some kind of device, The questioner asks: \"How does your nuclear device help with protect- ion?'+ and Bell replies: \"These nuclear devices work in several different ways. They consist of different gem stones and work as a filter or a microwave amplifier a which will build up the basic body functions of the person wearink them. Most recently, the Pleiadians gave me a receptor that-works on the erown chakra and the pined gland. It takes people out of the lower 'survival mode and accelerates their vibratory rate. It allows them to excel under any kind of ELF, extra low . frequency attack. There are literally hundreds of thousands of these devices out there all over the world, and they have proven to be effective.\" The questioner then asks: \"So these sew devices, when placed on the physical body, accelerate the speed of the cellular structure which gives us immunity from attack. Is that correct?\" Dr. Bell replies: \"Right. The Greys bring your cellular structure down to a lower rate of speed, and this pushes your etheric body out &om your physical body and they make an entry in between. That's the whole modikoperandi--for controlling human beings.\" I'd like to ask Awareness, is there some kind of device that he's talking about, or a substitute, that wfh protect entities, and is the way the aliens contsol people as explained by Bell, correct? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this is correct. That you will recall previously wherein this Awareness des- cribed that there were certain entities who would be loosened frotn their body, and the aliens would'walk into their body as s walk-in, in this manner, taking over the human body. That this as one way of pss- ession, and gaining access of a human's body whereby the entity simply moves the owner out of the body and takes over in the driver's seat. This Awareness indicates that the entity in moving in will still have all of the memory of that previous owner's brain, as these things are recorded on the brain and the memories stay in the consciousness of the in- habitant. That in regard to the units that are available to help strewhen an entity's attachment to the physical form, there are some devices of different types that ate useful in this manner; that there are those radbpics clevgq such are available through the entity Gary Zuckett and some of his associates, which can also be beneficial.\" *ED'S Note: Gary & Emily Zuckett are long time C.A.C. members with many interests, I am not sure he is still selling radionic devices, but if you send him a stamped self-addressed envelope and ask for his latest catalog, you can find out. I bow be used to sell them, becauw I bought one from him several years ago. The address: Gary Zuckett, Box 144, Pullman, W. Va. 26421. There are also other benefits derived from crystals; that the particular type spoken of by Be13 from the Pleiadians, a$ those which you cannot simply build yourself or find at a local gem store. You might request more information from Bell as to whether there is a w~y or an arrangement that would allow these device& to be'hade more widwread, and if so, find out how they could be obtained. Avoid the 'Fear and Survival' Mode & You Avoid Or ya This Awareness indicates that the important message Bell was giving has to do with the fact of raising the vibration out of that fear and survival concern into the more spiritual aspects of conscious- ness so as to overcome the areas that can be controlled by the Greys. This Awareness indicates that by raising"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"one's vibration to the higher chakras and the more 13. spiritual aspects, wherein the heart chakra is ener- gized, the chakras above.the heakt are opened and energized, and those chakxas relating to the fear and exceeive concern in regard to animal lusts are given a more recessive priority in one's fife.

This Awareness indicates that, this essentidy can be beneficial, wen if the alien types attempt to chall- enge and to cause a psychic-type of harassment against the more spiritually evolved entity. This Awareness indicates that essentially what It is saying is that\" the more spiritually evolved you are, the more you may become the target, but the easier it will be to overcome any frequencies that the Greys could emanate to cause harm. That even in regacd to, such thing as harassment, in reference to bureaucratic, government or personal harqent by individuals or alie'ns; these things can only bave a limited d,egrqe of effect in accordance with the.strength of your own fait+ and attunement to the higher spiritual essences. Aiwayr Call Dmvn the White Light for Protection If you allow excessive fear to enter into your think- ing, into your feeling, into your life, it can help to draw in these things. If you do not allow these and can keep your faith strong, even if there is an attempt to harass, you will be more able to overcome any alien force directed at yourself, This Awareness suggests you not forget to cover yourself with White Light, cover your family, home, and all things assoc- iated with the White Light of Perfection and all will be easier during these coming months and years; that any time there is what appears to be a threat or a fear of imminent difficulties, simply call on the White Ligg't, the Christ Light, the spiritual light, however you berceive it to be, to come down as protection around, above and below you, to cover and to protect youqeii, your loved ones, and all that is associated with your concerns.

There may be some question in regard to its having been properly served.

It is unlikely that unless there is some great support for it that it will ever have the effwt intended, and it is unlikely there will be great support for it, unless for some strange reason, the media should publicize the document.

March 1,1990, and it ran till 1:00 AM on the Billy Goodman Happening. It was an interview ivith UFO investigator Bill English, and she took notes, evidently in short hand, of the conversat- ation, and I'd like to read some of this information and ask Awareness if this is typical, or if this information is simply disinformation and so on. there is great outcry from masses thaf here will be much to come from this other than an attempt to quash it as quickly and quietly as possible, perhaps ' creating some other diversion to do so. This Awareness indicates that it would not bereal- istic to expect that these two entities in presenting wch a summons could actually cause a great change in the powers that are controlling this situatiqn; that there would indeed need to be much more than just this , act alone. Thia Awareness indicates that there are entities who are awakening to the rdties and some of these entities are also picking up the baU, so to speak, and carrying the ball along with these to Cooper and Lear and otheys, and that this could quite easily continue to anowba4, leading to a movement which could have a profound effect. This Awareness indicates however, that it must be understood, attacking those who have made agreements with the aliens is not totally fair, for there are mitigating circumstances, as indicated before, that this nation had very little choice in the matter. Had this nation gone to war against these entities, the nation could have been totally devastated by the technology these entities possess, and by making deals with the entities, the nation stalled for time, gained some technology. The main error in the secret government and its deals with the alien is that even after discovering that individuals were being abducted and mutilated, and harmed, they continued quietly allowing this to be, but in the interest of fairness to these ent- ities, it needs to be understood too, that they were not informed or aware until relatively recently, in the last few years, that such mutilations were occurring against humans. It is a strange dilemma that humans find themselves facing in dealing with \"Bill English was a captain in the Green Berets and served in Laos in 1969 through \"71. He was part of a ten man team sent to investigate a B-52 bomber crash in the jungles of Laos. The plane reportedly had been attacked not by aircraft, but by another object. The team, however, found no cmh puttern at the scene! It was as if the plane had been set down by a giant hand in the middle of the jungle. The plane ahowed no damage, although it was fully loaded with fuel and bombs. The men blew open a hatch and there was the crew, all sitting in their safety harnesses. They had been mutilated in what was termed the 'standard' manner: anus cored out, apparently with some large corkscrew; patches of ski sliced from neck and jaw; and eyes and genitalia removed by extremely precise surgery. Yet no blood was spilled anywhere. At the time, the team assumed the Viet Cong were responsible, no credence being given to the report of a strange encounter.

This Aware- ness indicates that it would be possible for them to port- ray themselves as humanoid types, as was presented on the series V, but it does not appear that this will be their approach. Rather, they are expecting humanity to be wellcontrolled by the time they arrive. They have sent their emissaries ahead to gain control, and their intent is simply to set up, when they arrive. This Awareness wishes again, to remind you It has already indicated there is a contingency plan to destroy *planetoid before its arrival on earth. That is one pcitential option, which at this time appears to be given a high priority. This Awareness indicates that it would be premature to worry about the reptilians; that there is enough to be concerned about already; that the add- ition of the reptilian threat may in fact become an element that helps to solve much of the problem, for it creates the temptation of the Greys who are already present, to turn against their masters and join with the human element in so doing. - That in order for this to occur, the technologies the Greys possess would need to be shared with the humans and that, in turn, creates a greater opportunity for humans' survival. This Awareness indicates that this is getting into areas which are more than is appropriate for your membership. It is bordering too closely on some of the areas that have not yet been made public, to the masses, and therefore, this Awareness wishes to refrain from further comment at this time unless there is some form of exposure. This Awareness reminds you that It does not partic- ipate in exposing information that is held secret by you government, or information that could assist aliens or any others in gaining an advantage; that It gives information only that has already been released in order to help your membership and those vho are interested in finding out what they can do, or what they must become aware of, so that the information they gain is not from a secret source, but is simply compiled. This Awareness indicates that It does not wish to disclose secrets that would cause harm to yourselves or to those whose secrets have been exposed, but fP information has already been exposed and can be help- ful to your readers, then this Awareness can release the information with certain comments. HOW ALIENS HAVE ALTERED THE COURSE OF OUR HISTORY DOWN THRU THE AGES (What Hurmrnr Have in Common with the Reptilians) (Closing Message) : This Awareness indicates that the world is under- going some great transitions. It is not that these ener- gies are necessarily new. It is that they are new to most entities in terms of their view of the world. This Aware- ness indicates that down through the ages, these entities and entities like them have participated in altering the course of your history. There are also others who have participated in the directing of your evolution and his- tory, and there are even moments in the past in which the reptilians have been in contact with humans prior to settlements on earth, and this may trigger certain rimo or dial memories. This Awareness wishes you to understand that your own reptilian brain,--that part of the brain which moves down the spinal column some distance, as that which is to some degree genetically reflective of certain elem- ents in the genetic makeup of the reptilians. It gives a certain kinship, There are, in fact, frozen in the Ant- arctica, remnants of the reptilian race in earlier visit- ations to earth. Many humans walking in human bodies have at one time or another, inhabited reptilian bodies on other planets. It is not that these entities are to be seen as absolutely alien in every way. There are some areas in which entities have things in common. We Are Perceiving a Whole New R~ality This Awareness indicates that what is actually occ- urring at this time is not so much what appears as a disturbance to your reality; what is actually occurring at this time is that you are becoming aware of a greater reality than you have previously perceived. It bas always been there. It is much like if you were put into a giant dome and lived in a small corner with people who looked like yourself, became very much acquaint- ed with them, and suddenly, after many months or years of this, had the light of reality extended to dis- cover that there were bats and other creatures also living out in the shadows of your reality, and then in exploring and discovering these unidentified flying, objects of bats and other creatures, you were to con- tinue peering into the darkness, into the shadows, to discover that not only were there bats, there were also reptiles, and in further discovery, you realize that there are beings out there in your reality, and those beings are somewhat Iiened unto yourself, but have qualities that are intermingled with bats and with reptiles, and in this discovery, you begin to perceive a totally new reality. This Awareness indicates what is actually happen- ing here is that you are discovering that the reality is being created as you discover, but that your reality may lag behind the reality of others who have already exper- ienced these creations, and that you too, are being created by the realities of others as they grow and develop new perceptions. This Awareness indicate$ that it is not that your discovery of something new created that something, for that something may have existed before you, but the nature of creation is such that one thing discovers another, and is discovered by something else, and then these things begin to make more red their presence, and in so doing, new realities are perceived and understood and new laws are discov- ered, to be dealt with."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"17.

Paul Shockley, Interpreter \"THE FIRES OF HELLm--THOSE UNFULFILLED DESIRES SOME FEEL AFTER DEATH ( HOW TO ESCAPE REINCARNATION,--THAT WHEEL OF BIRTH, DEATH AND REBIRTH ) QUESTION: A question from D.C. of Toledo, Ohio. \"One of the reasons given through various channels for reincarnation in the physical world, is what they call 'unfulfilled desires'; like wanting to be rich, powerful and famous, or attachments to something they prized highly when in the physical world in their previous lives. At the same time, these channels will claim all the desires d the dead spirits are instantly met in these inner planes. It looks like another contradiction, because if their 'desires' are met in these inner planes, then what do they need the physical world for? Who would want reincarnation in the physical world?\" COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates the only desires that entities meet in the inner plane, are those of their own, and in meeting their desires, this is that which may be termed the 'flames of hell'; that when an entity has burning desires and no physical way of fulfilling these desires, it is indeed a kind of personal hell for such entities. The attachment that entities form in regard to anything on the physical plane as that which creates a desire for the entity, and if such attachments cannot be released at the time of passing over, then these become the desires which haunt or burn at the entity, prompting him or her to return for fulfillment of those desires. Thus, the entity who is obsessed with some kind of addiction, upon passing over is still inclined toward the addiction, but has no way of fulfilling the needs. The entity who craves alcohol in the physical, or food or other substances in an extraordinary sense, will pass f- IN THIS ISSUE -1 How m E~clpr Reinu~tion; Unfulfilled Desiru, he 'Fim of Hell' Paw 2-4 Hor* Spiria Un Entitha m Sat* Mi Addietiom m Drugs 8 Alcohol 3.

Such entities often attempt to vicariously experience some kind of satisfaction by aligning themselves or attuning themselves to some living being and attempting to tap into the living being's experience of drinking or indulg- ing in some kind of physical satisfaction which is parallel to the entity's own addiction. Thus you have the spirits hanging around those who are drinking, that they might indulge in some etheric way or astral manner, the alcohol which is being ingested by the ones still in physical form. This Awareness indicates that likewise, if an entity has unfulfilled desires or desires and attachments which cannot be released upon the passing over, the entity will be inclined to return into the physical form in order to again indulge in the pursuit of fulfilling those desires. Those who imply that your needs and desires are totally fulfiiled upon passing over, do not understand. It may be fulfilled only at the moment of death when the entity moves into the Clear Light that the entity may then experience a oneness, a unity that is beyond anything the entity has previously conceived, but this experience does not last eternally, and the entity then begins to sink into the lesser lights, and here the cravings which have hounded the entity, begin to reemerge, causing the entity to seek reincarnation. This Awareness indicates that movement into the Clear Light as that which allows the entity to see truth, to see the ultimate reality for a brief shining moment, and this is that which gives the entity a new under- standing, if the entity is capable of recalling that brief moment in its future sojourns. Too often the entity forgets that brief moment of truth and in moving back to the lesser lights, the entity begins to think more in terms of his or her own cravings and needs and then the focus changes and the entity again seeks rebirth into physical form, and seeks to fulfill the desires which are still being carried in the subconscious and emotional levels of the entity. The means by which entities can overcome this vicious circle of life and rebirth, life and rebirth, wherein an entity is born, lives, dies, and is reborn to live again, to die again, meanwhile pursuing one desire after another; the only way this cycle is stopped is wherein the entity's desire become focused on that which is Universal Divinity, wherein the entity wants so desperately to be attuned"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"to the Divine that none of the other desires have any 3. Z particular meaning or value to the entity, and in such a situation in which the entity is ultimately attached or attuned to Divinity, then all of the other lesser desires can easily be put aside at the moment of death and the entity will then be more able to stay, to reside in the light of truth; this at least for longer periods of time, as long as the entity remains ultimately and most pre- dominantly attached to the Divine. HOW SPIRITS USE ENTITIES TO SATISFY THEIR ADDICTION TO DRUGS &ALCOHOL ( WHY THE ALCOHOLIC BLANKS OUT (FOLLOW-UP QUESTION): When these entities that have passed over that are addicted, for example, to alcohol, and they continue to have this craving, how does this work, when they're able to suck up the essence of alcohol from the earth; do they find a hole in the aura of some physical alco- holic and attach themselves to it, or do they hover around the actual tavern, or are they somewhere else and they're still getting the essence of the alcohol? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that they attach themselves to the aura of an individual and assist in creating holes in the aura, whereby they can then siphon off some of the feeling and experience of the drinker; in this manner they vicariously experience the drinking of another so that they share in the indulgence. For the drinker, this entity will feel himself at times lacking control of him- self and may experience expressions that are not char- acteristic of himself if he were not drinking. This Awareness indicates that it is in such cases that the mischievous or hungry spirit is inhabiting and controlling the body during such times; that it is for this reason that many alcoholics blank out and do not remember having done something. They were in fact pushed out of their body and the invading spirit was involved in the action of moving and man- ipulating the body during the time of the blackout or blanking out in terms of memory. For example, an alcoholic may indulge in some action, in terms of traffic or in terms of driving or in terms of some behavior toward another, or for example, shoplifting, but when the alcoholic goes to sleep and wakes up and is confronted with what he has done, he may plead that he does not remember at all having done this action. That this may be true, the entity may not recall, for the entity may have been totally absent from the body while the invading spirit was acting and using the body. When an Imposter Takes Over a Body This Awareness indicates that in some rare cases, the invading spirit can in fact gain so much control over the body that the original individual has little claim on the body, and the alcoholic spirit, having taken over, may still use the entity's name and still have access to the entity's memories to some degree and may still act out the part of the entity to some degree, but may actually be an imposter living in the body of the alcoholic and may use the body under that entity's name, with the entity being almost non- present, much of the time in the body. Generally however, when an entity or if an entity makes great effort to reclaim or keep his or her body, the invading spirit seldom has the sufficient strength to counter that claim and force the other out. Gener- ally it is a kind of death wish that leads entities into becoming alcoholic and letting other spirits invade and take over their body. It is not necessarily a death wish in all cases; it can also be a type of escapism, whereby the entity just doesn't want to face responsibilities for being oneself and would just as soon turn it over to someone else, at least on a temporary basis. This is one of the main motivations for entities indulging in heavy drinking. They simply want to get away from themselves and find that alcohol is a means by which they can do this. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE'S BODY --YOU, OR THE INVADING SPIRIT? (FOLLOW-UP QUESTION): In the example given by Awareness just now of an entity who allows himself to be possessed by one of these spirits and then gets involved in say, an accident, a drunk-driving accident and claims he can't remember any thing about it. From a cosmic point of view, this does not absolve him of his responsibility, does it? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this is negative. The entity is responsible for the body which he has been given in this lifetime, and if you turn over your vehicle to another who is incompetent, you are still responsible for the outcome of any damage your vehicle may have caused; -this in reference to the bodily and physical behavior as well as to any automobile involved in such behavior. IF ONE WASTES A LIFETIME, DOES THIS CREATE A 'GHOST OF THE SOUL'? QUESTION: Another question along this line by D.C. He writes: \"Another reincarnation theory by the channel Vern Overly, gives this type of explanation: 'If the life just ended adds nothing to the present soul accompanying it, if it detracts from the soul you desire to become, the soul rejects that portion and refuses to accept it as part of the whole. It then becomes a true ghost of the soul. That portion hovers above the soul, attempt- ing to fuse. It actually haunts the soul. This ghost must be refined to the point where it is acceptable to the soul so that it may infuse with the entire entity. Rein- carnation takes place. The refinement of this portion must come through physical lie. This rejected part of the soul is the part that suffers whatever karma it needs to in order to be 'refined'. ' Could Awareness say this is correct, or is there anything wrong with this explanation on reincarnation? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this as... This Aware- ness suggests this be reread again. (The above is read again) This Awareness indicates that the essence of this statement being that if experiences in physical form do not contribute to the development of the soul, they"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"then become likened unto problems or ghosts of the 4. in some kind of more pleasureful activities, and the soul which need to be in some way resolved or attended entity may spend little time thinking of how he or she to in order that they may be refined and brought into wishes to be closer to the Divine, so the place where some kind of purposeful attribution for the develop- these entities are has nothing to do with their develop- ment of the soul.

However, there are also problems involved wherein personalities can create differences that are incompatible, even though they may have the attract- ion at one point, wherein the entity is so outgoing in regard to social life, and the other is very quiet and likes to avoid others. Women Can't Change Men's Behavior If the one entity cannot truly accept the outgoing person's behavioral pattern of being out and about with friends all of the time and finding themselves left at home all the time, the entity can't really accept this, but thinks: 'Well, if we get married, this will all change. He or she will stay home.\" This Awareness indicates you may be in for a great surprise because entities generally do not change their behavior very much just because they are mated with someone. Their behaviors are seldom changed by any considerable degree. There are many, especially women, who think that they can reform their man, only to find that the man seldom changes. The woman generally has to modify her life to accompany the life of the man, to accommodate the life of the man. If you are not prepared for that then you must think twice about marrying this person. This Awareness indicates that it does not mean that you cannot change a person, it just means that it is not as easy as it looks; that for this reason, the old adage IS THIS HOW THE UNIVERSE WAS CREATED 7 QUESTION: A question by SX., Ontario, Canada. He writes: \"Awareness, you have mentioned that the majority of souls were created at the same time when the concen- tration of the Light Forces'exploded. However, in the philosophy of Cosmic Awareness, the creation; you mention that the soul is created when there begins the self-awareness. The birth of a soul is when there is a creation of a free mind and not the creation of simple awareness. Are you essentially saying that the simple awareness, the mere vitality, existed before the explosion of the Light Forces took place and it is the explosion that created the soul? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that it is very difficult to explain the way the universe created things, because the term explosion is inadequate. This Awareness ind- icates that it was not so much an explosion as an awaken- ing; that wherein energies of mind come together in a focus to the point wherein that focus then becomes so intense that there is an accumulation of great energy and that great energy in the focus, such as might occur in one's meditation, reaches a point of ultimate intensity, there is that which may be a bursting forth, a release of that energy. This is much likened unto the climax in the sexual act, whereby energies then are broken free from that focus, released from the focus and are sent forth in all directions."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"3 This Awareness indicates it is not likened unto this '. being some physical actions, since the universe is a living being and it is all mental. It is all consciousness, but this mental or consciousness explosion as that which created fragments, fragmentations, and these fragment- tations had with them certain qualities, one being magnetic, so that certain fragments created magnetic centers and certain aspects of consciousness followed and attached to those magnetic centers and these became what may be termed souls. The Black Hole in Space This Awareness indicates that It has also given that all material objects that have life force carry with them that which may be termed as the black hole. In physics the black hole is that which is a very dense area of great gravitational pull, that pulls life into it, and from which no light emerges, and that black hole, absorbing light, brings light into itself and then, from there, it goes into another dimension. The soul is much likened unto a seed. Every seed has within it that potential for transmutation into another dimension of expression, and thus, the seed when planted and given certain light energies and certain nutrients as catalysts, experiences something that causes it to invert or transform, much likened unto actions associated with the black hole, and out from this inversion comes the beginning of a plant. The soul is similar in that once it is planted in phy- sical reality, and given certain nutrients, out from this soul emerges that which is the beginnings of the plant of the human consciousness; the conscious mind may be equated to the buds that grow from or sprouts that emerge from the seed. This Awareness indicates that the human mind then, as the sprouts, continue to emerge and grow, leaving the roots underground as the subconscious or soul. These souls are not created as fulfilled beings, but have the ability to evolve from their many exper- iences, thus, even the seed may be thought of as the soul of the plant, and animals and their magnetic centers with their memory, which may be equated to a subconscious, the memory of all they have exper- ienced; these animals may also be though of as having souls. Generally, when speaking of souls, entities restrict the term to that of humans. This Awareness uses the term in most instances as referring to the magnetic center of an entity's being, whether that entity is a plant, an animal, a human or the earth itself; that magnetic center which is conscious and which carries memory as that which may be thought of as the soul, thus, when entities ask where and when was the soul created, It needs to interpret what the particular questioner is asking about, what particular reference is this questioner referring to in regard to the soul, because the soul is being created in some minute ways, all the time. There are many souls being created in plant form, in atomic levels, and these miniscule souls are not what the questioner was speaking of in the question. Thus, there can be an inconsistency when someone asks in regard to the soul and means a certain level or aspect of the soul, as compared to a question a year later by someone else who wants to know something about the creation of the soul in regard to another frame of reference. This Awareness indicates essentially, the soul is that vortex between life in the sense of spirit and matter in the sense of image or reflection of spirit. The soul is that vortex that lies between matter and spirit. It is also commonly called the magnetic center, although magnetic is not actually the proper termin- ology to describe the soul, because it is mental more than magnetic; but the mental aspects draw things to itself, therefore it can be thought of as a mental mag- netic force. It also has certain radiant forces or powers, because the soul not only draws toward itself, it also reaches out and touches other souls. This Awareness indicates the problem with many questions is the problem of language and of how ent- ities' concepts have been programmed to think in terms of separatenesses, to think in terms of physical tangibles and one cannot always explain in great detail all of these nuances of vagueries involved in dealing with energies that are beyond the perception of one's vision, hearing, taste, tactile senses or the sense of smell. That if entities could see with their mind's eye the invisible energies, the frequencies and vibrations that exist everywhere about you, and how certain things that you perceive as material have their certain magnetic, mental magnetic centers, and that this kind of energy is everywhere present but that your senses tend to block out your ability to see these things, then indeed you would have an understanding not only of reality, you would also have the ability to ask the questions in a way that could be answered in a con- sistent manner with reality. The Importance of the Frame of Reforenee This Awareness indicates it is likened unto those who ask questions regarding Star Wars, answers being given, while someone later challenges: 'But I thought Star Wars was just a myth!' This Awareness indicates that indeed it is a myth, but within its own framework, there are certain answers that can be given as in the affirmative. That likewise, entities ask questions in regard to the story of the New Testament, much of which is myth, but here again, if asked within a certain context, a certain question within a certain context, is it necessary to keep repeating or to inform entities that this or that is mythical? This Awareness indicates that if you ask a question about Santa Claus, this Awareness would answer the question in regard to the color of Santa Claus's beard as being white, but is it really white if there is no such character as Santa Claus? This Awareness indicates it is as with everything, necessary to look at the frame- work or the glue, the frame of reference which you are asking about, and realize that within that frame of reference, there are certain truths, even though the frame of reference itself may be totally false.

By the way, the latest TV UFO show here showed photos of \"the Cabbit, a pigcow, and a horse with a 5th leg growing out of its back. They had simulations of the clone sector of the alien base showing aliens fetuses inside glass tubes and a wall of cow-bladder look-alike things. I don't think that this was the real video, but an excellent studio copy. All of these UFO programs here have mutilations and copies of the aliens and crafts. They even showed a simulation of an attempt on Cooper's life, where he was run down off his bike by a l&usine and received his big facial scar.\" That essentially is what he said in this latest commun- ication. My other question was, this thing about Lazar: Does Awareness see this as a clamping down, this death threat, or was this just some crank out there? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that these entities appear to have pushed the UFO concerns beyond that which was intended; that there are certain areas of exposition which these entities have given that are of grave annoy- ances to the people who have interests in keeping the information secret; that Lazar as having a kind of naivity that is associated with youth; that Cooper as shaving a kind of conscience that is associated with idealism, and between the two they have given truth a great position in their lives, which many others would like quelched. Speaking of silent weapons of destruction, I spotted an ad in a recent issue oStrcrnge magazine, which I'm going to read to Awareness and ask about. The ad reads:''scott Parker, 1035 Inis, Beaumont, Texas 77706 is in need of any information on \"acoustic shock,' a phenomenon involving an inaudible sound that can be sent over the telephone and will interfere with a person's heart rhythms, possibly killing them.\" That's his classified ad. I'd like to ask Awareness, is there such a thing as 'acoustic shock', and if so, how and why is this being used? * Strange Magazine, PO Box 2246, Rockville, MD. 20852. COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that such a phenomenon could be created to affect the heartbeat through ultra- sound or infrasound, especially through very low freq- uency, so as to be inaudible. The hearing range is only within a narrow band of potential frequencies, and these frequencies can have effect on rhythms and on the frequencies of the electrical body of an individual. The question of why would anyone do this or use this kind of weapon of destruction; it would simply be a way of destroying someone without an obvious weapon, creating a more difficult path to the murderer. This Awareness indicates that it could be done. The question of why people do such can only be answered in the nature of mankind and his or her values."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"QUESTION: 12. .Then this man who wrote this ad, he has heard of this technology, but as Awareness indicated, it has not yet been perfected or implemented. Is that correct? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that it appears that this has been used as a kind of extra low frequency or ultra low frequency weapon since the time of the early 30s; it was known during such times. It has since been perfected and used in different ways for different purposes, and may be considered as a silent or hidden weapon, not commonly used, but available to certain individuals within certain areas of those secret groups involved in military and ulterior types of activities. DOES A NEW TYPE 'RADIATION' CAMERA DETECT ALIENS IN ITS PHOTOGRAPHS 7 QUESTION: In reference to aliens, there's a story in the current Weekly World News. I'd like to read this brief article called \"Space Aliens Among Us: New Camera Exposes Shocking Roof of Extraterrestrials on Earth.\" \"A series of startling new photos provides shocking evidence that space aliens are living and working among us. Researchers using an amazing new 'radiation' camera designed for outer space photography have photographed at least 76 individuals they believe are extraterrestrials. The photos were taken in a major European city, but they suspect aliens have infiltrated human populations worldwide--including the U.S. 'These individuals show up in photos of crowds very clearly,\" explained Dr. Hugo Kornhelm, a Geneva, Switzerland, physicist who helped develop the new camera. 'Their heads are surrounded by a faint green halo which we believe is caused by radiation coming out from their brains. 'The extraordinary thing is that the glowing individuals are completely untraceable. We can locate almost any human shown in our photos, but when we try to track down one of these halo people we run into a dead end every time.\" Dr. Kornhelm and a colleague, Dr. Max Vanderhaufer, discovered the alien-spotting capability of their camera by accident. The sophisticated appartus was designed to pick up space satellites and debris by responding to minute traces of radiation given off by the man-made objects. On a trip from Geneva to Oslo, Dr. Vanderhaufer fired off a number of test shots at an airport after the camera was slightly damaged in transit. The camera worked fine--well enough to record startling images of \"halo people\" mingled with the airport crowds. \"At first we had no idea why these green auras were visible around certain individuals in the picture,\" Dr. Kornhelm said. \"In cooperation with local police, we attempted to find them to see if they had been exposed to radiation in their work or homes. But after months of trying to trace these individuals, we found that they've completely vanished. What's more, we cannot find any signs that they existed. \"There is no evidence the space aliens cause us any harm, but it's frightening anyway. They are hiding out among us and we have no idea what they're up to,\" said Dr. Kornhelm.\" That was the end of the article, and they reproduced b a photograph showing a picture of about 70 entities, about 25 of whom have this halo around them. Will Awareness comment on that story please? . COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that the story as essent- ially accurate in as far as it goes with the informat- ion; that there has been further effort to follow through with other photographs and to track other entities having this halo and this has become a source of concern and interest to those within the intelligence communities of the various nations. This Awareness indicates that the camera as that which can be used for this purpose. It could be used as a principle for developing what may be termed glasses to allow entities to see these auras. The principle would involve a sensitivity in the glasses themselves that would detect radiation, much as is used in the film of the camera; that it could be placed between two glass shields or lenses so that the vision can see through both lenses and the substance that is responsive to the radiation, so that when radiat- ion is detected, it responds and the viewer is able to then see the radiation or halo. It is also possible for entities who can develop the ability to see auras to detect this energy. This Awareness indicates that one must be some- what cautious not to misread an ordinary aura as being of this type, for many entities have strong auras around their head; that generally a green aura simply is an indication of a healthy individual. The energy of radiation as that which shows in the camera as being of a kind of greenish color. It would not necess- arily show the same color for one who is psychic and looking at auras. An entity who is psychic, looking for auras, in observing an entity having such a strong aura as a radiation energy, would simply see an over- whelmingly strong halo.

A strong aura can simply mean an individual is healthy and has a large amount of odic energy in or around the head. This Awareness indicates that the camera as that which does give a relatively clearer view of this energy because it does not pick up the psychic aura or the spiritual aura of the individual. It only picks up the radiation that the individual may be carrying. ARE THESE ENTITIES IN THE PHOTO WALK-INS? (HOW ALIENS ARE INVADING THE HUMAN RACE) 13. This Awareness indicates that they may forget they were ever another entity because their memory merges with the memory that is recorded within the brain of that individual whom they have walked in to. This Awareness indicates that it is a phenomenon that is allowing many of the alien race to begin anew in bodies that have been abandoned by humans, who have the ability to reincarnate, and to create new bodies for themselves. This Awareness indicates that it is not seen as some- thing that entities should be highly worried about, especially as long as these entities continue behaving in a normal fashion.

That it is much likened unto asking is not accurate; that in many cases these entities are the question: \"How can one be sure that what one is simply from other places, travelling, and were not seeing is really being seen, or whether one's eyes are traced because of the inability or inconvenience involved playing tricks on one?

If the entity is descending from a spaceship or in a secluded area wherein you are alone with it, you may want to leap to the conclusion that it may be a space alien, especially if the ship is in view, and you may discern that it is a rare type of Zeta Reticuli that would be friendly to you, and take your chances that you are right, or you may simply split the scene and look for more human types to associate with. This Awareness suggests that hypothetical concerns of this nature are mere exercises in thinking rather than of great practical value, because the likelihood of your ever coming in contact with an alien who is of nonhuman form is very rare. The likelihood of your coming in contact with a walk-in in human form is greater, though such an entity is less likely to cause you any problems and is less likely to be recognized as a walk-in in human form. 14. The likelihood of coming in contact with a human b from the Pleiades is extremely unlikely. If you see someone with large earlobes, whose hair comes down onto the forehead, further than is normal for humans, you may have simply met an abnormal human, or you may have met someone from the Pleiades. The more likelihood is that you have met a human who has large earlobes, whose hair has come down on the forehead further than is normal. This Awareness indicates that it is likely of little con- sequence to you as individuals whether you meet a person from the Pleiades or a walk-in. If you meet a very unusual person with large almond-like eyes, having grey skin, being very short with no distinguishable facial features, or one who is about seven to nine feet tall having a large nose, there is a good chance you may have met one of the Greys from Orion or from Zeta Reticula. This would be significant, and if such occurred to you, and you had the opportunity, it would be wise to go elsewhere with great speed. This Awareness indicates that there is no need to ask questions or seek further identification from such entities, for their appearance would be obvious. - -- - - -- ARE SOME UFOs LIVING CREATURES FROM OUTER SPACE & NOT SPACECRAFT? ( MORE ON OCTAVES. ALPHA & THETA LEVELS. AND T HAT 4 QUADRILLIONTHS OF A SECOND 1 QUESTION: There's an article that I got out of a tabloid sometime back that has a rather interesting frame of reference on this subject. I'd like to read this and ask Awareness if there's any validity at all to this theory. The article says: \"UFOs aren't spaceships-They're living creatures. Many UFOs are actually living creatures from outer space, say experts-who reveal that Prince Charles' great- uncle and mentor, Lord Louis Mountbatten, shared this belief. \"Lord Mountbatten proposed way back in 1952 that UFOs are alive,\" said UFO investigator Timothy Good of Britain, author or \"Above Top Secret: The World- wide UFO Cover-Up.\" \"He outlined his belief in a letter to a British news- paper editor, proposing that UFOs are inhabitants of other planets rather than mere nuts-and-bolts spacecraft.\" Many UFO cases support this astonishing theory, para- normal expert Brad Steiger told the ENQUIRER. \"For instance, there are numerous reports of UFOs moving as though they were creatures rather than space vehicles-such as moving along on the ground and entering and exploring inside homes. \"In one 1973 case, a UFO entered a bedroom in Log- rono, Spain. The resident, Javier Bosque, lay terror- stricken as he watched it maneuvering around his bed. \"Moreover, many descriptions of UFOs down through history describe living creatures-such as in the form of dragons and serpents-moving through the skies. \"These entities from deep space may have the advanced ability to transform themselves into various shapes- making themselves look like animals in the past, and solid spacecraft in modern times. 'They are a unique life-form with highly advanced intelligence.\" Lord Mountbatten, who served as Supreme Allied Commander for Southeast Asia during World War 2, was Prince Charles' personal hero. They were very close, and their many conversations on the paranormal sparked Charles' own well-known fascination with UFOs, said a royal insider. Living UFOs may have evolved on other planets-or from cosmic dust and gas in deep space, said Hayden Hewes, executive director of the International UFO Bureau. \"These sky creatures may even be living, thinking pure energy! \" Hewes said. \"Most assuredly, many UFOs are actually living creatures-and undoubtedly are among the universe's oldest beings. \" That's the end of the article. Would Awareness comment on that please? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that the term UFO as referring to Unidentified Flying 0 bject, but if it is not identified, it can be any object that is flying; that in this sense, this article is correct in many cases. Not in all cases, because some objects that are flying have solid material qualities and are not what would be normally thought of as living beings, cap- able of reproducing themselves, even though within the objects there may be living beings capable of reproducing themselves. This Awareness indicates that in some instances however, these flying objects are indeed capable of reproducing themselves. They are of a vibratory rate that can be photographed by infrared camera and in some cases have been photographed by infrared camera and may be also seen by certain entities who have the capacity to see into the infrared spectrum, such as those who see auras, or they may have the ability to traverse between the 49th Octave and the infrared or 48th Octave, or into the 50th Octave of ultraviolet light."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Y his Awareness indicates that some of these objects I' they move beyond the speed of light and overcome the , are capable of moving through these various freq- concept of space as a limitation.

WHY SUDDEN SlGHTlNGS OF UFOs IN SPAIN, BELGIUM & OTHER PLACES? QUESTION: We got a letter from T.A., who lives in Malaga, Spain, and she sent a long letter about UFOs sometime back which is in my files somewhere, but I'll read this short letter and ask Awareness what is going on. She says: \"I hope that by now you have received my two last letters with some UFO information. Yesterday on TV and in spite of all the coverup, it was said that the town of Brugge, near Gaud, in Belgium, is going crazy with an avalanche of UFO sightings and landings, both during the day and night. It has reached such proport- ions that the police have cordoned certain areas and people are ordered to stay at home. The photos shown on TV, made by the inhabitants, were spotlessly clear and showed many UFOs about to land near the Belgium coast line. Other photos clearly showed the burnt marks left in the fields where they landed. Something really heavy must be going on if people there are in such an uproar.\" That was her comment about UFOs. Does Awareness see this information as being valid and is this going on in Belgium as well as other places around the world, in this proportion? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this did occur there; there has also been what may be termed a UFO flap in England, also in certain areas of Russia, in certain areas of Canada, in China, and in the United States and in Brazil and certain other South Amercian count- directive to the radio and television stations which # allow local reporting, but which does not allow for t national reporting of UFO information. This has of recent times been relaxed considerably, which has allowed for incidents such as the Gulf Breeze sight- ings to be broadcast on nationwide television. This Awareness indicates it is all a part of the loosening of government coverup of the UFO phen- omena, allowing the information to come out grad- ually, to wait for feedback from the public to see how it is received in an effort to determine whether the masses are ready to receive more information, and if the government will become the object or target of wrath from the masses, for having kept the information secret. This Awareness indicates that there is a conflict between many involved in the government, MJ-12 and other groups related to the UFO coverup, in which some want the information released, and others want it kept secret for fear that there will be reprisals demanded by the public for having kept the public from knowing of the alien situation. However, because of this conflict, there have been more releases of infor- mation and the releasing of information will gradually continue so long as there is no panic or overreaction by the public, especially in regard to hostility directed toward government figures, for it is desired and in the best interests of the government that the people now know what is going on in this regard. Give Thanks to Officials for Leaking UFO Info This Awareness indicates that if the people can be given the information in a way that is not disruptive to society and to the government, and agencies in- volved in the coverup, then this is seen as that which would be of greater benefit and which will be allowed to continue. If, on the other hand, entities become panicky, begin to demand action and so forth, it wiIl create paranoia within the higher ranks of government to where they feel it is necessary to control the flow of information, to stop the information, to deny the information as being valid, and to again attempt to coverup. That in this sense, if entities were to write to people involved in the government coverup, it should be thanking them for letting the information of Cooper and Lear and Lazar and these others to be released to the public, and letting them know that you are very grateful that they are being open about the release of UFO information. ries during the past year. This Awareness indicates that the Zeta Reticuli have bases not only in Dulce, New Mexico, they also have bases in England, in Canada, and in other northern states in the United States; that these areas are often areas that are freq- uented by UFO sigh tings. The Radio-TV Directive on Reporting UFO Information This Awareness indicates there are also bases under the sea. There have recently been sightings in Australia; that the sightings of UFOs in the months of February and March were heavy in the area of Oregon and Wash- ington, moreso than at any time in the past two years. Usually these sightings are reported only in local areas and not broadcast on a national level; that there is a GETTING RID OF BILLY GOOMAN'S UFO SHOW: IS THE REASON LEGITIMATE OR A COVERUP? QUESTION: The current UFO magazine states that the Billy Good- man Happening show on KVEG-Radio in Las Vegas, is no longer happening; that they got rid of Goodman because he wasn't up to management's marketing desire, it says. This was the radio show that was very heavy into UFO information, every night, I believe, and many times Cooper, John Lear and English, and these other guys would call in. It was a talk show and they would call in and answer questions and so forth about UFOs and the alien presence. Does Awareness see this as a legitimate ending by management, or is this part of the coverup?"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"17. COSMIC AWARENESS: like locust from the blackness of space.

A VISUALIZATION EXERCISE TO HELP TRANSMUTE THE ALIEN ENEGIES SO A PEACEFUL CO-EXISTENCE CAN OCCUR (The Hrling Prow Can Bagin with Your Help) QUESTION: One final question here tonight. We've received quite a few letters from members along this same line, and I'd like to read this letter by R.J., of Gilroy, California, who presents a possible idea for dealing with this sit- uation. He writes: \"The recent reading concerning the Zeta Reticuli, or Greys, is disturbing. If the current drug mania is an outgrowth of their influence, then we can assume correctly that their presence has already harmed man both spiritually and physically. I understand Aware- ness's neutrality or objectivity, but we should be more than depositors of information for the tolerance of collective mind consciousness. Our history is replete with examples of what happens when a superior culture meets one of lesser development. There may initially be coexistence, but in time man will be placed in a subservient position. There is one consoling ace,--\"life is the s ort of the lp absolute,\" as stated by %r Rarnakrishna. he plan of Divine Providence may include men experiencing de- volution for a while, or until we incarnate as Zeta Riticuli. There is movement and action on this plane. We should not sit idly by and allow the Greys to descend COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this is very clear and very correct in its evaluation and as a type of ritual that can be used in the visualization and energizing process. This Awareness indicates that It is concerned for the human race on this plane.Its concern is as much for the potential that the human race offers moreso than for the performance of the human race. The human race is cap- able of great things. Its performance has been meager. This is not in reference to those involved in spiritual pursuits and to many of those who have artistic and bus- iness activities, but in general, many of the leaders of the human race have either been negligent or aggressively hostile toward others of the human race, and there has been much conflict between cultures, groups and indiv- iduals in the human race, so that it has brought on much of its own karma,--but there is a certain potential that is present in the human race that deserves nurturing and a chance."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"18. This Awareness indicates that the Greys generally lack this potential, though they have a great technology and have had a long history and have, in many ways, suffered long periods of time under the domination of the Reptilians, and in some ways they too deserve a greater chance; but because they have, through engineer- ing and through inbreeding, attempted to remove any vestiges of passion, emotion and other soul stuff from their bodies, they have become more likened unto shells than beings. Their potential has diminished. They are essentially a dying race. Their only hope is through intermingling or interbreeding or intergenetic relation- ship with humans. This Awareness indicates that because of this, and because humans have only begun to reach their potential, It would like to see the human race con- tinue to have a chance to fulfill its potential. This Awareness indicates that the ritual suggestion given by this entity and the visualization process suggested by the entity as that which can be of considerable value in helping to create a state of consciousness on this plane that will have an effect, for all things stem first from consciousness and manifest into physical. Thus, the entities who can create concepts of a collective nature have the potential to heal great disturbances and wounds. The entity is correct in assuming that the human race would be subjugated by this high technology if it were placed in a position of subordinance and that the likelihood of such a position of subordinance is greater, unless the human race bands together in a collective unit. This Awareness suggests therefore, that the practice and the application of this kind of thinking, visualizing imagery, as that which can begin the healing process. This Awareness indicates that there are other factors also, but none of these factors will be of any benefit. The factor of your own government and military forces, the factor of your relationship with Pleiadeans and other human types in space; none of these will count or be of any significance if the human race itself is not unified and together in a kind of spiritual, philo- sophical and collective unit, working for the good of all. This Awareness indicates therefore, this may be thought of as the first and most important primary action that entities can now take. This Awareness suggests also that entities may benefit by searching out recommended sources of information, reviewing video tapes, audio tapes, books on this topic, so as to become knowledgeable enough to be able to talk to others, to infonn others without seeming to be foolish in appearance and to be able to refer entities to these books and sources for further enlightenment, for now is the time wherein entities can wake up others to this new reality; that they might understand the true history of man on earth and the present conditions and the future possibilities.

COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this does not appear to be of any great concern. It does appear that a certain aloofness in that relationship be maintained; that you not develop any closer ties. The entity himself as having certain troubles in regard to personal identity. That it appears that your occasional visitation and brief comm- unications in regard to eating at his restaurant or discuss- ing things in a mundane and light manner are without great consequences, even if there were some monitoring occurring. It does not appear the aliens have any kind of designs on you or Avaton because you have never had any pact with them, in any past-life relationship, and therefore are off- ( limits to them. There is, however, some concern in regard to the work you are doing and the fact that it is exposing information, which they seek to keep quiet. This does requi a certain amount of discipline on your part; that you not feel too confident or too careless and negligent about your own safety.

If this occurs too frequently, there can be hazards involved in this work that could become extremely troublesome. That generally, it would take place as something other than physical threats or physical abduction, but it could occur in ways that could be extremely harmful to YOU.

There's an article being circulated through various UFO magazines and others, called Alien Embassies on Earth, by Diane Tessman. Ill read some of it now: - Are 'alien embassies\" opening around planet Earth? There is convincing evidence that this is exactly what is happening as the decade of the 1990s gets underway. The space intelligences who are visiting Earth and contacting its citizens, of course cannot staff these embassies directly because they would be immediately imprisoned by the govern- ments of Earth. However, those humans with whom the aliens have had ongoing contact are working harder than ever to bring Peace, justice, and unconditional love to Earth, while helping to Stop the destruction of the planet itself. And it is these humans --Star people and light workers-who are staff'mg the embassies. , There have also been reports of actual aliens appearing at these embassies on a regular basis; citizens around the globe havebeen able to meet them, face to face, in a friendly, relaxed way. This is certainly a new phase of alien contact with Earth and one which promises to continue and grow. '1 wandered into a healing In a Dublin hotel,\" reports Mrs. Carol McFarlane of Finglas, a suburb of Dublin, Ireland. 'I hoped to get Some ideas on how to help my mother who has a serious form of cancer. In fact, I did receive some wonderful instruction in healing and my mother is holding her own currently, whereas before, she was not. But I had no idea I'd meet an alien and be asked to visit his embassy on Earth. That's exactly what happened! l got to chatting with who I fist thought was a child, then I thought he was a dwarf, when I looked at him across the room. Up close, it quickly dawned on me and--he told me psychically, explaining himself-that he was a space alien. I could feel how bving and enlightened he was and his conversation, in perfect English with a slight accent, was very much this way as well. We talked for about 15 minutes, though that's hard for me to guess because I was so mthralled I lost track of time. He asked me to visit his embassy- that was the word he used--in the countryside, and gave me the location. He explained that embassies of foreign nations are always in cities but that for his safety's sake, the permanent embassy for his planet was outside the city of Dublin but that this healing seminar was a temporary extension of the embassy for that weekend.\" Carol's experience is similar to other reports which we have received from New York, San Francisco, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Detroit, London, Rome, Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and Mel- bourne. We are sure that there are many other cities worldwide from which we have yet to receive active reports. This is a won- drous development which has just begun to occur as the year 1990 gets underway. In some cases, New Age bookstores and crystal shops are also embassies. If a person frequents these places and talks in depth with the staff, he may well find himself being asked to meet a very special friend shortly thereafter. Sheila of The Rising Moon Book- store near Detroit, Michigan, explains, 'Adelle and I own this little bookstore and it is a part of our star purpose, we fell. It is a dream come true. In addition to the first dream come true, we have also recently had another dream come true ... a special friend who is not of this Earth has become available to us on a regular basis. The one thing she asks is that she be able to meet as many human beings as possible as long as we first decide that the individual human is non-violent and has a good attitude about meeting an alien. I know this sounds crazy, but this is exactly what is happening. Our friend became available to us in this endeavor on January 5, 1990, so it is strictly a phenomenon of the new decade.\" The alien embassies are not yet in the huge conservative build- ings where embassies of foreign nations are usually found. There is no alien flag which fles (in fact, our alien friends do not believe in flags as a nationalistic proclamation for themselves. They feel that flags are fine for Earth nations but they do not have the same need for such a proclamation). However, as 1990 dawns, the proof continues to mount up: alien embassies are indeed being established on Mother Earth! My question is this: Is there any truth at all to this information, or is thii, as I suspect, more of the Pollyanna type stuff being put out by so many? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this appears to be more of the what you term 'Pollyanna' type of infor- mation. It appears that it is related to the more fantasy phenomena associated with the socalled 'Star children.' This being that which relates to the human phenomenon that this Awareness referred to at one point as the Wander- ers, but which is more or less a commercialization of the . - work resulting or springing out of the book, Star Pe-opk; that it is based somewhat on wishful thinking and some what on a psychic belief in the UFO aliens as being here to help humans. This does not appear to be related to the Pleiadeans, nor to the Greys. It appears rather to be more of a earth/human phenomena organization based on New Age concepts and wishful thinking; however, it could become organized sufficiently so that some alien force could take control of such and use it for purposes of an embassy or network interfacing with humans. At this time it does not appear this was organized in any way by aliens, not in the sense of extraterrestrial aliens; that the humans who see themselves as 'Star People' having been born of earth parents; that they may have had origins in previous lives from other planets, or other places. This Awareness indicates, however, that this does not mean the network could not change at some future date to become a genuine bonafide network for alien interface with humans or even with implant humans. *ED'S Note: There's a mail order hustle that's been going on for some years that preys on the gullible egotist. You get a computerized letter, using your personal name, stating that you are a \"star person\" and one of a privileged few (they can tell by your sun sign!) and if you send them $20 they will send you a written certificate that proves it. For an extra $10 they will even send you a book on the subject of 'Star People'. This is all supposed to make you special from others, appealing to your spiritual snobbery. This is horse manure, pure and unadult- erated. Everyone on earth is a 'star person' in a sense and if you have to pay money to be convinced of that fact, you haven't learned much in this lifetime. Over the years this editor has received some really remarkable bull in letters from people who used their purchased 'Star Person' handle as credentials for the 'channeling' they enclose for my benefit.

She writes: \"In 1961, three rockhounds, one of them named Mikesell found a geode in the Cosgo mountains of Calif- ornia that was encrusted with fossil shells. When the geode was cut in half, instead of a cavity, the object con- tained a circular section of apparent ceramic material with a two millimeter shaft of bright metal in its center. Sliced in two, the object showed a hexogonal part, a porcelain or ceramic insulator with a central metallic shaft, and the remains of a corroded piece of metal with threads. The impression is that the object is man-made, and some kind of electrical device,--specifically, a sparkplug. However, geologists say the fossil shells encrusting the outer edge of the geode must have taken at least 500,000 years to attain its present form. Is it possible for Awareness to tell us the origins of this artifact and perhaps something about the culture that produced it?

That given sufficient time and sufficient type of environment, these things can be encrusted or covered; that in a recent tabloid and also on CNN, the Chinese government announced the finding of a burial ground in the side of a cliff. It was not understood how they were able to bury these entities in the side of a cliff. The cliff being almost straight up, not quite, and the bodies being buried back into the cliff, were discovered as having been there for several thousand years. Upon the excavation they discovered this one body with what appeared to be a kind of recording device or a Walkman- type device. This Awareness indicates this simply indicates the technology of space aliens, or human aliens of the past and their influence on the earth from ancient past, showing that technology in the past was much higher than humans wer imagined, at least until now. It is as much like a primitive island in a remote area on earth wherein a civilization in the United States and Europe is thriving, but on the primitive island, the entities have never seen anything of that civilization, except occasionally seeing some strange bird going overhead that hums and flies in a straight line, and on occasion finds something on their island that is out of place with their reality. If at some point one of these strange birds would land near their island and develop for them a more modern civilization, and then in their excavation they would discover that deep down in the earth they had found a pickaxe, dated long before the arrival of the civilization, they might wonder: \"How could HOW ALIENS ARE CHANGING YOUR REALITY (Closing Message): This Awareness indicates that there is an entirely new world for entities to discover at this time. The world that entities have lived in, has been changed by the change of information they have. What was real is now unreal, but what would be considered unreal yesterday has now become a reality. The element of the equation of the presence of aliens on your earth, in your history, in the universe as creators and destroyers, alters the concepts which you have long lived with. Your realities have changed and will con- tinue to change as you absorb and digest this information. This Awareness indicates that at any time new inform- ation enters into a system and is processed, it is possible for entities to benefit by the way they perceive their new reality, or to suffer by the way they perceive their new reality. This Awareness suggests you look always at the new reality, from day to day, from moment to moment, with a perception that brings you and your loved ones greater benefits and that you minimize fear and strengthen your faith in the future, and in yourselves, and in those things which are held dear to you. **** (The Law of Gratitude is given) WHAT TO DO IF YOUR HUSBAND IS REPLACED '9 ( C.A.C.

Is this man who is so similar yet different than my husband of many years, a double of my real husb- and? Is his body now inhabited by a walk-in?

THE WILL STEGER EXPEDITION 70 SOUTH POLE -WHAT WAS THE REAL REASON FOR THE TREK7 ( More on the Hollow Earth QUESTION: A Question from W.E., St. Paul, Mn. Actually there's several questions. I'll read his statement. \"A lot of media attention is being given to the Will Steger expedition and his trek across Ant- arctica, especially in Minnesota, his home state. His international team will travel to the South Pole, transversing the continent in the process and will probably come home as heros. Anyone who is familiar with the Awareness readings on the Hollow Earth, knows that there is a polar opening several hundred miles wide, and the South Pole is nothing but a point in space above the opening. Is this expedition a gigantic put-on to deter any suspicions that there is no South Pole or a polar opening leading to an inner world? Is our government afraid that too many may learn the truth too soon? How long do they expect to keep the truth from us? I believe that Steger will circumvent the polar opening, claiming to cross the South Pole, or does Awareness see the expedition set up by the government to explore the opening? I also believe the world population will be outraged once the truth is learned of the openings and how the world governments purposely withheld this inf- ormation in the name of world security. Could Awareness please comment?\" COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that the pole itself as a hypothetical point, but the magnetic pole is that which moves around the rim and entities in moving in that direction will find their compasses suggest- ing a kind of haywire activity, so that they cannot determine which way is South when they get into [5. the close vicinity of this line that tends to follow the rim for some distance, this magnetic line of energy. This Awareness indicates that generally, the cover- up will continue in this regard for a number of years to come, and the entities involved in the trek, many of them being unaware of the opening, because it is not as though they could walk up to a hole; there is never that sense of walking up to a hole; they could walk and walk and would even walk into the hole without even knowing it if they were to walk in that direction because the curvature leading into the hole runs many miles and they would simply see themselves going over a hill, or over terrain for a long distance. Light would alter, cloudcovering might change, but they would be more likely to assume it was natural phenomena than to realize it had to do with their entering into this hole, keeping in mind the opening as that which is hundreds of miles across. This Awareness indicates that indeed, this would be a considerable shock to the public were this to be officially released, that there is an opening into the inner part of the planet. This Awareness indicates however, that in time, this information will be released, most likely after entities are told of similar hollow qualities in other planets. This Awareness indicates that much of this potential release of this information will also depend on which way things go in regard to the alien issue. (Follow-Up Question): The life-forms that Awareness has referred to in the past as existing in the socalled Hollow Earth, and all of those books and stories relating to this thing; these are different entities are they not, than the entities Awareness has been referring to as the aliens in New Mexico? COSMIC AWARENESS: This ~wkeness indicates that this is in the affirmative; that these inner earth entities as being more highly evolved; that those of the subterranean bases are technologically evolved, but have certain lack of spiritual evolution and have evolved along different lines than humans, and of course those that have been referred to as Deros are even less human, more as subhuman types, being a kind of .cross between humanoid and the aliens; more of a short squatty animalistic human type. This in reference to Deros. (Follow-Up Question): Are the Deros and these aliens referred to lately, going to get along together if the tunnels sort of run into one another? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates they do not like each other. They are very similar in some ways in terms of their lack of compassion, but they are what may be termed mortal enemies. They simply do not like each other; they see each , other as threats to their own plans and there is some coop- ' eration or recognition of boundaries, but there is consider- able hostility between them."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"16. *ED'S Note: For more information on the hollow earth, deros, aliens, UFOs, etc., please refer to 'Revelations of Awareness' issues No. 79-25; (The Secret of the UFOs) $4.00; 83-18 (Expanding the Mind); $3.00; 85-15 (The Dark Side of the Moon)$3.00; 86-1 (Some 1 ' Mysteries of the Pyramids Expbined)$3.00; 89-1 (Some Possibilities in the Coming Nbnths?)$3.00;89-7 (ET1s Go Home!)$S.OO; 90-2 (The Alien Presence: The Secret Government Exposed) $5.00 from C.A.C. A WORD ABOUT THE MESSAGES YOU RECEIVE (AWARENESS ASKS: 'WHERE DO YOU STAND?\") (Opening Mecsrp,CAC. Gened Reading) October 7,1990 COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness wishes to express appreciation to those entities who have assisted C.A.C. financially and in other ways in getting the information regarding the UFO and alien situation out during this past year. This Awareness indicates that it has been a considerable expense in terms of the time and energy as well as money for this organization to accomplish this particular mission which has its own unique urgency at this time. This Awareness indicates that there are some entities who appreciate and understand the urgencies and need for the support from the readership. There are many who do not understand this. It wishes to remind entities that organizations such as this in getting information out are the kind of organizations that can help preserve the comfort, freedom and lifestyle that most entities wish to maintain, and this Awareness suggests those who have not contributed toward this, should recognize and app- reciate the efforts of those who have. This Awareness indicates in a sense, others contributing are taking on some of your karma for you in making life easier by helping to spread information that is urgent in keeping your lifestyle free of those forces that would enslave you; that down through history this has always been the way things occur. There have always been those who shoulder or help to shoulder the responsibility of caring for others, and there are always those who are willing to let others shoulder such responsibility and who meanwhile, care for themselves. It is suggested that each entity determine where you stand and whether indeed you are doing what you feel is right for you in this regard, and that you consider this to be a measure of karma owed you or karma you may owe to others, in accordance with your responsiveness to such urgencies. This Awareness suggests those who have contributed little should feel a great gratitude toward those who have contributed much. Without the contributions of those who have taken on responsibilities for the organization, the information could not have been released. It is so likewise in regard to future conditions, for this organization. This Aware- ness essentially wishes to remind entities that they are making these messages possible by their contributions to the work. This Awareness suggests that questions now be asked. TAKE TIME TO SMELL THE ROSES1 ( Closing Message, C.A.C. General Reading ) Sept. 11,1990 This Awareness indicates that enormous amounts of information have been channeled during the past nine months, regarding the alien technologies, regard- ing the events and potential events to come. Enormous information has been given prior to that regarding cosmic metaphysics and along with this, the expansion of consciousness into the realization of life throughout this universe and other universes. It is enough to cause one's head to sweat with confusion, with questions, with a desire to ask no more questions, with a desire to forget everything that has been asked. This Awareness indicates that entities should not forget now and then, in spite of all that has been given recently in this past year, should not forget to take time to smell the roses, to walk along the path in nature, to enjoy an outing near the shore, to visit friends, to play with children, to call a loved one. This Awareness indicates that it is important that entities maintain some contact with their mundane lives, in spite of all that has been given, which would literally spin the heads of entities around in 360 degrees or more. 1 .c HOW TO RECEIVE THIS NEWSLETTER BY MAlL 'Revelations of Awareness' is a cosmic newsletter, published every 3 weeks, more or less, by Cosmic Awareness Communications, P.O.

That this is essentially a scenario or overview of the changes that are occurring; that the forces are in struggle with one another; that there is a greater breakdown in the government support that has been traditional toward Israel because the government now in the United States tends to be more toward the Fascist nature than towards the Zionist and liberal type, and the BolsheviWZionist factor of Israel as that which does not have sufficient (or as much) power over Washington as it did have a decade or so back. That essentially the Fascists have gained greater power in Europe, the United States and Russia during the past two administrations. This does not imply that Naziism or anything of that type will ever again rise to the heights of notoriety as was witnessed during World War II. There is however, some potential for this to continue. This Aware- ness indicates that there is a potential of war in the Middle East. If it occurs, it will be in part due to elements associated with the aliens; that there is some potential for the aliens to attempt to trigger a war in the Middle East, to get the humans fighting each other, as they have done so often down through history, over religious beliefs, or over cultural differences, and the most easily ignitable area for this is in the Middle A RISING NEO-NAZI THREAT IN GERMANY? ( The Alien Connection ) (FOLLOW-UP QUESTION): There are a number of stories lately, that a lot of people in Europe, particularly the smaller countries that were dominated by Germany during World War 11, are very paranoid about what's happening with Eastern Germany and the talk of reunification, and they say now that West Germany is the most powerful country economically in Europe and there's all kinds of fears, plus there are stories that anti-Semitism is rising up again and that there are neo-Nazi type organizations making themselves heard. Does Awareness see this as being the threat that some of these people in Europe think it is? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this has some degree of validity; that the threat is not of great importance at this time, but it does need to be watched so that it does not begin to develop and grow more powerful. That the purpose of reunifying Germany at this time as also related to the alien threat; that Germany has long been involved with the CIA in helping to deal with the aliens; that there have been connections between and arrangements with Germans and the CIA in this regard for quite some time, and these entities, these German entities working with the CIA, constitute a powerful alliance and it is seen that by bringing about this unification, Germany can become a power quite helpful in the event of a war with the aliens; that Russia, Germany and theunited States, working together to build up the technology needed to fight off an invasion by the Reptoids would be a powerful axis or alliance; that the other nations would also participate. This Awareness indicates that there is more to this than can be released; that this Awareness cannot safely divulge further information relating to the involvement or relation- ship of the aliens in regard to what is occurring in these areas, without offending certain elements; that offending action could bring problems.

It is also suggested that by '97 the Reptilian or Reptoid invasion could occur. A space war could break out. However, the potential for this is approximately 50 percent. It is approximately 50 percent likely that a space war or war in the Middle East will occur between 1993 or 1997, or will be in progress and developing during that time period. In the event it occurs, the United States and Russia will be seen as al!ies, along with most of the European countries. It will be the powers in the Middle East that will tend to be the aggressors in such a potential war. There is, of course, the 50 percent chance that it will not occur, and entities can energize this.

She writes: Dear Friends, We were pleased to get your letter. We have indeed heard our son speak of you many times in glowing and loving terms. We're delighted that you are moving up here and looking forward to meeting you. We don't know much about the job market. We do know that many have not been able to find work in their fields and have taken minimum wage jobs. But you prob- ably won't have much trouble finding work in your fields. At this time we don't know anyone who might provide you with temporary parking space for your travel trailer on their property, ..but will continue to ask. There may be many who would. You just need to find them. Perhaps an ad in the newspaper you spoke about would connect you with possibilities. You asked for any advise that we might could give you concern- ing current conditions in Washington State. A reminder to be care- ful what you ask for, for you will surely get it. Of course, we can only give you our view of what it looks like to us. The 'Enlightened One' told us that he would give his last verbal teachings in May '88. After that he would still be with us ... teaching us in a non-verbal manner. No one wanted to believe that he was really going to stop channeling, and force us to look within our- selves to get his non-verbal teachings. And if he stopped channeling through her, how would his channel maintain her lifestyle, which according to a report on her divorce in a local newspaper, cost app- roximately $37,000 a month. She had tried giving seminars on her own and had very few customers. Remember the story about the Emperor who had no clothes? Well, shortly after the Enlightened One made his announcement, a few folks noted a change in his voice, his lingo, and his overall style. But no one that I knew of dared to suggest that he had in fact left. May '88 came and went and his channel continued to schedule events. A story appeared in the \"newspaper\" explaining that it had been the channel and not the Enlightened One that had been planning to quit channeling in May. Wonderously she had experienced a personal breakthrough and was now willing to continue channeling. The new teachings that came forth contradicted the Enlightened One's teachings. It was admitted that the old teaching was a lie ... that we really don't get to choose our parents because we're too far down on the evolutionary scale to be allowed that privilege. The entity quit referring to himself as the Enlightened One, and just leaves it up to the audience to assume that they are in the presence of the Enlightened One. Unlike the Enlightened One, the entity began to accept and revel in the praise and worshipful stand- ing ovations. He says he deserves such and encourages more of the same. The Enlightened One has had quite a bit to say about Jehovah and his fear-inspiring tact.ics of mass murder, power displays and inhumane treatment of his people. Now, in the Bible it is recorded that Jehovah and his angels utterly destroyed the cities named Sodom and Gomorrah. Well, on the UFO tape sets this entity claims that his people are the beautiful, tall, blond people of the angelic order talked about in the Bible. He said that he is their prophet. He says they are the ones who blew up Sodom and Gomorrah with their huge beamships, and that such actions may again be necessary. He stated that if you are in judgement about, or can't stomach such power displays, then you are not yet ready for his secret teachings. He declared that his beamship is currently in our skies again ... That our government is aware of the huge ship that covers half the sky, and said some of our government officials are foolish enought to think that they could shoot it down. He laughed scoffingly at such a preposterous idea, said this ship is capable of annihilating the entire planet with one blast. This FEAR inspiring threat of awesome power coupled with this entity's blatant admission that he is the god of the Old Test- ament in the Bible should have been enough to jolt us awake and cause us to realize that he isn't our beloved Enlightened One. The Enlightened One never used FEAR inspiring tactics. He inspired only LOVE because he is the essence of LOVE. The Enlightened One and another famous channeled entity warned us many, many times that Jehovah was corning back and that he would amass a following through channeled behavior. They told us to not be naive enough to think that he would be stupid enough to appear through a channel and speak, \"Hi, I'm Jehovah. Worship me or Ill blow you all to bits.\" He's far too clever for that. We were warned that there was no way to tell where he might appear ... who he might channel through. That the only way that we could recognize him was by what he teaches and the FEAR he inspires by his secretive and deceptive tactics. They said he would say, \"Follow me and my teachings, for I am the only one who can teach you what you need to know in order to make it through the days to come.\" He would give forth dogma and rituals that are supposed to save you in exchange for your giving your power unto him by loyal worship of him and his sacred SECRET teachings. Now this secretive entity is teaching these very things in a very aggrandized manner, \"Make the sacrifice of big bucks paid to my channel to be in my ten year school for enlightenment ... Be in all of the required events ... Prove your worthiness to receive the sacred SECRET teachings by demonstrating your passion by being at all of the events you possibly can ... and most of all you must keep your mouth shut and tell no one about the sacred SECRET teachings. The SECRET teachings will be delivered as you prove your worthiness to receive them. I watch you ... and if you tell the teachings to anyone, the rest of the teachings will not be given.\" I said that he is teaching these things in a very aggrandized manner .... I meant aggrandizing to him and his channel ... but certainly not to the students. The students are required to sit and lay on their blankets laid in horse manure in a large and crowded arena.

This Awareness indicates it is of little consequence whether entities live in this area or some other area, in terms of safety factors; that the message was more toward that of subjective purposes and interests in which the message was interfered with by these subjective interests. This Awareness suggests that this area as not being that much safer, in general, than most other areas of similar quality. It all depends on what kind of safety you refer to. In reference to earthquakes, this area as safer than some, and not as safe as others. In reference to potential for nuclear holocaust, this area as not being safe, for if attacks were to occur in a military sense, the Boeing industry would be targeted and the area locally would be hit with the repercussions and firestorms that would result. This Awareness indicates that this of course is of little likelihood, but must be considered when discussing safety. That in terms of safety regarding economic concerns, this area is not any more economically sound than most other areas in the nation. It does have some diversities which have economic benefits but not any greater than most areas. Weatherwise, it may be seen as safer than areas in which there are tropical storms, but it does have rain and cold weather at times. That generally speaking, it is a pleasant area, but there are many other pleasant areas in the nation. This Awareness indicates It sees no reason why this prediction was made in regard to actualities. ED'S NOTE: Olympia has had a number of rather severe earthquakes in the past, which took lives and caused much damage. In fact, 40 years ago Olympia had one that registered 7.1 on the Richter scale. Last year's San Francisco quake was registered at 6.9 and you saw the damage of that one on TV. This printed letter from Toni and Jerry was mailed in May, 1989, but since then they have published several more on this same issue. A few weeks ago CAC received another of these printed letters, this one 12 pages long, and explains to those many Ramtha followers who wrote to them that they were \"Ramtha bashing\" exactly why they feel that Rarntha \"The Enlightened One\" has left, as promised, and is no longer being channeled by J.Z. Knight, and the entity who is now coming through her channel is none other than Jehovah, who they believe is leading innocent Ramtha followers down the left-handed path. Using the very words this entity has uttered through the lips of J.Z. Knight, Toni and Jerry present an extremely compelling, logical and straightforward, non- judgmental argument for their cause. Having read Ramtha's philosophy in the white book (which CAC sells, incidentally) and having no quarrel with it, this editor can not help but agree that whoever is coming thru the JZ channel these days, it certainly is not the gentle, loving Rarntha. What is really scary is that the entity, in an ongoing series of expensive seminars, is telling his students that comes the time of passing over, they must not go toward the light, but turn the other way, avoiding the light and head into the darkness, the 'void1 as he calls it. This is contrary to everything Awareness has ever told us on this subject. CAC has quite a few Ramtha people in its member- ship, but my personal efforts to get them to discuss this issue, along with the UFO information purportively put out by that organization, is met by a stony silence. Evidently, they have been sworn to secrecy, or perhaps been threatened. Whatever reason, they keep their mouths shut. No sharing of the UFO information, no warnings to humanity of the horrific implications to come if the public is not informed, each appears to be only taking care of 'Number One.' The last few times I have driven out to Yelm to check out the Ramtha bookstore, I have felt a sort of pall and paranoia hovering over the area. The store is always full of smiling people who nod and whisper with that smug little look that people sometimes get when they feel they know something the yokels out there in the street do not have access to. My conclusions were that for many of them it is a selfish trip. They are taking care of number one, digging in for the heavy times ahead; utilizing copper and other things to hopefully protect them from surveilance, from monitoring by aliens and authorities etc. There does not appear to be any concern for anyone outside the esoteric sanctions of the Ramtha stronghold, no effort that I could see to alert the ' ignorant' masses. Although the welfare roles have swelled to new heights in that area since JZ put out that threatening call that implied, 'if you want to save your ass, move to Yelm!\" there appears to be many who have not mastered the vaunted message, \"don't worry about the cost, we will teach you how to 'manifest'. I take this to mean that if you can't come up with the thousand bucks needed for a couple of weekends at the ranch, you are not evolved spiritually enough to come anyway, since you have failed to 'manifest' the required entrance fees. This editor was recently accused of 'Ram Bashing' because I had the temerity in a recent fundraising letter to suggest that we did not operate like our expensive neighbors down the road in Yelm. This punched the buttons of 4 other CAC people who are also involved in the Ramtha brain-washing. I asked one lady who really was steamed, \"Okay, please tell me what $30 will buy you from JZ Knight?\" ($30 at the time was the membership CAC was charging for a year's worth of newsletter containing the Cosmic Awareness philosophy and information). I never received an answer from the lady. I figare these are probably all well-meaning people who require a guru to tell them what to do, particularly a guru who can dazzle them on TV and hang out with soap opera stars and other celebrities. Hope- fully they canlearn from Awareness how to contact that 'guru' within themselves, not their \"monkey minds\" as the entity posing as Ramtha calls it, and hopefully they will learn to share their newfound awareness levels with others. As Awareness has indicated, when one learns to truly go within self, there is no paranoia, no isolation; there is only the truth and love, and this is given and shared with others, a gift that no amount of ~minars, no amount of dollars can ever buy. Jonestown was a cult that ended up with a thousand dead bodies all over the place. Will Yelm end up with a thousand programmed robots who cannot think for them- selves,-dead brains whose egos are allowing them to be led down a one-way path to hell and damnation? This last letter from Toni and Jerry implies just that, and I suggest that anyone, all CAC people and particularly those of you who are following the so-called 'Ram' these days, get a copy of this letter and study it, then meditate upon it. There is no charge, Toni and Terri say, except they request you send them a large Number 10 envelope, self-addressed and with TWO postage stamps thereon, and they will mail you the 12 page letters explaining all of this. Personally, I would suggest sticking in a paper dollar or two to help these entities get tbis information out. Paper, ink and printing does cost.

QUESTION : We occasionally get questions like this one from J.J. particularly since we've been advising the new members to review some of the earlier material. She asks: ''The current Carter family emerges in the news from time to time, all three of them in connection with the best of causes: pacifism, ecology, building homes for the poor, etc. In what possible fashion does this serve the purposes of those who replaced the originals with these, or is it simply a function of the duplicative material used?

You cannot have it both ways. It is likened unto throwing away your property, then after someone picks it up, cleans it up, polishes and restores it, coming back to claim it as your own again; this is not acceptable under any kind of law, earthly or Galactic. What Can You Do ? This Awareness indicates that in the sense wherein entities ask: What can we do about this situation?', there is very little that individuals can do in situations such as yours other than to become aware and to share what you are aware of with others. If by chance a great awakening occurs, even if it takes several years for the masses to awaken, the chances of the aliens being able to subdue humanity decreases in direct proportion to the awareness of humanity regarding the alien agenda and purpose. Thus, by becoming aware and helping to make others aware, each entity can do his or her part. When you con- ' sider that it was only about a year ago that the entity William Cooper began to give forth information in regard to the Zeta Reticuli and some of these alien intrigues, COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that there are many things occurring at once in a kind of synchronicity. The agenda of the aliens is part of the total scenario for humanity's progress. The aliens may be thought of as a kind of catalyst to get humans evolving more rapidly from their stupor, to awaken the masses from their slumber. That it is as though there are forces even above the alien Reptoid and Zeta Reticuli forces that are overseeing this general drama that is occurring on the stage of earth in this stage of human existence, and in overseeing this, these higher forces are allowing certairi things to take place so as to have an effect on the consciousness of humanity. If they move too scon, humanity will not awaken. Humanity tends to awaken more out of fear than out of promise. Things may be promised, but until entities fear something, they do not easily become stirred up to leave their comfort zone and to go into a more dis- turbing area of consciousness that would awaken them from their comfort.

This Awareness indicates that A does not wish to discourage this effort if entities truly believe they have found a way of removing these implants, but It does suggest that hard evidence would be most encourag- ing to entities and if there is a way of contacting through radionics or through other instruments, contacting some frequency to indicate the presence of an implant, with sufficient evidence thereafter of removal, to show that the implant is no longer present, this would be of great value. This Awareness indicates that Catscans can be used for locating and for showing the absence of an implant; that if entities can indeed provide some indication with credible authorities as witnesses, this would be of great value to thousands. There are approximately 26 million entities in the United States with implants, most of whom would like to have them removed. WOULD 'MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING' DEVICES FOR CANCER DETECT IMPLANTS? (FOLLOW-UP QUESTION): There's a great deal of publicity and promotion going on now on the 'magnetic resonance.imaging' device that doctors are encouraging women to use (for a large fee) in their office to detect early breast cancer. Does Awareness see that technique as also detecting implants? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness suggests that this may be a possibility with certain modifications involved; that this could be an approach, were one to find a doctor having such an instrument who was willing to use the instrument for such experimentations. *** Please Note: \"More Flesh for the Skeleton\" is an ongoing feature of this newsletter. If you want more information on the alien presence, please write to CAC for a free list of backissues available on this subject. ED'S Note: This entity hawking this service (\"removingii implants for $500), was given the information in this reading, as he has pestered the editor for months to plug his service to our readers and members. His response to the above information from Awareness was that now his method was \"dissolving\" the implants so it was not possible to send us a sample of an implant he removed. The entity is probably honest and well-meaning (although a bit too wide-eyed for my money), but the fact remains: How do you know for certain you have an implant, and if you do know for sure, how do you know for certain that it has been removed? You can't. So it is a natural for any charleton to con entities into handing over their money if they think they have an implant and do not bother to investigate the service. This editor is not at all convinced. It is not our practice to plug a service by someone who has not convinced us the service is valid and honest and worth the fee that may be charged. Another thing we consider in this regard is the fact that many CRC people have written us, convinced they do have an implant usually because of some vivid dream about aliens. When we check their letters out with Sam or with Awareness, it was usually revealed that there was no implant. For one thing, Awareness has indicated that entities who have been abducted usually have made an agreement in some prior lifetime to allow this abduction to occur, this being some form of contract. Awareness has also indicated (in a reading just days ago) that the CAC membership is 85% composed of Wanderers who came to this plane for the sole purpose of awakening humanity to the alien threat on this planet. It has taken many years for these entities to do much of anything constructive on their assignments because up until recently you were killed or driven insane if you talked about the possibility of aliens being on this planet, other than possibly dis- cussing movies about them. Thanks to UFO researchers like Valerian and the socalled 'Whistle-blowers' like Cooper, Lear, et al., that 85% of you can now begin to get down to some serious business of helping to awaken humanity to this threat. Awareness has indicated age is no factor: some of you are young, some middle-aged, some 'senior citizens' (don't you simply despise that handle?) So most of you have been able to sail through life, taking many side trips, until your High Self finally notifies you, \"Okay, the party's over. Now it is time to get down to the business of why you came to this plane in the first place.\" My point in bringing this up is that the 85% of you who are on this mission, it seems logical to me, that you would not have made any previous agreements with the aliens, and therefore you do NOT have any implants to worry about! You are therefore free to start working on your mission. There ARE some CAC people who do have implants for one reason or another, but this should not stop them from informing others either. So, if my reasoning is correct, 85% of you do not have to feel. paranoid about having an implant. You may have had some very vivid dreams about aliens etc., but these were probably to help awaken you to your mission. So save your money, even if you think you have an implant. Until we have been given positive and sufficient proof that anyone can safely remove these implants, we are not going to plug any services of this nature.

WHO WAS THAT NAKED FEMALE LIGHT BEING WHO KEEPS PESTERING CAC MEMBER IN DETROIT? (A Pleasent Way to Remember Who One Really Is) QUESTION: Some questions from J.K. in Detroit. The first one is personal, but leads into some others of a little more genera1 nature, so I'll ask it. He's continually sent this question in over the years, and I've never asked it. He writes: \"Cosmic Awareness, in the early 1950s, a super- beautiful golden naked female Light Being was beamed down into my room. I instantly recognized her and screamed out her name, and she merged into me and we communicated for quite some time. When she beamed back up in a shaft of light through the bedroom ceiling, she erased her name from my conscious mind, along with our communications. Then, in 1984, May llth, between 11 :00 PM and 1:00 AM, another golden light naked female merged into me. I remember saying to her something like: \"Now you have a perfect face and body. You are a perfect beauty!\" Please tell me if these visitations were from angels or members of the Golden race, or of the future race, and what was the purpose of these visitations?\" COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that these entities are seen as having been what might be termed emissaries from your home planet; that you are one from the constell- ation of Vega, and that these entities on Vega are much concerned about the welfare of those who have ventured to this planet. That it appears these entities came as emissaries to help remind you of who you are and to give comfort and encouragement during times of diff- iculty. This Awareness indicates that your purpose in coming to this planet as being to represent the Con- federation, the Galactic Confederation which hopes to prevent the earth from being taken hostage by the alien forces from Draco and Reticuli. The ent- ities from Vega who travel to this planet and others in order to assist in this, what may be termed \"Gal- actic conflict,\" are recognized as heroes in their own planet at home, and are often taken there in their dreams. This Awareness indicates the entity R.R. as also being from your Vega constellation, and this entity can give some further information about the program and how it works. It is much like UN troops being sent to a hostile area in order to maintain peace, except that it is transferred to a Galactic concern, rather than a global situation. This Awareness ind- icates the Interpreter as being from a different system, not connected with Vega; that there are many entities who have come to the earth at this time in order to help to see it through a transitionary period that is essentially quite dangerous to the inhabitants of earth. This Awareness indicates that these entities are also referred to as Wanderers. There are other names and the purposes vary with each entity, but are often part of Galactic Confederation program designed to salvage the earth from the Draco Reptilian takeover and theReticuli and Orion forces. This Awareness ind- icates these Wanderers are not usually destined to have an enjoyable or harmonious life on the earth, but they do receive a certain amount of protection from spiritual sources, and they can, by carefully working, merge their purposes and personal lifetime so as to find reasonable enjoyment in the earth experience. HOW PROGRAMMING ON EARTH DEFLECTED A WANDERER FROM HIS IMPORTANT MISSION This entity has spent a good number of years of his life putting out newsletters and so on, with the emphasis on racist and anti-Semitic diatribe, I suppose you could call it, attempting to blame the conspiracy and the evils of the world on certain groups of entities. I was wonder- ing, if since he was sent on a mission, it seems to me he either got side-tracked on his mission, or if he is doing his mission, pointing out this type of information, then it must be more significant than I can see. COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that the entity as having a particular programming for this mission and arriving on the scene, and growing up from childhood with the pro- gramming of the child, did not find the target of his pro- gramming and instead, focused on race and other concerns among humans, and selected certain groups as being his enemy. The entity's true programming became distorted because of certain earthly programming that deflected the true focus of the entity's purpose in being on earth. This Awareness indicates that the entity has only recently become fully aware of the nature of the alien presence and the transmutation of his programming is under way to realign him with his true purpose for being on earth. That this essentially has to do with alerting the public to the presence and danger of the alien conspiracy. This Awareness indicates that this entity is quickly becoming the force and warrior whom he originally set out to be in his agreement to come to the earth plane. There has been a need for greater awareness of whom he is to deal with, and how to deal with these alien intruders on earth. This Awareness suggests the entity continue studying the information relating to the Zeta Reticuli and the Draco Reptoids in whatever books and sources may be made available; that the entity also seek to discover what he can find in regard to Billy Meier's contacts with the Pleiadians; that these entities are close allies with the Vegan groups."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"DID THE BEAUTIFUL NAKED FEMALES 4.

QUESTIONER: In reference to the Unified States of Awareness, CA.C. still has a few historic copies of that document, which contains the three complete readings given by Awareness back in 1977. New members should check this out, because the Unified States of Awareness is the complete outline for the New Age government and at the time it was presented, it offered an alternative to what is now about to come down upon us in the form of George Bush's \"New World Order.\" (Price for this booklet is $5.00 plus $1 postage from C.A.C.). You might also check out the two other booklets we put together back then, \"A Magic Happening in Yorktown\" ($3.00) and the special report on Yorktown, November 1977, in which Paul Shockley gives his historic address during the 200th anniversary celebration of the Articles of Confederation.

Please tell us if there are any humans with an an elic genetic base, and can you tell us how many angefic types there are today on earth and where they came from and what is their role in this battle with the Reptoids?\" COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that the animal-based humans that which are termed the mammal humans, also had at the beginning, when first cloned, certain reptilian genes, but these genes became more and more recessive with each generation, and the mammalian genes began to dom~nate the individuals.

It does not see a great possibility that the Ramtha forces will be involved. The general concept of Ramtha being involved as that which is promoted through the J.Z. Knight channeling, and this Awareness suggests that entities may wish to investigate this aspect, but that this Awareness does not see energy on this. It is possible that these channelings are shielded from view. The J.Z. Knight channelings have of late been restricted from release to the public. It is possible that they have also been shielded or protected in such a way that they are not seen or available for viewing by this channel. This Aware- ness indicates that essentially, It cannot find or does not see at this time any information relating to the questions asked regarding Ramtha, where the eritity is from or the strength of his forces, or the power available to him. It simply does not have this information provided. This Awe ness indicates it is blocked. The information is blocked. ED'S Note: this is yet another indication that something is amiss in the Ramtha camp. Probably why Awareness can not pick up any energy at all is because, as some are alleging, Ramtha is long gone, as he promised, and some- thing or someone else calling itself Ramtha is being prom- oted. For more info on this, please refer to 'Revelations of Awareness' No. 91-4 (How to Lose the Spiritual Balance); $3.00 from CAC. Like has been indicated regarding the so-called 'ascended masters' and the socalled 'space brothers' who are merely thought-forms created and promoted by certain entities on earth who find it profitable to bilk the gullible to fund and follow them, the entity now calling himself Ramtha is probably also merely spouting a lot of hot meaningless air.

IS THEIR TRUE INTENT TO SAVE OUR EARTH FROM EXTlNCTlQN ? ( A RUNDOWN ON OUR REPTILIAN HERITAGE ) (CAC General Reading, QUESTION: A question from J.A. He writes: \"I have just read Raymond Fowler's book The Watchers. * From his studies of UFO abductions Mr. Fowler concludes that the intentions of the small Grey aliens are benign; that they are gathering genetic material from human abduct- ees because they expect mankind to become sterile and eventually extinct on earth because of increasing pollution, and they want to preserve human genetic material in order to reestablish the human form on another planet. 'Mr. Fowler says the small Grey aliens have been seen frequently in the company of tall blonde or white- haired human type aliens and appear to be working for them. It is difficult for me to accept the proposition that aliens who abduct people without their consent, likewise implant them without their consent, and again without their consent create mental blocks in these people to prevent them from remembering their exper- iences could have benign intentions. Likewise, it's difficult to accept that aliens who perform horrible cattle mutilations have benign intentions. How- ever, one question occurs to me: Could it be that the aliens are deceiving the U.S. government because they know the government people to be of evil intentions and thus feel no obligations to treat them respectfully? I'd like to ask Awareness's assessment of Mr. Fowler's conclusion that the aliens are benignly preserving the human form for a transplanting to another planet when this one becomes uninhabitable, due to pollution? Aug. 10,1990) \"Also, I'd like to ask Awareness's assessment of my speculation that the aliens haven't kept their promise to the U.S. government because they don't regard the government as worthy of their respect. How can any honorable person respect the U.S. government? Also, who are the tall blonde or white-haired people that Fowler says the small Greys are working for?\" COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that the small Greys are working for the Reptilians from Draco; these same Rep- tilians from Draco are those who were involved in the myths and literature from early writings as being repre- sented by the serpent in the story of the Garden of Eden; this as symbolized in some of the earlier writings as the creators of man. This Awareness indicates that the so-called Adam and Eve as having been in the realm of creation from genetic engineering by the serpant-types. It was a failure, as these entities were a species that could not reproduce. A new Adam and Eve type then being created was then intro- duced using mammal genes which would allow for repro- duction. The purpose of the creation of these entities was as slaves to work for the Reptilians in mines and agricultural settings. This Awareness indicates that the true God, what might be termed the higher or more humane type of creator during that time was from Sirius. The intro- duction of the gene in the creation which was repre- sented by the one in ancient literature known as Enlil"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"* 11. or the Elohim, was symbolized as a representative of * those entities from Sirius. The introduction of that gene which allowed for the potential for immortality to eventually emerge in the human form, which allowed for the ability of the human form, generation after generation, to improve, to weed out or to filter out the Reptilian gene and to increase its more Divine aspects through the code that was introduced by the Sirius inf- luence which allowed for the mammalian genes to grad- ually evolve the human creation toward that of the God types, the more human or Sirius type of person. The Cute Little Greys and the Phony Pleiadeaos (The Half-Breeds Wearing Wigs) This Awareness indicates that these Sirius influences came from another dimension other than the present dimension, though they were represented through the entities from Sirius. This Awareness indicates that the Greys that entities refer to as the Zeta Reticuli, the short small Greys, the cute little ones who appear to work for the tall blondes, are in fact working for the Reptilians as a kind of mercenary hired types, fore- runners, who were set out ahead to set the stage for the rather than those who have strong individualistic qualities; Reptilian masters. that those entities with strong individualistic qualities often Those who are often seen in abduction situations as arft rejected for the breeding process and in some cases, tall humans with blonde hair are in fact half-breeds these become part of the Reptoid diet. wearing wigs; that they often claim themselves to be The Diabolical Nature of the Greys Pleiadeans when in fact they are half-breeds from the This Awareness indicates that these entifies do eat hm, ~eptiliahuman genetic engineering aperiments; that the way humans eat chicken; that the Greys do tell in most cases they are from test-tube to make entities fee] with their actions.

It simply buys in to the impression that the The Reptoids pefer to have obedience and are cd Greys want to create.

These experiments were unsuccessful. Their effort to clone themselves with human genetics have not been as satisfactory as those usingthe Reptilian or Reptoid genes and humans, and particularly less successful than using the human and Reptoid eggs and sperm. This Awareness indicates that much of this is what is actually behind the majority of abductions: the exper- iments in trying to commingle and create a new race, drawing from the genes of Reptoids and humans. This Awareness indicates that this has its roots back as far as 40 thousand years in the past, at the beginning of the homo sapiens types, and also that there have been sub- sequent experiments with various types. There has also been some confusion and curiosity in regard to the nature of the human genetics because they mew to be different from the orisnd homo sapiens; ihi evolution of the human race becoming much more accelerated than was expected by those who were involved in the production of the species. This was, as mentioned previously, the result of the Sirius influence on the genetic code. This Awareness ind- icates the Pleiadems also being part of this, and having moved in to another area had even greater growth and evolution partly because of the extreme interference on earth with the development of the human, the homo sapien species, by those who did not like what was occur- ring and by the commingling of earlier types with the homo sapiens species. This Awareness indicates the commingling of earlier types with the homo sapiens as that which was one of the reasons for the destruction of Sodom and Gomrnorah and of the deluge. GREYS EXTRACTING A WOMAN'S EGG This Awareness indicates the Reptoids are tail, between 6-1/2 and approximately 8, even as tall as 9 feet in height, extremely strong. Most of the reports of 9 or 10 or 12 foot tall aliens as exaggerations of those who are or may be Reptoids or half-breeds and in some cases, they are seen, the reports are reporting on the size of the suit being worn, which makes the entity seem even larger. This Awareness indicates that the Reptoids are not in great number yet, though there are quite a number present. In cases of abduction, the Reptoids usually stay in the background and simply watch. The small Greys and the half-breeds generally take part in the abduction procedures in extracting eggs or whatever else may be done, such as planting the implants in the humans. They are often the ones who appear friendly. The small Greys can appear friendly. The half-breeds can appear friendly. This Awareness indicates that it is more amearance than actuality.

Now, I've never bought that argument, but are the aliens influencing these people to think that way? COSMIC AWARENESS: This is in the affirmative. This is part of the process.

How Aliens Use the Image of the Owl There are often animal images superimposed in the entity's consciousness so that when the entity starts to get close to a feeling related to the experience, the animal image will appear and distract the entity. This Awareness indicates that an owl is a common image used by aliens to distract the entity from following through in his or her thinking in regard to a memory of the experience. There are other animals used, also. These are designed and implanted in the entity's con- sciousness to keep the entity from recalling what occurred. There are also, of course, those feelings that are implanted to make the entity feel that something wonderful happened, something important happened. THE QUANDARY OF THE WANDERER: WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THE ALIENS? AN EXAMINATION OF OUR SECURITIES ( \"Thank You for 'Nightmare Hall' \"1 QUESTION: A long letter from Tom K., Santa Clara, California, which has a question. It's an interesting letter, so 111 read it. Dear Avaton and Vikki, Thank you for your blockbuster \"Nightmare Hall\" issue [90--101. No, the thanks is sincere, however disturbing (and it was); ignorance is a luxury we cannot afford. This knowledge forces us to appraise, re-evaluate, and ask meaning and importance in our lives. I am sure many are asking the question, is the source \"Awareness\" reliable and accurate? Perhaps that needs to be answered in two ways: has it been accurate in the past, and how does lt compare to other channels which have been published or encountered first-hand? The first is somewhat difficult to evaluate if you concentrate on what Awareness said could happen, because much of it did not happen. When a source estimates a future, it is based on the confluence of events in motion at that time. But, as Awareness has said, new input, events, change of con- sciousness, etc., create a new confluence and change in predicted events. Thank goodness that the future is fluid and not locked into a preordained destiny! (But realization of this should be a flag to those understanding individuals to exercise their mindss and mouths to create more constructive inputs.) We didn't have nuclear war, we haven't had (yet) all the enslavements mentioned (tho many we have had), and isn't it the nature, or perhaps the dream, of us to say, Awareness was wrong, the world's OK after all? The ostrich is a marvellous bird, but it doesn't stick it's head in the sand because what it hears offends its sensibilities. Perhaps one recognizes truth only if he desires to seek and understand truth. Truth frequently cannot be tested as a laboratory specimen; it must be understood, applied, and evaluated by its utility not for self advancement only, but its universality of promoting harmony for all. As for the second comparison, it has been my personal experience that the channels I have encountered have either degenerated into the promotion of themselves or have lacked at the outset the depth of evaluation of existing energies which Awareness has demonstrated. I must admit that I don't under- stand the process -- I have merely seen and heard it happen. But we don't need to know the mechanics of television to watch a program, we need only to know where the controls are. Responsibility is a hard word. Integrity and the courage of intelligent selfexpression are even more difficult. With more comforts and conveniences than ever before, we have truly become immersed in the beguiling apathy of materiality, the illusion that we have achieved 'happiness'. We have only to look at what Aware- ness has said in the past about the power of materiality in the hands of the manipulative few to herd us in the directions they wish, for their own ends of personal power. Doesn't it demonstrate that power really exists, that it is more than a concept, that any- one can use it? It makes me very curious to know the nature of power that if someone tries to use it against me, I can counter with my own. If they can use it, why can't I? But superior techno- logical power in the hands of aliens who feed upon us--how do you counter that? Us humans have devised extremes of death and mutilation over the many centuries of our time, and undoubtedly before our time. We know of the torture of the Spanish Inquisition, the death camps of World War 11, the indifferent slaughter of women and children in the many wars, the experiments of Hitler's murderous doctors, but now even humankind's atrocities have been exceeded. Our own excesses have been bred thru the excesses of emotion and uncontrolled power (another emotion, I believe, in its origin), but we are ill-equipped to understand a race of aliens who maim and destroy out of what can best be likened to scientific interest, without emotion (perhaps Dr. Mengele would have understood). It made me ask when I read of 'Level 6', is there any intell- igence to the idea of spiritual growth, to the metaphysical concepts we felt explained and gave hope to life, when alien beings can transplant souls, create souls, manipulate the entity of ourselves which we held precious? It seemed to make for me a horrible mockery of all the teachings that this should not only be possible, but actually being perpetrated upon us. Is God l'rinciple so utterly mechanistic, like the aliens, that It allows absolutely anything to happen? I seem to want to ask this question of Awareness, for it bothers me still. That it bothers me is probably the emotion of self, and separate self at that, still wishing to anthropomorphize--how could a \"father\" do that! How could It allow us to be devast- ated by more than we can create in devastation among outselves? How could It sit back and watch entities experimented into hell? Ironically, I think I have answered that question. The soul is a field vibration, as the body is a different field. Both are an aspect of the whole of creation, as the aliens are a different aspect of creation. Fundamental laws exist governing all, and all is in evolution. Perhaps those entities had a karma which led them into that, gd-awful as it seems. As Awareness says, perhaps their influence is actually speeding evolution."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"I think we have become locked into the belief that we are an an island (there can't be intelligence life anywhere else!)., the earth is a kind of 'Romper Room' in which we can play without acknowledging symbiosis, let alone responsibility to real higher law, and no one should disturb our games and our illusion that we are the end-all and be-all of creation. Indeed, pride, and willing ignorance, goeth before the fall. How dare there be aliens who can threaten not only our beliefs, but our warm and fuzzy feeling (even if we are enslaving other humans, beating our wives and treating our children like chattel possessions)! How dare anyone suggest (or enforce) that we are miserable failures at understanding life and act like barbarians, when we are Where It's At! No, I don't think I'm better than those who live their everyday lives as they see fit, for I do, but I believe there is a better way for all of us, maybe even the aliens. And how ready am I to be forced into expressing that, when I may have to leave what is comfortable behind? But what of the abductions, the mutilations, the feeding, the superior weaponry (no way am I going to go anywhere near New Mexico!)? How are we to protect ourselves? Well, how are we going to protect ourselves against the governments which are steadily increasing the laws which enslave ourselves? I understand those who want to be 'raptured' away from this mess, but that goes back to what I said about responsibility beins difficult. How difficult it is to say, Enouah!, and not 16.. unportant to restate any of this because the entity did ' , state this quite well. This Awareness indicates the main * question the entity asked as that: What can be done? This Awareness indicates that if you will recall in the past, this question was once asked: What can I do in regard to some action? This Awareness indicated that the entity asking the question was told: Observe. Be Aware. Hold back and do nothing, but look a little closer, look a little harder. See What Is, and in so doing, you will find yourself asking: Yes, but what can I DO? This Awareness would suggest that you look even closer, become even more aware. Look a little harder, and you will find yourself asking again: Yes, yes, I'm doing that, but what can I do about it? And this Aware- ness again will suggest to you to look more carefully, even deeper. At some point you will find yourself acting, without having decided or without having been told what to do. You will find yourself being moved by the awareness of What Is. If you become aware of What Is, the awareness of What Is moves you to the right action, without your deciding to do so, without your being told what to do. onlyhuestion authority, but stand in the way of its enslavement. It's difficult because we love those close to us, we enjoy comfort, progress, and we see these being potentially destroyed by attack or gradual suffocation. When we have striven among the obstacles of our life and envision the destruction of our striving, that is more than scary, it is devastating. Material comfort is not wrong, desiring to achieve is not wrong, desiring success and happiness is not wrong, but maybe consider- ing these as securities needs to be examined. We are so immersed, involved, and it has gone on for so many generations ... We are divided in concept of Principle, we are tired of foraging for daily necessities, we see what materiality can provide, and, perhaps, we have devolved to government what, in the end, we can least afford, ow sovereignty as humans and individuals. We wanted the struggle to end but, it seems, it is only beginning. Perhaps the struggle is not as important as the concept, as understanding, but it is very real; we live the struggle, and it dulls the concept, the under- standing. I guess I need to amend my question. Instead of my previous emotional question, I would ask of Awareness: What can we do in our lives that our endeavors, those we love, our desires to make life a better thing, are not cast into the hopeless hell of a 'Level 6', or a daily hell of authoritarian enslavement? And of the answer, How do we gain the courage to manifest our freedom; what reverses the tide which has led us to our present apathy and enslavement? If you wish to ask Awareness, I would like to know. Maybe others, too. I am not an activist--they have their purpose; is there another path of dissention, or am Iexpressing weakness of self-purpose, fear, disillusionment in what I have known and insecurity in what could be? When to oppose, when to allow, when is it too much? Undoubtedly that is for each individual to answer. I am hoping for guidelines. Again, thank you for \"Nightmare Hall\". We really need to stop hiding from what is, trying to create our own insular reality in which we aan be \"happy\". Perhaps we should heed the words of the 'Prophet' Pogo who said: \"We have met the enemy, and he is us.\" Go ahead, shake us out of our unreality, we need it! Sincerely, Tom. This Awareness indicates Its purpose is to help entities to become aware of What Is. That is all that is necessary. Perhaps the action you take will be to help others become aware of What Is, and hopefully it will not be because you have decided to do so. Hopefully it will be because you are moved to do so. This Awareness indicates that it is sufficient for you to focus on becoming more aware of What Is. If you continue to focus on becoming mxe aware, that in itself will bring about the response necessary to help bring the healing. If every entity in the world were aware of What Is, there would be no further problem, for the entities would all respond accordingly, and the problems would tend to reconcile in accordance with the awareness of the masses. This Awareness indicates that entities always tend to think of doing, of taking action. There are others who tend to think of talking about what to do, but those who are fully attuned to an urgency don't think, they just find themselves doing something. This Awareness indicates that the response that comes from knowing, from being aware, as that which comes about without any personal ego involved. It comes about spontaneously, and anything that comes spon- taneously, from the awareness of what is happening, is going to be a channeled response from the Awareness. This Awareness indicates that is the path. It is sufficient. It will guide you. It will move you. Be aware of the dangers to yourself. Be aware of the importance of the information and its ramification to the earth and to others. Be aware of all the aspects of a situation so that when you find yourself responding, you are not responding with some aspect of ignorance being involved. You may be aware of the alien presence, but if you are not aware of the danger of your potential response, then you are acting in part from a level lacking Well, there's a number of questions in that epistle, but aw,ness, from a level of ignorance md that will surely maybe has a to the cause you problems.

It's a personal question, but it covers an area in which we have had many requests for information. She writes: \"This is the second letter that I write to you. The first one was to bare my soul to you when my husband died in 1984. We were together for thirty years, 24 hours a day. I was on the verge of committing suicide when I received a mailing from Cosmic Awareness Communications. It was truly a Godsend, because when I read it (I always read it immediately when rt arrives), it contained all the information about life and death and life after death. My whole life changed and I began to send you contributions. About a year after my husband died I had a heart attack and the line went straight on the heart monitor, but they , brought me back. I was toId by the cardiologist that if I didn't submit to heart by-pass operation, that I would die within two weeks. I decided that I wanted to live. I got out of bed, and took out all of the tubes and needles out of my body and announced that I was leaving. They tried to force me to stay, but I insisted. They told me I had to sign a paper releasing them from any liability. I signed the paper and went home. \"I'm now in my 5th year and about 90% recovered Now I have a chionic arthritic condition that is very painful. I'm not able to walk for very long periods. There are so many things I want to do to make this a better world to live in. My heart and mind are willing, but my legs won't cooaerate. Can you help me? Is there anything I can do to help myself?\" she writes. I'd like to ask Awareness if there's any new information on arthritis that It could give at this time? COSMIC AWARENESS: Gamma Linic oil and linseed oil or Linolenic oil are seen as beneficial. This Awareness suggests that olive oil should be recognized as a good oil to use for foods along with grape seed oil, which is found under the brand name Canola oil in your supermarkets.This Aware- ness indicates that these two oils being mono-unsaturated oils are seen as beneficial; mono-saturated oils used for salads and cooking can be additionally healthy for your general health and diet and the avoidance of cholesterol- forming oils or poly-unsaturated oils, which although generally healthy, grow rancid quickly and may cause other problems. This Awareness indicates that it is also seen as beneficial to avoid saturated fats in the diet, and those foods containing high uric acid. This Awareness indicates that fresh vegetables and veg- etables from the broccoli/cabbage family, are seen as beneficial, preferably when steamed. This Aware- ness suggests the low sodium diet; that tomatoes being high in sodium may be used sparingly. There is seen a benefit from Vitamin C, but there is also seen some need for this entity to avoid excessive citric acids through the citrus fruits. This Aware- ness indicates that bathing with salts or that which is the bath salts, such as Epsom salts in warm watei can be beneficial; that this helps to draw out certain stiffness in the joints. This Awareness indicates that the use of cayenne and the use of garlic are both seen as beneficial; that Coenzyme 210 can be beneficial also. This Awareness wishes entities to understand that It does not give amounts of usage because new laws have been passed which prevent any amounts being given in terms of suggestions as to usage of vitamins or minerals or even water. That were this Awareness to prescribe drinking water, this would be acceptable under such laws, but were the Awareness to suggest how much water and how often, it would be classed as prescrib- ing without a license, and this could cause the Inter- preter considerable difficulties, including arrest and possible imprisonment. This Awareness indicates that this is from laws that were passed approximately three years ago. ED'S Note: these absurd laws now on the books were passed by Congress because they evidently could not resist the pressure of the AMA and the FDA which wants to control absolutely anything relating to health.

Thus, an entity who there are many kinds of vulnerability. has no responsibility to others may feel less concerned about the possibility of death than does the one who has a number of responsibilities to others, who takes those resiponsibilities quite seriously. As a General Rule, Entities Cling to Life This Awareness indicates that as far as the fear of per- sonal safety or the fear of personal death is concerned, the issues to consider are the aspect of pain involved in the potential of death which entities would naturally dread, just as entities would dread going to a dentist or a doctor whcrein there might be pain involved, and the aspect of the permanent loss of something they are attached to. It is not the unknown that is so frightening, it is more the fear of losing that which is known. Even the most unpleasant attachments entities may have are at least known to them and entities do not know what lies beyond, whether the beyond has any kind of circumstances or situations that are manageable as are the more familiar and known aspects of life. Therefore, entities cling to life as a general rule unb~ss it becomes so unbearable to them that they feel they would rather face anything other than continue in the direction and with the circumstances thev now endure.

When creating humans, who seemed to have more perfect features and so on, was this an accident on the part of the aliens? How did they arrive at that? Why weren't they created in their own image? COSMlC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that in regard to the creation of modem humanity these creations were such as to have features that were relatively balanced and harmonious; that the original purpose of modern humans was that of serving those Reptoid masters of the past. This has been discussed previously in regard to Sitchin's books, in regard to mining and other operations. This Awareness indicates that there were modifications made by those from Sirius and also from certain Pleiadian influences to the genetic nature of the earlier creation, and the Reptilian aspects sf humanity began to fall away with each passing generation; the generations losing some of the long lifespan qualities but gaining more of the symmetrical beauty of the human nature as well as the more intellectual and decision-making power of the human qualities that were implanted through the Sirius and Pleiadian connections so that as time passed, the human development became ever more predominant and the Reptilian qualities of humanity fell away, almost entirely.

It would hinder your plans and activities. In this sense, the action of sending White Light to these entities in a kind of love frequency can be a deterrent to any mis- chief they may be planning. This Awareness indicates also, that by wrapping them in White Light, using three circles, one horizontal, two vertical, perpendicular to each other, and spinning those circles so that the entities are enclosed in three different circles or spheres; this also serves as a kind of energy field that keeps them from per- forming any serious mischief. This Awareness indicates that those who have not learned to wrap themselves or those who would threaten them, or to wrap their loved ones in White Light, should learn to do so. There have been previous readings given on the exact ritual. This Awareness suggests that this can be a most powerful way of preventing harm to a loved one who is at a distance, who needs protection or who may need protection, especially when you are waiting for someone who is late, you are worried, wondering what has happened to them; by wrapping them in White Light in the three circles which then become three spheres, one inside the other, you send protection to them. This Awareness indicates that you may also do this with your automobiles or your homes in case these are in any way endangered or threatened; that it is especially helpful when relieving one's anxieties to be able to use the White Light, wrapped around one's loved ones, when the loved one is missing or feared in jeopardy. This Awareness ind- icates also, when one is in danger, or if there are hostile forces, one may wish to wrap the hostile forces in White Light which prevents them from making their mischief effective against you.

COSMIC AWARENESS: This as in the affirmative. The entity was aware of these forces. I they are able to manipulate spiritual groups that have a dedication to the concepts of unity and love of Universal Divinity. This Awareness indicates that this type of organization that develops meditative rituals and concepts of Light and spiritual energy building, is difficult for the aliens to deal with, and they would like to disrupt these things before they get started, if possible. They generally seek to divert the spiritual organization to become involved in the pro- motion of their own alien agendas, if possible, and seek to turn spiritual organizations into organizations that promote the concept of 'our friendly space visitors', 'friends,' so that they can be made welcome by these org- anizations to allow them great freedom in making their mischief without hindrance from spiritual groups that would otherwise alert others or call upon the true spiritual forces from extraterrestrial levels or other dimensions who know the entities to be the messengers of deceptions, and servants of Ahriman.

Would Awareness verify this as being correct?\" COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that essentially, they are working to alter the weather patterns to fit the climate they are more familiar with and which is more suitable to their own feelings and their personal needs. They prefer a hotter climate. This Awareness indicates they live underground.

The effort would be to control humans passively and to use force only when humans got out of line, or attempted to rebel. This Awareness indicates there are plans for a new mini-series of the V movie, in which the aliens again return to earth, this time in a planetoid; the producers and writers working on this script have also connections with the War of the Worlds which ran for approximately two years on a weekly series. This Awareness indicates that these entities have some inside information in regard to the alien agenda and are attempting to inform the masses through these television mini-series and programs. ED'S Note : These two series, plus the series \"War of the Worlds\" are now being replayed over and over in most areas of the U.S. (FOLLOW-UP QUESTION): So essentially, what Awareness is saying, the Reptoids have come up with a diabolically clever way to enslave the entire planet and the average entity will probably never even see the face of one of these Reptoids. COSMIC AWARENESS: This is in the affirmative. This Awareness indicates that the Reptoids are already on the planet and few see them. Some who have been abducted have reported seeing these very tall people standing in the background watching. Most of the time these are Reptoids; in some cases they may be those from Orion, the Orion Empire. The Reptoids generally are present with the short Greys in the ships. This Awareness indicates that it is the intention of the Reptoids not to engage directly in war with humans, but to have half-breeds and abductees involved in such, if war with humans erupts. It is the intention of the Reptoids not to engage directly in war with Pleiadians or those from Sirius who come in to rescue humanity, but to have the humans and the abductees and the half-breeds to carry on any war with thase extraterrestrials from the Pleiades or from Sirius, if they enter into the affairs of earthians. The Reptilians prefer to let others kill themselves off rather than get in the midst of direct conflict with their enemies. This Awareness indicates it would be likened unto a zoo keeper who has a competitor who seeks to take control of the zoo and therefore trains the animals in the zoo to fight the competitor when the competitor arrives, and also has a way whereby the animals in the zoo will fight each other in order to thin out the number of animals, if the zoo keeper needs this to happen so that the zoo keeper never has to actually get involved in the killing process, wherein he himself might be jeopardized. This Awareness indicates that these entities think of themselves as custodians of humanity, much the way a farmer would see himself as a shepherd of sheep or one who owns cattle. This Awareness indicates that the aliens also occasionally refer to their role as 'handler,' especially in regard to the abduction of women, from whom they collect eggs for fertilization on a regular basis, each woman being assigned a particular handler who will always be the one dealing with that particular woman. This, they have found, creates greater ease for both the abductee and the abductor, through the famil- iarity in the arrangement. HALF-BREEDS DESCRIBED IN THE BOOK: \"THE WATCHERSw--HOW ACCURATE IS THIS? (FOLLOW-UP QUESTION): In the book The Watchers, by Fowler, he describes how this woman under hypnosis would describe the eggs being taken from her year after year, and babies made by experiments, and these entities eventually taking her up to the ship or to the nursery and letting her hold these half-breeds. It goes into very great detail. This woman seems to be a very good hypnotic subject and other books have been written about her. Is this infor- mation valid in relation to how the aliens are doing this with some of those whom eggs they take? COSMIC AWARENESS: This is in the affirmative. This is quite a valid report- ing of the incident by this entity. This Awareness ind- icates that there have been some unusual and nearly violent reactions by some of the entities such as mother and offspring upon meeting each other. In some cases the offspring became furious at being told an entity was his mother; being very angry because the mother appeared to be so unevolved and animal-like and would not accept the fact of having an earth human mother of that type. In other cases, the mother, in one case, the mother being furious at seeing her half-breed daughter, stated that she wanted to \"rip it's arm off;\" that this because she saw it as half Reptilian and half human and felt it was an abomination to her to have such an abberation. This Awareness indicates this entity later became more accepting of the offspring. The Greys in working with humans attempt to avoid letting the child and mother become too close or to have too much of a bonding. This Awareness indicates however, they have also dis- covered that while the child is extremely young, it becomes healthier if there is some bonding with the mother, thus, they have in recent times begun to let the mother meet and hold her offspring, for short durations during the very early part of the child's life, as this helps the child to survive, but they still frown upon any long-term bonding between earth-mother and alien offspring of the mother.

QUESTION: DO SINGLE MEN DIE YOUNGER THAN MARRIED MEN 7 There was an article in the paper the other day I'd like to read and ask Awareness if this information is true, and if so, why? It says: Listen up, bachelors: Being single can be deadly, according to a national study that says unmarried, middleage men are Mice as likely to die as those who have spouses. And don't think living together will save your lives. \"Even single men who live with someone other than a spouse have a higher death rate,\" Maradee Davis, primary author of the university study, said Friday. Twenty-three percent of men ages 45 to 54 who lived without a spouse died within 10 years, compared to 11 percent of sim- ilarly aged men who lived with their wives, according to the study by the University of California at San Francisco. The study also found that 7.7 percent of women ages 45 to 54 who lived without a spouse died within 10 years, compared to 4 percent of the married women in the same age group. The study analyzed data compiled by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survev. The 7.651 subjects from across the United States ranged &age fro& 45 to $4 and were studied from 1971 to 1975 and then again from 1982 to 1984. COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates the information appears to be accurate in regard to the subjects studied and the statistics kept. It appears that the question of why relates in part to the mental state of entities. This Awareness indicates that entities who make a commit- ment to the welfare of another and share another's life, also tend to commit themselves to remain healthy in order to fulfill their commitment and likewise, they try to support each other when they have such commit- ments. The action of not being committed or not accepting marriage tends to indicate an unwillingness to give oneself, as much of oneself to the other, and to hold back oneself. The action of not accepting the marriage implies an entity who likewise refrains from caring as much about the other. It appears that this is a reflection on the entity's ability to love fully or as deeply. The action of loving another deeply tends to have a physical effect on the one who loves, an effect that is healthful, helping one's biological balance, helping to balance the metabolism and giving one a sense of purpose and zest for life, for living. This Awareness indicates that when one has no one who depends on them or who cares about them, and when one does not have anyone close to care for, life is less meaningful, and when life is less meaningful, people do not tend to take care of themselves as well as when their health is important to others and to themselves. There appears also to be some physiological influence relating to the hormones and the general glandular and metabolism balance of entities that relates to their inter- action with another, and this likewise has a bearing on the general energy level and health level; even the com- mingling of auras is a factor. This Awareness indicates that those who live together without being married have a better chance of improved health than were they living separately, but by being married, the health would be even better. IS THAT WHY HOMOSEXUALS WANT TO MARRY? FOLLOW-UP QUESTION: Could this idea of making a commitment be the motiv- ation, whether knowingly or unknowingly, of some homo- sexuals who are pushing for laws that would allow them to legally marry one another? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this may be so in some levels. In some cases however, it is more of a social challenge and social statement that is being attempted. It is a way of institutionalizing homosexuality. If it can be allowed in marriage through legal means, then it becomes institutionalized and therefore more acceptable in society. In this sense it is an attempt to make a state- ment that institutionalizes homosexuality."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"SOME WAYS TO SLOW DOWN THE AGING PROCESS QUESTION I A Question from A.J., Columbus, Ohio, \"Scientists have reported that when injections of DHEA hormones of the adrenal glands are given regularly to animals, the hormones help to prevent cancer, causes excessive fat to disappear from the body without dieting or exer- cise and lengthens the lifespan of animals which dies of old age. Injections are not available to us. Scientists dso report that the human body produces only five to ten percent as much of the hormone in old age as it did in youth. Is there any method, middle-aged and elderly people could use which would cause a rejuvenation of the DHEA producing mechanism of the adrenal glands with the result that the adrenals would increase their manufacture and secretion of that hormone?\" 16. e This Awareness indicates that certain of the Hawaiian . fruits such as pineapple, papaya, guava, passion fruit, a and others are quite beneficial for the digestive aspects of nutrition and dieting. Banana is quite a healthy fruit, being high in potassium; that these can be of considerable benefit to entities. The sugar content is that which some entities may wish to avoid. Coconut can be a detrimental fruit in that it has an adverse effect on saturated fat levels, as does the palm oil when used in cooking or in diet. This Awareness ind- icates that essentially, the more green and fresh vegetables used, this in preference to non-starchy vegetables, the better the diet, in a general sense, for preventing the aging process. This Awareness indicates that pumpkin is an extremely valuable food in that it is high in beta carotene and Vitamin A; this being healthful to hair and eyes and COSMIC AWARENESS: to ward off cancer.

It can help to reverse certain age patterns by reducing the MA0 properties and manufacture and this also has some ---'-'- relation to the growth hormone consideration. Foods that Reduce the Aging Process This Awareness indicates that there are also benefits that come in a similar manner through the use of certain foods that hinder aging or reduce the aging process; this especially in regard to those foods of the vegetable nature, and some fruit. The vegetables, especially relating to those of the brocolli/cabbage family, including cauliflower; lettuce, also is beneficial; celery, green onions and white . . or yellow or red onions are also beneficial in helping to ward off elements of the aging process. Garlic, of course, is quite beneficial. Peas can be bene- . ficial and lentils; these helping to reduce stress and there are others.

This Awareness indicates that this does appear to have some correlation; the implants being such as to cause an irritation as well as from the radiation being emitted from the implants. This is not the only cause of brain cancer; that there are increases because of this, but there are also other causes for brain cancer, this having to do with free radicals in the system, pollutants in the body and poor dietary factors as well as other things such as smoke, alcohol and the general debilitating process caused by aging itself. This can also be caused by external or environmental factors that occur to individuals through latent causes such as X-rays, and other environmental abuses to the system from earlier in life. This Awareness indicates that essentially, the increase that is notable as being largely from the implant factor. THINGS TO LOOK FOR IF YOU HAVE AN IMPLANT (FOLLOW-UP QUESTION): Speaking of implants, is there anything physical that would manifest in some entities who have implants? For example, would they have peculiar problems with their sinus or their eyes, or their hearing, or something like that? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that such physical telltale signs of implanting is generally found immediately after the implant. An entity may, for example, be abducted and have a mark on the back of the right ear indicating an implant to that area was effected, or in the area in the back of the head, where the head and neck join, or the entity may have the experience of a bloody nose or sore sinus problem or possibly an eye problem gener- ally in the left eye, related to an implant in the left nostril, by the optic nerve. This Awareness indicates that occasionally, an entity will recall a dream of being taken aboard a UFO, and if the entity has any such mark on his or her body, this may also include marks on the body such as on the wrist, in the navel, or in the area of the genitals or on the feet,--the feet are often used by aliens for drawing blood; that any such marks may be an indication that the dream had a basis in reality in which case the entity might wish to undergo hypnosis to attempt further clarification to determine whether or not the dream was truly a dream. or whether it was an actual experience. This Awareness indicates that there is some evidence that some entities can neutralize implants by taking germanium over a long period of time. This germanium as available in health food stores as a dietary supplement. This Awareness indicates that it would appear that the use of chelation over extended periods of time will also have some effect, particularly on the metallic elements of the implant; that the implants made of plastic would not be responsive to chelation treatments.

Since then several cats dropped by and adopted the premises and filled the void, for the most part, left by the departed Siegfried. Strangely, however, in the past month a PO, both Vikki and myself somehow mted noetalgicdy noticing dogs and hands around town, finally admitting that we \"missed the vibes\" of an honest to goodness hound. Cats are okay, but a hound in his houndin- is something else. Our 'mourning' for Siegfried was over. This must have energized consciousness somehow, because a few weeks ago we were talking to this man we just happened to run into downtown, about old Siegfried, how we missed having a dog armnd and that we were planning to visit the dog pound and look around one of these days. The guy suddenly slapped his forehead with his hand in amazement and said: \"My god! I wish I had known a week ago you wanted a dog, because I had to take one to the dog pound at that time, a really beautiful dog!\" It seems his dster and her kids were driving along the 1-5 freeway when they saw this great reddish brown hound wandering dong the side, looking scared and bewildered, She stopped the car, figuring the dog would be killed at any moment, opened the back door and whistled, and the hound jumped happily into the car. That was the good news. The bad new was that the landlord would not let her have animals, so after advertising for a week in the Lost and Found, she reluctantIy asked her brother to take the huge beast to the dog pound. When we ran into her brother downtown that day, he said they kept a dog like that 7 days at the pound before executing hi in the gas chamber. Ha figured that today was the 7th day and the dog by now was in that great doggie condo in the sky. Vikki gave me a look that spelled panic and she hollared, \"Let's go!\" Within minutes we were at the pound, asked to see the dog on death row, and sure enough, he was still there. The attendant said he was scheduled to die in about 40 minutes. Needless to say, we quickly adopted the dog, who showed how grateful he was by jumping all over Vikki and prancing on his hind legs with joy.

These vessels, though huge, do not give the impression of enclosing vast amounts of useful space, as would be the case with freighters, or passenger craft. They are up to five hundred miles long, sleek, apparently all technological muscle, and are assumed to be military in nature, and therefore likely hostile. Such a conglomeration of power would not be put together to pay us a friendly visit! We must assume the worst!

THE ALIEN PRESENCE AND THE COMING REPTOID INVASION OF EARTH-AN UPDATE (Opening Message, CAC General Reading) July 19,1991 COSMIC AWARENESS: Government Now is Releasing More UFO Information This Awareness indicates that in regard to the more current events in the UFO arena; that there have been a few changes since this Awareness previously addressed entities in this matter. However, these few changes and events are of some significance. This Awareness indicates that there has been a leaning in certain areas of the govern- ment toward speeding up the release of information re- garding contact between government and alien entities; that this information could be released at any time during the fall of this year, or in '92. Part of the reason for this speeding up of the release of information that the government has had contact with aliens; this being an official release; part of this is due to so much evidence from other sources being released at the current rate, causing the public to become saturated with information of this nature, and the need for the government to be able to control the public perception of the relationship between government and alien contacts. This Awareness indicates that there is also another area that is seen as of significance. This is in regard to the govern- ment having some relationship with the Pleiadians at this time, and pulling away from their alliance with the Greys; that this alliance with the Greys as that which is becom- ing more strained. In fact, there have been some direct clashes. There have also been some efforts to diminish assistance to the Greys in ways that would hinder their efforts. Reptoid-Filled 'Asteroid' Now Circling the Sun This Awareness indicates that there has been a recent release of information regarding an asteroid that is cir- cling the sun, as having high quantities of valuable minerals, including gold and platinum. This Awareness indicates that this appears to be not an asteroid, but an alien craft that may become the target of scientific efforts to probe or do further investigation and take action in corraling the craft.

This Awareness indicates that this is the craft that was previously indicated as being the size of the state of Pennsylvania, or that of Great Britain; that both des- criptions have been used previouly in describing this asteroid; that there are other releases of data or inform- ation relating to material which this Awareness has given regarding aliens that comes out in different ways. Some of the tabloid television shows, such as 'A Current Affair' has released some information. There has been and will continue to be further releases of such information. Watch particularly for information regard- ing the Roswell crash in New Mexico in 1943. There are many entities coming out with information about this now because of the recent release of information. Others who have had some contact and knowledge with this are now coming out and speaking out regard- ing the Roswell crash; that this will continue for some time. The British are Releasing New Abduction Information (Censorship in U.S. Loosening Up) This Awareness indicates the recent release of infor- mation on television from Great Britain; this appears to have been on one of the television tabloid type shows, revealed information that was previously not shown or given on television to the general public, or even to the general public through other forms of media. This was a discussion of British sight- in which entities spoke of abductions and of cattle and human mutilations. This was a first time for such topics on television. This Awareness indicates that this is a strong indication that the censorship regard- ing the alien's negative effects on humans is no longer as present as previously, and that it is not such a taboo to speak of these things. It appears that there is an element in the govern- ment that wants the information to be released to the public in regard to alien abductions and their effects of negative behavior toward humans. Otherwise, this show would have been censored.

Some Help May be Coming From the Good Extraterrestrials This Awareness indicates that this Awareness does not wish to make the future sound bleak. In fact, it appears more hopeful than in recent times, particularly in view of the fact that there are some in the higher echelons or places of power that have contact with those from the Pleiades and that these are helping to give some advice and direction toward the freeing of the planet from the grip of those aliens. This Awareness indicates that this is only a beginning of help from external or extraterrestrials of a beneficial attitude toward humankind, but it is a beginning that can grow into something meaningful for humanity. This Awareness indicates also, that the Pleiadians are not the only entities who have considerable interest in seeing the human race prevail on this planet.

CAC 0.4 Reading) July 20.1991 COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that the recent con- vention of scientists to discuss the threat of aster- oids hitting the earth in 1992, wherein there was the expression of concern that the probability of at least five asteroids hitting the earth was expressed in this convention, and therefore, there needed to be some special defense against these asteroids, should be understood by those entities who are familiar with the publications from CAC and pre- vious predictions or statements by this Awareness regarding the threat of alien invasion in 1992; it should be understood that this is a cover for a potential space war. This Awareness indicates that by calling these asteroids and alerting the people that there may be an asteroid threat to the earth, preparations can be developed to help in ways of diverting or destroy- ing the asteroids as they approach the earth. This Awareness suggests also that entities should be made aware that Dan Quale is in charge of the asteroid project. This Awareness indicates that he also has been instrumental in developing an observatory in the Southwestern part of the United States to watch for asteroids; that the means by which these asteroids would be diverted is expressed by the scientific con- vention as hitting them with nuclear weapons, or attaching rockets to them that would propel them into a different direction. 4. This Awareness indicates that this information was released in the month of June in various newspapers in the United States. There are publications regarding * these asteroids, particularly in the latter half of June, for those who wish to research this. This Awareness indicates that it is obviously a ! erfect cover for those alien attacks that this Awareness as spoken of, thus, It suggests entities watch for new information relating to asteroid movement toward the earth, especially during 1992. HOW TO EXPAND PARAMETERS OF THOUGHT AND MAKE IT EASIER TO COMMUNICATE NEW IDEAS AND CONCEPTS TO OTHER PEOPLE (LIKE THE CONCEPT OF ALIENS!) (CAC Gallard Reading, August 12,1990) QUESTION: Awareness, we're here tonight for a CAC general reading. Does Awareness have an opening message? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that in your conversation just prior to this trance, you were discussing the differ- ences in terms of parameters of thought, the parameters of ideas and concepts. This Awareness indicates that this as a concept that can be helpful to your member- ship in understanding why it is so difficult for them to communicate with others who are not familiar with material that they have gathered through their researches and through these readings. This Awareness indicates that the concept of a param- eter is the idea of the outside edges of a cube of phil- osophy; the concepts of a program or a game or the size of a building, the size of a place, the parameters or outside fences, as entities may call it. The outside definitions, the edges of a field of knowledge. This Awareness indicates in the movieThe Right Stuff,they spoke of pushing out the edge of the envelope. That it is the extension of one's field of understanding to its limits; those are the parameters or surrounding fences that stop or hold the entity's level of awareness or under- standing. This Awareness indicates that when you are speaking of parameters in a computer program, the parameters are the description of the limits of that program or the description of its features; that these parameters are sometimes suggestible according to a customization that is allowed for .the program, and as you adjust the features, you are adjusting the parameters. In other words, for example, you may wish it to have 80 columns wide on your screen, or you may wish it to be 120 columns wide. Each of these would be differ- ent parameters; that the number or rows would signify other parameters. If you set up your screen to have 25 rows or 43 rows, you are selecting different parameters. Parameters of Science This Awareness indicates that science operates under certain parameters and scientists tend to stay within those parameters. There are occasionally daring scientists who go beyond the parameters of acceptable science and get into areas that step outside the parameters of that which is acceptable at great risk to their reputation. That this generally leads to new fields of science, or new levels of science; the stepping from Newtonian science into Quantum Physics is a change in parameters."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"5. This ~wareness indicates that when entities study religion, they are studying the religion within a frame- work of the particular sect or type of religion, and that framework is essentially the parameters of that sect or type of religion, thus, the entities of a fundamental- ist Christian religion operate within certain parameters, c&ain givens, certain rules, certain acceptable concepts, and if they step outside those concepts that are accept- able for the parameters of their own group or sect, then they would be classed as heretics or as being outside the mainstream- Parameten in Society This Awareness indicates that in society there is that which is the mainstream of social conduct and behavior, social thought, social morality, and there are those who step outside these areas; they are essent- ially stepping outside of the parameters. This Aware- ness suggests that when entities became involved with messages from this Awareness and receive information that is outside the mainstream of thought, which includes such things as are given in many of these readings, they may find themselves running into a kind of social barrier wherein they can only speak to their neighbors and friends in a limited way as though being put in a straitjacket, having certain parameters, and if they talk to these friends with all that they understand, the friends look at them as though they are insane. This Awareness indicates you cannot talk to most people about the alien situation, for example, without appearing to be totally out of your gourd, so to speak. This Awareness indicates that in speaking with one who is a fundamentalist or a Catholic or other Christian or other religious discipline, you may find that it is imp- ossible to communicate outside of the limited and narrow area that they understand and accept as their parameter of philosophy. You may visualize this as being likened unto a cube of knowledge that they operate within, and you may also recognize that your cube of knowledge has expanded in size to encompass so much more and you feel a great need to reach out and communicate with others about all of the field of knowledge that you encompass and inhabit in your cube of knowledge. This Awareness indicates that unfortunately, it is next to impossible to communicate easily with one whose parameters are so narrow and so limited as to be unable to include the knowledge that you hold within your own parameters. That sometimes there are entities who are willing to open up their parameters to include and accept information that you have to share with them. These entities, being more open, can collect the information from your parameters, and in so doing, the parameters of their cube of knowledge expand in size to accept and include that which you have to offer them. This does not diminish the size of your parameter, it simply creates a relationship with someone who encom- passes much of your parameters in their programming to allow them to accept more of what you have to offer. This Awareness indicates that in your sojourns you may also run into entities on occasion whereby they have parameters that include knowledge which is foreign to you, or they may have parameters that are even more open to encompass knowledge that you do not have. In your sojourn it is important, and may be valuable for you to open yourself to accept or explore and ex- amine some of this knowledge that others have, and you may yourself encompass some of the knowledge into your parameters and thus push back the edge of your envelope or the edge of your cube of knowledge to again enhance and increase the space for encomp- assing knowledge that you have in your parameters. This Awareness indicates that you may find that speaking with entities who have very narrow and small parameters for their knowledge, who live within a very narrow framework, who do not explore outside that area, that they are likened unto two-dimensional thinkers in comparison to the way you observe and put so much together in your thinking. This is natural. It makes a barrier, so that it becomes difficult to talk with them. If you talk with them from your parameters, they cannot comprehend what you are tallcing about and their narrow limited parameters will cause them to simply reject you, or to see you as being outside of what they consider to be the only right parameters. It is like the entity who knows everything, and if you introduce something new, they will simply tell you: 'It's impossible. I couldn't possibly work, because my rules don't allow that.' This Awareness indicates that there are many scientists who think in this way. There are scientists and experts within a limited field, and therefore, anything outside that limited field would be an impossibility. There are many people in religious disciplines or in occupations whose thinking is also limited, in narrow parameters, and when they speak to you, and you speak with them from parameters that are much greater in scope, you are simply an outsider and cannot possibly have anything worthy to say. You are a dreamer. You are one with a This Awareness indicates that the general rule for communicating with entities who have a more narrow set of parameters is to speak to them within their own parameters. Speak with them within the confines of their own limited understanding. Push these confines back just a little and allow them to know that there is more that is available, if they wish to communicate further with you; that you understand what they have to say, and you understand a little more than they understand in regard to their own philosophy. This Awareness indicates you do not want to overwhelm them with everything that you have to give for they will simply shut off, close down, lock up shop and go on vacation to get away from you; that the other rule is that if you run into someone who has a knowledge of everything or much of what you know, it is time to open up and to accept or listen to and share and ex- change ideas, and see what is available from them in ex- change for information that is available from you, for sometimes they will carry part of the puzzle and may be looking for answers which you have while you may have answers to some of the puzzle and need pieces that they are carrying, and together, you may both enlarge your parameters greatly, to where you both have greater answers to the puzzle and you may leave from the comm- unications both the wiser. This Awareness indicates of course, thoughts that entities share do not have to be passed from mouth to ear; they can be passed in books, in newsletters, on tele- phones, and in movies or in actions shared by each other, or other means. There are many means of communication. This Awareness indicates that any means of cornmunicat- ion between entities who have something to share with each other helps to push back the envelope to broaden the parameters of one's cube of knowledge."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"- IS THE HUBBLE TELESCOPE REALLY DEFECTIVE? 6. QUESTION: A question from B.F. This question has been coming in from several others basically. \"I have a question for Awareness. Is the Hubble Space Telescope really defective, or are they, the NASA people keeping secrets on what they really have seen so far? It also seems peculiar that the scrapped shuttle flight also contains a super telescope of some kind and is grounded due to these helium leaks. It would be great to hear what Awareness can advise on this present situation.\" COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that these are essentially spy devices to observe into outer space, to find, follow and to track alien craft and movements. That in both instances, there were damages perpetrated to these devices to prevent them from working in accordance with the intended purp- ose and it has become necessary to make adjustments for improving these devices in order to further make use of them for their intended purposes. 'We can't be absolutely sure that these beings are hostile,\" says the NASA source. \"But if they intend to take over the Earth, we must put up a fight.\" 1 Is there any truth to that article, or is that a fabrication? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates there is some threads of truth in the article. There are some areas that have been fabricated. This Awareness indicates that the purpose of the Hubble telescope was to watch the heavens for the invading fleet or invading intruders. The indications this Awareness sees is that the intruders are coming in that which is more the size of a small planetoid; that it is seen that this concept of a fleet of 43 as being fabricated. In general, however, the scenario and the general story as being closer to the truth than outside of truth. This Awareness indicates that the seeing of this was no surprise. It was the purpose for putting the telescope up at this time. It is seen as being a key part of future preparation. This has already been discussed to a limited degree in regard to Reptoid invasion forces by this DID THE HUBBLE REALLY SPOT Awareness in previous readings. AN INVADING ALIEN FLEET?

This Awareness indicates that the fake invasion would be used to introduce the aliens who are already here, with an implication or presentation that they have just mived or recently arrived, and that it turns out they are friendly, so that with the aliens giving tech- nologies such as cures for AIDS or cancer and other help- ful benefits to humanity, they would be accepted dong with the One World Government. This Awareness indicates however, there is also that threat of real invasion that has been mentioned, which is more inclined toward the time of 1996 or 1997; that if the invasion is to occur within the next two years, it is more likely a fake invasion even though aliens may be involved. You must understand that the invasion already hus occurred and aliens are already present, but these stories being leaked about ships coming are designed to prepare entities for this fake invasion so that they will be ready to accept new information into their parameters of reality, when the time comes for their new program- ming, to include a One World Government and other National Emergency deeds. This Awareness indicates that in essence, this too and the One World Government can be recognized as part of the preparation for the potential of the real invasion that may follow several years thereafter. That this, in essence, is seen as a pact between aliens presently on earth and humans in a kid of alliance that may be designed to attend the threat of invasion from Reptoids; that this is one of the scenarios being enacted. It may alter from this plan or be altered by energies that would counter such a plan. THE TELESCOPE ON THE MAGELLAN SPACECRAFT (More on Life on the Illloon, Mars & Venus) QUESTION: NASA just launched the Magellan spacecraft to orbit Venus, and on it, the 3.7 ton Magellan, is another tele- scope that they plan to take the best radar pictures yet of the surface of Venus. Is this another watching device to spot incoming aliens or is this legitimate as they are telling the public? C 0 S MIC AWARENESS: COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates this as another attempt to keep track of alien movements; that there are alien craft or alien beings using Venus, Mars and the moon; that there are technologies that allow aliens to have bases on Venus, regardless of the alleged heat problems that most earthlings are cognizant of, just as there are technologies that allow bases on Mars and the moon in spite of alleged atmospheric problems. !FOLLOW-UP QUESTION): These are bases on the planets in addition to the infor- mation Awareness gave previously on entities living within the hollow structure of these planets. Is that correct? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that on the moon there are bases under certain water or lake areas. There is, in the shadow area of the moon, between the dark side and the light side, a certain amount of life, of vegetation, and on the far side of that shadow are some craters, for example, is water. There is moisture on the moon and a small amount of atmosphere, especially in those areas where darkness and light commingle and there is a lake in which UFOs enter and leave under - ground facilities. This Awareness indicates that Venus also has bases. It is very difficult for entities to understand this because of the technologies that can alter the concept of heat. Heat being a pressure on molecules, but wherein a tech- nology is capable of transcending vibration on the electro- magnetic scale, it does not experience heat unless it is within that particular level of electromagnetic frequency that the heat resides on and has its effect. This Awareness indicates that there are also domes and underground facilities available on both Venus and Mars. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS: There has also been stories lately of close encounters the earth has had with asteroids, and speeding asteroids whizzing past a ,comparatively tiny distance of 3 million miles and so on. Are these reports really of asteroids, or are these more actually some of these Reptilian spaceships Awareness indicated? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates in most cases they are asteroids. There has been a number of craft that have passed earth's orbit that have been mistaken for asteroids or have been mislabeled as asteroids which are, in fact, inhabited by entities. (New Technology Produces the 'Flash Gun') QUESTION: L.B. in Maine, sent in an article, evidently from a tabloid, about a killer cloud that melts an entire city in China, and eye-witnesses confirm that 35,000 residents were reduced to water, from a mysterious black cloud that turned an entire city and everyone in it, into a shimmering pool of water. Is there any truth to this story? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this is seen as the testing of a weapon type; that it is essentially the opposite of that which is used by aliens and which your government also has, which is a kind of gun that emits a ray that sucks all the water out of the thing it shoots at. This Awareness indicates that with such a gun, a human body could be dried up in a matter of seconds, with all water extracted from the burst. This Awareness indicates that the other is seen as having been tested ... there appears to be some fab- rication in the telling of the story in regard to the number of entities. It appears it was a small village on which this was tested and it was a certain kind of weaponry that sucks water out into the cloud as it passes overhead. The cloud contained the weapon, drawing energies that formed the cloud and drew water from entities, turning them to dust and drop- ping water back to earth. This Awareness indicates this appears to be a var- iation of that same type of technology. This weapon referred to as the Flash Gun; that name as commonly used for the weapon. This as having a similar type of technology to that described in the newspaper article for the cloud. (FOLLOWUP QUESTION): So this was not aliens. This was from the government or elsewhere?"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"COSMlC AWARENESS: This Awareness does not wish to comment on this; that this as being information that ...

Therdore, this Aware- ness suggests that you not pursue this question further at this time; that there may be, at some future time when this information comes out further, and you may ask further questions on this. At this time it would be much likened unto trying to extract information in 1943 about the atom bomb. STRANGE SERPENT-LIKE UFO SIGHTED IN CHINA (New Technology of warping molecules) QUESTION: One othei question a member sent in on a UFO, if this isn't related to the above question. It says that a gigantic UFO six miles wide and shaped like a coiled serpent struck terror in the hearts of millions of people as it swoops through the skies over four provinces in Central China. The flight of the colossal UFO positively identified as a spaceship by experts, was reported in Chinese newspapers which normally ignore extraten- estrial sightings. And it goes on and on, but it says other witnesses clearly described the UFO as a huge shimmering coil that rotated clockwise at a high rate of speed as it rocketed through the night sky only one thousand feet or so above the ground. Is there any truth to that story? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this appears to have a degree of truth to it; that this reaches into tech- nologies that are not understood by your people. This Awareness indicates that it is very difficult to explain these technlogies. This has been briefly des- cribed on occasion, wherein entities have reported ... This Awareness indicates that this is extremely difficult for an explanation that can be comprehended. It relates to the nature of a technology that allows a perception of something which is small to appear to be extremely large in size, or something that is ex- tremely large, to appear to be small. How Tiny UFOs & ~iles-~on~'~~~s Are Created This Awareness indicates that an example as having been reported wherein an entity steps inside a thirty- five foot spacecraft to make photographs and at the door, looking inside, saw that the spacecraft was almost the size of a football field, yet on the inside was barely more than one tenth of that size. It has to do with the warping of molecules so that when an entity enters into a small space, the entity's molecules become more dense, causing the entity to become smaller and the space to appear larger. That likewise, illusions can 8. be created to cause a small craft to appear much larger in size by expanding the space between the molecules. Therefore, you have reports of little tiny flying sauces. ' three feet across or less, and larger flying saucers such as six miles across. It has to do with the expansion of the space or contraction of the space between the mole- cules that allows these things to change size, to become more dense or to become less dense. Faster than Light Travel Used bv Aliens This Awareness indicates that this is also part of that technology that allows them to shift from one dimension to another in order to travel at higher speeds by bending light or bending the timelspace continuum, flippeg in to a different vibratory rate and then reappearing m another dimension or frequency. It allows faster than light travel. It is a difficult concept to explain. This Awareness indicates that some time back, one of your tabloids described a story of scientists who recog- nized a galaxy as being a fetus, and that the fetus was emitting a sound like that of a child. This was a distant galaxy, and they theorized that it was a child waiting to be born in a universal body. This Awareness indicates that this is part of the same physics as described in the previous message; that a universe can function in the shape of a human being; that you as a universe can have within you little tiny replicas of yourself in the DNA code, or in atomic levels, running around inside having their own individualities and life experiences, and you may not be aware of these, even as they are not aware of you. Your Relationship to the Body of God Yet there is definitely a contact between the two of you, an interrelationship; just as you may be a cell in the body of God, the Universal Deity, and you may not be well aware of the Universal Deity, and It may not be fully focused on you as an individual, and yet there is a relationship connected by consciousness that allows the two of you to as one. This Awareness indicates that if you were to remove all space between atoms, everything would collapse into a very small pile of dust, and yet you can expand; if you doubled the space between atoms, think how much larger everything would be. Of course, in proportion, no one would notice the change if they too expanded accordingly. THE FACE ON MARS MONUMENT NOW DISCOVERED BENEATH THE POLAR ICE CAPS. IS THIS TRUE? QUESTION: Awareness has given information on those monuments on Mars. Yet, V.M. a member, asks that we request as many facts as possible regarding this face on Mars, and adds that an African country has produced a postage stamp with this face pictured on it, and there s much speculation regarding it. And member V.D. sent in a tabloid article saying that an incredible discovery revealed in Antartica, that a stone face found under a polar ice cap is identical to the image photographed on Mars in 1976, and it shows a blown-up picture of it under the ice, and the article reads in part: \"German and American scientists have found a stone face under polar ice that's identical to the stone face on Mars. The mile long monument also matches the stone faces found on the moon, Venus and Neptune, and that suggests that the people or creatures who built them were capable of interplanetary travel over 500,000 years ago, when the images are believed to have been made.\""},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"It goes on, but would Awareness indicate whether this is true, that they have discovered and photographed this monument under the polar ice caps, and perhaps give a little more information on this? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this appears to be accur- ate; that the faces, while not absolutely identical, are very close and do resemble human shape; that it appears that these features were left by entities from Sirius, these entities as having colonated many different places. In the framework of information that has been given, you may perceive these as having been remnants of that which relates to Enki, and the Founders. This not from Reptoid sources. This Awareness indicates that the purpose of these as previously stated was to serve as a kind of trademark. It is likened unto the United States planting a flag on the moon or the British attempting to plant a flag on the Falkland Islands, to show who owns the territory; this to warn off others travelling by or to alert them as to whom they are dealing with, if they land there. \" HAVE A NICE DAY\" --- QUESTION: Member B.B. in California sent in a photo copy of a couple of pages of a book. She sars this is from a book by Eustace Mullins. She writes: ' It's very weird. Would you ask Awareness if this is valid information?\" It doesn't say which book its from, but it's one of his, where he goes into Zionism. 121 read the two pages: It was the ingrained bloodthirstiness of the Jews which led them to select as their principle \"religious\" holiday, the Feast of Purim, which celebrates their massacre of the innocents. ESTHER VIII: 17. \"And in every province and in every city, whithersoever the King's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.\" One of the most striking parts of this. well known quotation from the Book of Esther, the only genuinely Jewish book of the Bible, and, for that reason, the only one in which God is not mentioned, is the revelation that the code word of the Jews to indicate their knowledge of the Jewish World Murder Plan, is their remembrance of their massacre of the innocents by their code phrase, \"had a good day.\" Since that massacre, Jews have always offered this recognition phrase to each other, in Yiddish or in whatever language of the particular nation which they planned to take over, by saying, \"Have a good day,\" meaning, of course, 'We're looking forward to more massacres of the women and children of the goyim, or the gentile cattle.\" Now that the Jews have attained such enormous economic and political power in the United States, they have instructed DO WE REALLY WANT TO ? all of their gentile employees in the vast networks of retail grocery, drug and apparel stores which they own throughout the United States that they must greet each customer by saying, \"Have a good day.\" This apparently friendly and supposedly meaningless salutation lets the Jews in the know be tipped off that he is in a store owned by Jews, and that the owners are anticipating \"having a good day\" in the future by more slaughters of the innocent and helpless gentile women and children . She'd like to know if that information is valid. COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that there is some basis for the phraseology, the terminology in the Yiddish lang- uage for the terms used meaning 'Have a good day' much as there is in the English language for entities saying: 'Goodbye' to each other, which means \"God be with you.\" The entities using the phraseology 'Have a good day' are not in nine hundred and ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine percent of the cases, intend- ing to link that term to an entity attempting to or wanting to slaughter others. In most cases they mean strictly what the words mean. The terminology as having been around before the slaughter spoken of in the historic occasion and was simply applied to the occasion out of traditional language patterns and their attitude toward the event at the time. It is not seen as being a sinister remark when used, though"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"1 there may be some trivia value in knowing this inform- atlon in regard to its origin and thb history of the term. ARE CHRISTIANS AND JEWS STILL AT IT? DO THEY WANT TO DRINK EACH OTHERS'BLOOD? (FOLL~W-UP QUESTION j: ( ''The Fear of the Jew\" Syndrome) She asla one other question about this book; whether .this information I'll read pertains to the current day. Mr. Mullins researches this out of ancient texts and a lot of it probably isn't applicable at all, but I'll read it, since we are into this subject at this time. It says: The Most important statement in the Book of Esther is the warning that \"the fear of the Jews fell upon them.\" Today, the dark shadow of imminent tragedy looms over every Christian, because of their fear of the Jews, and because of their instinctive knowledge, like penned cattle in a slaughterhouse, that the Jew, intends to kill them for his profit. Jacob Timerman, in an enlight- ening series of articles in the New Yorker Magazine in 1982, said, \"TO understand the existence of the Other and then admit his existence without hatred is something new for Israel as a whole.\" The Other, of course, means the non-Jew, a person whom the Jew cannot see without hatred. Because of his savage nature, the Jey wishes only to kill him and drink his Mood. It is this terrible desm which bars the Jew from peaceful existence in any civilized nation, and which has been solely responsible for the occasional but in- effective resistance which the intended Christian victims have offered in opposition to his murder plans. The Jew has only one purpose in the Middle East, and that is to murder all of the Arab inhabitants and to take their lands. The great scholar, Dr. Eric Bischoff, discovered this revelation in the official Jewish text of the Thikune Zohar, Edition Berdiwetsch, 88b, a book which, like all Jewish \"religious \" texts, is actually a code of cabbalistic rituals detailing the instructions on how to murder the gentiles. \"Furthermore,\" says Thikune Zohar, \"there is a commandment pertaining to the killing of strangers, who are like beasts. This killing has to be done in the lawful Jewish method. Those who do not bid themselves to the Jewish religious law must be offered up as sacrifices to the High God.\" COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that if you look back in history, most religions have had periods in their history and writin@ in some of their literature on how to get rid of heathens or those who are not of their religion. If you look into the Christian history, you will find that there are and were periods of time in which anyone who was not a auist- ian was dealt with in similar ways to destroy or torture ' the entity if they did not embrace Christianity. What's new? This Awareness indicates that it is time for entities to stop fearing each other's religion or race based on past history and start looking at each other afresh in regard to what they are doing now, not what was said a thous- and years ago, or two or three thousand years ago in their literature. This Awareness indicates it does not appear to be of great sinister significance, significance in terms of any sinister connection or wariness. It is not important that entities be aware of this; it is more along the line of trivia. This Awareness indicates that this phrase is in the book of Mullins called The &me of Canaan, it being an expose that has a kind of one-sided approach and view of history in which one side of the negative coin is attributed to lineage from the line of Cain and in which the negativities of Christianity are totally ignored. There is very little discussion or mention of the atroc- ities that have been handed down through Christianity and the line stemming from Shem, and only those of the one side are shown in magnified form. It appears this book is well written and weil researched, with consider- '' able historical value, but is somewhat slanted in an un- balanced presentation. This Awareness indicates in read- ing the book, entities understanding that imbalance can 0 still receive considerable information but should not be too easily polarized, if they are aware of the imbalance Khazar Jews Were Blonds and Finnish in Origin (The Origin of the Word \"'Jew\" ) This Awareness indicates that another issue: the word Jew was not introduced until approximately the 14th Century and was used to describe Khazars, entities of a blonde-haired blue eyed Finnish background who lived along the Volga river, and who did not want to embrace Byzantine Christianity or orthodox Christianity of Russia at the time, and did not want to embrace Catholicism from the Roman origin, both of whom were trying to convert these entities to their faith. Therefore, to spite them both, they embraced the IIebrew religion, the religion that became known as Judaism. They went back into history and they found the term Judah, and claimed to be remnants of Jude, and embraced the Caballah. They have since claimed to have a connection with the land of Palestine and the early Hebrews. This Awareness indicates that much of the rewriting of the Bible then incorporated changes from the term 'Hebrew' to 'Jew' so that people now believe the term 'Jew' reached back into the time of Christ and before. That term was not used in those days. This Awareness indicates that there is also the present political movement known as Zionism, which stems from the works of these Khazar Finns, these entities who are of Finnish origin and are Khazars from Russia with blonde hair and blue eyes in general, who formed that which became the move- ment known as Zionism and who put themselves into banking, formulating projects which allowed them to manipulate money. These are the ones that entities think of as Jews. This Awareness indicates that they embraced the teachings of the Hebrews and some of their ancient books because 'they were forced to choose something. The Catholic and 'the orthodox churches would not let them go without having a religion. They were very much like gypsies. This Awareness indicates that in this movement of Zionism, their main interest was in regard to the profiting from money,for they were not allowed to work in ordinary jobs and were thus relegated into being creative and finding ways to make money without holding an ordinary service job, so they were forced into occupations that dealt with manipulating cash, loaning money, usary and pawn shops and such. This Awareness indicates that this then became a pro- fession and trademark of many of these entities, and it helped to stereotype them. This Awareness indicates the ordinary person who, from Israel and from the area of Palestine, may have still clung to some of the teachings or literature left from ancient times, and may have called themselves Jews, even if they were not part of this Khazar movement and there were bands and groups of entities who studied these things from a traditional sense, and held their religion sacred. The majority of the millions of Jews are not interested in drinking the blood of Christians. This is but a loaded imagery to create panic and cause extremism and polar- ized thinking in the minds of those who are easily influ- enced and frightened and who can be persuaded to get polarized against someone. There are probably as many Christians wishing to drink the blood of Jews as there are Jews wishing to drink the blood of Christians.

COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates this as in the negative. That there can be some rare situations in which an entity who happens to be Jewish might be taught by another who happens to be Jewish, this kind of thinking, but it is as rare as having some Christian teaching another Christian to hate the Jews and to wish to slaughter them in the form of Naziism. Of course there are those aberrations but this is not the mainstream of Jewish thinking. It is sorrowful that entities cannot get to know each other better in regard to what people are really like. It is too bad that the entities are so easily influenced by images that terrorize and spread fear and paranoia. This Awareness reminds you that the first Interpreter, Ralph Duby was Jewish. This Awareness reminds you that there have been many entities in this organization who are Jewish. This Awareness indicates there has never been any indication that any of these entities was even remotely interested in harming others for being Christian. This Awareness indicates such books only have sig- nificance in terms of history, in regard to this factor. MANY JEWS FORCED TO CONVERT OR ELSE (I~OLLOW-UP QULSTION): I read somewhere that during the Roman Inquisition or the Spanish Inquisition, tharJews were ordered to convert to Christianity or they would be tortured and condemned to death.

This Awareness indicates there are always reasons why you can reject another, why you can exclude yourself from communicating with another, why you can hold hostility and contempt for another. There are always reasons, if that is the way you create your parameters, to exclude others, and thus to make yourself appear to yourself and to your elite few friends as being special. What a great illusion. (The Law of Gmtitude is given) ED'S Note: CAC does not stock the book, 'The Curse of Canaan,' by Eustace Mullins. It is available, however, from CPA Book PuWers, PO Box 596, Boring, Oregon, 97009. There is also a two volume book called \"The Fear of the Jews Syndrome\", written by R. M. Jurjevich, published by Ichthys Books, Inc. PO Box 1701, Glenwood Spring, Cdo. 81602. At first, this editor had decided not to include that question by the lady who asked about Mullins' book and \"Have a nice day\" etc., but upon reading it and finding Awareness' Closing Message tied into it, decided to include it, beings the entire reading was reproduced. Writing about Jews is nerve-wracking because no matter how the subject may be covered or from what frame of reference is being discussed. we always seem to get letters, some quite &my, adg us of anti-Semitign. In fact, even our transcriber who knows better, penned in at the bottom of the quote from Mullins' book, read in the question; 'What is this anti Semite shit?\" Look, we ask the questions you guys send in, and I personally think Awareness handles them quite nicely. There ARE bigots out there and 'drinking the blood of Christians' is a concept many of them actually still believe and promote. Here at CAC we are not bigots, and although I periodically as editor get accused of being one, we do ask questions in this highly charged area and we publish them and the answers from Awareness in the hope that the information will help to defuse these polarized energies.

(CAC General Reading, Aug. 10. 1990) ARE MASS KILLERS BEING DRUGGED BY DOCTORS? THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL ? QUESTION: A question from H.W. She writes: \"I started a new job, very low on the totem, as a clinical worker with the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta. The pro- gram that I work for is Public Health Practice Ro- gram Office. Its basic forum or rather mission is to strengthen the Public Health's infrastructure. It's implementing many Federal guidelines for all labs and health centers in the United States. Very contro- versial. They work with state-of-the-art equipment, money out the yin-yang, blood, body fluids, etc. My question is: Are they actually helping in the long run, the world by the year 2000, to be able to cope with its health problems, or at its basic core, have they sold out to the aliens? It just seems to me in deal- ing with laboratory diseases and experiments, some where up the line of command there would be too many common denominatoras, not to cross paths with the aliens.\" That's the question. COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this as having different levels of response in some areas. The individuals who may be moving forces in regard to this have sincere motives in other areas. There are distorted and mis- understood directives or purposes. That in still other areas there are those intentions whereby population control factors and assistance in terms of helping to increase the workload of doctors and the medical pro- fession are part of the action. This Awareness indicates an answer cannot be given to this question in a blanket sense. There are some areas and some entities whose intentions in this action are not for the benefit of the masses. This Awareness indicates it is something that needs to be watched care- fully in regard to the various situations that develop ovei ~eriods of time. QUESTION: A question from J.W. in California. \"A letter from a reader of the paper attached: 'Guns don't kill people, psychiatrists do!' fascinated me. This is a question for Awareness. Do the drugs prescribed for treatment of psychiatric patients sometimes cause these patients to suddenly break out in homocidal behavior, as the letter alleges? ' (I'll read the letter): Before gun control zealots seize on the recent Jacksonville shooting as a new reason to outlaw firearms, why not have a reporter check to see if perpetrator Pough was on drugs prescribed by a psychiatrist, as in the case of so many recent spectacular shooting incidents, for example: John Hinkley had taken four Valiums only two hours before he shot President Reagan. Laurie Dann (Winnetka School killer) was on Anafmnil (obtained from Canada) and Lithium. Patrick Purdy (Stockton school killer) was on Thora- zine and Elavil. Joseph Wesbecker (Louisville printing plant killer) was on Lithium, Restoril, Cogentin and Prozac. James Wilson (Carolina school killer) was withdrawing from Xanax, and for years had been given a variety of drugs, including Thora- zine, Valium, Halcion, Mellaril, Vistaril, Lithium and others.

This Awareness indicates that there are many factors involved in the question that are far too serious and have potential disturbances for deep response at this time. This Awareness indicates that the use of the psy- chiatriac profession by conspirators of a nation or a group of entities as that which is nothing new; that this does not imply a general reference to all psych- iatrists, but there are some psychiatrists who use their profession and allow their position in their pro- fession to be misused for certain purposes that can have political effects on society, effects that would alter value systems and behavior of groups and ind- ividuals."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"13.

When Children are Abused by Family Violence This Awareness indicates that in some cases, a mother will have children and be the victim of an abusing father of those children. The children will be abused, the mother will be abused. It is the responsibility of the mother to those children to get those children away. This can be d?ne through agencies, especially in the more highly civilized countries. There are agencies that are set UP, designed to protect entities from domestic violence, to protect children from domestic violence. These laws and protections need to be strengthened even further. This Awareness indicates that in some of the less highly civilized nations there are laws that allow domestic violence by the husband, allow the husband to beat or even to kill his wife or children. That even in this country one hundred years ago in this United States, laws allowed the father to beat the child if necessary, to death, for disobedience. Fortunately these laws have changed. In some countries this is still committed. Author- ities simply ignore the situations.

BACK TO ALIEN IMPLANTS & KILLERS (FOLLOWUP QUESTION): The question of possible implants by aliens in these entities who go berserk and kill school children: did Awareness cover that in that statement? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this is seen as a possibility in some instances. It is not seen as a common action in- volved in such instances. There are some cases wherein this, either through alien or through government implants or through hypnotic techniques and drug use; the combin- ation of hypnotism, drug use and implantation for trigger- ing actions is used on occasion by some entities for creat- ing assassins, or using entities for purposes that are less than noble. This Awareness indicates that many of the assassins or attempted assassins during the past fifty years have been programmed in this way, either through implants, drug use or hypnosis or a combination of these. There is information available in regard to this kind of mind control in various books. (FOLLOW-UP QUESTION): Is there any significance that the movie The Manchur- ion Candidate, which deals with this very subject of mind control and having an entity murder people, seemingly mindlessly, has been removed from circulation for some twenty years and it is now back on television? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this may be significant that it is now back on television. The question does not indicate what is significant about this. The significance in reshowing a movie that has not been shown for some time is not in itself significant. This occasionally happens. This Avareness indicates It does not understand the question, the significance of the question or what is being sought in the question. FOLLOWU UP QUESTION): The subject matter, that certain powers at one time sought to control and keep from the public,% now back in circulation and I was wondering: Is it back in circ- ulation because they figure that information is no longer a threat, or could it possibly be back in circulation as a type of programming to let people see how it's done, a sort of conditioning, rather like the violent movies that are back in? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates this as being a movie that appears to be regulated strictly by those distributors who recognize the film has marketability at this time. It is not seen as a film controlled by government or CIA or as a film that would be used in order to manipulate mass- consciousness or to influence or to alert the masses. It is simply seen as a film that was made, had its day and was shelved and forgotten for a time, until someone noticed that it was a good movie and might not have been seen by a generation of entities, and therefore, might have both nostalgic value from those who had seen it some time ago and others who have not yet seen it, and there- fore, it was brought back. ED'S Note: Sorry I asked!"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"16 SHE DREAMED OF A BLUE LIGHT AND ALIENS! [HOW the Brain Proceues a Thought) QUESTION: A question from D.S. 'The information you've been pub- lishing lately about the aliens is rather disconcerting. Part of me wants to ignore it, but I can't. Dozens of @- have occurred to me as I read the information. The fa- is one of them: The blue light has been mentioned as a mechanism for transporting abductees. Has a blue lat been mentioned for any other purposes? When I was in college in 1975 I had an intense dream which seemed SO very real. In the dream I was observing a brilliant blue light as it followed along the circuitry of my brain. %c~- ing this I was very excited, in a state of wonder, because I understood, I felt exactly how the brain processes a thought. Then my alarm clock went off. I had set it unusually early to get up and do some studying. \"The blue light disappeared immediately, but my understanding of how the brain works faded gradually as I slowly came awake. I concentrated very hard on trying to maintain the insights, but I couldn't. It was like trying to hold a piece of the wind. The idea that this could have been something other than a dream, such as an alien mind probe never occurred to me until I read about the blue light in your newsletter. \"Do I have an implant, I wonder? If you have already published information about something like this, I must have missed it and would greatly appreciate it if you would refer me to the issue. If not, I would ask you to please read this to Awareness and ask for a comment. Perhaps it was just a dream!.\" COSMIC AWARENESS: A Link to Cosmic Awareness: How to Watch your Brain Work This Awareness indicates that this was just a dream; that in this vision the blue light you were seeing as that which is the electromagnetic energy within the brain itself, stemming from the linking of the pituitarylpineal energy field, looking out over the brain. You were indeed examining the brain. It is much like the action of being in a trance level, such as that which the Inter- preter now experiences in tuning in to this Awareness. This Awareness indicates if entities turn their atten- tion backwards from where it focuses from, approx- imately one inch, and look back to an area in the center of the head and slightly above the level of the ears, the action will be one in which the pineal and pituitary focus on each other, and this creates an energy field caused by certain of the chemical reactions of these glands, or you may refer to these as chakras, and this energy field'becomes a doorway to this Awareness. This Awareness indicates that it simply feels like a little light-bulb in the head, with a soft feeling; that if you turn then directly overhead, you will feel another light above your head; this out of the top of your head. If lying down, it will be an extension above your head rather than above your nose or eyes. It will parallel the ground or floor or bed. Approximately 6 inches above the crown or top of your head, you will feel another light energy. That energy may be equated to. a halo, or to your High Self, depending on how you wish to interpret this. This Awareness indicates that this is also an aspect of, or link, or doorway to this Awareness. That from these focal points, you may then look at the brain itself within the head and you may see that it operates from electrical currents that dance on different areas, much like thunder and lightning dancing on the clouds of a storm, triggering different memories, words, concepts and ideas and feelings and 'emotions in different areas of the brain as these currents dance from place to place. ALIEN AND OTHER IMPLANTS: THEIR MANY USES QUESTION: Awareness has given quite a bit of information on. implants. Member J.S. in California, submitted a 1st of possible reasons why. He writes: \"I have long con- templated the question: What purpose might be served for the alien forces' plans by the insertion of the alien &plants in the heads of abductees. A number of ~05s- lbdlties come to mind. (1) Monitor the speech and act- ivities of entities. (2) Make possible the rapid location andlor immobilization of entities in case of a need to abduct them again. (3) Send disruptive electronic signals into the nervous system to cause .nervous dyslunctioq,, mental or physical disease. (4) Make people 'hear voices of God or the devil to drive them crazy and bring about incarceration for violence or bizarre behavior. (5) To stimulate hatred, greed, envy or other base emotions and to block spiritual awareness. (6) They might contain explosive toxic carcinogenic or teratogenic (mutation- causing) chemicals or radioactive material (such as plutonium) to cause brain cancer. Please ask Awareness about these implants.\" COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that any of these can be used in implanting. The more common purpose being that of monitoring entities and also the most common being that of monitoring the chemical or hormonal balance of entities under certain conditions: the selection of certain types of entities, implanting them with certain types of implants, then taking from them the implant at a later time and examining to determine the hormonal and chem- ical balance of the individuals in regard to the gland near which the implant was placed, as being a more common form. This in an effort to discover how these particular hormonal glands work in humans because the aliens do not have the similar hormonal glandular natures or sub- stances and workings in their own natures. This is a more common purpose for the implants; in some instances they are used for monitoring and watching others and in some instances they can be used to turn the entity into a walking time bomb. In fact, there have been instances in which entities have literally exploded with no explanation as to why or how. There is very little purpose in aliens implanting in order to destroy the individual through cancer or some other device, radiation device or action simply to destroy the individual. That could be done without the implanting if they so desired to do so. All Zeta Rmticuli Aliens are Not Hostile This Awareness wishes also to point out that It wishes to clarify that not all of the Zeta Reticuli are involved in hostile actions against humans. Some are more benevolent toward humans and are of a scientific mind in a more gentle and passive approach in their scientific research. Others have a kind of hostility. This Awareness indicates that this stems from two different types of the Zeta Ret- iculi coming from two different star systems in the Zeta Reticuli system. This Awareness indicates that the tall Grey Orion types with the large noses are not as much involved in abductions as are the Zeta Reticuli and their Reptoid masters. Those entities involved in the implants are generally and more commonly associated with the Zeta Reticuli and their RRptoid masters.

The space geneticist Jehovah from Mars that Awareness has mentioned so often; is Awareness saying that this entity was the Reptilian entity? ED'S Note: The book, \"The Prism of Lyra': by Lyssa Royal and Keith Priest. is published by Royal Priest Research, PO CO%MIC AWARENESS: This is in the affirmative. (FOLLOWUP QUESTION): , Well, if he cloned Adam and Eve in his image... COSMIC AWARENESS: These entities were Reptilian in nature; that the Rep- tilib skin was shed after the action of Enki the Sirius group. The Serius group entered upon the earth plane and worked with these humans, or creations of the Repilian types, creations of Jehovah, or whatever name you choose; these entities had scales and were worked with by Enki, and the Enki altered them to give them more of the mammal qualities. 'fhe Naked Feeling When Scales Were Removed (Circumcision: The Shedding of the Serpent Skin) This Awareness indicates that the entities , the entity, was put into a deep sleep; it is a reference to a long period of time in which the entity, the entities, were genetically hibernated and worked with to be changed or altered so that the skin of the Reptilian type was removed and the Sirius creator then in removing that skim, gave them the altered form which is common to humans, thus upon awakening, the entities discovered their nakedness, and felt themselves to be most vulner- able and wanting to cover themselves. This Awareness indicates that it has been pointed out in the book Flying Serpents and Dmgons that the ritual of circumcision is a carry-over of the shedding of skin or shedding of the serpent skin. It is a symbolic ritual; that this essentially is correct. This Awareness ind- icates that as time passed, the mammal qualities began to grow in dominance and the Reptilian qualities became more and more recessive in the genetic pattern of human- ity, thus, in the earlier history of human-kind, the lives of entities were commonly measured in time spans above five or six hundred years in length; this is because of the long Reptilian lifespan. Humanity Now Stands on Threshhold of Immortality As time passed and the Reptilian strain became more recessive and the mammal strain became more dominant, the lifespan began to reduce. This Awareness indicates it now has reached a time wherein through the tradeoff of knowledge in place of long life (or immortality in the sense of actual physical immortality associated with the Reptoids), humankind eating of the Tree of Knowledge or that of having choice and becoming capable of thought, now being able to make choices and indulge in procreat- ion rather than being cloned; mankind's lifespan having been greatly shortened because of this, is now enjoying that which the gods have always had,--knowledge,--and is rediscovering concepts that the gods held at the time mankind was created, that is, the concepts of cloning and genetic engineering and the ability to reproduce and alter lifespans.: Box 12626, ~cottsdale, AZ 85267.

THE WEB OF CONSPIRACY (THE ALIEN PRESENCE) Part 11 : THE FACE OF THE INVADERS THAT STORM REPORTED SEEN ON SATURN QUESTION: A couple of questions relating to the last reading. Awareness indicated that plutonium was launched and hit Saturn. Was there any harm done to any entities that might possibly be on that planet? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that It was suggesting that this appears to have been the case, in regard to this launching. It is not an absolute clarity to this Aware- ness that this occurred. It appears that this is what occurred. This Awareness indicates that the energies are not sufficiently clear to state this as an absolute. It does not appear that there were entities on the planet, in fact, it does not appear that entities live on the surface of Saturn. This Awareness indicates that it appears Titan, a moon of Saturn is a base in which entities gather. It appears that there are some areas of a subsurface nature cn Saturn where entities reside. The indications do not suggest the plutonium storm created a threat to surface beings on Saturn, for it does not appear there are surface beings on Saturn in the physical world dimension. WHY DON'T THE ALIENS TAKE OUT THE HUBBLE? This Awareness indicates that whereas the movie Predator and Predator 2 gives the impression of aliens of a Reptoid nature, having a high technology and being superhuman in terms of strength and power, the Reptoids in actuality are not of this same appearance. The skin of the Reptoids as scaly and green in color but the facial features are not dis- torted as in the movie Predator 2, having the great ugliness as ~ortraved in the movie. These entities have more humanoid type faces but the features are covered with scales. The nose being more like that of a snake, and not protruding greatly. The eyes being the main difference between human and Reptoid appearance other than the scales. The Reptoid eyes being more like those of Reptilians. This Awareness indicates that it is true that the Reptoids and reptilians in general see with infrared capacity. They see the heat of the body. They detect heat rather than visual qualities, as does the human through its dis- cernment of color and shapes. The reptilians or Reptoid types detect heat and if an entity were protected by certain types of clothing that allowed no heat to escape, such an entity would essent- iall be invisible to the.Reptoids. Much Expensive Research Lately on Reptiles This Awareness indi~ates that entities who have paid considerable attention to the recent research such as is QUESTION: funded for various types of research, may notice that In regard to the Hubble telescope, why don't the aliens much has been expended in the last few years to research take out the Hubble?

An example of this occurred when humans were given certain alien craft and attempted to fly the craft. In the effort to fly the craft the craft exploded, killing the human pilots and crew. Thereafter, the humans were much more careful in regard to alien technologies, attempting to understand the technology rather than simply taking the technology and attempting to use it. This has led to some conflict between the Greys and the humans who have sought to gain from the Greys and their technology. There have been some areas of cooperation, such as, for example, the plan to destroy the command ship which is the small moon-sized craft of these Reptilians when they choose to enter the solar system towards the earth. The use being not to use plutonium, but to use Element 115 for this destructive action. This Awareness indicates that there is also some technological research and effort in try- ing to discover how to reduce the size of plutonium so that a greater power can be packed into smaller size. This has been part of a research effort and essentially has been dev- eloped to a significant degree. The Plan to Destroy the Alien Command Ship This Awareness indicates that all of these efforts as related to the threat of the command post invasion from Nemesis through the small moon-sized craft that would be used for that purpose. This Awareness indicates Nem- esis itself, this in reference to the Jupiter-sized planet, would be of no threat to the earth because of its frozen condition and all beings therein also being frozen. It is a threat in that these beings, through alien technology gan be unfrozen and restored to their military status, and used for the conquest of earth by these Reptoids. This Awareness indicates that therefore, the most logical action in a military sense, of disarming the invading Rep- toids would be to destroy the small moon that would bring these beings to earth. This Awareness sees approx- imately 30 to 40 million beings as a probable size attack force in that moon, or command post. shell foot by foot, was then told to go inside and photo- graph inside. When he turned to enter the door, into the inside of the craft, this entity discovered that the craft was much greater in size on the inside than on the outside, being approximately three times larger inside that it was outside. This being a kind of space warp that was part of the alien technology, wherein upon entering into the inner craft, the entity was given the illusion of greater size because the entity himself was reduced in size through certain molec- ular shrinkage of his body, caused by force-fields that acted upon the entity's body. This Awareness indicates the action shrinking the entity, his clothing, his camera and everything proportionately to give the impression of greater size on the inside of the craft, than was exper- ienced outside the craft. This Awareness indicates that for orientation purposes of the mind, entities may recall a movie in the 60's, Fantastic Voyage, which entities were reduced in size repeatedly for several sessions so that they could be in- jected or put into a small micro-sized ship and injected into the body of a scientist, whereby they could enter into the scientist's body, go into the brain and make repairs, being given a short period of time to do so, before they would then revert back to their original size or die as the reduced beings as small particles or small beings in the body of the scientist. This Awareness indicates that the theory used in the movie as that which reflects the principles involved in this technology of space-warp or wherein the inside of a craft can appear to be larger than the outside. FOLLOW-UP QUESTION (V IKKI): In that case then, if the craft had windows and you could look in and see the man with a camera, he d be smaller, like a little man with a camera, looking from the outside? The Oregon Vortex has Similar Warp Properties COSMIC AWARENESS: This would be in the affirmative.

Pleiadians have been filmed, the messages have been released in books, and yet very few entities search or study the works of Billy Meier and his contacts and messages from Semjase. This Awareness indicates that, perhaps the questioner should pursue these areas and seek to discover for himself why these messages have not been more widespread, why these films of Billy Meier, including the videotapes of the Beam ships have not been more widely accepted by the masses. It is beyond reason that the Pleiadians have had little respect in spreading their messages, in comparison to the messages of the Zeta Reticuli, who abduct people and whose abductions seem to fascinate the public more than the messages from the Pleiadians. Apparently, the violations of a greater number of Zeta Reticuli in abducting humans and mutilating cattle creates a greater focus and garners more attention than does a peaceful contact of the Pleiadians and messages from the Pleiad- ians given through entities such as Billy Meier. *ED'S Note: CAC stocks the BiUy Meier books and the Beamship Trilogy Videotapes. Sea Book Rice Sheet. QUFSllON: IS SEMJASE THAT WICKED 'FALLEN ANGEL'? A question relative to this by T.S., Los Gatos, Calif- ornia. He writes: \"I have been an ardent UFO researcher for 14 years. Rarely does Awareness release anything that my fellow researchers and I have not already un- covered. In fact, I would like a point clarified if you have the time to ask Awareness. The Billy Meier Pleiad- ian story is well-known among UFOogists. What is not so well known are the facts concerning the cosmonaut contactee who calls herself Semjase. In short, if you are not familiar with this account, Sem'ase claims to be from the Pleiades, and is here to he 1 p mankind in many ways. Yet, scrupulous researchers have shown much of her transcripts to be incorrect. And get this! In the orig- inal Book of Enoch, it speaks of fallen Hierarchies, angels; the leader's name was Samjaza. Cosmic Awareness has touted the Meier Pleiadian incident as a positive one and I have grave concerns about this. Please advise, if you can.\" COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that there are many cases wherein entities can have a similar name to someone in ancient history. There is in fact, recently, a young boy who made headlines in the United States because of his name 'Sadam Hussein.\" This Awareness indicates that similarities in names should not necessarily imply sim- ilarities of quality or behavior; that the ancient Book of Enoch describing an entity with similar names is in no way evidence of misbehavior by Semjase. This Awareness indicates that it is true that much of Semjase's messages to Billy Meier appear to have some discrepancies, part of this simply because she is not revealing everything and she does not reveal everything because she is being careful to avoid excessive candor in regard to the true situation. She has not, for example, explained clearly to him the nature of other aliens on the earth plane. It was more because it was not her mission to get into the description of these aliens's behavior and intention on earth. She was simply attempting to make contact. Billy Meier himself, being somewhat concerned about the earth and aliens' presence, sought to get more infor- mation from her than she wished to give. It is much like one who speaks to a priest, trying to get infor- mation about a criminal. The priest may withhold information simply because it is his personal ethics not to talk badly about others. Halfbreeds do Pass as Pleidians Sometimes This Awareness indicates that there is seen no evidence in the behavior of Semjase to indicate a reason for the questioner's great apprehension of her contact with Billy Meiers. This Awareness indicates however, that there are many halfbreeds who attempt to pass them- selves off as Pleiadians and these halfbreeds are half- humanlhalf-Reptoid, or in some cases, they may be half-human and half-Orion. Generally they are not crossed with the clones or artificial lifeforms of the Greys. There are a number of varieties of Greys, some being artificially created and incapable of reproduction except through genetic cloning, others having the capacity to procreate themselves. The majority of halfbreeds how- ever are created through the use of human eggs and Reptoid sperm imbedded in the imprisoned bodies of human mothers for a time being, 'ti1 shortly before natural birth, then taken and finalized in the laboratories operated by the Greys. These halfbreeds have been developed for various purp- oses, mostly for military use at a future time, and there have been many problems because of the human factor, in that the halfbreeds keep bonding with a parent and the Reptoids do not tend to accommodate that need, and many of the halfbreeds have died because they simply did not have their human bonding needs satisfied. It has been recently determined by the aliens that a human mother can be of great benefit to the health and well-being of a halfbreed child, to keep the child alive. It isa factor that they did not understand and have only recently come to recognize and are now making efforts to correct this, for the benefit and value of the halfbreeds. Most Pleidiam Peaceful but Renegedes do Exist This Awareness indicates that the Pleiadians themselves, in a general sense have done no harm to humans. There are, of course, as Semjase has indicated to Billy Meiers, renegades or some Pleiadian groups from their previous history which were villainous in their behavior and she warns against these entities. This Awareness sug ests that the researchers may study the conversations of & mjase and Billy Meiers in the recently released book, Message Born the Pleiades. * *There are 2 volumes now available, \"Messap From ih~ Pleiades, the Contact Notes of Eduard Bay Meier\", published by Genesis 111 Publishing, Munds Park, AZ 86017. These two books are also available from C.A.C. Ream refer to the CAC Book Catalog Price Sheet. This Awareness indicates that there has recently been a release in some private circles of approximately 2000 pages of communication between Billy Meier and Semjase. This is almost impossible to acquire in a public sense; that it is possible with certain connections for entities to acquire the 2000 pages, much of which is dull and redundant read- ing. The books Messuge From the Pleiades appears to have taken much of the conversations from these 2000 pages, representing some of the more important conversations.

This ~s one of the weaknesses for them in that if you present them with a problem, they cannot decide what to do without consulting someone up the ladder.in the chain of command, if they are as a group in a situation and there is, therefore, a pause of as much as 15 seconds while they attune to someone in higher levels for decision.

The Structure of Alien Government (Rape 81 Pillage Allowed) The question asked about what kind of overnment % structure would be set up on the planets t ey controlled. This Awareness indicates that on earth these entities received directions from their earlier formulated plans of their own hierarchy system. They generally have a kind of allegiance to the Orion network or empire, those from Orion who are the thinkers and politicians and these entities set up the structure of government. The Reptoids are the basic enforcers of the structure. The Orion Alliance creates structures on the planets run by hierarchy and controll* by money systems and the Reptoids enforce the allemance to these structures and control the masses, and for this they are allowed what may be termed 'rape and pillage' privileges. .This Awareness indicates the Zetas support the Reptoids and the Re toids support and derive authority from the Orion E mpire.

This Awareness does not wish to speak for others. - - This Awareness suggests however, that one further phenomenon ,pf change in this area is that abductions are'now focused on mass-abductions as compared to individual abductions reviously. There appears to be modinterest on the af ien's part to abdu$t many people at once rather than just one or two at a tune. They are also focused on children. This Awareness ind- icates that entities who wish to avoid further contact with aliens once it hq occurred, can best do so by ex- ressing a strong ddike for the encounter, appearing to unwilling to cooperate further. These entities prefer that abductees be coope!ative with them. They in fact would invite your worship qf them. If you do not want further contact with them, it irj: b-at sim ly to express.

Therefore, if ou command them-to stay away from you or your family, they are inclmed to obey because of the way you speak to them.

These are ideas I hope you would consider. I realize maybe Awareness does not want to reveal much on this to avoid panicking entities. Ramtha has touched on this as well.\" Can Awareness respond to this? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that much of this is a very slow process; that there will be ample time for entities to respond; that it appears that it will take man genera- i tions for this change to occur to the degree escribed. This Awareness indicates that it is seen largely the result of the heating up of the earth in terms of the general lobal warming and the melting of the ice caps in the korth and South pole areas. Th~s Awareness indicates that this will bring the water levels into those regions that are already present, raising rivers and creating in some cases, rivers that are much wider and deeper so as to appear likened unto lakes or ocean inlets. Rlslng Water Will Affect Coastllnes-But Gradually This Awareness indicates that it also will affect the coastlines of countries throughout the globe. This Awareness suggests that the rising water levels are not likely to occur in a eriod that would be of (a) sudden nature; that one cou ! d for example, live on the coast for 30 to 50 ears without realizing that their home was actually g eing changed or that the coastline was being changed to any considerable degree. This Awareness indicates that the global warming as that which is not seen as coming in a persistent manner that will over a period of ver short duration cause a reat and major T several centuries. % Inundation o these areas. It is more 11 ened unto taking Mlllennlum Changes Exlst Only In Man's Mlnd This Awareness indicates that generally, when entities pass the year at the turn of a century and particularly as in this case, the turn of a millennium, they expect great changes. This Awareness indicates however, these are just numbers. They are artificially created, or in other words created by man's mind, and they have nothing to do with nature itself, therefore, do not expect too great of changes just because it is approachin the year 2000; that more of the changes that occur will % e the result of mankind's expectations of change and artificial change brought on by those expectations. This Awareness indicates that of course there are also the changes that occur because of social and technological advances or in some cases, detractions, but these changes also have little to do with nature itself; that the cycles which occur in terms of nature are generally less chaotic in terms of individual's life spans than many entities realize; that in terms of the duration or time a planet changes there can be thousands of lifetimes occurring during that moment of geological change. The Raping of the Rainforests and the Problems It Caused This Awareness indicates that in some ways however, there can be what ap ear to be ma'or changes in a very short duration; that t 1 e effects oft A e Greenhouse, which are triggered by mankind's misbehavior toward the planet, can be seen as creatin a major change during the i? recent decade in which 6 of t e years during the 1980s decade have set records in terms of heat; that 6 of these have either set or tied records over the past century for being the hottest years during that century. This Aware- ness indicates that this is not because of nature, but because of the effects that mankind has had on the earth itself through the pollution and the raping of the rainfor- ests. This Awareness indicates that also, the release of radiation from nuclear weapons over the past 30 years has began to have an effect contributing to this condi- tion; that particularly though, the automobile and all of the pollut~on from the petroleum industry and use has had an astounding effect on the atmosphere of this planet and is creatin a heating up or contributing to that of the Greenhouse If ffect, This Awareness indicates that this is seen as the ma or concern which will in turn, unless checked, will f! ave its effect in causing a heatin of the f olar caps and can then bring about the rising o sea revels. This Awareness indicates it does appear however that there will soon be an effort on the part of the industries of nations around the world to move toward a fuel that does not have these negative effects on the earth's atmosphere, that does not create the heating effect known as the Greenhouse Effect, and this will slow the rise of temperature so that thin s move back toward that B which is more of a normal leve . This Awareness indicates all of this of course is dependent on whether or not mankind becomes aware enough of the otential the dangers lie. l hazards of the path which has been followe and where This Awareness indicates that it does appear that there is an awakening that is occurring among scientists and among leaders of many of the countries whereby many of these entities are now becoming concerned with this global warming; that if the warming does not continue, many entities may simply slip back into their stupor and think more in terms of convenience and maintenance of the same system regardless of what effect they might be creating by perpetuating the continued use of the petroleum industries. Those Concerned With the Poles Tipping This Awareness indicates that in regard to the concern that many entities have relating to the tipping of the poles, This Awareness indicates that the poles are always in movement and there is always a tipping that is occurrin ; that since approximately 1933 there has been a gradua y movement in terms of the polar tippin and that this movement is accelerated over that whic 8; is normal, but it is occurring in its usual manner; that there are times when the poles ti more slowly and times P when it moves more quick y. This Awareness indicates that these are like regular cycles; that the tipping of the poles has been occurring for some time; that it is such a slow movement that it is hardly noticeable and this Awareness indicates that this will continue for some period of time, the poles tipping"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"to approximately 23 degrees and then moving back in 3 the other direction to approximately that same degree. This Awareness indicates that the oles essentially move in a kind of figure eight motion. T R is Awareness indicates that there are times when they appear to s eed up, other times when they move more slowly; that t !I is is a time of acceleration, but it is not seen as a time in which there will be a sudden shift as many entities expect, which will cause oceans to flow over the land and so forth; that most geological changes will occur in a gradual motion. There will, of course, be those sudden earth shifts associated with earth uakes and volcanic action. This Awareness indicates 1 t at the area in the Mediterranean as that which ap ears to be movin toward a eological activity, especia f) ly that of Mount h tna. This 1 wareness indicates that this as an area that may soon be in the news, as being of considerable concern in its eruption. This Awareness indicates that there will be further eolo ical changes that occur in other areas from time to Eme &ring this eriod in which the earth's surface is being warmed w R ich allows for the lava and substances beneath to have greater effect in penetrating the earth's surface. How Earthquakes Occur It is likened unto having a ball of molten lead wherein the outer crust is cool, but if that molten lead with the outer crust cooled is placed into a hot oven in which the entire thing is heated, that outer crust becomes more vulnerable to melting and allowing the inner molten lead to break through the surface. This Awareness indicates that this is in part why much of the recent earthquake and volcanic activity is prevalent on this plane,lartly because the surface is warmer than usual, This ware- ness indicates there are also other reasons. This Awareness indicates the West Coast of the United States has been destabilized somewhat in terms of the underground magma because of various atomic testing over the past several decades; that there are also other causes for eruptions, such as the eruption of Mount Saint Helens This Awareness indicates that several of the mountains of the West Coast of the United States are experiencing warmer temperatures than normal, but then again, so are the states in the West experlenclng warmer temperatures than is normal in terms of what was normal 20 or 30 years previously. Global Warming Affecting the West With Much Less Ice This Awareness indicates for example, in the early part of this century, settlers used to ride their horse and wa ons across rivers such as the Willamette in the area of ! ortland and Oregon City, because the ice was thick enough that they could do so. This Awareness indicates that ice on these rivers has not been seen in several decades and since the early part of this century there has not been enough ice for entities to take horses and wagons across these rivers. This Awareness indicates that these Western states have become much warmer in terms of their climate than in earlier times during this century; that even the last decade has seen warmer times than in the decade before, and because of this there are also the warmin trends in the mountain ranges which may eventually f ead to more activity of some of these dormant volcanoes. Greenhouse Effect to Create More Volcanoes This Awareness indicates that in fact, the entire Pacific Rim as appearing to be experiencin a warming trend which may allow for volcanoes on % 0th sides of the ocean to become more active in the Northern and Southern continents on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. This Awareness indicates that this warming trend, related to the Greenhouse Effect, may have its effect in causing the oceans to rise somewhat; that there is also seen a greater potential for the Increase m storms and changing weather patterns due to currents in the Pacific and also in the Atlantic Oceans that will be influenced by these changin temperatures and by the melting of R snow and ice in t e Northern and Southern hemispheres. Environmental Pollutlon the Greatest Concern This Awareness indicates that in so far as a need for concern, it appears the greatest need for concern is in the area of environmental pollution, pollution of the land, pollution of the seas, and also the destroy the ozone layers; that this the greatest problems that is time. The threat of nuclear war as There is still, of course, threats in regard to fanatic groups or nations which may have a need to evolve out of some stage of fanaticism in order to relate in a civilized way, and this can lead to social problems such as wars and terroristic actions, but in the sense that during the last decade the greater threat was from nuclear war, in this decade of the 90s the greatest threat appears to be in the area of conventional or terroristic wars as one level of concern, but as a greater level of concern, the global warming and depletion of the ozone layer: this is where entities may find themselves coming into a need for a real confrontation; this including of course, other activities of environmental concern: the depletion of the forests, the discharge of toxic wastes, the pollution of the oceans and atmosphere, as well as the pollution of the human and social values through drugs and distorted value systems. This Awareness indicates the extremes of problems tend to surface and then when attended to, they begin to fade into the back round as new problems surface. Who, 25 years ago, wou f d think that there was ever to be a need for concern with regard to Satanism, or with regard to the excessive use of drugs among youn children, or R f, young peo le? This Awareness indicates t at the problems t at surface in one generation may fade and new problems surface for the next generation. This Awareness indicates that during the decade of the 90s, the dru s, the fanaticism of groups who wish to impose f their va ues on others, even to the point of expressing terroristic actions, the concern for pollution and envi- ronmental problems, these will be the problem situations during this decade of the 90s. Unchecked Greed and Power on the Rlse This Awareness indicates there also is that concern with regard to the nature of greed andpower, and its tendency to want to be unchecked. This Awareness indicates that the problems which seem to fade at this time, are those associated with the nuclear war concern, and concerns about the military involvement in various countries.

This Awareness does not sug est or see any great need for f entities to add geologica threats and problems to this, for these do not ap ear to be of a major concern for most entities, although t E ere will be some, much as has occurred during the past. WISI)OM OF AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that there will always be MEDITATING ON PEACE some calamities in regard to storms, earthquakes and This Awareness suggests that entities meditate on volcanic eruptions, but the devastation to masses IS peace; that entities visualize peace; that entities think in enerally of such a level that most entities escape from terms of chaotic potentials as diminishing, as moving &is devastation, and those who do not, are caught in it away, toward peaceful settlement; that entities cornmu- and must suffer the conse uences, accordin to their R 8 nicate their desires for eaceful settlement; and in this own destiny and karma.

It is not my intent to bog you down with research finding concerning m knowledge of Fantazia in its application , but simp ! y to open up areas not previously explored by those involved in publication of Cosmic Awareness Communications. areas of which I have worked on and know to be successful and those I have been informed of from Ann in Houston (she supplies you with the water). In doing this, it opens up areas you could choose to pose questioning to Awareness. First I will comment on research done here in Mont- real concerning that known as dislease of the treemass- form known as elm. I received 'directives' to deal with a very old elm which had in past years been treated by 'tree surgeons' for several years, in an effort to save it from losing its battle against the dislease it felt that was causing its breakdown of massform. On talking to the owner, he showed me where pipes had been inserted at the base of the trunk and some chemical component (not known what it is) was injected to supposedl clear out mites eating away from within the tree itsel ? . This stuff they spra ed the exterior trunk too and was such in content, t K e owner had to have spray that blew onto the windows, scraped off with razor blades. It was like a plastic substance one could not wash off. I speak of this so you can get an idea of the state the tree was left in by these tree specialists some 7 plus years ago, before I was directed to attend it. I enclose a hot0 of said tree too as it was an awesome sight to {ehold its 12 main branches chopped off some 75 feet up from the ground. It also will show the extent of the research and the results obtained, which in turn show very clearly the 'effect' in the 'directed' application of Fantazia to bring this tree back to 'balanced' state. The owner refused to allow the city to cut down this tree; he believed it was still alive. He was happy the day I arrived to ask if I may treat it, as I had tuned into the tree and indeed, it was still alive. The massform of the tree bein a large area to balance out, re uired 3 applica- tions of ! antazia (4 ounce bottles) and t 4 ese were s aced to coincide with specific dates (moon cycles) &ring July, August, September 1987.l also had to apply 3 times, a mixture of apple cider vinegar and water, to allow the tree to expel toxins that were, until first application of Fantazia, trapped inside and on the exterior of the tree as a result of the chemical applica- tions made to said tree in previous years. I will add here that this tree had not had any new growth or leaves in the 7 years before it came my way to deal with, in in previous years to that, the tree s ecialists had no success P In stopping the disleased state o this tree. It lost its ability to bring forth new growth during those years. Needless to say the owner was ecstatic at what he saw take place. I will update b sayin the following year, she brought forth growth. ft was iealthy and I was not 5 directed to treat it any further as all alignments have occurred. As this tree has been a conversation piece for ears, looking so naked and awesome a sight to passers gY , the owners were constantly asked what had killed it. Slnce treating it during the summer months of 1987, these same folk were amazed to see rowth and foliage for the first time in years. Indeed we % ave been given a wonderful demonstration of just how dislease can be turned around. I ask now that you consider questioning Awareness of the validity of use of Fantazia when applied to our trees in dislease, and also plantforms. To go a step further, would you ask for verification in application to soil and planet water. As mentioned, I do not want to get into my research successes, as it would take hours of typing etc. Just know that indeed is living up to that which we have been told it will deal with; the first phase of cleansing for planet Earth. If you are willing to explore the quest~oning I have suggested in this letter, we can give fellow incarnates the chance to have good soil to grow their own food in times ahead. With full energizing taking place in the produce, the roduce will glve us top nutritional value, (in perfect Form) free of toxic contaminations etc. 1 have had some 'knowing' come into my view in the last two days that I wish to share with you.. .again. It would seem that if say you want a vegetable patch to grow veggies etc., ust one vial of Fantazia will be. enough to handle t i e preparation of the so~l, detoxtfy it, energize it to the highest level and thus pass all these to the produce to be brought forth from this area of soil treated. I get indications that if one sections of the land lot chose to house area taking into considera- tion the resonating Fantazia water, and apply one ounce of to create a 20 ft d~ameter resonating effect; this will be enough in content of the water. Thus to use up a full bottle, one would section a fairly lar e area one could use to produce one's foodlveggies etc. f erhaps you could ask Awareness for clarification on this. I got the definite indication to write to you, and do that which has now become physically manifest in this letter. It is done.. .so be it. I leave you now. It is necessary for me to remain closeted with m work a while longer, all part of the Divine plan of t K ings.\" She included hot0 ra hs of the before and after elm tree and so 8rth. hi6 Awareness comment on that lctler please? COSMIC AWARE~ESS: This Awareness indicates that the information con- tained within the letter in regard to the tree as that which is essentially correct and accurate, without excessive exaggeration. This Awareness indicates that the relation- ship in regard to the use of this substance as that which cannot possibly be understood by most entities without the full recognition and understanding of what this Awareness has referred to in revious readings as the fact that the universe is an in ! ormation processor, and that within each as ect within the universe, whether it be a sub-particle or su \\ -system, that there is certain infbrmation being processed, unique to that particular particle or system. This Awareness indicates of course a tree is a sub- system of the universe, and the Fantazia water is composed of certain particles or sub-particles of the universe, and the information within the tree and within the Fantazia water as being information that is in the order of being processed. This Awareness indicates that the peculiarity of the Funtazia water is that it has a particular quality possess-"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"ing a uniqueness in the sense that it is not contaminated or olluted by any negative element. This Awareness in d! icates you might say it is blessed, or you might say it is of a unique nature because of the descriptive forces used to create it, so that it serves according to the information that has been put into it, as a kind of catalyst or life and vitality and spiritual upliftment. This Awareness indicates that when this Awareness speaks of information being put into a sub-system or roup of particles, the information is not necessarily Emited to mental concepts or words; the information can also be substances. For example, a breeze is information. A seed is information. Water itself is information. And the information contained in a dro of water is that which is confined and does descri e certain systems of behavior in the universe. f This Awareness indicates that the information in a drop of water or in an ocean of water as that which has many applications, that the information within a seed is that whlch has certain applications specific to that particular seed. This Awareness su gests that likewise the information contained within d antazia water as being specified to a certain type of defining process, that is withln certain perimeters In terms of its application, and usage. This Awareness indicates that much of the ower in the Fantazia water is not sim matter of c \\ emical properties, but also of the definition that has been iven I the defining o the Fantazia water is that which contrib- utes to its particular results, the results that it brings. This Awareness indicates it i's much like an entity who creates from a stick of wood that which the entity calls a magic wand. The piece of wood serving as a magic wand to this entity will have magical powers, so lon as the entity believes in these magical powers, and attri % - Utes the magical powers to this stick of wood. Another entity looking at it will say it is nothing but an oversized toothpick, it is nothing but a piece of wood, it has no power whatsoever. And et, much like a placebo, it has ?' ~ts psychological effect or those who accept it, who belleve in it, who use it, and who continue to assert and give attributes of magical power to it in their defining of this stick of wood. How Eellevers Create Fantazia, Relics, Holy Statues etc. This Awareness indicates that likewise the Fantazia water as that which gained much of its ower by the attributions of entities who accept it as aving some kind of magical power. E his ~wareness indicates that this is the way many magical icons, relics, trinkets, sacred places, holy statues, statuettes or symbols are created and have certain unique benefits. Thus the priest who blesses water can glve that water certain ower just from the act of blessing. A chemist checking t \\ e water mi ht find no difference between it and the water from the f aucet, and the chemist might even substitute -- without the priest knowing -- substitute faucet water for blessed water, but if the masses believe that tap water is blessed water, and receive a sprinkle or a drink from the blessed water, expectin some blessing to occur, even though that water be % ut tap water in reality, if they believe it to be blessed water, they may receive that which they expect, a kind of blessing. The Power of Suggestion at Work This Awareness indicates it is the power of suggestion at work, that entities can give certain suggestive power not on1 to substances, so that those substances become i magica in their properties, magical properties receiving their magic from the mind itself, but they may also convince others of the magical pro erties, and even possibly they can put, if their mln 2 force is strong enough, put a mental energy around the substance that carries the placebo action or the belief factor with the substance to a total stranger who knows not of its magical properties. The \"Curse\" of the Hope Diamond This Awareness indicates that in this way certain things, such as the Hope diamond, for example, which has at one time been cursed, has brought great harm to many who have owned it, because it carried that psycho- logical energy which was attributed by the curse, and that energy spread to subsequent owners, and even though they may not accept or believe in it, or even know of such a curse, they can be affected by it. Likewise, entities can attribute psychological energy definitions to a substance, such as the Fantazia water, so that this power of suggestion, even when accepted without one knowing of the suggestion accompanying the water, the entlty can receive certain attr~butes from that which has been attributed to the water. Thus it is more than the mere power of suggestion in the sense of hypnosis or conscious suggestion; it becomes also a form of subconscious suggestion that follows and carries along with symbols, icons, trinkets, and statuettes and other relics, from one who attributes those powers. This Awareness indicates that this, then, can be passed on to others. The Indian Ritual That Removes Negative Thoughts This Awareness indicates that there is a ritual which is used by certain Indian tribes, wherein upon their meetin they p~ck up a stone and pass the stone in a circle aroun the~r circle, and each entlty implants all of his or her % negative thoughts into the stone, emptying his or her mind of negative thoughts, giving them to the stone. The stone is assed from one to the other, and upon comple- tion oft k' e circle, the stone is then thrown into a lake, or discarded somewhere, so that all of the negatlve thou hts the entities had are now embedded in the stone, f and t ey are free of these. This Awareness indicates this ritual is that which is used to help clear the minds of the entities so that they can then attend to the business at hand without interfer- ence from these negative thoughts or emotions. ?'his Awareness indicates that hypothetically, were there to be an entity who walks alon , at a time when the lake is low, in which the stone is un f erfoot, and the entity were to ick up that stone, containing all of the negative thoug R ts of those others, that entity mi.ght inherit or receive man of those negative energles that Z had been placed into t e stone, and suffer certain consequences from coming in close contact w~th that stone. This Awareness indicates that likewise, were entities to put pasitive thoughts into a stone or other object, attribute great good to that object, attribute otential for % g healing and blessings or rosperity to that o ject, and to sell or send or give that o ject to others, even d they knew not what the object had been charged with in terms of the psychological charging, entities receiv~ng such objects would receive certain benefits, because the objects would carry the psychological energy that had been attributed to ~t. It is not necessary that entities consciously understand or know of these things, for the transferred on a subcon- stone, from one or through some other"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"This Awareness indicates that all of this is based on the principle that all things in the universe are energy, and all energy is information, and when one focuses attention and defines, or has an intent or purpose in one's attention, and directs it to an ob'ect, that object receives ! the information, contains the in ormation, holds the information, that was attributed to it from the intended focus. Thus if one intends, for example, to harm another through voodoo, poking a pin in a doll that represents another, it can have an effect. It de ends on how stron ly the voodoo rinciple and ocus and intention is, f R P as to ow effective t e project would be. How to Use Suggestive Energy to Heal Entities Likewise, an entity who focuses healing intention u on another can have an effect of helping to bring g a out a healin for the other, depending on how strongly the intent and 7 ocus of healing energy IS expressed. This Awareness indicates that thivoodoo doll or trinket or symbol is only a physical object to be used in the ritual of transferring mental intent. It is the mental intent that carries the seed of information from place to place. The object used in the ritual is but to assist the subconscious in its need to accept and believe in the effectiveness of the ritual. This Awareness indicates that one could, for example, use a raisin, a toothpick, a encil, a peanut, or any object whatsoever, to represent a I' oved one who IS ill, and to focus upon that peanut, tooth ick, pencil or raisin the concept of Divine Light and L' ealing so that the entity visualizes healing energy coming to that person sym- bolicall represented by the peanut, raisin, toothp~ck or encil. 6 he energies from that focus would actually be Felt by the entity needing the healing. This Awareness indicates these are simply tools to assist the mind in its effort. These tools are not for the mind, they are for the senses, which the mind has come to trust, but they work throu h the subconscious mind, because the subconscious re f ies heavily on the senses, rather than on concepts. The subconscious mind is not as quickly or easily accepting of concepts as is the con- scious mind. The conscious mind can think of the idea of someone being healed from illness, but the subconscious mind cannot grasp that idea without an image or trinket involved to symbolize that kind of healing. This Awareness indicates it is in this manner that much of life is conducted out of the conscious level, whereby man entities perform magic without even knowing it. Any entitles, by their so-called supersti- tion, are actually using the subconscious mind to affect certain ends. The scientist is limited by certain usage of tested mechanisms, whereby the scientist who refuses to be fooled b some subjective suggestion, and who doubts ever ding that cannot be proved in the labora- tory, is wor r ing not with a full deck but with a part of the deck of cards. There are, of course, entities who rely too much on the sug estive mode and ignore those conscious realities, t fi ose things which are provable, ignoring facts, and are quite content to live with fantasy. ~lvina In a Fantasy world VS Livlnp In a Reallty World This ~wareness indicates that these entities living in their fantasy world are seen by those who live in more factual real~ties, as being less than honest and lacking in substance. Yet at the same time, many of these entities living in their fantasy world live their entire life without any undue hardships, any more so than those who are cautiously ske tical of everything. The question may be asked, then, w e y is it that one must accept the more skeptical reality over the fantasy? This Awareness indicates that there are others who live with one foot in the reality world, but who step off into fantas , and in so doing, enhance their total experi- ence and a i so add to their reality world by enhancing much of that which is seen as factual, w~th realities out of the imaginary. Thus, one who in dealing with subjec- tive levels, with the subconscious, who can also main- tain certain levels of reality, may begin to enhance those levels of realit and meanwhile keep levels of fantasy in a solid, groun d' ed state, so that the entity uses the imagination, rather than letting the imagination use him or her. This Awareness indicates that it becomes ossible for P an entity having one foot in reality and one oot in fantasy to be much more creative, reallstlcally creative, than the entity who is in one extreme or the other. . When the Subconscious Accepts the Placebo This Awareness suggests that to understand the power and the value of being aware of the subjective, creative forces, the subconscious acceptance of a placebo, realizing this placebo is but sugar and does not in itself have healing power, but \"If I can trick myself into thinking it has healing ower, perha s it will substitute R ! for the real thing, whic is unavaila le to me,\" and thus the entity takin the placebo receives the benefit of the k, real thing, whic is otherwise unavailable. The Stage Hypnotist Who Can Make You Feel Drunk Entities who have watched good hypnotic presenta- tions may recall how certain subjects were brou ht up on P stage, hypnotized, given a glass of water and to d that this was whiskey, and the entities in dr~nking this water, within a few minutes began to act like they were in fact, drunk on whiskey. These entities were not rofessional actors, and could not fake such activity, suc R presentations, but indeed appeared to be drunk, and would do things that they mi ht do if they were, in fact, drunk. And yet, they had f on y water. This Awareness indicates it is a case of their mind being fooled into thinking the placebo, the water, was indeed alcohol. Is that so different from being given water and being told that it brings about heal~ng, or s iritual evolution, and in so being told, experiencing t l! is healing and spiritual evolution, because it was expected? 'I'his Awareness does not imply that the Fantazia water is common water or has no other power other than the power of suggestion, or that entities have been duped into thinkin that this had some kind of power and were therefore af f ected. It does not wish to imply this, for indeed like the stone that had been implanted with all of the ne ativities of the Indians in the clrcl?, the stone did indee c! contain certain attributes from being passed around the circle. It was not simply a su gestion that the % stone was negative, or had negative attrl utes. This Awareness indicates that if one could see the energies of the mind when one focuses, one would see certaln energies protruding from the forehead toward that which is the focus of one's attention. There is actual1 a substance there, invisible to your senses; and if one r ocuses that substance to a stone, leaving an intended mark on the stone, such as the attribution of one's ne ative energies, then that stone's aura or energy f field wil be enlarged, reflecting the attributed negative energy that has been given to it, and yet your eyes, your vision, will not see that? because your visjon does not see mental energies easily. Certain psychics m~ght be able to hold that stone and read energles that are con- tained within the stone, even seeing a history of events"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"that have taken lace at one time or another around the stone, or relate J' to the stone. This Awareness indicates that the process which has gone into creating the Fantazia water as that which attributes certain qualities to it, but those qualities that are attributed and iven to that Fantazia water are only part of its magic. #he other part of the magic is the suggestive force. It is not a matter of it simply being a fake or sug estive force alone. It is a combination of suggestive f orce and other attributes contained in the water by those who put it together. This Awareness indicates that it does appear that there can be benefits from the use of this, in regard to apply- ing it for certain projects in the environment, and as mentioned in the letter related to plants or to animals. The sug estive force that accompanies this enhances the power o f the water, or if the entity doubts the power, the suggestive force of doubting will detract somewhat from its effect. This Awareness indicates that the price as that which appears to be out of reason in regard to the cost of putting the water together and the marketing costs. So the question of whether you are being properly served is not so much a question of whether the substance is capable of doing what it is pur orted to do, but whether you are paying too much, or w R ether it is worth the price in order to receive the benefits. This Awareness indicates that this is for each individ- ual to determine, accordin to his or her own subjective evaluations and understan % ing in regard to the general expectations from the substance, and according to the evaluation one has. How do ou value something of this nature? What price do you p ace on it? What is it worth to you? r This Awareness indicates that for some, it may be a great bargain, the bargain of a lifetime. For the tree owner, this was a most unusual bargain. For others, it may appear to be a rip-off. A Tree Also Receives Your Thoughts and Suggestlons This Awareness indicates that in regard to the effect on the tree, do not think that just because this was a tree, that the tree cannot absorb a suggestion, for like the stone that receives your negative energies, the tree can also receive your thoughts and intentions for healing, and when this is coupled with a particular water element that is designed for certain purposes, the tree also is processing ~nformation. In effect, it has a mind of its own. It has no conscious mind to speak of, but it does have a subconscious mind, and this subconscious mind is that which readily receives without criticism the blessings that are sent to it throu h the water and through the belief that the entity % ad in using the water to heal the tree. It is the same princi le as praying for plants, to make them grow better, w R ich has been demonstrated in the book, The Secret Life of Plants, or singing to lants, or playing music to plants, with the R intention t at this would seem to make them feel happier and grow healthier. This Awareness indicates that the plants, being such information processors, havin a mind of their own, receiving su gestions, responf, perhaps even more so than if they b ad a critical, conscious mind to evaluate whether this water actually had any chemical properties that they needed. This Awareness indicates essentially it is all part of life; that life exists in all things, even the stones them- selves contain a certain amount of life, and when thoughts are rojected into a stone, those thoughts can remain with t 71 e stone, and when thoughts are projected into the atoms of water, those thoughts can remain with the water, arid when thoughts are projected into words, those thoughts remain with the words. Thus the action here at CAC of charging distilled water, using a tape which ives suggestions, this, too, has its effect on the water, f or the words carry intentions and meaning, and the words vibrate in the presence of water, which in turn receives those intentions and meanings, and those intentions and meanings penetrate the water, the sub- stance of the water, and when ingested, flow through the body of the receiver. * This Awareness suggests that this can have certain benefits. This Awareness indicates the healing process comes in many forms; that some entities in their rejection of such su gestions, such subtle suggestions as these, would opt rat 1 er for something of a more dramatlc and absolute nature. One Can Be Healed by the Scalpel or by a Drop of Water This Awareness reminds you that even the action of the surgeon's knife cutting away on one's flesh, is an action of information processing within a surgeon's system or subsystem, and when one believes In the surgeon's knife as a way to heal oneself, that entity may gain certain benefits from the operation, in spite of the side-effects, the pain and suffering that accompanies this operation. It is sometimes necessary for some entities to experience these, depending on what particular ailment is attributed to the entity's subsystem, the subsystem that makes up the entity, and the particular information processing that is going on within the entity, particularly the information that is processing, which has caused the problem. This Awareness indicates that It does not wish to and they may then others who receive the scalpel and operation, but who regardless again brin back the illness, even though the doctor, the surgeon, fid a erfect job and recovery was 1 g com lete. A fe.w years go y and the entity is ready for anot er operation, because the psychological effects were not removed along with the organs that were affected, and the psychological effect calls for the entity to suffer more. This Awareness indicates that most illnesses are caused either by environmental assaults or insults, or by self-induced insults, such as guilt, or personal poisoning, ative thoughts. And for some entities, radical belief in someth~ng higher,. something magical helps. And st111 in scenery, or a new hope, a new direction, can help the entity to overcome that illness or imbalance. This Awareness indicates that Fantazia is essentially a tool, much like a magic wand, a magic pendant, a magic trinket. It carries certain inherent properties, that could under testing, proper scientific testing, could show it to have some benefits of its own, but its greater benefits lie"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"in its mystique and the suggestive power that accompa- nies it. This Awareness indicates that were a control group of trees or plants to be given Fantazia water and another control group to be given re ular distilled water by entities who did not know w % ich water was which, wherein the water was selected mechanically without anyone knowing until later which water was which, then you would have a proper scientific evaluation of the effects of Fantazia water, without the im lied sugges- R tion that accompanies the application oft e water. This is not to say the water being sold with present suggestion is fraudulent, but rather that the water 1s not as powerful without that suggestion, for the suggestion that which carries and adds to and enhances, the power of that water. Would Independent Tests Show Fantazia Is Better Than tap Water? As I understand it, the suggestions are put into the molecules of water when the Fantazia is made, so if the test Awareness has suggested was carried out by independent people running it through ipes and stuff, theoretically, the Fantazia water woul J' prove out to be better than the normal tap water, would ~t not? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that, given that the tap water is molecularly the same, does not have more pollutants or other substances as the Fantazia water, theoretically, the Fantazia water carries certain sugges- tions, would or should, prove to be better. What this ~warenessjs suggesting is that, in addition to the suggestions which are put into the water itself, there are suggestions that are being made in the market- ing process of the water, which are enhancing it, adding to the effectiveness of the water, and in order to measure or evaluate the water itself, one would need to take awa the marketing suggestions, to have a clear evaluation o the water itself. i This Awareness indicates the processing suggestions that go into the water are one thl12. The marketing suggestions are another thing, an when entities market something as being magical, that marketing suggestion ives the receivers a certain confidence and expectation bat causes them to respond with reater enthusiasm, so that the water has a greater effect ecause of the expec- tation of greater effect. B This Awareness indicates the question has to do with whether the Fantazia water is as it is claimed to be. The question was related to an endorsement by this Aware- ness, and this Awareness wished to clarify in this so- called endorsement, that there are certain factors involved in this Fantazia water which need to be you sicker, but in the This Awareness indicates that suggestions are power- ful, and the marketing of many roducts today contains suggestions. That is a type of a d' vertisement, and these suggestions in marketing should be understood as being dist~nct from the product, and this articular product being created as a substance out ofsuggestion, needs to be d~stinguished between the roduct suggestion, that which is put into the product t \\ rough the rocess of the marketing by suggestion. R suggestion, and that which accompanies t e product in Would DilutingFantazia Help Clear Pollution? FOLLOW-UP (AVATON): Would one way to overcome the exorbitant price of Fantazia as presently it's being marketed, if one wished to use it in uantities in gardens and perhaps dumping it in lakes an c? rivers to ho efully clear the pollution, to dilute it, like say dilute t % e 4-ounce bottle into sa a 50 or 100-gallon tank or well, throu h the process o & homeopathy would this be just a out as potent? i COSMIC AWARENESS: This is in the affirmative. This Awareness su gests particularly since this is a product that is create d out of the use of su gestion; that further suggest~on of enhanc- ing or expan $ lng the product as that which is reasonable, and that entities may participate in this action by taking one bottle and putting it into a larger container of pure water, such as distilled water, lett~ng it sit for a certain amount of time --this Awareness suggests perhaps 24 hours -- and considering the substance as being ex- panded to that amount, so that, much like the growth of acidophilus culture, a small amount can then be grown into larger amounts. This Awareness indicates this is a way of increasin , masses. i much like the breaking of bread to multiply, to feed t e The D-Cell Experiment to Clean Up Polluted Lakes and Rivers Some years back, during a discussion of D-Cells, I believe it was through the interpreter David Worcester, Awareness su gested that D-Cells placed into polluted waters, could % egin the process of cleaning up the pollution, and as a result, a number of members and organizations wrote in that they had tossed D-Cells into various lakes and streams around the country, including Lake Michigan. I know that ears later, Lake Michigan was declared clean enough t h' at they could introduce salmon once a ain into it, and I was wondering, did those D-Cells 1 ave an effect on this, and would the Fantazia, working the same way, have the same type of effect? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this, to some degree -- it is not such a simple matter; that there can be poisons put into blessed water, and entities who would dr~nk the poisons would likely succumb, even though the water was blessed. Likew~se, were poison to be put into a jar of D-Cell water, the poison could override the power of the D-Cell, even though it may not be quite as toxic as otherwise. This Awareness indicates that, likewise D-Cells thrown into rivers and lakes can have some effect. The symbology is perhaps more important than the actuality, for the action of one entity throwing a D-Cell into a river or lake may, in itself, become an action in consciousness that serves as a seed that later is multiplied by other entities picking up on that thought-form of wanting to clean the lake or river. This Awareness indicates that in regard to lakes and rivers, those micro-substances within the D-Cells can"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"10 What Strange Entity Scared Albert Bender?

In deep water, this appears to be ap roximately R Four to six months, depending on how muc light reaches the D-Cell, or whether it becomes covered with mud so that no light reaches it, and if so, the D-Cell can emit its cells for only a limited eriod of time, and those minute cells can only effect a c f eansing action within a certain amount of area or a certain amount of tlme. These are quite small, when placed in Lake Michigan or in a river, remembering of course that a quart-sized D- Cell is designed to purify a quart of water. AVATON: I think everybody involved in that project looked at it as a magical sowing of seed rather than actually cleaning up the lake. It was supposed to start something in consciousness that would later manifest. COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this as an action that started a movement in a kind of creative process. This Awareness suggests this as being likened unto information processing in its beginning in regard to the cleaning of lakes. This Awareness reminds you that all actions, all substances, all energies, all things are essentially information processing, and when any s stem is started, for example, the systematic cleansing o lakes, it has to start somewhere with some action. r She Has Breasts Lopped Off to Prevent Any Future Cancer (More on the Suggestive Force at Work) QUESTION (AVATON): The example Awareness gave of the suggestive force and undergoin the knife reminds me of a recent tabloid article I read o f a young woman who, because there was breast cancer in her family, had convinced herself that she would get breast cancer somewhere down the line, so she found a physician who lopped off her breasts for her. That seems to be a pretty extreme way, but she probably would have gotten the cancer because of the strong suggestive force that she had; is that correct? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this as a strong prob- ability at some oint in this entit 's life that she would have manifeste!, either genetica r ly, subconscious1 or consciously, the breast cancer; that in her approac K of ridding herself of her breasts in order to avo~d the breast cancer, the entity essential1 was tryin to free her mind from fears that had plague ‘i\" her from c fl ildhood. How Radionics Can Restore the Environment (Increasing Ocean Oxygen Can Create Miracles) Questlon: Another uestion, a ossible solution to the environ- mental prob 9 em, from ! teve Sobol, Cypress, California. He writes: \"Dear friends, thank ou for the informative data in the latest newsletter, 89-$, on why our forests are dying and the reasons for the ozone la er depletion. I i\" have a theory which may provide a so ution, and would greatly appreciate if Cosmic Awareness would comment on its potential. By increasing the oxygen in our oceans and our atmosphere, this would reduce the effect of continuous depletion of ozone to create more oxygen. My proposal is to increase the oxygen in the ocean and in the atmosphere, by projecting the energy of hydrogen eroxide, via instruments developed by Dr. Galen &ieronymous. One unit is called an Industrial Analyzer, and another is the Eloptic Beam Projector. A satellite photo or aerial photo of the North or South pole could be placed in the instrument along with hydrogen peroxide, (food rade or dilution of) and the energy of the H202 could % e s sent to that re ion. A typical cycle might be !3 fifteen minutes on and 4 minutes off. Various cycles could be tried to see which is most effective. The same could be applied with a photo of the various oceans. I am willin to devote my energies to this roject if it % f, would be eneficial. Equ~pment is ava~la le. Please ask Awareness to comment on this approach.\" COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this as related to the use of radionics in terms of creatin certain frequencies or vibrations that would enhance t % e production of hydro- gen peroxide. This as being a kind of creative process using frequency or radionic device to separate the molecules and combine them into a hydrogen peroxide molecule within the atmosphere so as to enhance the production of oxygen. This Awareness indicates that this is much likened unto the use of radionics on a subject, human or plant or animal, in order to produce certain chemical changes or genetic changes or molecular changes within the ~ndividual, to effect a certain type of healing or mutation or change. This Awareness indicates that these devices essentially work with vibrations, frequencies that all things emanate to. This Awareness indicates that essentially since every- thin in the universe is a frequenc or vibration, or a com % ination of frequencies and vi 5 rations, theoretically the use of frequenc~es or vibrations may be effected in such a manner as to roduce molecular changes in things, and thereby a s tering organic substances. This Awareness indicates that essentially the theory is sound, providing the application is correct, and can be implemented in a manner that approaches the need desired, and this is done on the proper scale, for that intention desired. This Awareness indicates that it would indeed be a would indeed be a project requiring Awareness su gests the most f be to work wit pictures, usin this process to build up and 8 outh poles. This being effective because it would be within the realm of one's ability to perceive the totality of the scenario, whereas if one is simply out in one's back yard focusing toward the North pole or South pole, the image becomes so magni- fied, it begins to boggle one's mind. This Awareness indicates that were the image working with a photograph, it would be easier for the mind to assist in deal~ng with these frequencies. This Awareness reminds you that radionics is dealing with the frequency of the mind being projected alon the mechanics of the operation. f with the intention and vibrations that are represente in This Awareness suggests that while you are at this, you might also wish to doctor the forests, rticularly in the Amazon region, to prevent them from eing de- stroyed further, which In effect is contributing greatly to the destruction of the ozone layer. FOLLOW-UP (AVATON): Could the benefits of the Fantazia be projected in this manner also?"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"This Awareness indicates that this is in the affirmative. This Awareness suggests that the use of Fantazia on photographs of trees or on maps of Brazil with the intention of growlng more forests in the area; this, along with other areas in which vegetation could or should grow, as that which could be beneficial. This Awareness suggests you might as well also con- sider ex anding forestr , expanding the forests in and R $' around t e Sahara in A rica, where much of the vegeta- tion has been dying off, in the area surrounding the Sahara Desert; that this also might be beneficial in regard to the Gobi Desert in Chtna, that in all of these desert areas you may visualize the forests beginning to grow further and further out into the deserts, to reverse the trend that is now occurring, in which deserts are encroaching on the vegetations.

(More on King Solomon) Legend has it that King Solomon lo ged forests -- f cedars of Lebanon or something like t at. Is it true that at one time, instead of deserts, there were vast forests in those areas? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates this is in the affirmative. There were, at one time, considerably large numbers of trees; there were forests in those general areas in Africa. This Awareness indicates likewise there were great forests at the North Pole, that these too have been destroyed and a polar desert now remains, but this Awareness sug ests there are remnants of trees millions of years old in t % at area of the North Pole. This Awareness indicates that deep beneath the sands in the Sahara, there are also remnants of forests. This Awareness indicates that subsequent to the for- ests in the Sahara, water covered that area at one time. Why the Rapid Drop in the Bird Population? (More On the Destruction of Tropical Ralnforests) One final question. An article sent in by Ted Helinski, entitled \"The Ra id Dro in Birds May be Linked to Deforestation.\" %said, '$opulations of many species of migrator birds, including some familiar songbirds, are rap~dly d' eclining, and tropical deforestation ma primary reason, according to scientists who ana twenty years of bird surveys from across North The severe decline of some songbirds which spend their winters in South and Central America, and their sum-. mers in the United States and Canada, have occurred in less than a decade, with some species diminishing b P 2' almost half. 'Something dramatic is ha pening,' sai. Russell Greenber , research scient~st. ' n the past nine years, the Wood I hrush has been reduced 30 percent, the Baltimore or Northern Oriole po ulation has fallen R 23 percent, and the Scarlet Tana~er as declined 10 ercent. It's tragic,\" he said, \"we re going to have fewer girds.' Are the birds being harmed, scientists have wondered, by changes in their summer homes in temperate North America, or by changes to their winter rounds in the 'r tropics? Many bird experts have argue that forest fragmentation in North America is mostly to blame, since cutting the forest into smaller and smaller atches R increases the access that predators and parasites ave to the forest-dwellin birds. However, Greenberg and his colleagues argue t f at the primary cause is more likely to be tropical deforestation.' Would Awareness explain which of those or either of those are correct? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that it is indeed more the effect of the tropical forest being destroyed; that there are, of course, certain effects of destruction from northern forests also. This Awareness indicates that part of the situation is not on1 that it disrupts their habitation, summer and winter g omes, but also the deforestation destroys insects which they feed on. This Awareness indicates that as these dam forests ? a are destro ed, these insects become fewer an fewer, and there ore it becomes more of a problem for birds, to find places where the can live that will provide suffi- cient food for themse 7 ves and their nests. Another Easter Island Is Corning Soon This Awareness indicates that the world is quick1 approaching the catastrophe that is symbolized on Jaster Island, where there was a time in which these islands were covered with trees, before natives began to cut down the trees to build houses and boats, and wherein at some oint the last tree was cut down, and no seeds or 7 no rep anting was done, and because of this, when the boats and the houses rotted, the natives then had no means for fishing, no place to live, no way to survive. This Awareness indicates that this was the hazard of living on an island and.not protecting the vegetation on the island, for when it is gone, it is gone. This Awareness reminds you that the earth itself is but a great island in the sky, and one cannot expect to rape and remove all foliage, without destroying every thing that is left. The Ozone Layer: A Point of No Return CLOSING MESSACE: This Awareness indicates the great danger on the earth is, there is a point, the point being immeasurable, as to where or when it will occur, whereby the ozone layer diminishing will pass a point of no return, whereby as it becomes so weakened and so thin, at some polnt, the rays of the sun will begin to burn the vegetation, which will reduce the oxygen further, which will deplete the ozone further, which will lead to rapid destruction of life on earth. Thank you. (The Law of Gratitude is given) *Ed's Note: For over 20 years CAC offered D-Cells and S- Cells to the membership. During that time our members planted these in almost every lake and river in the country, same in Canada and in many places in Europe. They were literally seeds planted in consciousness and I suspect that these actions had something to do with the raising of awareness in mass consciousness that help the environmental movement get laws passed designed to clean up and protect Mother Earth. In addition, as many CAC people can attest, the healing proper- ties of the D and S-Cells had much to do with keeping the membership healthy and with access to pure drinking water in their homes. When Joe Dun Sloan, the creator of these cells died, he took the formula with him to his grave, so unfortu- nately humanity no longer has access to them."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"13 It was much the same with Fantazia water. CAC made it available to the membership until human greed made it so expensive per ounce we no longer would carry it. Fantazia essentially was just distilled water subjected to vocal prayers and positive affirmations instructing it to accomplish certain things, such as healing the people who drink it, enhancing the fruit and vegetable gardens, etc. Vikki came up with idea of creating our own form of Fantazia water. We recorded healing affirmations and numerous positive suggestions on a 12 minute endless tape cassette and by using an electric timer, triggered it to play next to the distiller we had placed in a sound-proof closet. So during the long hours the distiller was cooking away, those recorded affirmations were permeating the space around it including each drop of the distilled water being brewed. It seemed to work and Awareness mentioned it in several readings, including this one you just read. Anyone can do the same thing if they have the inclination and it could be used in any project designed to help the environment, such as radionics. As to the woman and her company who originally created Fantazia, we heard through the grapevine that the FDA had shut them down years ago for attributing certain health claims to their product. The claims were probably true but as far as CAC was concerned human greed was what priced them nut of business.

The first time she had just returned from India and was excited over having met the avatar Sai Baba whom many believe is God incarnate. She showed us photos and videos of the entity being idolized by the masses as he \"manifested\" ashes out of empt bottles, trinkets of old and other ob'ects which he t rew % i K to an adoring crow . Both Paul and viewed her video s ectacle with polite skepticism. JD's questions during t I! at session, however, brought out information on the real nature of gurus, Cosmic Awareness, divine beings (all of us) and we all learned something, particularly JD who u until then was a guru follower, or as I once remar f ed a \"Guru groupie.\" Another time when JD came to Olympia and sta ed for a week of sessions, we were all sttting in a circ i e around Paul laying in \"trance\", JD was having a dia- logue with Awareness over a series of questions (she kept rephrasing until satisfied Awareness got the exact meaning of her uestion) when right in the middle of the dialogue, JD su 3 denly raised her arms and her blouse flew off and there she was topless talking to Cosmic Awareness. We learned later she was having a hot flash and was being particularly plagued by them that sum- mer. It was retty hard for me to stay focused on the business at f and durin that reading session. But like I said, JD Rabbit was a gee s irit, very uninhibited, and in a discussion she shot from t e e hip, wasted no words, demanded direct answers to questions, demanded details and proof to back up statements etc. We first met the Rabbit when we flew to New York to see Wagner's Ring Cycle at the Met. She had invited us to come to her apartment on Houston Street on the edge of Greenwich Village. It was a large buildin fortified with security fences, yet surrounde f, with lovely flowers and a well-kept herb and vegetable garden. I was dumbfounded at the sight, huge tomatoes growing right in the heart of New York City. A security guard phoned after we identified ourselves and we were directed to a stairway that led us to her a artment. The place was luxurious but sparse: a couc\\, a chair and a telephone which rang 11 times during our 4 hour visit. JD ex- lained she did a lot of \"counseling\" over the phone. eater, she led us across the street to a tiny hole in the wall restaurant for ice cream and coffee. There were several homeless eople on the sidewalk as well as 3 panhandlers who e it us up. JD pulled a fistful of paper money from her jeans and saw that every entity received some. We knew she was generous because she spon- sored a dozen or more risoners and other hard-up entities she knew to C b: C subscriptions over the years, but it was also obvious she was an easy \"touch\" and one who seldom said \"no\" to those less fortunate. We found out later she was also supportin a number of \"starving\" artists, poets and playwr~ghts w g o were having hard financial times tr ing to make it in their professions. We knew by some o ?' the questions she mailed in that this subsidizing of what I would refer to as \"deadbeats\" deeply troubled her because in several cases it created resentment and jealously from those who received her enerous gifts and yet made JD feel like she had no real friends and those who called themselves friends were doing so only for her money etc. Over the years she made 'loans\" to various characters with hard luck stories an I suspect there are many of these left unpaid. JD and her family owned a lar e and impressive villa in Acapulco, Mexico called \"La % ondine\" (the swallow) like Puccini's opera of the same name. It was full staffed, with a huge swimming pool and a magni ? icent view of the city and ocean below. To enter the area we had to pass through a hu e metal gate manned by two uniformed and armed poficemen; a was like out of a movie! When she was in Olympia she told us about that villa sayin it was seldom used anymore, that she would k fly there a one to rest, meditate and recuperate after various world travels, and she invited us to use it anytime we wished. She said, \"Not ust you two, bring a the whole family.\" So we did, all 1 of us includin children descended on La Rondine like a swarm o f locusts, leaving Olympia during a January snowstorm and 20 degree weather and arrivin in sunny 90 degree B % Acapulco. We sta ed 10 days, pro ably the most memorable perio in our lives, thanks to our gracious and generous host JD Rabbit. For years JD had a small uiet retreat near Montpelier, 5, Vermont, which she used w en the noise and vibes of New York City ot to her. A few years back she de- si ned and built er \"dream home\" on that wooded spot e 7, w ere she created flower and vegetable gardens and encountered deer and various creatures (yes, rabbits) and seemed to finally have found contentment. It was on a road nearby that JD Rabbit suddenly and unexpectedly left this plane. We knew from the readings that JD Rabbit's present lifetime was not her most significant. Over the years Awareness volunteered considerable information about some of her ast lifetimes. She had very si nificant 1 % lifetimes in tlantis, Lemuria, the Temple eautiful, Egyptian lifetimes during the building of the p ramids; 2 she was always a part of those entities who to a comprise what could be called the Awareness dove- ment. Awareness revealed, in fact, that the main mlssion of JD's incarnation this lifetime was to energwe and send in questions which helped Awareness access to this plane throu h the Interpreters and to extend that \"Cos- mic Day\", t f at hole in space that could have been closed years ago but didn't because of that ener y supplied by % the questions. There is little doubt that J more than succeeded in this lifetime endeavor. CAC has 8 bulging files of questions sent in by this entity over the years, hundreds, robably thousands of which have been asked and printe ! in the newsletter. There are many more, I can assure you, to come in future newsletters. At the time of JD's passing over, I also have 3 complete files of uestions yet to ask but probably never will due to the gensit chan e now rapidly occurring which will proba g ly m af e all questions moot. One bit of information Awareness once revealed was that in one of JD Rabbit's more recent lifetimes, \"she was almost made a Saint.\" Neither JD or this editor ever pursued that remark for more details. What we do know from the readings is that JD Rabbit wasKvi5-y high s iritually evolved entity and had served humanity t l! rough many lifetimes playing different roles that always he1 ed the spiritual evolvement of the masses on P ! this lane. t was also revealed by Cosmic Awareness that D was a Wanderer and that Sach Kahn or Essence, that plane adjacent to the Godhead was her true home. And I have no doubt that at this moment JD Rabbit has gone home.

This Awareness indi- cates that durin these moments of a pearance and disap earance t g ere is created that w 1 ~ch is likened unto a shlf?ing of ener ies, and in this pulsation wherein energies shift an f gather from place to place leaving vacuums and leaving densities, there becomes that which is the separatton of light and darkness, of matter and spirit, of space and that which is non-space or substance. This Awareness indicates that as this occurs on large-scale levels; wherein this is occurrin in consciousness and consciousness is capable o f expand- ing in many directions, the very action of this expansion does allow the possibility of contraction, and wherein there is that which can perceive expansion and contrac- tion, there is the possibility of consciousness to perceive size, to perceive shape, to perceive that which may be termed space. This Awareness indicates there is in reality no such thing as time and space. There is only consciousness, but withln that consciousness there is the possibility of the illusion of time and space. This Awareness indtcates this is likened unto entities dreamin , wherein entities move into that state of the dream and ? eel themselves flying throu h s ace, yet suddenly awakenin and realizin that t l! ey 1 ave never left their bed, but % ave simply een moving in terms of consciousness. This Awareness % indicates that likewise this third-dimensional world in which entities feel themselves moving in levels of matter from place to lace, from moment to moment, is a similar type o f dream or illusion, and in reality, all of this is but consciousness, is but the dream of one aspect of yourself which is sleeping elsewhere and dreaming your existence. This Awareness indicates there are twelve aspects of each entity and only one resides on this plane at a time. This Awareness indicates this plane is-but a lane of consciousness, rather than a plane of reality. de concept of reality may be better termed a level of realization: to realize, to be indicated as real by the consciousness, by the collective consciousness of entities who are in agreement that this or that situation is real. This Awareness indicates that the agreement creates the reality, and wherein everyone disagrees with an entity, that entity then is said to have his own reality which is separate and not akin to the reality of others. This Awareness indicates the others then refer to that entity as being un-realistic. This Awareness indicates that as entities move through levels of consciousness, they may be likened unto vibrations, unto particles of light, unto igments of a painting, unto the refractions of the redctin light or of the vibrations of a note - each being totally 8 istinct and unlike any other, yet each being totally integrated and part of the total tone, the total colors, the total vibration which exists in this universe during this moment. This Awareness indicates that these ent~ties, these portions or parts of this mosaic pattern which is known as \"now\" - this pattern of matter and li ht dancing on the Akashic screen which spreads and fi k 1s in all directions that state of consciousness, that sea, the psychic sea on which these images are projected. These portions, these particles known as entities, known as atoms, known as molecules, known as parts and organs and features and shapes and items - these forms are all but images, and exlst in the land of the Magi-nation. This Awareness indicates that each of these does have within itself the strength to survive and grow according to its ability to be of interest, to gain attention, to grow as an entlty and to survive as an energy through the feeding or service of somethlng greater than ttself. This Awareness indicates as each particle surrenders itself unto somethlng greater than ~tself, it becomes incorporated with that greatness, and that greatness then becomes a container of that article, and an organ that has reater chance of survivat) ~hls Awareness indicates t f at as this occurs, entities begin to take on the appearance of stability - of being a mag- nanimous type of creation. This Awareness indicates through the sensitivity,, the development of certain sensitivities toward the envlron- ment, toward the actions of becoming self-aware and aware of the environment, these organisms begin to grow more definite in terms of their tmage, so that the tmage becomes energized and appears to be more solid. This Awareness indicates as long as these images can either suffer pain to remind them.of their own existenc~, or pleasure to remind them of thelr own existence, and In this way feed themselves through these impressions and sensitivities - through feelings, through various types of reaching out and experiencing - and gathering these impressions which tend to reassure themselves of.their own existence, these organisms begin to develop into that which becomes more than mere vitality, but be- comes likened unto self-awareness. This Awareness indicates that as these begin growing even stronger, there is the possibility for these organisms to begin to grow into levels of self-awareness expandin and in that % expansion of self-awareness there becomes t e possibil- ity of that entity or organtsm moving about and discovering more about its environment. This Awareness indicates the particle becomes the molecule, the amoeba, the creature, the small sea creatures, the small parts of vegetation, the moss, the parasitic type of ve etation - those tiny sea creatures which move aroun f in stagnant water, in fresh water, and in sea water which normally serve as feed for other creatures. These creatures have within themselves the capability of moving so far into their own being that at the point of change, instead of simply dying, they move toward metamorphosis and enter into that level of creaturehood wherein they become self-awareness ex anding, and in this action they learn to move about or to \\ ecome aware of themselves ~n relation to other creatures about them. This Awareness indicates that as this moves on, this type of consciousness eventually can reach that level where it is so sensitive and so aware, that it perceives actions in directions far beyond its own experience and feeling levels. This Awareness indicates that this may be likened unto the do1 hins of the sea, the R porpoises, and certain whales. This wareness indicates these creatures, many of these creatures do have that consciousness which is cosmic. This Awareness indicates that many of these creatures have consciousness levels which surpass the eniuses upon your plane who walk as human beings. %his Awareness indicates that there are those upon this plane who, as human beings, have consciousness which is less sensitive than the mere vitalit level of certain amoebas. i There are humans upon this p ane whose consciousness is but self-awareness and they cannot perceive beyond that level. There are entities upon this plane who do have self-awareness which is expanding at tts own rate - some"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"rapidly and some very slowly - and there are entities upon this plane whose consciousness is indeed reaching into levels which are cosmic. This Awareness indicates that there are many levels and steps and gradations between these. That often entities who have moments of cosmic consciousness also have those moments wherein there is but mere vitality. This Awareness indicates that the development of the soul is that which occurs when entities begin to experience a separation from that level which is cosmic, and recognizing themselves as being a self. The development of the soul comes between the mere vitality and the be inning of the self-awareness. For wherein there is se 5 f-awareness, the soul begins to become a sole creature - sole - a feeling of solitude comes over the entity, and the entity feels separated from the mass of livlng vitality around that entity, and as this soul begins to experience from that level of solitude, of being se arated, it then begins to perceive greater suffering an f greater desires and greater feelin s of aloneness and the need to struggle a ainst that whic B f is not itself. This Awareness indicates t rough this kind of struegle wherein there is that feeling of isolation and separation a art from the universe, apart from the God, R apart from t e rest of consciousness, this is that which begins creating the irritation upon the entity which may be likened unto the grain of sand in the oyster which creates irritation upon the flesh of the oyster, and which in time begins to manifest as a hard lump which works and swells and grows and eventually develops into a pearl of great price. This Awareness indicates that the entit in developing his soul throu h the suffering and strugg f e, the hardships which come atout through being separated from God, from the rest of consciousness - that feeling of separa- tion, of isolation, of being alone - that great suffering is that which begins to develop the soul of the entity and allows that entity to become so certain of his or her own existence that there is no longer any doubt, and the soul is born and is permanent. This Awareness indicates that when this occurs and the soul becomes permanent, the entity is capable of leaving the body and the soul continues. This then relates unto actions of moving as a soul through spiritual realms and moving back into matter. This becomes that action known as reincarnation - moving back into the flesh from the levels of spirit. This Awareness indicates that as the soul continues to develop even further, this soul is capable of recallin those previous lifetimes and revious experiences. Ais Awareness indicates that as t ! ose memories become more and more o ened and the soul is capable of experiencing itse P f, the possibility of pro ectin its own future lifetimes becomes even greater. Ti at lt .% ecomes also very possible for entities living upon this plane to begin reallzing that their lifetime at any given moment may be compared to the waking state prior to falling asleep and reawakening the next mornin . This Aware- ness indicates as entities live and die an f live again, this is but a cycle on a larger day and night c cle very % r similar to the action of the wakin and s eeping cycle wherein entities do not lose their ody but simply leave their body as they sleep. This Awareness indicates as entities fall asleep and leave their body each night, so likewise on a larger scale, entities lose their body and recreate a new body on certain c cles - this being considered that cycle of life and deat K . This Awareness indicates that it is possible for entities in high states of consciousness not to fall asleep at night and not to be totally awake in the day- time, but to reconcile these two levels of consciousness into levels of subjective awareness. This Awareness indicates that even as these extremes of consciousness are possible in the daily and nightly life of entities, wherein certain entities have not been asleep for many years, so likewise it is possible for entities not to move through the life and death cycle, but to continue existing indefinitely in the shadowland between. This Awareness indicates that much of the material which shall follow shall discuss these man levels wherein the reconciliation of polarities, of %fe and death. of ood and evil, of ri ht and wrong, of li ht and a % i! dar ness, can lead to t at twilight zone w eretn a new reality becomes understood which allows entities to move into eternal life. This Awareness indicates this is the conclusion of the first lecture, that an questions relating to this may be asked at this time; t i: at barring and questions, the Interpreter may be brought from trance. The 12 Aspects of the Soul QUESTION (AVATON): Awareness spoke of the twelve aspects of the soul. Is this the same as the twelve aspects referred to in the lessons? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates there are twelve entities which make u a team for each entity who now resides upon this eartl!, and these twelve ent~ties ... eleven of these entities arc moving in other rea!ms, yet keeping close contact with this entity upon thls realm. This Awareness indicates this as mentioned in a simi- lar t pe of reference in the works of Percival, and in the wor l s of Jane Roberts, wherein the multi-dimensional personality is discussed. This Awareness indicates that these twelve entities may be likened unto twelve aspects of the soul and do corres ond with the Disciples which are associated with the Rrist. This Awareness indicates these twelve aspects often alternate in the body of each entity upon this plane and often these twelve aspects integrate together and this then becomes that level which may be likened unto Christ Consciousness, wherein a total integration occurs, and the entity is moved into levels, of extremely high levels of awareness. This Awareness su gests that this be the conclusion for that first lesson, t b at further information will be forthcoming in the next lesson. That the questions of a personal nature may be asked, that the Interpreter be allowed to come out of trance for a brief moment to stretch. (The Law of Gratitude is given.)"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"THE 144 LIGHT-PULSE EXERCISE- MEDITATION FOR HEALING THE EARTH ms Awareness asks that entities who read this mes- sa e to s end ap roximately five minutes prior to fa 8, ing as f' eep eac ! night for a period of one week, ima ing the world floating in space, and visualizing this wor d as havin certain areas of darkness, and fecling the presence ! o this world floating in space, likened unto the pictures of the earth taken from the moon. This Awareness asks that entities then begin visualiz- ing the earth as gathering a t e of \"halo\" around itself an aura of hght, and to watc i? this light as it grows, and see this light pulsating. This Awarcness su ests that entities then count the pulsations of light, Ct they count silently to 144 (one hundred and forty-four) pulsations, and as this is com leted, that they move themselves back into the li ht and l! ack onto the cart. and experience the light whica they have created. This Awareness asks that entities do thls for at least seven days. This needs to be done nightly, throughout the rest of the year, if entities can bring themselves to putting out that much energy. The action of puttin forth this ener y will bring man rewards to entities un f er the Law o{&at~tude(*), and Ley shall fmd themselves being ealed on many levels as they move into the light. After entities move back into the image of the earth now li hted, they ma also begin feeling the pulsations aroun f their own bo 2' y, feeling themselves ulsating as light, and may also count 144 pulsations. l%s Aware- ness su ests this may also be used on other entities who need he3ing. (77-0-04) 'The Law of Gratitude is that sense of satlsfaction where energy which has been given receives a certain reward. For all energy you give, whether thought, spoken, or acted, goes out on that curved unequal line, and can only return to its sender bearing gifts. What happens when you fall asleep,in the rocess of that setting up? B trylng to do your 144 light-count meditation. What is COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness su ests that this continues on the subjective level re ar 8 ess of what is running through the conscious levef. Wherein an action is started, the rest is implied in your sub'ective levels, and is continued. The greater effort to # inish the count, the stronger the on the subjective level. This is that which assists in deepening the effects of the count. (78-09) USING THE 144 LIGHT-PULSE MEDITATION TO HELP THOSE WITH DRINKING PROBLEMS This Awareness su ests that the same meditation may be used for alco I!? olics. Wherein there is the feeling of a need for a dtink, that you ask the alcoholic to begin seeing the light pulsating, coming into his being. The light may be equated with the dr1t.k; it may be used as a substitution for the alcoholic spirit, the use of alcoholic s irits as a substitute for the true light and the true spirit. herein an entit can realize this and can begin tuning in to the use of d' e real true spirit, this shall become a substitute for the entity. This Awareness indicates that the entity visualize in his hand a glass; hs glass becomes that which be ins pulsating as light. That the entity visualize this ligft pulsating twelve times in this glass, growing stronger 18 yith each pulsation. That the entity then visualize h~mself drinkin @is light, that this be done in twelve % swallows (this elng a count up to twenty-four, the twelve pulsations and the twelve swallows). This Awareness su ests that then the entity. sit m f9 meditative position, ee ins the light pulsating in and through his body for remainder of the count to 144. This may be likened unto the uerichin of the thirst, this being a drink of ~ostnic%pirit - tie nectar of the Gods. This action, bein a substitute, may satisfy the subcon- B scious cravings. or alcohol, and thls shall assist in the withdrawal period. This Awarcness sug ests also that this be done, not % simply as a substitute, ut as a transition. That music bc layed; that there be great feeling of 'oy eace and A ,R Lrmony connected with this. And a el t !s has been completed, that the entity be grectedwith joyous attitudes and given juice and something to eat. This Awareness su gests the use of fruit juices after f the meditation. (77-0 ) CONCERNING THE USE OF THE 144 LIGHT PULSE MEDITATION FOR PERSONAL GAIN This Awareness su gests that it is all right for entities fi to use the 144 Light- ulse Meditation for their own as it brings no harmto any other.

She writes: \"I understand that in some cases, the physical or otherwise forms of living beings are sustained by light or thought. Here on earth the majority of life forms seem to survive b reying on other life forms. I find this appalling. f ust [ow revalent is this survival by predation system? I f shou d hope it is quite rare!\" COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates that this is akin to that which is called 'psychic vampirism,' feeding off of the energies of others, and it is quite common among humans. It is possible for entities to learn, however, that energy is everywhere resent and the mind is capable of f drawing energy even rom the air around, because the air and the space contains life energy. When entities discover that the spirit-of Divinity is everywhere present and that spirit of Divinity is the Life Energy, then the no lon er will need to draw Life Energy from eaci other. tntities who seek attention are essentially seeking the energy of someone else. Entities who give attention are essentially giving their energy to someone else. Attention taken, or attention given is the passing of energy. This Awareness indicates that you can give attention continuously, if you are aware that energy can be drawn from the space around ou, for everything is alive and contains ener y. There ore, as more and more B r entities become aware rom the ever-presence or omnipresence of energy, the will reach a point whereby they no longer nee '7 to draw energy from others by seeking the~r attention or trying to get some- thing out of them. This Awareness indicates the person who comes to you with a great need, with some hun er, is essentially drawing your ener y, and as you wor with this entity B t and invest more o your energy into the entity, they come to expect this from you and they will return for more of your attention and more of your help. There comes a time when such psychic vam ires will need to be told, \"I can't help you anymore!\" +' ou may wish to continue he1 ing them for some time, but if you cannot help them to P earn to draw energy for them- selves, or to handle their own problems, then you are helping to make them dependent on someone else for the energy they should learn to create on their own, for themselves. You do not want to become an 'enabler' enabling them to continue being the ps chic vampire that they have begun to become. This lwareness indicates you will see such entities at ever party. Where there is a crowd of people there will a r ways be some psychic vampire seeking energy from someone. Do not look down on them as though they were evil. They are simply people in need of attention. Give them the attention you can afford, and tell them how much strength they have within and how you know that they can draw the energy they need or you know that they can handle the situation; you have faith in them, and then let them go their own way. Do not feed them too much of your energy, or get them dependent on you. Many entities will enjoy being the fountain for psy- chic vampires. They enjoy tr in to help others to the point where they are deplete ;i o f their own energy. It gives them a sense of importance. \"This erson really needs me! I am very important to their li f e! Therefore, I will give myself to this person, over and over, as long as the erson continues to need me.\" This, many entities P thin of as being a leader. As you move into a osition of leadership ,or impor- tance to others, you o t ten think that you are important yourself, but you may simply be creating followers and dependents and kee ing them from becoming self- contained or self-su ! ficient, or in their own rlghts able to handle their problems. You do not want to become the fountain of energy for other peo le's lives and make them dependent on ou. This can k' e a grave mistake, because not only wil l\" you then lose your own ener y and your own right to go out and be yourself, you wil k not only make them dependent on you, but you become dependent on them, and you become responsible; that is the key word, to them. You begin to make them independent, and ou have a responsibility that you must continually fulfi ?' 1 for them. Th~s Awareness indicates too much responsibility for the welfare of others can not only make them overly dependent and keep them from growing and developing their own sense of responsibility, it can also deplete you of energy that you could put to other use, or for helping others to develop their own sense of responsibility. In other words, help eople to help themselves. Don't simply help peo le so t at you can be important and P R they can stay he pless before you. Should We Agitate Water Before Drinking It? QUESTION: Another question from JD. \"Please discuss the merits of drinking flowing or otherwise agitated water, and whether it will benefit significantly to agitate our water before drinking it?\" COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness indicates the flowing or agitation of water helps to purify it; that is, more or less the main value of such action. Water flowing approximately 16 feet in terms of space, depending on its degree of impurity, can be much more ure than standing water. This Awareness indicates, o fl' course, water flowin throu h pipes may not necessarily become purifie by ff 8 that ow, even if it is more than 16 feet, but in general, even that would help somewhat. This Awareness indicates it tends to affect the mole- cules of water to have them moving, but to have oxygen available for moving water is what real1 helps to purify i it. The more it churns or is agitated, suc as moving through ra ids or waterfalls, the more purified it becomes. htting water in a blender could give it some oxygenation. Even running it throu h a screened filter g, as may be installed on a faucet can elp to oxy enate the water, and the oxygen can help to purify it, % ut this is not to sa such water is necessarily pure enough to drink, just r, ecause it has been oxygenated or ut in a blender. It may be better, but still not be goo 'f enough."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"20 Do Lawyers Need to Take an Oath in Order to . - -- Lie and Cheat? I QUESTION: A question from Cheri P., in Tucson, Az. She writes: \"There is an oath that all lawyers take at graduation that in effect says that they will lie, steal, cheat, do whatever they have to protect the government, the president, the powers that be, whatever, exactly what I'm unclear, and that whenever you ask one of them about their oath, the question will be avoided at all costs. At which time you can say, \"Thank you.Youlve just answered my ques- tion.\" \"No doubt this is why all or most of the presidents of this country have been lawyers.

I understand there are other legal oaths as well, such as a judge's oath.\" Does Awareness see any truth to that? COSMIC AWARENESS: This Awareness does not see where these oaths are ke t or where they can be found. This Awareness ingcates it appears to be somethin that is doubtful as to its very existence. If such an oat a does exist, which is This Awareness indicates it is unlikely that there is such an oath. It is possible that some kind of oath exists which may have been distorted in its expression for this entity, however this Awareness does not see the oath mentioned as being something which law ers do have. If it does exist, there are many lawyers w i: o have broken their oaths, have turned against presidents, have worked to indict presidents. Think back on President Nixon and what is happening today to President Clinton, for there are lawyers at resent who are working to indict the present president For misdeeds, and there were lawyers m the past who have sought to investigate and indict residents.
