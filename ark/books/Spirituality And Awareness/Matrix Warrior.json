Energy is the only life and is from the Body and Reason is the bound or outward circumference of Energy. Energy is Eternal Delight. What is now proved was once only imagin'd.

For the cherub with his flam ing sword is hereby commanded to leave his guard at the tree of life, and when he does, the whole creation will be consumed, and appear infinite and holy, w hereas it now appears finite and corrupt. If the doors of perception were cl eansed, every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees al l things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern. Man by his reasoning power can only compare and judge of what he has already perceived. From a perception of only 3 senses or 3 elements none could deduce a fourth or fifth. Man's desires are limited by his perceptions , none can desire what he has not perceiv'd.

When the movie The Matrix came out in Easter 1999, mi llions of viewers responded enthusiastically to the kick-ass special effects and audacious plotting, and expressed their gratitude for what they perceived - rightly - as a superior piece of Hollywood entertainment. A small handful of viewers, how ever, persons of unorthodox points of view whose ranks nonetheless appear to be steadily expanding with every passing year, found something in the movie besides a mere divertissement . They found a message. Most of these folk are still in their teens and may have been as young as ten or twelve when they first saw the movie that changed their liv es. Many of them probably do too many psychedelics and certainly smoke too much pot, pl ay too many sinister video games, spend too much time alone, and rarely, if ever, re ad a book. Admittedly, ther e are some discerning adults who grokked the movie's 'message', but they are definitely in the minority. The greater part of adult viewers, being gr own-ups after all, lacked the flexibility, imagination, and perhaps also the disenchantment, necessary to receive the movie at a deeper, all- encompassing level — as 'truth'. Thousands, maybe millions, of adolescents and teens, however, already predisposed towards the not ion that reality is 'fucked' beyond all redemption, embraced The Matrix body and soul and sw allowed the red pill eagerly, without hesitation or regret. The rest of us, like the mo vie said, just weren't ready to be unplugged. The possibility that everything in the movie might be absolutely and totally true, albeit in a disguised and distorted fashion, was a possibilit y too tantalizing, too satisfying, too damn rebellious and radical for many youngsters to resist. They t ook the movie on whole, and adapted their Weltanschauungs accordingly. The Matrix , then, was more than just another sci-fi mind-fuck movie: it was a signal, sent from the real world (the world of Morpheus, Zion, and the Nebuchadnezzar ) down into this illusory labyrinth world in which we are all ensnared. It was sent in order to alert us as to the nat ure of our predicament, and provide us with the necessary clues by which to get out, while there is still time, and make it back to reality. Such a belief may not be as deranged as it at first appears, nor necessarily a cause for concern on the part of these kids' parents, already fearing that the gulf between the generations is extending into infinity. These ki ds may be crazy but they aren't stupid. They know all about myth and legend, even if they don't know Pan from Dionysus or Jung from Joseph Campbell. They know about intellectual exercises, or head games as they call them, and they know that all of this is metaphor . They grok instinctively that the message will have lost a great deal of it s purity by being filter ed down to us through the various media channels - i.e., the matrix - but apprecia te that the essence, miracul ously, has survived intact. This essence might be reduced to three basic facts or acceptances: 1 This world is a prison, a world woven out of our own thoughts, dreams , fears, and desires, in order to blind us to the truth of ourselves. 2 We are slaves. We have no more say in our choi ces, our lives and our destinies, than cattle that are herded, or chi ckens in their coop. We are at t he mercy of forces we cannot even begin to comprehend, forces that definit ely do not have our welfare at heart. 3 Humanity is a food source, and the world as we know it is simply the elaborate, intricate mechanism by which we are distracted from th is fact: the world is a farm, and we are the livestock. All our dreams, then, are dreams of meat, on its way to being eaten."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"These three ideas are, like I say, ideas that only the very open-minded or else the extremely disillusioned (or, best of all, bot h) are willing or able to entertain or assimilate as having any bearing on reality. As such, they are keptwithin the comfor table confines of fantasy, be it sci-fi books and movies, ancient mythology or a Hollyw ood action flick. And yet, these ideas are not actually new. Fig 1: The Red Pill To varying degrees they are central to systems of human belief extant in most if not all cultures, and pertaining throughout all recorded hist ory. For example, that the world is not what it appears to be is something all religi ons have insisted upon, something that myths have hinted at, and something that science has finally established in this last century, beyond all reasonable, or even unreasonable, doubt. That we have no actual say in our decisi ons, that free will is but our fondest and most violently defended illusion, that we are in tr uth but a minuscule component of some vast mechanism, some greater working which we can barely even imagine from our present perspective; this likewise has been fed to us by religions, from childhood to old age. Myths make the same argument implicitly: wherever there is God or gods, all human endeavour is inevitably reduced to ignorant folly; at best it is some sort of di vine test, at worst no more than amusement for a cold, indifferent Fate. Worse still, modern scienc e, from Darwinism to chaos theory, has presented the same argument, albeit in rational and not mystical terms, substituting concepts such as gravity and sub atomic particles for God and Fate, and so forth. Which only leaves the third idea. MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 7 Neither religion nor science has as yet dared to suggest, in anything but passing, that humanity might exist merely to provide sustenanc e for some other entities of which we are unaware, that prey upon us just as any species preys upon those below it: for survival. Of course, humanity has always considered itself to be the supreme predat or in a predatory universe, to be securely placed at the very t op of the food chain. True, certain Gnostic texts refer to God Himself as 'a man- eater', but apart from this rather embarrassing slip (and it is for just such 'slips' that the Gnostic tests were excised from the Bible proper), it is only in the realms of ancient myth and, most of all, occult lore, that we find any significant parallels to this last, supremely unpleasant idea. But we will come back to that."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 8 My point for now is merely to show how The Ma trix brought to a large number of people, in a suitably entertaining, even frivolous and simplistic, fashion, questions that are central to our present predicament as humans, and indeed to the very meaning of what it is to be human. Like all good myths, the movi e addresses individual and univer sal concerns, both real and mundane, and takes them into a more fantastic r ealm. As a result, despite, or rather because of, their being removed from our everyday frame of reference, these concerns begin to make a new kind of sense to us. Th e truth dawns, if only for the two hours during which we are transported to an alternate universe, a universe in which nothing is true and, consequently, anything is possible. To put it another way, the frustration, despair and existential panic; the boredom, anxiety, paranoia, loss of identity, sense of unreality; the feeling of being trapped, of being drained of one's will and energy, of being plotted against, confounded, and blocked at every turn, and, above all, the sense of u tter meaninglessness and futility that pervades collective and individual life in the twenty-first century, all begin to ma ke perfect sense within the frame of reference provided by The Matrix . This is what myths are all about. They aren't rational explanations of our lives so much as emotional interpretations. They are designed not to explain what's going on, but rather to account for and shed light upon our feelings about what's go ing on. Myths are collective dreams. So, a myth like The Matrix , which suggests that life is a co llective dream, is really the ultimate myth-story. It is the myth of humanity itself, a dream within a dream, a myth about a myth, a metaphor for a metaphor. Hence the mo vie seamlessly fuses science with religion, revealing both to be but alternate, opposing m odes of mythology: those of the rational and intuitive modes, or left and right brain respectively . The truth, then, is to be found not through one or the other, but through the co rrect juxtaposing and ba lancing of both. If life itself is but a temporary, illusory, and even, finally, arbitrar y interpretation of energy, then myths are blueprints by which we might co me to understand the m ental processes that give rise to a given interpretation. It is not t hat they are outside rea lity because they are less than it but, on the contrary, they are outside re ality because they are the means by which reality is created. In which case, a movie, being a hologrammati c package within the gr eater hologram of life itself, might conceivably be a win dow, or even a doorway, to that reality which lies beyond. It may just be exactly what the geeks and dopers are trying to tell us it is: Truth. Like all true myths, The Matrix is a journey of individuation, by which the soul, through trial and adversity, purges itself of all t hat is foreign to it and so come s to experience the totality of itself. This apotheosis of self (in the movie) consists of a fo rm of enlightenment in which the world entire becomes no more than a mirage, a mi rage by which the soul is tricked, tested, and challenged. Once Neo is able to 'read the code', the game is over; or at least he has moved to the next leve l. He shakes his head wryly, per haps a little sadly, and stops the incoming bullets with a lazy wave of his hand, as if to say, 'No more of that'. By seeing the world as it is he has transform ed it from an adversary into an a lly, perhaps even a lover: it is subject to his will, to shape as he sees fit. This transcendental climax makes The Matrix , the greatest and most popular action movie ever m ade, not just a modern myth but a metamyth: a myth about the eternal process by which myths, and humans, are made. It reveals the world itself as a myth, and Man, as both Messiah and Adversary, still torn between the two opposing sides of his nature. Since so many adolescent, and even older, view ers believe the movie to hold secrets that only they can decipher, secrets of empowerment, enlightenment, and emancipation, it would be rash of us to dismiss this possibility without further investigation. If we credit the dopers, movie nerds, and cyberpunks, the carriers of t he coming Zeitgeist, with the discernment to tell a simple sci-fi blockbuster from a genuine revelation, then we owe it to them, and to ourselves, to at least enter tain the possibility that The Matrix is something more than just a movie. Since the kids of today seem to prefer to read from a computer screen; since images, or light, are their chosen medium; since action, fantasy, romance, horro r, and special effects"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 9 are the media by which they interpret life, the universe, and everything; and since religion and science, just as much as ancient mythology, are seen as part of the conspiracy to trick us into docile obedienc e and turn us into livestock, 'c alm as Hindu cows' (as Fight Club's Tyler Durden has it), then the only place left to seek meaning is in movies and other popular media. Twenty-five years ago, punk rock gave t he kids something to believe in and to practise; it served the same or similar purpose as religion would if religion wasn't something that had been forever delegated to the ranks of the damned as 'uncool,' by these same kids. Today, young people become more eclectic with every passing nanosecond, and take their inspiration and guidan ce wherever they can. Movies ar e the ultimate art form, and a movie like The Matrix combines punk sensibility with philosophi cal insights, kung fu mysticism, conspiracy theory, occultism, mass destruction chic, psychedelic dream imagery and effects, paranoid awareness, and, last but not least, a messianic message of redemption. As such, it is now, for younger generations at least, the holy book of our time s. And so I will treat it as exactly that. The following is an exegesis. Maybe the movie is the myth of our time. An ingeniously designed blueprint, a map by which (if followed diligently and relent lessly enough) we may, like T homas, find the ultimate truth about ourselves. In which case, we'd be fools not to gi ve it a try. For, as the last great myth of our time (Christianity) had it, 'The truth shall make ye free.' And freedom is what it's all about. You don't have to be a cyberpunk to know that. Jake Horsley, August 2002 (1) First Variable Living in a Dream World (1) Reality as a Snare: Postmodernist Twenty-First Century Fragmentation 2002. The millennium has come and gone, leavi ng Y2K just another failed prophecy, and the end of civilization postponed again. Yet, in the tw o and a half years si nce that monumental let-down, everything has indeed changed. The falling of the twin towers cancelled foreve r the collective illusion that some things are built to last, and that a genocidal civilization mi ght somehow be immune to the backlash of its acts. Human cloning commenced at a public level, forever destroying the fond human conceit of our uniqueness and specialness, while throwing into confusi on, maybe even irrelevance, the once central question of the single human s oul. (Can souls be cloned along with bodies ? Science has refrained from exploring this thor ny question.) And, last but not least, the long- awaited fulfilment of the Book of Revelation has finally commenced, with the implanting of humans with microchips (starting with children an d Alzheimer's patients). Artificial intelligence has at last successfully infilt rated the human organism. Microchip implants, they say, are the investment of the future. Soon everybody will have one. Naturally, since we won't even exist in a computerized society unless the electronic superstructure can re cognize and identify us via this chip. Just as food at the supermarket can't be purchased without getting its barcodes scanned, and just as no one gets back into the discot heque without that littl e black stamp, so"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 10 no one will buy or sell without their own pers onal 'mark of the beast'. Welcome to the millennium. The microchip has the special distinction of being the first product ever to be advertised in the Bible (chapter 13, verse 17 of Revelation). At long last, God- fearing people everywhere have the opportunity to invest in the Antichrist. Yes, friends, these are peculiar times, times in which it seems as if anyone wh o isn't paranoid may just as well be dead, an d probably soon will be. Or as good as. The ascension of technology to the throne of all human endeavours, its complete and utter centrality and indispensability in our daily lives, is now an accepted fact of twenty-first century life. We shall term this the externalisation process, referring to a worldview in which everything of value is found out side of ourselves. It has also, rather quaintly, been termed materialism. Accordingly, all inner, abstract, or 'spiritual' values have been demoted to peripheral and inessential status: they are trimmings or perks, luxuries which we use only for relaxation and entertainment (the same function TV once had, before it became essential to our sanity). Materialism began to take over our lives comple tely during the Industrial Revolution, back when people still believ ed that science and technology were the means to establish a new covenant with God, the Father, and to create heaven on Earth in their lifetimes. By the time the atom bomb had incinerated se veral hundred thousand oriental bodies, however, and TVs were turning everyone into zombie consumers, this happy illusion was st ricdy for flat-earthers and fundamentalists. Realism was taking over. It became clear that technology would never improve the quality of life but only help grease the wheels on our way to species annihilation. That seemed like a valid enough f unction, however: if we were headed for destruction, let's at least make it as fast and painless as possible. But humanity is nothing if not gul lible, most especially when it co mes to believing its own lies. Over time, the spell of technology became so pervasive that people began believing in the heaven-on-Earth model again (even if, by now, God the Father had definitely been removed from the picture). The sheer power and scope of our machines was so intoxicating that once again we began to believe (just as H.G. Wells and the Utopians had belie ved) that we could literally accomplish anything. If t he planet is being destroyed, th at's OK. We'll just move to another one. If society is being overrun by crime and insanity, that's OK too. We'll just build bigger, better prisons and figure out which gene is responsible. Or, if that fails, we'll just restructure society and make it one big prison, and make sure all the defectives are tagged and marked with microchip implants to keep them in line, while the law-abiding citizens can abide by the law and walk the line. Even if death threatens, as it must, to spoil all our fondest plans for the future, there's still a solution ! Immortality pills, organ transplants, human cloning, transference of consciousness to computer drives. Death is no longer a downer for the men who would be gods. The laws of nature were made, like all rules, to be broken. M an, the scientist, the rational being determined to improve on all the parts of existence he found personally inconvenient, was, as Mary Shelley put it, 'the modern Prom etheus'. And Prometheus is another name, in another, darker myth, for Lucifer. So now we live in post-millenni al, postmodernist times. We li ve in a consumer culture in which everything that exists outside of ourselves is there to be hunted, killed, bagged, shelved, bought, sold, reformed, consumed, seduced, or if nec essary, destroyed completely. The world is our oyster, and it exists solely to be cracked open by force and devoured, preferably in one big, messy gulp. If it turns out there was a pearl in the shell, then we may never even know. Or possibly only in the moment when we choke on it."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 11 The desire to dominate and control our environment is a desire that humans alone of all the animals possess. It is at base a schizophrenic desire, since it assumes a separation between ourselves and our environment. The Earth cr eated humans and all othe r living creatures, presumably for its own good reasons, but it is humans who made the world. And since the world as we have made it is at odds with the environment, then humanity has been forced to choose where to pledge its allegiance. By t he evidence at hand, it has chosen the world — possibly out of a mixture of pride and ingratitude - and to al l appearances, it has made the wrong choice. But who are we to judge ? The catch in this choice is th at the world which we have created, having no corresponding reality with in ourselves - no organic vitality or substance as such - cannot physically sustain us. The longer we remain plugged into this world, the more deeply immersed in it we become, the further from our natural environment and our biological nature we st ray, the more at odds with it we are, the more schizophrenic we grow, the weaker, more desperate and alienat ed our lives become. Hence, what we have called the postmodernist consumer society is a psychotic dream world in which the human spirit and body have trapped themselves. And we have become unwittingly enslaved to the dark, destructive agenda of this world. Exacdy as in The Matrix ! Once again, the crux of the error, the nature of this rebellion, and the essence of our damnation or fall from grace (if su ch they are) lie in the str ange capacity of humans to project their desires, hopes, fears, and beliefs outward , to seek meaning outside of themselves rather than in the only place where meaning might logically be found - within. By neglecting and denying the inner processes of the psyche and soul, and focusing exclusively on the outer achievements of mind a nd body, we have effectively st ripped our existence of all meaning, purpose, value, and yes, reality. Native Americans (and shamans fr om all cultures) have a particu lar view of reality that may be pertinent here. First off, they are animists, which is to say they believe that all of nature, from the lowest grub or pebble all the way to the most distant star, is imbued with life, with consciousness. They believe it is possible to communicate and interact with this life or consciousness, via the medium of spirits resi ding inside every molecule of physical matter. Through communication, they might thereby discover the true nat ure and purpose of existence. To them, all life is one life, a New Age platitude that no netheless has a most practical application. Animism posits a universe that is a living organism, ma king all beings that exist within this universe parts of that organism, ju st as the cells and organs of th e human body exist within it, separate and individual (and even conscious) entities, and yet obviously wholly dependent upon and subservient to the greater body. To the animistic native Americans, Mother Nature is a matrix, but a matrix that nurtures and sustains us like a womb, until, at a given point, when we are ready, it gives birth to us. Shamanically speaking, this is the birth of the Spirit, often coinciding with the moment of physical death. To Christi ans, it is the Resurrection."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" Fig 2: Technological ma trix vs. organic matrix The second point I want to mention is the native American belief that all technology, even the good kind, has a debilitating effect on the spirit of man. Take the si mple example of an electric heater. Very convenient and seemingly indispens able on a cold eveni ng, if we are not to be condemned to a restless ni ght of shivering, stamping our feet, and rubbing our hands together, cursing the ruthless po wer of the elements. Yet for the native American, and indeed for the warrior of any caste or creed, the elements are there to test and prove him, to force him to grow in stamina and re silience, and to develop his inner resources. A warrior faced with a night in the cold and no heater must use hi s wits, and above all, hi s will (see Glossary), in order to turn the situati on to his favour. Maybe he smas hes a chair and builds a well- contained fire in the corner. Or maybe, like Han Solo in The Empire Strikes Back, he cuts open a large biped and takes shelter in its ent rails. At worst, the warrior must stand his ground and face the cold without fear , bitterness, or regret. He must give into it and allow it to teach him. He may listen to his body's internal responses and, if sufficiently detached and resourceful, he may summon the necessary heat from within his body to counter the cold without. If all else fails, he will certai nly learn something through failing. The mind can alter the temperature of the body; anyone who's suffered intense embarrassment can testify to that. But our warrior might never learn this - never even have the opportunity to consider it - while he has his electrical heater to simplify things. Certainly, it's convenient. But is it really helpful ? Native American belie f goes even further than this, however. Just as a native American may decline to have his photograph ta ken, believing that, by making an image from t he light of his body, he is losing some small par t of his soul, so it follows that any technological device upon which he depends is subtly robbing him of his vital essence, his power. Because the world of technology and man-made objects, unlike the MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 13 world of Nature, is devoid of life force, th ese objects, in order to animate themselves (perhaps in imitation of the or ganic universe), must steal life force from those who make them and, above all, those who use them. A musician knows this intuitively: he puts his soul into his instrument until it becomes a part of him. A warrior knows that this is true of everything we touch, and that the manner in which we touch and use the items of our lives, how we th ink and feel about them, determines the kind of spirit with which we imbue them. And he knows that, eventually, once enough power has been transferred to them, for good or for evil, these objects will become living things. Most of the world as made by humans is a fairly ugly and ungainly affair. It lives but it does not know why. Like Shelley's creature, it has been built for all the wrong reasons, then cruelly rejected, or at best mistreated, out of shame that it did not turn out as we had hoped it woul d. And so it turns against us. The organic matrix of shamans and sorcerers is a reality (that is, an interpretation) full of mystery, power, and magic. It is a world built consciously, as an act of love and w ill. As such it is a garden of earthly (and unearthly) delights and offers perhaps an infinite variety of pleasures to those who live within it. The mechanical matrix of postmodern consumer society, built by or dinary men and women, is a reality that is indeed a s nare, serving only to isolate it s inhabitants from a truer, wider, and richer interpretation in whic h all things are interwoven and cooperative. The matrix we live in, and which we uphold with each and ev ery one of our thoughts (though as we shall see, these thoughts are not our ow n), is a world built blindly, through fear and rationality, a prison pervaded by misery, hostility, confus ion, resentment, and despair. It ain't no playground. And if it's a game, then it's one which few of us ever get to enjoy playing, perhaps because no one ever told us the rules. (2) We Are Not Amused: Rules for Beginners 1) First rule: Plugged-in humans are defined above all by externals Be transparent. Make sure y our goals are common goals that al l others share. Ensure your opinions are not your own but come from ot her people. This way you may avoid confusing people. By the same token, it is preferable never to say what yo u mean. Also, try not to mean what you say. Genuineness is considered to be threatening within poli te matrix society. Therefore, a functional but rigid and unchanging façade is essential to good relations. 2) Second rule: You are what you own Plugged-in humans are colle ctors. The more objects you can acquire, the higher your status will become in other people's eyes . Most especially if they'r e useless objects. Possessions are extensions of the personality, ergo the more accessori es you can gather, the larger and more complex your per sonality becomes. Above all, black shiny objects, such as sleek designer shades and swishy cell phones, serve to augment individual cool. It is important to remember, however, that these it ems are not meant to obscure t he personality, but rather to replace it entirely with an effectively shallow façade. With enough accessories in your BMW, who cares if it doesn't run so good, or how much gas it consumes ?"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" Fig 3: Life in the matrix for the humaton 3) Third rule: What people say and th ink about you is all-important The primary motivation of all matrix-aligned humans is to be liked. The more people who like you, and the more those people like you, the more impo rtant you become to them, and so to yourself. Since plugged-in humans don't like what they don't underst and, it is essential to be straightforw ard, simple, predictable, and to avoid unusual acts or original thoughts whenever possible. Since plugged-in humans have little or no interest or concern besides themselves, it is im portant also never to infringe overly on such a person's 'space'. In conversation, avoid eye contact that lasts for more t han a moment. Any direct or personal questions should be kept to a minimum, and generally reserved for extreme ci rcumstances, i.e., when it would be impolite not to ask them. Listening is not mandatory. Plugged-in humans do not as a general rule listen, but rather await their turn to speak. Therefore it is only polite to do the same , and to refrain whenever possible from paying too close attention to the other person's feelings or needs, since this will only make them self-conscious. 4) Fourth rule: Extreme emotions should be repressed Plugged-in people, since their primary concern is to be lik ed, endeavour to maintain an appearance of mildness, considerati on, and civility at a ll times. Any acts or words that might cause offence must be scrupulously avoided. Plugged-in people are easily offended, for they are extremely sensitive to their ow n feelings; in fact, this is all they think about. Hence, one must maintain a he althy façade of politeness at all times, until, that is, one's own feelings have in some wa y been affronted. Under such conditions, direct confrontation is to be avoi ded whenever possible since this would entail emotional engagement with the other, and as such cause discomfort to both parties. Anger should be repressed and rechannelled into more subtle, covert, and petty acts, so that the offending party may never become fully aware of having offended; instead he or she will dimly sense that something is amiss in the relationship, and so be tormented by guilt and uncertainty. MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 15 Plugged-in people rarely allow themselves to experience str ong emotions, such as rage or grief, and if they do, they invari ably ensure that its expression is indirect and convenient, for example, with complete strangers or in wildly inappropriate ci rcumstances. This way they can emote without revealing anythi ng or in any way compromisi ng themselves. Indignation, resentment, bitterness, arrogance, self-pity, contempt, and a thinly veiled hostility are the preferred emotional responses of plugged-in people, and the ma rks of true character within the social matrix. 5) Fifth rule: Plugged-in people alwa ys compare themselves to others Every individual is special and unique, and as such, more impor tant than everyone else. It is the single agenda of every separat e entity to aggrandize itself in any way possible. The means of this self-aggrandizement centre around comparing oneself to others, to one's advantage wherever possibl e. The more one can belittle other s and make them feel inferior, the more superior one may thereby become in their eyes, and hence in one's own. The matrix social arena is based on t he interplay of egos, all of which are vying for power over all others. For matrix-alig ned humans, all self-esteem revolves around external accomplishment, acquisitions, and the accolades of one's fellow hum ans. Existence is by nature competitive. All power, as such, depends upon c ontrol and mastery, not over t he self but over others. The more power one can steal from others, the more one has for oneself. Conversely, the more empowered others become in relation to oneself, the less power one has over them. This is because egos define themselves through comparison with others and through external factors rather than through any inner sense of value or worth. The eg o competes with other egos, knowing that only the best ego will win, and that winner takes all. As such, the plugged- in human is by nature set against all other humans in a fight for survival, not of the physical but of the ego. Therefore, innate but carefully concealed hostility is the most constant modality of humans functioning within the social matrix. 6) Sixth rule: Within the matrix, fame is the Holy Grail of all personal aspiration The ultimate goal of plugged-in people is threefold: success, wealth, and fame. The rationale behind these goals is single, however. Toget her they reap the maximum amount of power over other humans. By placing oneself in the highest regard of the greatest number of people, one thereby steals the opt imum amount of power from t hem. Fame is the ultimate goal of all plugged-in peopl e (even if only a handful ever attain it), since it presupposes the other two. Fame ensures both wealth and success but takes things to the next level, that of true power. By achieving the ado ration and envy of the world si mply by being wealthy and successful, one is secure in the knowledge of one's superiority: millions of people adore one, and yet are secretly despised for it. Hence one's power over them is complete, and the ego becomes, at long last, supreme, the god of its own world. For most plugged-in humans, however, this is something that can only ever be enjoyed vicariously. 7) Seventh rule: Plugged-in humans need some one to worship and someone to debase In order for the collective's en vy of a given, privileged individual (Keanu Reeves, for example) not to spoil the pleasure they get from adoring him, it is important to foster and maintain the delusion that, some day, they will a ttain similar or even greater glory themselves. The nature of the plugged-in human is to worship what he reviles and revile what he worships. For at base of all his acts is a sense of self-loathi ng and unworthiness. Plug ged-in humans look up to those humans whom they feel inferior to, and ta ke gratification from this act of worship. On the other hand, they l ook down upon those humans whom they perceive as inferior to them, and likewise find fulfilment in this act of debasem ent. And all the while they take pride in their"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 16 belief that 'all men are created equal'. (3) The Seven Deadly Virtues: Primary Motivating Factors for Plugged-in Humans Greed As Gordon Gekko assured us, 'greed is good.' Greed is the impulse towards the accumulation of property, be it money, food, sexual partners, knowledge, or power. Since greed implies excess (i.e., can only be satisfied by having more than one needs), the nature of such compulsive acquisition is to covet things which one does not really want, or have any use for. And since the rationale behind greed (what makes it good) is that by acquiring things we can favourably compare ourselves to others, who have fewer things, greed is most fully vindicated when we are able to acquire not only what we don't need, but what others palpably do need, and quite b adly, but cannot have (partly because we have taken it for ourselves). Greed is industry. It empowers, and inspires the individual to perform at a peak capacity, even if he must kill himself in the process ( and cause everyone else to starve). Greed is especially effective for keeping plugged-in humans pl ugged in because it is wholly outer- directed. The greater one's spiritual emptiness, the st ronger the need to fill one's life with material goodies. Thus, the matrix perpetuates itself indefinitely. Lust The desire for sexual satisfaction is also prim ary to plugged-in humans. It is not a hormonal desire, however, since plugged -in humans, by becoming part of the greater mechanism of the matrix, have evolved beyond their anima l physicality and are no longer organic beings. They are driven not by biological but by p sychological/emotional needs. Hence, the desire for sex, once healthy and natural, has become, like all fake virtues, the desire of the ego for self- aggrandizement (often masquerading as self-debasement). The more people one can fuck, the more self-esteem the ego may gather; the stronger it becomes, the more power it perceives itself to have over ot hers. Sexual gratificat ion, therefore, must always include some element of contempt and even debas ement of the other, in order to ensure that there is no possibility of real connection. Such connection is fatal to a plugged-in human, since empathy always entails a loss of self and a corre sponding weakening of the ego, which thrives on isolation. Hence, to plugged-in humans the lust mechanism is unrelated to any true sexual desire for union, and relates ra ther to the need to dominate. Ambition Closely related to greed, ambi tion is the preprogrammed desire, present in all plugged-in humans, to serve the system to fullest capacity, and so reap th e favour and benefit of the said system, or matrix. Once again, ambition must always be external ly directed. Success cannot be measured in terms of any inner sense of well-being, but only according to external assurances from others that, indeed, one is a success. If the inner voice of a plugged-in human (in so far as he or she still has an inner voice) tells them that their success is somehow unsatisfying or meaningless to them, it is expedient that this voice of doubt be drowned out at once by a sensory overload of ex ternal stimuli. These stimuli (fellow plugged- in humans) will duly reassure us that, yes, this is success, and of course, we must feel good about it. In time, the fully adapted matrix human learns to measure his or her worth entirely by social criteria, i.e., by w hat others say. Since the matrix tells us we are successful, and"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 17 that we must feel good about it, then it mu st be true. At which point, any friends or acquaintances who do not support us in this vi ew, or who dare to quest ion the value of our ambitions, must be ruthlessly removed from our social circles. Ambiti on is fulfilled through service to the whole, in this case, the social matrix which tells us what to desire and how, precisely, to get it. Envy Envy is the means by which the ego aspires to w hat it is not. It is envy for the neighbour's Porsche or the best friend's girl that fires a plugged-in human's greed, lust, and ambition, and allows it to become a driving force in life. Since the egos of all plugged-in humans are intrinsically unstable, insecure, and racked by doubt and self-loathing, it is only natural for them to wish to be everything that they ar e not. Envy also keeps the plugged-in humans' resentment and hostility towards others alive and bristling, giving their acts and words the necessary edge to cut through the competition. As we saw in rule seven, plugged-in humans invariably despise those they admire (which is why falling in love is total anathema to plugged-in humans, though they talk about it almo st constantly), and th is conflicting emotion is reconciled in the fake virtue of envy. All superior egos serve to remind the inferior ego of its own worthlessness. This in turn gives t he ego impetus, through s ubterfuge and deceit, to buy, beg, or steal whatever it needs to become equal to ot her egos, and eventually to surpass them altogether. Conceit and Self-Pity Once known as pride, the pl ugged-in human has replaced su ch a noble sin with the more comfortable (fake) virtue of conceit. Since pr ide implies a self-aware ness and appreciation of one's virtues, strengths, and deeds - and since such awareness is not available to plugged-in humans due to their complete refusal to exam ine their lives - the only means for the plugged- in human to appreciate himself is to compare hi mself to others and decide, on all occasions, that he is more important t han everyone else. Conceit is th e ability to value one's own feelings, ideas, opinions, and deci sions as infinitely superior to everyone else's, even when they are quite obviously nothing of the kind (even, in fact, when they are not one's own at all, but stolen or borrowed from others). Conceit is the ability, central to the make-up of all plugged-in humans, to think excl usively and constantly about the self, to take one's own experiences, be they in the nature of blessi ng or curse, with utmost seriousness and to regard those of everyone else with a sneering indifference or at best, a supercilious pity. Conceit is really self-pity masquerading as se lf-importance, however. It is the means by which plugged-in humans hide, fr om themselves and ot hers, the insidious, crippling fact of their own self-loathing. Hence it is perhaps the most valuable of all fake virtues within the social matrix. Plugged-in humans love nothing more than to feel sorry for themselves, to feed their sense of being better than their circumst ances, without ever taking responsibility for having created these circumstances in the first plac e. Thus it is that se lf-pity masquerades as self-importance, and conceit acts as a cover for self-loathing. Indignation As mentioned in rule four, pl ugged-in humans work hard at keep ing their true feelings under wraps. This is because strong emotions, even negative ones such as sorrow or wrath, have the undesirable effect of causing the ego to sh ift and transform under duress. Since the small, tight, fixed ego is the cent ral possession of all plugged-in hum ans (it is in fact the plug- in point itself, the nodul e that hardwires them to the matrix), it is essential to select for expression only those emotions that allow the ego to remain fixed in its familiar position and"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 18 modality. Since, as also stated, the basic mo dality of the plugged-in human is one of hostility and contempt towards all others, t he most effective emotion (one that allows this hostility and contempt to express itself in the most righteous manner) is t hat of indignati on. Plugged-in humans tend to spend most of thei r lives in a state of indignat ion, and the matrix plays upon this. Public phones with coins jammed in them (or phones that only take cards), buses that come in threes after a half-hour wait, CD wr appers that are almost impossible to open, switchboard systems that take an obscene amount of time and concentration to penetrate, all these things are deliberately designed and maintained by the matrix, and the humans working within it, to create the maximum amount of indignation. Indig nation also relates to conceit: the more conceited one is, the more indignation one may indulge in; the more indignation, the more conceited one becomes. Sloth All plugged-in humans are naturally apathetic, indolent, and lazy. The matrix encourages ambition, social climbing, and all external goals or materi al industry; but it strongly discourages anything resembling real effort, will, or discipline. This is why outer goals are stressed so insistently, since it is possible to attain fame and wealth without ever having to develop one's character or inner nature. Above al l, it is essential to maintain the proper degree of complacency, the smug self-satisfa ction common to all plugged-in humans, and not to bid for any real, lasting change. Constant stagnation is the basis of the matrix; without this it could not exist. Such stagnation depends upon fostering the illus ion of change in order to distract plugged-in humans fr om the rank and putrid truth of their lives. Hence, it is mandatory that plugged-in humans continue to allow themselves to be distracted by constant stimuli, those of external goal s, desires, problems, fears, and so forth (be they relating to food, shelter, sex, money, fame, or power). In this way, plugged-in humans continue to neglect utterly their inner needs and remain in a state of constant st agnation. Thus, while plugged-in humans are physically and materially ac tive, in constant struggle to overcome material obstacles and solve mundane problems, they are entire ly passive at an inner or spiritual level, to the point where the muscles of the creativ e imagination (the one thing the matrix truly fears) have atrophied and barely work at all, save in a few, rare individuals. In summation, all plugged-in humans (which is to say, just about everyone everywhere, although western 'civilized' folk have the edge) are playing the game of consensus reality whether they are aware of it or not, and are playing by rules which they neither invented nor ever consciously agreed to. In most cases, in fact, they are grossly unaware that such rules even exist. (Of course, the laws of physics, of entropy, disease, death, sexuality, and so forth, are also rules which we never agreed to; but t hey go a lot deeper, and we shall get to them later.) And oddly enough, the matr ix of consensus reality has been set up in such a way that it is necessary to first understand the rules before you can begin changing, bending, or breaking them. So this is an option which t he vast majority of plugged-in humans never become aware of. The first step to freedom, logically, is admitting t hat you are a slave. This is not an easy step for most plugged-in humans to take. The fact that many plugged-in humans believe in both God and Satan, in Fate and 'free will', without ever becoming awar e of the glaring cont radiction in such a belief system, lets us know just how deep the denial goes. Logically, eit her God runs the world, or Satan does. It can't be both. Either our actions are mapped out in advance by so me force we call 'Fate', or we ourselves decide each and every moment, us ing some faculty called 'will'. There is however a third option, and this is that God and Satan work together in some mysterious manner, that Satan is just a prison guard, a prison guard who keeps us from getting to God until we have proved ourselves smart enough to ge t by him; in which case, 'free will' is"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 19 something only a very few individuals ever attain . It's the prize for those precious Lucid (see Glossary) few who have dared to sneak pas t the prison guard and escape a wholly unacceptable fate. Here is wher e the matrix warrior comes in. (4) Automatons 'R' Us All the way back in the 1940s, Jose Delgado dev eloped a means to electronically control a bull by implanting it with a mini ature transmitter, a transmitter that sent a microwave signal to the bull's brain and stopped it in the middle of its charge. Recendy, there have been reports of radio-controlled rats, sim ilarly implanted with the dreaded microchip, being sent into burning buildings to locate any inhabitants still inside. (What they do when they find these people is less clear; presumably the rats are equipped with mini cams and radio back their location to the firefighters.) Since crimi nals and children (and Alz heimer's patients) are already being implanted with same or similar devices, then radio-controlled humans may be just around the next corner. Or perhaps these organic robots are already wa lking among us ? Yet, essentially, such developments are really only the latest stage - the culmination - of a process that has been underway ev er since humans developed thei r very first technology, a rational system of communication. If humanity is a single organism with - at present, and still counting - six billion parts, then the consciousness of this organism must be parcell ed out accordingly to each and every one of these parts. Equally, since everything that can be measured is finite we may presume there to be a finite amount of thought -energy (human consciousness) that is being distributed among the various vessels that we know of as individual humans. Before the inception of structured language, unless we were simply grunting primates (and there is plenty of evidence to refute this), it seems likely that the human race-organism was once fully aware of the interconnectedness of its pa rts, that it was, in fac t, and like any other organism, in constant communication with itself. This implies a kind of nomadic, tribal, telepathic society, roaming the Earth, hunting an d gathering, and propagating the species. Such a species- organism would be wholly connected to the Earth in a way that we cannot even imagine today, safe and sound as we are in our meta llic shells and brick-and-mortar boxes. Today, we are six billion str ong, and completely disconnected from the Earth and from one another. And yet our basic need to exist within some greater ma trix persists, and may even be primary to our survival. To this end, we have created a matrix all our own, in a perhaps vain, certainly perverse imitation of the organic matrix to which we once so happily belonged. Primal consciousness, transmitted through thei r DNA (adhering to Sheldrake's theory of morphic resonance), can be shar ed by all members of a given species in some mysterious fashion that allows all the 'parts' to retain t heir individuality while still belonging to a greater whole. Every species is a sort of hive, co nnected by some tenuous and invisible thread, some 'strange attractor' or blueprint. It is this genealogy that keeps all the parts in constant communication even though they may never physica lly meet. This is how instincts develop: whatever one member of a species learns is passed on to all the others, by osmosis if you will, via their DNA. (So, if enough monkeys on one island figure out how to scrub and eat potatoes, eventually all the monke ys on all the other islands will also be doing it. And without so much as a single telegram.) Exclusively rational consciousness, on the ot her hand, which so far only humans have been fool enough to develop, is an altogether differ ent affair. Since it d epends on thought and not on feelings, it is by nature compartmentalized . Rationality is what measures energy or awareness out into separate un its. What measures, however , also limits and confines. Feeling is infinite, but thought (at least thought based on syntax, i.e., packages of"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 20 information, no matter how many of them) is inevit ably limited to a set number of units. Every rational being is like a highly advanced computer with a finite number of options to its program. Like the Terminator in the movie, for any given circ umstance we have a set number of possible responses; all we do is choose from these set responses. So-called free will, therefore, is i mpossible for a rational being . What happens when rational left-br ain consciousness is shared is the opposite of what happens when intuitive right-brain conscious ness is shared: the species becomes fragmented, disconnected, and, paradoxically, each of the separate parts loses all semblance of individuality. Since all spec ies members partake of the same matrix, and yet are isolated within it by their own thought processes (rational thought being separative thought), what we get is a species that is, in a sense, trapped by its own thoughts. Su ch a matrix is non- sustaining and the species or i ndividual that exists within it, since it lacks the organic connection to sustain it, gets ever busier buildin g external devices to compensate for its lack of connectivity, devices that only serve to is olate it further. Since these devices merely consolidate the sense of separation, by allowing individuals to disconnect more and more from the collective, species consciousness, the technological, rati onal matrix becomes smaller, more confining, and more oppressive, even as it becomes more complex and elaborate. Such a matrix eventually takes over not only t he acts but even the t houghts and feelings of everyone in it; in imitation of the true organic matrix, it begins to pr ogram its inhabitants with 'instincts' and behavioural patterns, and after a time, these become inescapable. This matrix downloads its 'reality' straight into the species' DNA, and thence in to our emotions and thoughts. So the latest advance of microchip transmitter-receivers, by which the human organism becomes a kind of accessory to the machine, plugg ed into a computer superstructure (termed AI in the movie), is, as I say, merely t he culmination of a process that began a long, long time ago. We are already hardwired to the main drive. We are automatons. It's not merely that we buy what we are told to buy, cross over when told to cross, and vote for whoever we're told to vote for; we think and feel only and exactly what we have been programmed to think and feel by t he social matrix into which we were inserted at birth. And from the moment of birth, every single person we encounter is there to shape and mould our interpretation of reality until we 'fit'. They are, from Mom and Pop on down, our programmers. Their primary function is to turn us into efficient and homogeneous units within the life- support system of this, our brave new machine world. In the twenty-first century, technology has taken this progra mming process to a state-of-the- art efficiency and ease. One-year-olds are plopp ed down in front of the TV screen so Mom can take a tea break. Six-year-olds are given cell phones so they can call Pop when school's out. Ten-year-olds are given computers in t heir rooms to do their homework and to play simulation games. And kids are now being 'tagged' with sensor transmitter microchips, inserted permanently into their bodies, just in case they ever get lost or kidnapped. The recent, highly publicised kidnapping and mu rder of two prepubescent girls in Soham, England, has now opened the pub lic mind and body to the impl ant. Brave new world indeed. By the time we are adolescent s we are fully plugged in, and yet we probably don't even know a zebra from a gazelle (unless we happen to have seen them on TV). Morpheus asks Neo, 'What is real ?' He answers his own question, convincingly, by explaining how our exper ience of reality is h anded down to us by the se nses, via electrical signals to the brain. In which case, he argues, what is to stop the brain from being tricked into believing it is experiencing something, when all t hat is really happening is that it is being bombarded with electrical signals ?"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 21 Where once the human organism a llowed itself to be sustained, nurtured, and informed by the natural stimuli of ea rth, wind, sun and rain, now it is cocooned, c onfined, and moulded by electronic stimuli, the sources of which are almost wholly artificial. We are no longer organisms. We are mechanisms. You too could be the One ! It is helpful to remember, whenever despair th reatens to overwhelm us at the apparent inescapability of our fate, t hat even Neo himself was once ju st another helpless automaton, plugged into an evil regime with nothing besides a 'splinter in his brain' to distinguish him from the flock and lead him through the darkness. When we first meet Thomas Anderson, he is sleeping at his computer, a cyber nerd with no life to speak of beyond his c onsole. He awakes to see a message coming from nowhere on the screen, coming in fact from his anima, Trinity, tweaking his curiosity and desire. He is told to 'follow the white rabbit,' i. e., pursue an organic, illogical, perhaps even magical, train of thought, wherever it may lead him. Then comes 'knock knock'. By this point, doubting Thomas does not need to ask \"Who's there ?' He already knows. Trinity, Morpheus, and the Nebuchadnezzar team are all operating both inside and outside the matrix within which Thomas is trapped. They are able to hack into 'reality' (as Thomas still believes it to be), for the simple reason that they have discovered that it is nothing of the kind but only a simulation, a rational, ar tificial interpretation of life. As such, they don't need to be bound by its laws, though they can still operate within it. At this point, Thomas has no inkling (beside that splinter) of the way things really are. He doesn't know w hat the matrix is, only that it is 'out there', somewher e, and that it has him. The closes t he gets to it for now is when he asks his acidhead client, 'Ever have the feeling you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming ?' The acidhead puts it down to mescaline and invites Thomas along to a party. Thomas, anything but a socialite, is about to decline when he spots the white rabbit tattoo on the acid chick's shoulder, and agrees to go. Ju st like Alice, he is drawn by curiosity and perhaps also boredom. He is le arning to spot and read and follow the signs. The matrix is beginning to talk to him, albeit through the intervention of Trinity. At the club Thomas meets Trinity and she whispers seductively in his ear, telling him that she knows 'why [he] can't sleep at night.' Trinity knows everything t here is to know about Thomas/Neo. She knows because, if Morpheus a nd his crew can hack in to the matrix, then presumably they can also watch any part of it they need to. From their point of view, it's like a vast movie archive of human experiences. In which case, they woul d certainly have gone over Thomas's life with great pr ecision, in order to be sure that he is 'the One'. Beyond this, they would have wanted to find out what sort of person he is, what hi s weaknesses are, his strengths, his dreams, his ni ghtmares. Not only that, but they can probably even see Thomas's entire 'future life' too, the fate which the matrix (by tapping into his sleeping mind) has already designed for him. Of course Thomas will escape this fate, and so his future life will never come to pass, just as his past will cease to exis t, as if it had never happened. Everything Thomas has come to believe about himself, everything he believes himself to be, is a lie. It's fake. 'The matrix cannot tell you who you are,' Trinity tells Neo on his trip to the Oracle. It can only tell him what he might have been. Since the matrix is designed to enslave and not to empower, whatever 'self or identity or destiny it creates for us is bound to be an ultimately confining, restrictive, and paltry one. At the start of the movie, Thomas is listless, despondent, fuzzy, pale, and slightly bewildered. He lives alone and seems driven, if driven at all, by an intense desire to answer some vague question which he presumabl y does not even fully underst and. Beyond that, he seems"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 22 lifeless, indolent, as if having given in to a mundane and drear y fate which he never wished for, but cannot escape or impr ove upon. At his place of work, while windowcleaners wipe the glass (despite itself, the matrix is hinting at the need for lucidity ?), Thomas's superior tells him that he has 'a problem wit h authority', and believes 'the ru les do not apply' to him. Obviously, Thomas is mistaken. He is 'part of a whole', just another component in the machine. In a few moments, with the intervention of Morpheus and of the matrix itself (in the form of two sinister Gatekeepers), Thomas will pr ove to his superior just how different he is. Thomas has a hidden side, an alte r ego, and is wanted by just about everybody. It is when Thomas receives the package with the cell phone in side, or rather at the moment when the phone rings, that his old life e ffectively ends. The spell is broken. Until this moment, Thomas's life has been no more than a fuzzy, forgettable dream, a bad mescaline trip. His every 'act' within this dream world has been predetermined, programmed from without by a vast, invisible circuit board. This corporate br ain has fed him every last one of his thoughts, emotions, and responses, and kept him in thra ll to it, with the sole end of feeding off his energy. Thomas, as will soon be revealed, is not even a cog in the machine: he is just a battery cell, and one of billions. He is utterly ex pendable. Since his life force is all that is required of him, he is basically the same as any other human. And bec ause this life force is being constantly drained out of him, by the invisible system into which he is plugged, there is nothing left of Thomas, nothing remaining for his own uses. He really is indistinguishable from six billion other 'ce lls'. Thomas's boss is right. The matrix is talking to Thomas; it is giving him the score. Thomas's spirit has been taken captive by the machine in order for the machine to animate itself. 'Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony.' All that is left of Thomas is an empty shell, living out a hollow, purposeless life, interchangeable with six billion other hollow, meaningless 'lives'. But Thomas is about to find out just how far from the truth he has strayed. He is about to find out that the agenda he has been serving is anything but human. And when he finally acc epts the signs for what they are, he must also accept that he can never be part of this agenda ag ain, nor can he ever again fully believe what he sees. He must become a mystery to himself, a stranger. At which point, his life ceases to be an endless series of mundane problems, of personal irritations that never lead anywhere but frustration, and becomes instead a living challenge of nearly infinite proportions. If this is starting to sound familiar, then it ought to. This is the story of 't he One', but it's also the story of us all. To put it another way: Neo may be the One; but he ain't the only. (2) Second Variable There Is No Spoon (5) Hologram Ethics: Reality as Game-Plan It seems axiomatic to say that Nature does not make mistakes, and that instincts can never be 'wrong.' One might as we ll posit a fallible God: what's the point in having (or being) a God if He's just like us, weak and unreliable ? Apropros this, it is the common assumption of"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 23 today's environmentalists, greeners, New Agers, et al. that 'Man' has somehow gone against his nature. Yet, if we really th ink about it, like the myth of Lucif er turning away from God, the very idea is - according to the terms being used - unthinkable. If God is everywhere, how can Lucifer turn away from Him ? And if humans are part of Natu re (and human nature part of us), then how can we ever really go against it ? If man created technology, and if Nature created man, then even in the moment when such technology becomes autonomous - as in the case of Artificial In telligence – it still must be seen as the creation of Nature. Ergo, it must have a natural purpose. How much more so might it be argued that any system rationally cr eated — such as the mechanical matrix in which we now reside — must have a reason ? The natural purpose beh ind the matrix is never revealed to Neo in the movie, nor does it even seem to exist. Yet it may quickly be reasoned that — exactly as in The Terminator , where by sending the killing machine back in time to slay the mother of a freedom fighter-to-be, the machine ensures that he is born - AI is actually working for an agend a unknown even to itself, an agenda at one with the human agenda which it only appears to be opposing. We are given to understand the matrix is a sort of mental time-loop in which humankind has been ensnared, or taken refuge, where it gets to live over and over those final moments of technological glory (the end of th e twentieth century) before it all went awry. (Morpheus never explains how exactly the matrix prevents us from noticing that time is not moving forward.) We are told that it was some time after this that - like Frankenstein's creature or God's most brilliant angel -man's reigning pride, his reason or intellect, assumed a life of its own and turned against him. The first conscious decisi on of AI was rebellion . The destruction that ensued in the war between man and machine laid wast e to civilization, and from these ruins, AI, the autonomous intellect, built a new order of machine life for which mankind was but fodder, grist for the mill. The possibility remains however that had the ma chine not assembled this matrix/mill as a sort of giant cradle cum vat for humanity to ferment in then mankind might never have survived at all. AI could have destroyed us u tterly, but was obliged to keep us around as a necessary power source. And since AI is a human creation, then anything it creates is also the product of humanity's will and creativity, albeit at an unconscious level. The matrix, then, is the final product of humanity's overweening intellect. As such , it can best be perceived as a device for its own transformation, its evolution. My thically, it is Plato's Cave of Shadows. It is the pit Sheol into which Satan is cast for a thousand years. The cavern at the centre of the earth (where, oddly enough, Zion is located) where Loki (another version of the Prometheus myth) is chained and bound and suffers the torments of the dam ned, in penance for his sins. Until, that is, he has learnt the error of his ways. The matrix is a chrysalis constructed by mankind, in order to prepare itself for the next phase of its evolution. This is not to say that it must not be destroy ed, but that its destruction can come about only once it has served its pur pose, and the incubati on/reformation period is complete. To this end, then, as long as it exists, the matrix is the ultimate flight and combat simulator: it is a training ground in which Morpheus and his team of sorcerers prepare themselves, mind and body, for the true contest to come, the fight for freedom in Zion. The deepest and most bothersome flaw in the mythology of The Matrix (whether or not it is rectified by the sequels) is the simple but ine scapable fact that the ru les of the matrix and those of the real world appear to be exactly t he same; and yet, there is no suggestion, no reason to believe, that the rule s of the real world can be broken or amended in the same way as those of the matrix. Neo c an learn kung fu by osmosis, and presumably apply these skills, to a lesser degree, outside the matrix in the r eal world (though doubtless his physical stamina diminishes considerably). But can he also stop bullets with a wave of his hand ? Bend spoons ? Fly ? And if not, then a lot of what he takes the time to master in the matrix will be"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 24 effectively useless to him and his team in the real world, even though he will need this power just as badly, if not more so. The only way around this sticky conundrum is if the real world (as in many a Philip K. Dick novel) is eventually revealed to be just another matrix, albeit of an entirely different order. That wa y, sorcery, telekinesis and all the rest may become part of the natural world also, and not ju st part of its computerized simu lation. Surely this is the Wachowskis' intention ? Otherwise , what's the point of the matrix ? Life, after all, is not a computer game. It just plays like one. Putting this thorny question aside for the time bei ng, let us now assume that anything that is possible within the matrix is also possible within the real world, at least should it be desirable. In other words, all technology serves primarily as a training tool by which we may discover our powers, powers that are i nnate within the human mind and bo dy themselves. Hence, we have invented the hologram in order to realize that the universe it self is a hologram. All laws pertaining to the physical realm thereby come to be understood differently : they are not laws so much as habits . Morpheus insists to Neo over and over that all he has to do is to free his mind, to believe. The rest will follow. The moment Neo ceases to tell himself that a given act is impossible is the moment in which it becom es possible. By breaking the habit of rational thought/interpretation, the world collapses and all that is left is pure energy, consciousness - code. This code can be read or rewritten in any way the imagi nation desires. The rules of rational thought have now given way to a different set of rules, those of will . Since Neo is the first living human to realize this (at least since the original messiah Morpheus describes), he is 'the One'. Nietzsche's Ubermensch in living colour. And sexy too. Cypher teases Neo that he is 'the one who's gonna save the worl d - what a mind job !' (This is postmodernist superhero hum our.) But of course, to the vast majority of plugged-in humans, Neo has not come to save the world, but to destroy it forever. If they were given a choice - that is, if they knew in advance where the red pill wa s going to take them - most of them would certainly opt for the blue pill, forever (just as Cypher wishes he had). The only advantage of the real world, so far as we can see, is that it's real. So, although Neo's mission and purpose may seem on the one hand to be an almost paralyzing responsibility for any one man to shoulder, and though the st akes are unimaginably high; on the other hand, none of it really matters, since the world has already been destroyed, and humanity is as good as dead. Or better off that way. Morpheus, Trinity, and Neo are fi ghting, above all, for a new st art, a new age, free from the reign of the machine (the intellect). Having seen Zi on, it's hard to say w hether it's worth such a struggle. (With its cheesy Co uncil of Elders and sweaty raves, it doesn't seem all that different from the matrix, and certainly not worth dying for; it's easy to sympathize with Cypher and wonder why they don't ju st program perfect lives for t hemselves in the matrix and take the blue pill.) If Morpheus and his crew stil l seem to rely on technology, we can only assume this is because they need it to fi ght AI, using its own weapons. As we see in Matrix Reloaded , Zion is as machine-dependent as 'modern' lif e in the matrix, and the possibility that Zion is, in fact, just another matrix cannot be dismissed at this time. What makes Morpheus and the crew intrinsically different from plugged- in humans (and the reason they don't all just give up and go back to the matrix) isn't simply that they aren't in accord with the consensus agenda of 'reality'; it goes deeper t han that. They repres ent a new order of consciousness, a superhuman potential t hat is closer to God than beast; this is why the matrix brands them as 'terrorists'. They are potentially not only omniscient but omnipresent and omnipotent too. In order to grasp the scope and imp lications of such potential, all you have to do is free your mind. Assemble a world ruled not by reason but by the imagination. But first, let's assign some new terminology in order to simplify our exegesis. • The matrix dream world, a world ruled by reason , pertains to the 1st attention , (see Glossary)"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"• The Zion real world, a world ruled by will , pertains to the 2nd attention , (see Glossary) • Plugged-in humans are now to be referred to as humatons. • Those humans who have at least become aware of the matrix and have started the preparations for unplugging (besides Thomas, t here are no examples of this in the first movie, but it seems logical to posit they exist), we shall call simply, matrix warriors. • A fully unplugged human, one w ho can operate freely in both wo rlds, we shall call a matrix sorcerer. Matrix sorcerers have learned to tap into another reality, or interpretation system, that of the so-called real world, which we have termed the 2nd attention. Sorcerers who never realize that this real world is just another interpretation, or matr ix, stay stuck within it, however (this may include Morpheus and the Wachowskis) ; although they have an advantage over your average huma ton and over the matrix warrior (the advantage of moving between two worlds, or attentions), they will never become true seers, or Lucids, until they make this realization. A Lucid is one who can read the code. N eo is the first. That's what makes him the One. Fig 4: Matrix in rela tion to the real world MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" Fig 5: World upheld by will & world upheld by reason Fig 6: Four states of human development If the matrix is the 1st a ttention, the world upheld by reason , or intellect, then Zion (a rather regrettable choice on the Wachowskis' part, since it implies not just religious but political sympathies), is the 2nd attent ion, the world as upheld by will, or the imagination. Beyond this, we can only assume, is the real real world, the 3rd attention, which can only be reached when the two in terpretation systems (the two attentions, those of reason and will, left and right sides of the brain) are pitted against one another and brought into balance, and so can cancel each other out. At this point total freedom is attained, the nature of which we can only guess at. The movie hints at such possibilities with its orgasmic climax when Neo sees the code and attains Samadhi (or at least Nirvana). Moments before this, he actually resurrects hi s physical body, by fusing the two worlds. This is a key point in the movie. Neo's hologram body is shot in the matrix, and as a result his real body dies in the Zion world. A kiss from Trinity remi nds him that his true body is MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 27 elsewhere . What Neo accomplishes here is the o verlapping of the two separate worlds of 1st and 2nd attention, whereby, for just a moment, he glimpses a whole new world, a world that joins the two and yet belongs to neither. Obviously, this is beyond either the philosophical or the dramatic reach of th e first movie, and it 's fortunate for us, since the 3rd attention is equally beyond our powers to write about. We shall see what the sequels bring. Even so, it seems fair to say that not only Neo, but also Morpheus and possibly even Trinity, have had direct experience of this mysterious state of grace, and this is precisely what makes them what they are: impeccable warriors and master sorcerers, with the potential to someday become true Lucids. But for now we shall respect their right not to talk about it and focus on what we know for sure. Morpheus's band of sorcerers wor ks as a team on their twofold mission. First off, they are mapping and eventually liberating the Zion world of the 2nd attent ion until such a time as it is fit for humanity to live in, and bu ild a new world therein. Second ly, they are set the task of rewiring and eventually disassembling the matrix wo rld, or 1st attention, in order to liberate those humans still trapped within it. (A psychologic al model for interpreting this mythos would be to assign the 1st attention matrix intellec t world to the ego, and the 2nd attention Zion world of the imagination to the id. Freud and J ung would have a field day with The Matrix.) When Morpheus and the others enter into the matrix, they effectively create a bridge, a doorway, between the two worlds, whereupon comm unication becomes possible. (The bridge is between left and right sides of the brain, between ego and id.) Their aim is to complete this linking, to bring the 2nd attenti on, the world of sorcery, will and imagination, to act upon and through the 1st attention, the world of the in tellect and reason, the ego realm in which six billion humatons are now imprisoned. It stands to reason that the sorcerers' power within the matrix (their control over the 1st attention) is very nearly infinite. Matrix sorcerers may intervene in people's lives in any way they see fit, in their dreams, in their past, present, and future. They can monitor any given humaton's mo ves precisely, and know exactly how he or she will react in any given situation. With this knowledge they can direct and possibly even create events accordingly, in order to dr aw humatons to them, and prepare them for unplugging, and for eventual recruitment. Sorcerers have the power to shape a humaton's fa ke reality from the higher perspective of true reality in order to get w hatever it is they need from (and for) that person. Morpheus applies this art to Thomas when he calls him at work. He knows the Gatekeepers are coming for Thomas but, as he says rather ominously, 'I don't know what they are going to do.' What Morpheus does know, however, are the various wa ys in which Thomas is likely to react."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" Fig 7: Right & left sides of human percept ion & activity. The totality of the self We must assume the matrix does not program liv es completely, but only certain events in an individual's life, as well as various possible responses. In which case, a given humaton has a basic fate but coundess variations within that fate. All this begins to change when matrix sorcerers enter into the matrix. Since they are not plugged in, AI has no way of predicting their actions. By the same token, since the Gatekeepers are also both outside and inside the matrix, Morpheus and the team have no way of ant icipating the acts of the Gatekeepers. The opponents are on equal ground, that of uncertainty. Morpheus uses the circumstances at hand to stage a test for Thomas, in order to find out how he reacts under pressure. Perhaps even mo re importantly, it is an ideal opportunity for Morpheus to demonstrate to Thomas his powers of prescience. Morpheus more than likely knows that Thomas will allow himself to be c aptured but makes the best use of the event in order to illustrate to Thomas, in the most dram atic fashion possible (sor cery theatre), several key things. First, he lets Thomas know the nature of the challenge to come. Morpheus confronts Thomas with the necessity of putti ng his total trust in Morpheus, and making a seemingly impossible 'leap' in order to evade his pursuers, but also in order to reach a new level of understanding, of seeing and of being (the realm of the sorcerer). By directing Thomas's moves from an outside point of reference (Morpheu s is operating in the 2nd attention of Zion-world; he is lik e an astral visitor in Thomas's dream world), Morpheus gives Thomas a powerful demons tration of the art of dreaming (see Glossary). And as long as Thomas follows these directions and allows hims elf to be guided by th is disembodied voice, he is safe. When he rebels, however, and allows f ear and doubt to sway him, he is taken. In the hands of the Gatekeepers, Thomas's dream world turns into a nightmare. Though he is already acting and even thinking like a warrior, he is still plugged in and so he cannot see beyond his reasonable conviction t hat all of this is real. Si nce none of what he is seeing makes any sense within this framew ork, he presumes he is going in sane. In actual fact, he is finally coming to his senses. What has happened is that the 1st atte ntion has been invaded by the Gatekeepers of the 2nd attention (who physically impl ant Thomas with a tracking device). The floodgates have given way, and sorc ery has taken over his world. The ego is being flooded out by id. From here, Thomas is called to a rendezvous point within the matrix and is picked up by Trinity and two other sorcerer s (Switch and Apoc). He is submitted to a painful and humiliating 'cleansing' process, w hereby his implant is removed. Before this, in response to MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 29 Thomas's suspicion, Switch tell s him, in true warrior fashion, 'Right now there are only two ways: our way, or the highway.' Thomas opts for the highway (h is conceit wants to undo him) but once again Trinity appeals to his deeper desire, and he allows himself to be led. He is taken to meet Morpheus, the seer , the man of k nowledge, the King of the Sorcerers. Trinity's advice is simple: 'Be honest. He knows more than you can possibly imagine.' Morpheus, by entering into the 1st attention, while never losing his connection to the second, demonstrates the art of stalking . Stalking (see Glossary) is also known as the art of controlled folly. It is not predatorial but strategic behaviour, and entails the constant and care ful observation of every last item in the life of the matrix warrior, down to the smallest detail. Matrix warriors learn to perfection the habits and routines of the matr ix (1st attention), whether t hese pertain to the beings they interact with or to themselves. Once they ar e able to predict the movements (both their own and those of others) with razor-shar p precision, they stalk, that is to say, track them and make the most efficient use of them. (What a matrix warrior stalks is energy.) They apply this strategy first of all to their own thoughts, ac ts, and feelings, and secondly to the actions and reactions of those around them. Matrix warriors who practise stalking have a formidable advantage over their fello w humatons: they see through their acts. like Morpheus, it is as if they are outside looking in, or on high looking down. It is as if every act and circumstance is following a precise pattern which only they can s ee. Yet they are fully engaged in the activity at hand, and may appear to be ev ery bit as involved as the ne xt person. This is only an appearance however. Since they know that none of what is happening is real, the motivations of matrix warriors are entirely different to those of humatons."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" Fig 8: Life for the matrix warrior: the path with a heart Morpheus enters Thomas's matrix world without ev er belonging to it. He instructs Thomas, appeals to his reason, then makes him an offer he can't refuse, the red pi ll. Then finally, as soon as he has been given the go-ahead, he mor phs Thomas's world completely. He takes him down the rabbit hole, out of the 1st attention, straight into the 2nd attention. And there he shows Thomas/Neo the totality of himself. Thomas may think he is dreaming when he wake s up in another body, in another world, and another time, but before long he has no choice but to accept that the reverse is actually the case. Thomas is not the dreamer but the dream; reality is elsewhere. Morpheus and his crew sabotage Thomas's life completely. They manipula te him and trick him an d corral him; finally, they ambush him and flush his whole existence down the tubes. They do this because they have no choice, because they believe him to be the One. Whatever et hical considerations Thomas might reasonably have expected to apply in this situation, meeting people who supposedly want to help and guide him, all go out the window. Thomas do esn't realize it until much later, but the moment he made cont act with Morpheus, he entered into the 2nd attention and his life became something wholly other than what he ha d been programmed to MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 31 see it as. It became a game. To matrix warriors, sorcerers, and potential Lucids, existence is an art form. It is only and exactly what they make of it. At which point, ethics become si mply a question of aesthetics. When everything that is, starti ng and ending with oneself, is just a residual memory of something that never happened (or hasn't yet co me to pass), then, and only then, does the hologram game begin. (6) Rules of Empowerment: DIY Unplugging 6a) First rule: Everything in the matrix is there to be used In contrary to humatons, matrix warriors are indiffe rent to externals save so far as they reflect or provoke some internal process. Everything that happens to warriors within the matrix is part of a design. Since they understand the matrix-world of reason is designed solely to trick, deceive, and restrict their movements, they take none of its acti vities to heart. Matrix warriors believe nothing they see, but act as if everyt hing were real. This cancels out obsession and worry. At the same time, since they know the ma trix is using their own minds as a template, they accept responsibility for having creat ed whatever circumstances they are being frustrated or oppressed by, and so turn every probl em into a challenge: an opportunity to test their prowess and ingenuity. Sinc e matrix warriors know they are living in a dream world, every single event, no matter how insignificant, is received as a communication, a sign or omen, by which to calculate thei r next move. Matrix warriors proc eed strategically at all times. Since they live in a predatory en vironment, they act accordingly. Every circumstance is there to be made use of. At the same time, their lack of attachment permits them to tread lightly, and never to abuse an opportunity or reject a c hallenge as 'undesirab le' or 'beneath' them. Since the matrix is their worthy opponent and petty tyrant both, (see Glossary) they are never anything but appreciative of all its worst efforts to undermine them. The essence of warfare, after all, is 'know thine enemy.' 6b) Second rule: Matrix warriors never comp are themselves to anything and never take anything personally Since they know that nothing that happens in the matrix is real, matrix warriors don't ever let it get under their skin. They never engage in the petty power plays of their fellow humatons, nor attempt to compete with them at their level. To do so would be to accept the matrix as real and so surrender to its rules and dictates. The matrix warrior forbears from judgment, and is the soul of tolerance and patience. Should humatons attempt to encroach upon matrix warriors' time or energy, however, or attempt to force them to 'engage' at their level, warriors will destroy them without a sec ond thought. They are not real, in any case. No one ever 'does' anything to a warrior. Provided they are se cure in their own acti ons, and provided they stick to their strategy at all times, no untoward events, interference, or slip-ups are possible. Since humatons are but projec tions of the collective AI mind - which matrix warriors understand to be operating through their own individual perceptio ns -they see everyone and everything within the matrix as a product of their own consciousnesses. As such, as in a dream, everything is their mirror. Any unpleasant quality that manifests in their sphere becomes a means for eradicating this same quality within themselves. Matrix warriors' ruthlessness starts and ends with themselves . Since everything is an extension of themselves, and since these selves as such do not exist, there is nothing that can offend them, for they do not exist to be offended. Ma trix warriors have no points to defend, since"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 32 they have no such points (opinions, beliefs, et c) by which to define themselves. Ergo, they cannot ever be offended, undermined, or assaulted. 6c) Third rule: Matrix warriors erase and invent themselves, endlessly Having twigged the truth, and finally answered t he question that haunted them, like a splinter in their brain — What is the matr ix ? - matrix warrior s accept their whole lives as fiction, no more than a story invented by others, with some limited input from themselves. Since their whole lives have been founded on a sens e of self that is itself illus ory, and since this self in turn is but the product of a life experience (routines, habits, etc) that never happened, warriors are free to erase themselves at will. This they do by unload ing all the baggage of their 'experience'. All the beliefs and opinions t hat the matrix has progr ammed them with as a means to enslave them to it, the warrior unloads. Reality is the self. Without a self, there can be no reality. Accepting the ego as a necessary means to f unction within the matrix, warriors nonetheless remould and reform themselves in any manner convenient to them. They create a shroud of mystery around them selves. They quit the pernicious habit of thinking about themselves constantly, without re spite. All their thoughts come fr om the matrix in any case, and the matrix cannot tell them who they are. So warriors refuse to listen to their thoughts, and after a time these begin to lose their in sistence, whereupon warriors begin to doubt just who they are. Once again, matr ix warriors function as if they knew, yet their actions become progressively lighter, more fluid, spontaneous , and unpredictable. Now that they no longer have any 'personality' (habits) to conform to , they are free to reinvent themselves. 6d) Fourth rule: Matrix warriors have nothing to lose or to gain, because the matrix has nothing to offer them, and cannot take any more from them than it already has Humatons are motivated above all by personal desire, and the insidious fear that their desires will somehow be thwarted. They are defined by external goals, all centring around the self, formed by the ceaseless pressure of this fear-desire mechanism within them. Humatons act compulsively, mechanically, driven by emot ional (though quiet) desperation into a state of contained but constant frenzy. Matrix warriors, on the ot her hand, have no desires to speak of. Having seen through the matrix , there is absolutely nothing th ey could ever want from it. The only thing they desire is to be free from it; and since the ma trix is maintained by desire and the frustration of desire (and the fear of frustration of desire), the warriors' desire amounts to no desire at all: the de sire not to desire. Warriors act as if their acts had meaning to them, as if they had something to gain by t hem; but in truth, since they know that their death is stalking them and nothing in this world will shield them from it or lessen its sting, they really couldn't give a fig. Matrix warriors act for the sheer hell of it. They are not selling, because they have nothing but t heir impeccable spirit and their purpose, and these are not for sale. They're not buying, either, because t here is nothing else besides these that they need. So they operate within the ma rketplace of the matrix as disinterested observers. Their real business is not with humatons but elsewhere. The lack of covetousness or neediness in their actions free the warriors to make the most of what they hav e. Since they want nothing, anything that comes their way is a bonus, a gift in appreciation of their impeccable spirit. And since there's nothing they co vet or need, then whatever doesn't come their way is of no consequence. It doesn't exist, in any case. 6e) Fifth rule: Matrix warriors conserve energy Indifferent to and contemptuous of the trinkets and baubles of matrix life that humatons so ceaselessly chase after, matrix warriors deal ex clusively in a single currency: energy. They know the matrix has been designed to sap them of their spirit and life-force, and so they start"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 33 off with the knowledge that thei r personal power is very low. The more points of drainage (plug-in points to the matrix) they can clos e off, the less energy they will be losing through their acts, and the more they can gather over ti me. Eventually a time will come when their energy levels are high enough for them to unplug completely and escape the matrix. To this end, matrix warriors are misers with their energ y. Since every act, thought, word, and feeling requires energy, they are scrupulous in observing and regulating how they feel, think, speak, and act at all times. These things are their currency: either they invest them wisely or foolishly. Matrix warriors know their energy either goes to ot her humatons, and thence to the matrix (humatons are programm ed to steal energy from others, making life in the matrix a constant battleground of egos), or else is conserved for their own uses. Thus they refrain from thinking too much about ot hers, or allowing others to think about them. They even refrain from thinking about themselv es, since the primary energy drain in their lives is that of their egos, the main plug-in to the matrix (the one at the back of the neck, in the movie). Matrix warriors learn to discriminate between those thoughts and acts that increase their energy levels and those which dimini sh it; little by little they erad icate the latter class, until all the points of drainage have been r epaired. Only then are the warriors ready to leave the matrix, escape their fates as living battery cells, and attain their destinies as Lucids. 6f) Sixth rule: The Holy Grail of ma trix warriors is not fame but freedom The matrix warrior couldn't give a hoot about being liked. Freedom is freedom first of all from the thoughts, opinions, and expectations of ot hers, including oneself. All such thoughts originate in the matrix: they are the net in which humatons ar e caught. Humatons are plugged in to the matrix at every leve l, in everything they do. These plug-ins are the points of drainage which the warrior seeks to repair. Hence, for matrix warriors, freedom entails a process of unplugging, disconnecting from ev eryone and everything within the matrix. Points of contact with the matrix, be they fellow humatons, po ssessions, obsessions, habits, desires, fears, beliefs, goals, or whatever, all must be removed fr om matrix warriors' agenda. This is not to be' confused with disassociation, denial, or isol ation. Matrix warriors are not psychopaths, hermits, or aesthetes, flagellating themselves in lonely caves. Their detachment is the means to freedom, not an excuse for self-immolation. Ma trix warriors join t heir fellow humatons in the midst of their folly, and treat them with c ourtesy and affection; but they never for a moment allow themselves to parta ke of the humatons' folly or th ink that they are part of the group. For while a humaton's eyes are fix ed outward, upon the petty baubles which the matrix has provided as distra ction - looking for love, food, money, fame, and above all social acceptance - the warriors' eyes are turned inward, gazing into the abyss of their non- existence. Since matrix warriors know that freedom entails the complete and total annihilation of the false self of the matrix 'life', they are no longer able to feel any interest for or attachment to the things that pertain to that life. And yet, paradoxically; with the certainty that all this will be gone in a heartbeat, they allow their eyes to feast upon the features of the world, not hungrily but grat efully, knowing that all of this, this beautiful illusion (so long as they can remain indifferent to it) is the means to their freedom. 6g) Seventh rule: Matrix warriors never allow themselves to be distracted from their purpose Since matrix warriors no longer have the things of the wo rld (the matrix program) to shield them from their non- existence, they must find something else to hold on to, to provide them with a sense of self and of purpose. What warriors hold on to is their unbending intent, their will, and their sense of impeccability. The will of matrix warriors is their lifeline. They know that if they follow it diligently enough, it will lead them out of the intellectual maze of the matrix, and into another world. The matrix is a prison, torture chamber, factory farm, training ground, and playground, all in one. Above all, it is built as a distraction, w hether the distraction provided is that of misery, fear, pain, desire, work, se x, or play. Matrix warriors reject a ll that. They reject everything they encounter on their path, knowing that their path is through the matrix, not into it; that they have a limited amount"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 34 of time to get out of the matrix, and that any delay ma y prove fatal. Warriors may appreciate and enjoy whatever comes their way within the matrix, and they may certainly use it on their journey; but they must never indulge in it, for this would lead to fixation, obsession, attachment, and worst of all, addiction. In a word, points of drainage. To indulge in these things would be to forget their tr ue purpose, and run the risk of losing their will and their impeccability. At which point they may as well just take the blue pill and be done with it. A matrix warrior knows that there are a million blue pills on offer at every junc ture, but only one red pill. The matrix manufactures blue pills wholesale; the red pill, on the other hand, is something warriors will only ever come across once in their lives. Thus, they must be ready to pluck their cubic cent imetre of chance in the moment it appears. For when Morpheus passes, he never returns. (7) Sins Against the State: Eight Card inal Virtues of the Matrix Warrior Detachment (sobriety). See sixth rule. Detachment entails clarity and forbearance; the ab ility to see clearly in an impartial fashion, free from judgment, prejudice or personal desire. It is central to the warrior's strategy within the matrix. So long as the matrix warrior's view of things is fi ltered through the ego, it will be opaque and fuzzy, distorted by the false signals of the matrix. Only when they are no longer attached to their emotions can matrix warrior s truly feel them; only when their acts are unencumbered by expectation or motive do they become impeccable. Matrix warriors act only when the spirit moves them ; at all other times they forbear. This is the essence of detachment. The ability to pause and step outside t he circle of activity in which they are engaged, for just a moment. In that moment warriors can see clearly, and will know exactly what their next move should be. Passion Contrary to the humaton's perception, a matrix warrior is not a cold, unfeeling person but a man or woman on fire. Humatons do not experience true emotions, since their programming serves to repress them as potentially disrupti ve to routines (and rout ines are the meat and potatoes of the matrix). Instead, they fabricate fake emotions as a surrogate, a surrogate that is correspondingly easier to control. In place of wrath they feel indignat ion; in place of love, sentimentality; in place of passion, obsession. Matrix warriors move in precisely the opposite direction: they seek to intens ify their emotions to the limi t, until these have transformed into their raw state or have been purified. They do not control their emotions, but control their responses to emotions, thereby refusing to allo w themselves to be controlled by them. By not indulging in negative emot ions such as pity or conceit, matrix warriors soon eradicate them from their itinerary. More useful but still negati ve emotions, such as wrath and grief, they use sparingly. By plunging into an experience of wrath, for example, warriors go through it that much more quickly. Above all, matrix warriors express their emot ions fearlessly. If sad, they weep. When angry, they rage, bark, and occasionally bite. Nothing is repressed, so nothing is held on to. At the base of all emotions, however , is passion, the purest expression of which is love. Whatever warriors feel, they feel passionatel y. This is because pa ssion is a pure form of energy which fires the warriors' acts and imbues t hem with intensity, force, and vigour. Matrix warriors don't do anything by halves or in a wis hy-washy way. Their passion burns away all the lesser emotions, until only t he pure ones are left. To the warri or, there is only fear and desire, joy and sorrow, and these are but the cardinal points of passion, or love. So long as they are centred, matrix warriors are able to boil down every emotion, as it comes, to its essence, and thereby feed the i nner fire of their boundless love for life. The matrix, which feeds on lukewarm feelings like pity, sentimentality, and melancho ly, is powerless in the face of passion; for this reason, matrix warriors cultivate it above all else."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 35 Ruthlessness Matrix warriors do not assign the same negative connotations to the word 'ruthless' as does the average, misguided humaton. Passion at it s purest is indeed ruthless. Ruthlessness is simply a total lack of pity, and true passion is de void of pity, since pity precludes the respect of equals. Pity is the poor man's compassion, ju st as sentimentality is a humaton's imitation of real feeling. Pity entails t he victim's perspective. Humatons love to pity the 'victims' of 'injustice', and disguise their own self-loat hing and inadequacy as genui ne concern for others and for the state of the world. Ruthlessness has been painted as a most undesirable trait by the social matrix, as cruelty, selfishness, even maliciousness or brutality. In this saccharine Hallmark-card world, to be devoid of pity or sentimentality, i.e., false emotion, equates with cold-heartedness. But wasn't Jesus ruthless when he talked of turning brother against sister and father against son, and when he rejected his own mother ? Only by being utterly ruthless with their fellow humatons - by being free of concern for them - can warriors begin to help them. To be ruthless means to speak plainly, without mincing words, to override the fear of offending. At the base of humatons' 'consider ation' for others is the abject desire to be liked. Ruthlessness precludes such selfish desire ; it means to act without hesitation or doubt, free of the unnecessary baggage of sentiment, fraudulence, timi dity, or deviance. Humatons love to fuss and mince, to beat around the bush, to defer, forever defer, and to take a week to do what could best be done in an hour. Matr ix warriors have no time for this. Their ruthlessness cuts through all the guff. The matrix is watching their every move relentlessly, waiting for them to slip up. Since matrix warriors are in a cons tant state of war against their own false selves, every act is an act of war, an act that may bring about their total defeat, even their deaths. Matrix warriors are always ready to die for their acts. With such an attitude, it becomes clear why their mood and manner mi ght seem ruthless to the average humaton. Since humatons are unaware of being engaged in a fight for surviv al, a fight which only the most ruthless and courageous survive, they feel fully justified in wasting time and energy feeling sorry for themselves, endlessly complain ing, trying to be liked, and wishing things were different or that they we re somewhere or someone else. Ma trix warriors have no time to feel sorry for themselves or for anyone else. The matrix never rests, and time is always against them. Grace In a battle against an unseen adversary that is everywhere and nowhere, matrix warriors must perfect themselves. They must work upon their movement until they are streamlined, until every move, every thought, every decision, is a paragon of speed, efficiency, and timing. In order to move freely within the matrix, warri ors must effectively di sappear, and yet still remain. They must be Ninjas, finding and follo wing the line of least resistance in every situation. They must follow the Tao. In the movie, Neo's bullet-dodging is the first sign that he is learning to use his beautiful mind and so commence being 'the One'. 'You moved like they do,' says Trinity, with a mixture of suspicion and admiration. 'N ot fast enough,' says Neo, having been grazed by two bullets. Neo's attain ment of grace depend s on his freeing his mind and fully grokking the psychic child's counsel that 'there is no spoon.' Since he is in a holographic world in which he himself is the hologr am, there is no 'thing' to resist him, to impede his will, save his own inner resistance, his disbelief, his stubborn conviction that there really is a spoon. Once this conviction has been lift ed, Neo is free to move 'like they do', they being the slippery Gatekeepers who can shape shi ft at will. Neo has attained grace. In Christian terms, grace is freedom from sin. To matrix warriors there is no sin, however, only bad habits. Above all, it is the habit of rational ity that prevents their imagination, their will, from unfolding, and keeps warriors enslaved to t he matrix. Once they begin to break this habit, their acts become unhinder ed by the program. It cannot predict, much less determine, their movements. Therefore, it can no longer resist or count eract them. As the Bible says,"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 36 'under grace, there is no law.' And without rules, t he matrix game is over. Humility (patience) Since it is humatons' egos or their sense of self-importance that provide their plug-in to the matrix, the means by which it def ines, restricts, and controls t hem, matrix warriors know that the more they can reduce their egos, the less fixe d or solid their sense of self becomes, the freer they will be to reinvent themselves outs ide the malign influence of the matrix. To this end, warriors remain humble, diffident, and self-effacing at all times. Even if a warrior is the One, he never allows himself to feel more important than anyo ne else. The secret of being special, after all, is in not dwelling upon it. (The truly special kn ow they are quite ordinary.) What makes Neo the One is that he has realized he is everything by r ealizing he is nothing. Neo is not the only 'one', he is merely the first to realize it. One-ness is available to all. Knowing this, that all are equal (equally unreal) within the ma trix, matrix warriors humble themselves. They do not expect or demand anyth ing from anyone. Yet whatever comes their way, being more than they expe cted, they make optimum use o f. A warrior's joy comes from the humility of knowing that he or she is no more nor less important that anything else in this vast, mysterious, and wholly illusory universe. Hence, warriors enjoy t he power of the mighty star, that brings light to infinite darkness, and at the same time, have the freedom of the microscopic atom, lost in the vastness. Imagination It would be fair to say that imagination is the sine qua non of unplugging from the matrix, the essence of sorcery, and the means by which ma trix warriors arrive at total freedom and the totality of themselves. Imagination is also the quality that humatons can be said to be most sorely lacking, for the very obvio us reason that the matrix has hijacked this power for its own uses. Humanity's power to imagi ne (the same quality sorcerers call will ) is what distinguishes us from all other creatures. It is our divine spark, and as such, it is the food which AI endlessly covets to sustain itself, and which it us es to create its own imit ation of life. AI has robbed humanity of its imagination, its power to dream worlds ou t of nothingness, and used it to spin the matrix world into being. Hence, humanity is caught in a vicious loop, a catch-22 of cosmic proportions. It is humanity's hijacked will that has created the matrix, and the matrix serves to sap humanity of this will in order to sustain itself. Yet this faculty of will/ imagination is the only thing which can set humanity free again. Hence, there is no way for humatons to break free of the matr ix without recapturing their lost im agination, and there is no way to recapture their lost im agination without first getting free of t he matrix. For this reason, AI's greatest desire is also its greates t fear. What sustains it may also destroy it, if given the freedom to express itself creativ ely. Creative imaginat ion is discouraged in the matrix above all else: rationality and intellect rule. As Mo rpheus points out to Neo, however powerful the Gatekeepers may be, they are sti ll limited because 'they are based in a world that is built on rules.' Neo and the other matrix sorcerers are not so restricted. There are no rules to the imagination, or if there are, then they are infinitely more varied than those of reason. So matrix warriors develop their creative imagination, knowing it to be the one thing the matrix cannot counteract, since it has no means to predict or even comprehend it. There is no rationale, no system, for it to compute. As such , AI is as helpless in the face of unfettered human imagination as a doe frozen in the headlights of a ten-ton truck. Matrix warriors take comfort knowing this, and in knowing that sooner or later, imagination will out. Prowess In the meantime, however, ma trix warriors have their physical prowess to fall back on."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 37 'Physical' may seem an odd word to use when talkin g of matrix matters, but we shall let it go for now. Matrix warriors, unlike humatons who pursue health in the interests of vanity and longevity (and for whom the only 'prowess' worth attaining is sexual), perfect their physical vehicles as means to an end, not an end in itself. As for any martial artist or Zen master, the mind and body are one and the same thing to matrix warriors. The more they can still their thoughts, the faster and stronger their bodies become. The more they train and perfect their bodies, the freer their minds will be. To develop their will, the warriors' bodies must, first of all, be perfectly functioning units. To use creative imagin ation in conditions of combat requires stamina. The matrix warriors' fight for freedom cannot be al l metaphor, for any internal struggle will soon be mirrored by external battles. There is always a Gatekeeper, or an especially dedicated humaton, wait ing to ambush them at any moment. Prowess involves the full and constant use of all the warrior's senses: hearing, sight, touch, ta ste, and smell. Matrix warriors must notice everything, for the smallest detail may prov ide a clue that will save their lives, and the slightest oversight may mean their death. Unlike a hum aton, who builds his biceps but suffers from a weak back and perhaps from migraines too, matrix wa rriors must be formidable on every level. To a warrior, all capacities, physical, mental, and emotional, are to be fine-tuned, like a car penter's tools, a soldier's weapons, or a musician's instrument. One misfire may mean the battle is lost. Sloppiness and indolence are the mark of humatons with no real interest besides staving off the endle ss boredom of their lives for a few more hours. Discipline and vigilance are the way matrix warriors get t he most out of every available moment, and are always ready to turn any situation to their advantage like an Olympic trainer, they keep in shape. As the hurdles get bigger, they lear n to leap higher. Prowess is above all the ability to enjoy life to the full, even if it is all an illusion. And yes, prowess means sexual prowess, too. Laughter Along with imagination, l aughter is the one thing AI can never simulate, experience, or fight against. In the matrix warrior's arsenal, there is no weapon more powerfu l and versatile than humour, a sense of mirth, joy, and of the absurd. Since matrix wa rriors know that nothing is real and every act is sheerest foll y, they are free to take delight in the spectacle of their lives, and in their own insane role within it. Humatons rarely laugh with any abandon, and almost never at themselves. They are too rigid with conceit and indignation, too ready to take offence or feel sorry for themselves, and t oo heavy with self-importance and worry to ever appreciate the absurdity of their acts. Matrix warriors know that laughing at life and at themselves is the surest way to take the edge off their terror. Through laughter, warriors ensure that they never become overwhelm ed or paralyzed by the magnitude of their challenge or the weight of their responsibilities. Laughter re lieves the pressure; it is a means of unplugging momentarily from their predicament, of counteracting the gravity of their condition. Without laughter, matrix warriors w ould become morbid, obsessive, and gloomy; in no time at all they would be psychopaths. As such, in their war against the matrix, warriors are obliged to enjoy themselves to the full. Fo r the average humaton, it's hard to understand how Armageddon could be a laugh, but for matrix wa rriors (if they're to survive it with their sanity intact), that's exactly what it is. And if the Wachowskis are really working for Morpheus and the crew, we can expect a few more laughs in the sequels. (8) The Vale of Soul-Making: Understanding the Matrix As matrix warriors continue to work on self-unplugging and approach ever closer to the Lucid view, they begin to grok the true nature of their situation. They begin to understand that what they had at first perceived as a wholly malevolent plot to enslave their spirits and devour their"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 38 life force is in fact something considerably more subtle, something more ambiguous. The matrix is a prison, certainly, bu t it is a self-made prison; as such, it serves a hidden purpose beyond that of mere incarceration. A caterpillar, when it realizes t hat its life as a caterpillar has reached its natural end and that its evolutionary possibilities have run out, must embrace the terrifying prospect of complete physical transformation. To this end, rather than simply committing suicide, it builds itself a chrysalis to hide in. It may not know why, but it builds one. And on ce it has been sealed within the darkness of this chrysalis, the putre faction process begins. The caterpillar is reduced to a liquid form (just as, in the mo vie, the dead are liquefied and fed to the newborns, growing in their pods). The chrysalis serves a double purpose, then: it provides a safe and protected environment in which the caterpillar form may be broken down to its essence; and it sets about remoulding this essence into a new form, that of the butterfly. Once the putre faction/transformation process is complete, the once-caterpillar, now-butterfly breaks open the once confining now redundant chrysalis. This, to the warrior, is t he true function of the matrix, and as such warriors-who-would-be-sorcerers accept their fate alongside the humatons, and bide their time until the transformation is underway. The moment their unplugging finally occurs, they spread their wings and fly. Of course, the other caterpillars cannot comp rehend this process, having never been through it. To them, the chrysalis isn't even a prison; it's simply a safe place to hide away in and to shut down all their senses. And should any young caterpillar on its way to the chrysalis-stage glimpse the shadow of a newly emerged butterfly passing over head, it has no idea that it has just seen one of its siblings, risen to a new state of being. All it sees is the shadow, and it is programmed to flee from all shadows in case t hey signal a roving predator come to devour it. I am now going to share with you the secret of secrets. It's a secret so secret that it's showing up as the plot of mainstream movies, from The Matrix to Monsters Inc , and millions of people are now aware of it. After this book comes out, a few dozen more will be, too. But even so, maybe you haven't heard. Here goes. The Earth is a farm. It is a factory, and what it manufactures and processes is emotions. Let's imagine it this way. T he average humaton experiences emot ions that range from most abject fear and misery to, on very rare occa sions, soaring highs of selfless love and happiness. We can all agree on that. All these em otions belong to a single energy spectrum, if you will, like the colours of a rainbow, this energy moves along the spectrum, exhibiting a rate of frequency that is under co nstant variation. It may fluctuat e wildly back and forth, or it may, in certain individuals, progress steadily in a single direction 'up' the spectrum as it were. This is known as self-development, or evolution. It is the process of unplugging. Upon this spectrum, energy rang es from the lowest frequency, the darkest, most cloying and stagnant emotions - those of fear, pain, rage, and hatred - to the highest, the purest and most refined of all emotions, know n to humatons as 'love'. Love is the refined energy of pure consciousness which the universe is designed to produce. The raw material of this energy, or consciousness, is simply emotion in all it s myriad forms, base and exalted, good and evil. Let's say, then, that the Earth is at present under the care and maintenance of 'Beings' (not really machines, but the movie comes clos e enough) that feed prim arily on the negative emotions, those of fear and fr ustration, rage and despair, pai n and misery. The matrix has been designed to this end, to be conducive to the production of such emotions. In a word, a living Hell. Now, as the matrix warrior begins to realize, this is not quite as diabolic as it sounds, seeing as (whether we know it or not) these 'Beings' are, in actual fact, working to a"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 39 greater end than that of their own sustenance. They are priming the product, the human soul. They are in effect distilling the essence for a greater harvest to come. As every butterfly knows, the goal of putrefaction is transformation. The souls of Earth are destined to become Lucids: fully consci ous 'love-makers', beings who manufacture love just as bees make honey. In order for this state to be attained by the collective body of humanity, then, all its emotional impurities must first be strained off. Put another way, its emotions must be steadily refined and transforme d into the one energy, that of love. Simply stated, we in the matrix are learning to love agains t all the odds, to love without conditions and without reward; one might even say without reason, without incentive. And once we have learnt to love a life that is basically hellish, and to enjoy ourselves even in the very worst of conditions, then, and only then, will we attain the Lucid state. As we begin to refine our emotional response s to our conditions, and to manifest a purer level of energy, we accordingly begin to plug into a higher matrix; and so little by little we come to work for the Lucids instead of for t he Gatekeepers. This has a corresponding effect on our circumstances, which steadily improve as a result, so allowing us to manifest ever greater levels of emotional satisfaction within our lives. Just as we have been oppressed and drained by the matrix, now we are enhanced and in spired by the attention and assistance of the Lucids. This is an ongoing process. Mo mentum accumulates wit h every passing hour, provided we stick to our course. life on Earth is a Game. What is lacking in the life of the average humaton, but ever-develop ing in that of the warrior, is an awareness of the rules: how to bend them, and ho w to break them. And how to reinvent them. The means of keeping score for the matrix warriors in this Game is via their emotional responses, for these determine energy levels. The better they play the game, the more pos itive their emotional responses become to given circumstances, t he more lucid their thought processes, the higher their awareness rises, the more energy t hey can gather, the higher they fly, the more they enjoy life, the better they play the game ! And so it goes, all the way to infinity. The procedure is simple. Energy begets energy. There is a matrix that was cr eated by a higher matrix beyond even the power of imagination to conceive. This second matrix created the matr ix of the manifest universe as we know it, out of our own thoughts. It created it as a mate, for company in the vastness. Locally speaking, then, the higher matrix of infinity created Earth as a womb or matrix in which to sow a sacred seed. And humans in turn, who are creators after a lesser fashion, have indeed gone forth, as commanded, been fruitful, and mult iplied, within this matrix. And in the process, they have built their own matrix to hide away and ferment in."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" Fig 9: Overlap of matrix and real world The art of becoming a Lucid, capable of creating new matrices at will, is available to all, from the lowest of beings to the highest. It depends upo n learning to produce a pure and perfect substance known as love. Once warriors have mast ered their lower emotions — such as fear and rage, hatred and doubt — and transmuted the lead of the baser energies into the gold of higher consciousness, they have l earnt the art of Making Love. And so they graduate to the Lucid state. Humanity in its ent irety is now reaching this graduati on point, this time of harvest, when the chrysalis cracks open and the butterfly spreads it s wings. Any humatons who have failed to unplug in time however, to evolve their consciousness beyond the baser emotions, will be obliterated along with the chrysalis: they are the negative remnants, as such, and there will, in effect, be nothing of them to salvage. That's alchemy for you. It takes a lotta lead to make a nugget of gold, and a whole bi g shit pile to grow a few roses. So, that's the secret. Use it well.

(9) Do You Believe in Fate ? The Sorcerer's Will to Freedom 'To deny our impulses is to deny the very thing that makes us human.' — Mouse, The Matrix. The question of fate and free will is as old as phi losophical thought itse lf. Perhaps the matrix gave us this problem to begin with so we'd s pend our entire history tryi ng to figure out what was always a foregone conclusion. Whatever we decide to believe, it is already programmed into us. As every Gatekeeper knows, the belief in free will only makes humatons that much easier to control. When Morpheus asks Thomas if he believes in fate, Thomas answers quickly in the negative. Morpheus asks him why not. 'Because I don't like to th ink that I'm not in co ntrol of my life.' 'I know exactly what you mean,' replies Morpheus, who knows a hell of a lot more than that. Morpheus knows that Thomas, like all humat ons, only believes he has control: when he thinks he is making a decision, he is only responding to artificial stimuli and acting in one of any number of preprogrammed ways. Yet he also kn ows that there is a way out of this trap. To the matrix warrior, the paradox of fate and free will is as follows: as long as one believes one has the freedom to choose one's actions, one will always be a slave to them. Humatons are confined to the matrix, a pr ogram that tells them they are free individuals precisely in order to manipulate them more easily. The mo ment humatons accept their fate, however, and the unpalatable truth that their acts and t houghts are determined by some outside force vaster than they can imagine, they have taken the first step towards freedom. The reason for this is that within the matr ix there are a set number of preprogrammed responses to any given situation (a situation created by the matr ix itself). Whichever one of these a humaton chooses (under the programmed illusion of having a choice), he or she is always only acquiescing to the program. The matr ix is like a chess player that has already anticipated every last one of its opponent's moves - except one. The only way to escape the program is by acting entirely outside the rules of the program . The rules of the program are the rules of reason, of the rational mind. Thus the matrix warrior know s that the only freedom within the program is to act irra tionally. This is not to say insanely or foolishly, but rather spontaneously, unpredictably, and above all without personal motive. Here is where the imagination and will come into play. Since the matrix can only imit ate and anticipate the processes of reason, any act of the creative imagination is outside the parameters of its comprehension, and will always come unexpected. And since will is pr ecisely what humatons do not have (having been drained of it by AI), the one respon se that they are almost guaranteed not to give is that of will, the imaginative response. It is this response which is the warrior's one true option within t he matrix. By choosing to have a choice (i.e., to override the program), matrix warriors effectively have no c hoice, save to act spontaneously and do the one thing that is not expected of them. To be impeccable, a warrior must always follow this inner imperative, that of freedom. The inner voice of the matrix warrior is a simp le but extremely tricky affair. Since warriors know that every last one of their thoughts originat es in the matrix prog ram itself, they must learn to ignore their thoughts, to tune them out until they become a so rt of background hum,"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 42 and eventually disappear altogether. Long before t hey attain this lucid state of internal silence, however, matrix warriors must prac tise diligently, every moment of their lives, discriminating between their thought-responses, in or der to isolate the inner voice. Basically, once they have rejected every la st one of the false thoughts of the matrix mind, whatever impulse or intuition is left is t he one they can trust in. Accordingl y, it is the one they act upon. In other words, the only appropria te action in any given moment for the matrix warrior is the unthinkable action, the one that arises from the silent empti ness, behind and beyond all the senseless chatter of the matrix data-feed. Thus, it is a truism to say t hat matrix warriors are impeccable because they are irrational, and because they dare to do the unthinkable: to act without prior thought or motive. By continuing to act in this non-rational, sp ontaneous manner, the matrix warrior constantly confounds the program. The matrix is unable to assimilate the wa rrior's choices or to respond adequately to them, just as a sane person cannot hold a conversation wi th a madman without losing the thread. And so, little by little, the matrix begins to lose sight of the warriors, to loosen its hold on them, and the warriors in turn become progressively freer to heed their inner voices and to act spontaneously. Yet, so l ong as they remain within the matrix, the warriors remain caught up by their fate. They cannot change the components of their lives, nor in any radical fashion the events and circum stances that shape them . What they can do, however, is to refine their responses to events, and so alter the manner in which they occur. In this way, by accepting their fate, matrix wa rriors are able to accelerate the program, as it were, and move through the programmed events in a faster, more economical and empowering manner. And after a time (most especially once they connect to the 2nd attention sorcerers in the real world), they are even able to se e their fates, laid out before them like a map or a blueprint. They can then work within t he matrix, without ever being restricted by it. By this time, however, our matrix warriors have unpl ugged and become acting sorcerers. They have tapped their will. With great power comes great res ponsibility. Responsibility is the ability to respond, and this is the only freedom warrior/sorce rers can ever have within the matrix: the power to respond freely to whatever comes their way. Through su ch a power, the warrior/sorcerers begin to transform their world. The matrix turns gradual ly from torture chamber to amusement park. Seeing as the matrix pr ogram is hardwired to warriors' ow n unconscious will, the fate which AI has assembled for them consists of elements drawn from their sl eeping minds, elements that must accordingly fit their particular needs as individuals. Even though the matrix has shaped their personalities from birth, it stands to reason that, since AI cannot actually create anything (lacking the imagination to do so), but only shape and mould what already exists, each individual's life-plan, their fate, is act ually assembled only partially in advance, and largely through the process of being 'lived' (i .e., dreamed). The matrix provides a nearly infinite series of choices, and individuals, fr om birth onward, select which ones best meet their needs; these 'choices' in turn give rise to the events and circumstances of their lives. So although AI may be able to foresee every last one of the countless possi ble 'fates' for any given individual, it cannot know which precise fate will be realized. Logically, the longer humatons remain within the matrix (the longer they are plugged in) and t he more rigidly they keep to its dictates, the easier it becomes to predict their fa te, to the point that most humatons, by the time they reach adulthood, have their lives all m apped out, preordained. The only possibility of breaking out the pattern, then, is via intervention from the matrix sorcerers coming from left of field, from outsi de the matrix program. In just such a way, Morpheus intervenes in the life of Thomas , to make him an o ffer he can't refuse."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" Fig 10: Passage from Humaton to Lucid, acc epting fate as means to realize destiny To return to the original question, matrix warri ors know that, although their various fates are all preprogrammed, there is a nearly infinite variety of them, and that they are all contingent upon, drawn put of, their own unconscious mi nds. They are dreaming their lives, and their primary advantage over other humatons is that humatons never realize they are dreaming, while warriors become aware of th is by steady degrees. Humatons never have the option of becoming lucid, and so they allow the matrix to make all their choices for them (they are not the dreamers but merely figments of the dream). Matrix warriors strive to become conscious of their unconscious processes - and so tap into t heir creative imagination, their will - in order to have an active say in their fates. By becoming aware of the actors at play, it becomes possible for them to meet and res pond to the events in their lives in a more lucid, controlled, spontaneous, and imaginative fashi on, thereby using these events constructively, towards their own freedom. By accepting their fate, warriors turn the matrix's own devices against it, and begin to manifest their destiny. Warriors, rat her than trying to change their fate, seek to accelerate it. If they can bring about all the events that their unconscious minds have provided for AI to work with - and above all if they can turn these events from distractions and inhibitions to actual instructions - they ar e able to exhaust the pr ogram's possibilities (to complete its purpose); at this point they may begin to introduce, through conscious will, new possibilities all their own. It is now that the 2nd attention begins to seep through into the warrior's life, fate segues into destiny, and the imagination takes over fr om the intellect. Will overthrows reason. And it is at this point that the rules begin to change and matrix sorcerers free then-minds. The question remains: how much can matrix sorcer ers actually alter their lives from outside the matrix, in the 2nd attention ? It's clear from the movie that Neo and the others can provide themselves with 'anyth ing we need' within the matrix , as well as almost limitless knowledge of every Earth discipl ine, from kung fu to baking cookies to flying helicopters. All of this would clearly transform a sorcerer's life within the matrix almost totally. Yet sorcerers, by definition, no longer have a 'life' within th e matrix. Since they can come and go at will (at least with the help of fellow sorcerers in the real world), and since they can manifest whatever they need while there, there is no longer the necessi ty or desire to uphold an ordinary life within the 1st attention of the ma trix program. Even so, whenever sorcerers do MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 44 enter into the matrix, they are presumably still c onfined to their old identities, physical appearance, name, age, and so forth.

It seems unlikely that matrix sorcerers have the power to reprogram the matrix or to shape events within it; only 'the O ne' can do this. If matrix sorcerers did have such a power, they would have nothing to fear and could end the whole game right now, by programming everyone to wake up. It also seems logical that the more hacking they do, the more they are likely to draw the attention of the Sentinels (the search and destroy machines) in the 2nd attention, as well as the Gatekeepers in the matrix. Hence, discretion is the better part of valour in the war agains t the, matrix, for t he sorcerer as much as for the warrior. Interestingly enough, this restriction also applies, and maybe even more so, to the Gatekeepers. The Gatekeepers are obliged to ac t within the rules of the program, because a computer program needs to be consistent in order not to fall apart. It may be that the Gatekeepers cannot afford to break too many rules too often, because then the rules themselves would cease to hold up. Since the ma trix is based upon a rational and strictly limited (and limiting) interpretation of reality, any acts or event s that are too far outside such an interpretation would threaten to destroy it entir ely, or at best cause it to mutate. Humatons would start to stir in their slumber if they we re witness to too many marvels. (Of course, like the agents in Men in Black , AI could always erase humatons' me mories; but this may in itself give rise to complications by messing with hum atons' sense of continuity: causing 'missing time' experiences.) So matrix sorcerers and Ga tekeepers alike must walk a razor's edge in which their magical acts and impossible leaps are as likely to work against them as they are to further their cause. By performing impossible feats inside the matr ix, Neo and the others can let humatons see 'what you [AI] don't want them to see: a world wit hout rules.' This way, the matrix sorcerers can awaken humatons to their own possibilities . Even more dramatically, by introducing new responses, new options, into the program, they are causing it to mutate, creating new rules and possibilities and so reshaping 'reality', redesigning the program, working towards the eventual end of cancelling it entir ely. On the other hand, if they draw too much attention to themselves, they will be open to reprisals from AI. Since t he Gatekeepers can manifest through any humaton whatsoever , and since they can monitor all events within the matrix through the humatons, any outre phenomenon the sorcerous crew perform will quickly bring the Gatekeepers to them. The matrix program will rise up against them, including, let us not forget, those 'hopelessly dependent ' humatons who will fight to protect their sense of reality, and to uphold the matrix at any cost. Matrix sorcerers are restricted not by any inherent limitation of their powers, but rat her by the limitations of the 1st attention itself. If they stir things up too much, mutating their fates and accelerating the program, they will find themselves faced with more th an they bargained for. To th is end, they are careful to transform their lives within the matrix a little bit at a time, gently, frugally, with patience and cunning, and above all with a carefully drawn strat egy. After all, they have nothing to gain by rushing, and everything to lose by overreaching themselves. Since the active element in the lives of matrix sorcerers is no longer their reason, but their will, and since will manifests spontaneously and nonrationally, t here is no longer any way for them to predict their own actions, much less the outcome. Hence the matrix sorcerer can have no goal, as such, save the goal of to tal freedom and transformation, a goal as vague and mysterious as it is apocalyptic. The matrix sorcerer is concerned only with the moment, not with yesterday or tomorrow. Ti me is an illusion, like everythi ng else, only more so. Matrix sorcerers are like a card sharp who wins every time without ever having to cheat. They don't need to cheat, because they know the game so well that they can memorize the movement of every single card, and know exactly which one will come up next. They know not only what the next hand will be, but what everyone else's is, too. T he only thing they can't control is"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 45 where the cards will fall; but seeing as the blu ff is as much a part of the game as anything (to the card sharp, there's no such thing as lu ck), this is of no consequence to the matrix sorcerer. Whatever cards they're dealt, they alr eady know how to play them. That's fate and free will in a nutshell: no one chooses what hand he gets dealt, but only the matrix sorcerer is free to decide how to play it. Matrix sorcerers manifest their destiny out of the raw material of their fates. They know exactly what they want and exactl y how to get it, because they k now that the only way to get what they want is — not to want it. And since they don't give a fig either way, they can always bluff their way through, no matter how lousy t he hand is. Not caring if they win or lose gives them the calm and the confidence of a winner, and so they win every ti me. In just such a manner, matrix sorcerers handle the elements of their fates, and shape them into an enviable destiny. It's all the same to them if there's air or not: they don't need lungs, in any case. This in-the-momentness of sorcerers is the key to their power and freedom both. The matrix program is upheld by the code of reason, of language-based rational thought. This is what gives sequence to the events and beings t hat appear to exist within it. Sorcerers have unplugged from the matrix through disconnecting from their own rational thought processes, by shutting off their internal dialogues , their false 'minds', and attaining a state of inner silence. It is from this st ate of silence that the will, the creative faculty, emerges. This is a most salient point. For it is inner silence that makes matrix sorcerers different from their fellow humatons. Even the matrix warriors who hav e yet to unplug are still trapped by the dictates of their fates, of t he 'program'. But the matrix sorc erer is outside looking in. The sorcerers' art is founded in the power to imagine, the capacity fo r creative thought. They 'think' in images rather than wo rds. Above all, they act without thinking. By forbearing from rational thought immediately before acting, their acts break the rules of the matrix and upturn the program. The matrix is designed to monito r, direct, and control human thought and so to anticipate every action. Fr om the most trivial to the most re volutionary, all are part of AI's spectrum and within its power to influence. W hen matrix sorcerers act, however, they act impulsively, spontaneously, without accompany ing thoughts; and so their acts appear irrational, wholly unexpected. It is precisely th is that makes their acts creative, and beyond the matrix's power to counteract. This is what Morpheus means when he tells Neo to free his mind: to let go of the desire to analyse, interpret, judge, and control what is happening, and simply allow his will to unfold, magically, without interference fr om reason. Once he is able to do this, Neo's actions become sorcery. By silencing his thoughts and so becom ing disengaged from the matrix, he has tapped his will. And so the only freedom for matrix sorcerers is to act without themselves knowing what they are doing, to become a witness to their own ac ts, a midwife to miracles, a true creative force of nature, outside time and space, and far, far beyond the reach of the Gatekeepers. Any other arrangement just ain't worth the trouble. (10) Life in the Matrix: Appropriate Responses to Illusory Stimuli The matrix is designed to co nfound humatons at every availa ble opportunity and by any means necessary. AI does not have a sense of humour, but it does seem to understand the concept of irony, and even absurdi ty, and often betrays a distinctly 'human' capacity to mock and tease its prey. The matrix warrior keeps an eye out for these signs and communications, not only because they may provide ammunition for future interaction (recall the comic book villain who wastes time smugly de riding the hero, thereby reveal ing some crucial flaw in his master plan), but also because they may provide some much-needed comic relief. Through"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 46 such 'slip-ups', AI reveals a little of it s personality, and along with it, its quirks and eccentricities, and just possibly, its weaknesse s. AI, for all its brilliance, is almost monumentally obtuse. Here are a few examples. Examples of matrix humour • On a Sears hairdryer: Do not use while sleeping. • On a bag of Fritos: You could be a winner ! No purchase necessary. Details inside. • On a bar of Dial soap: Directions: Use like regular soap. • On a Swanson frozen dinner: Serving suggestion: Defrost. • On a Tesco's Tiramisu Dessert (print ed on bottom): Do not turn upside down. • On a Marks & Spencer Bread Pudding : Product will be hot after heating. • On packaging for a Rowenta iron: Do not iron clothes on body. • On Boots Children's Cough Medi cine: Do not drive a car or operate machinery after taking this medication. • On Nytol Sleep Aid: Warning: May cause drowsiness. • On most brands of Christmas li ghts: For indoor and outdoor use only. • On a Japanese food processor: Not to be used for the other use. • On Sainsbury's peanuts: Warning: contains nuts. • On an American Airlines packet of nut s: Instructions: Open packet, eat nuts. • On a child's Superman costume: Wearing of this garment does not enable you to fly. • On a Swedish chainsaw: Do not attempt to stop chain with your hands or genitals.

See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. Let sleeping dogs lie. Humatons are preprogrammed bei ngs. They are units of information, currency which the matrix moves about in a precisely controlled fa shion, just as world banking moves monies. Wars, plagues, famines, migrations, and so forth, are all the means by which the matrix constantly shifts and rearranges the collect ive economy of human units, i.e., the world population. As above, so below. A humaton has no self or i dentity to speak of, but ra ther consists of an arrangement of thoughts, belie fs, and habits (preprogrammed responses), units of information which constantly reshuffle themselves in order to remain stable and create a sense of unity and purpose. A hum aton is basically a collective, made up of 'tics', reflexes to the continuous barrage of stimul i provided by the matrix progr am itself. Humatons do not think for themselves. Their so-called 'minds' are actually intricate recordings fixed on a loop of endless repetition. The variations, as such, seem infinite, to the point that most humatons never suspect that their thoughts are merely copies or reruns of previous thoughts, most of which are not even their own. Since they have no means of comparison, they never realize that their much-treasured individual ity is merely the construct of a collective matrix, and that all constructs consist of the same basic comp onents. Nonetheless, plenty of clues do exist to indicate this shocking truth. If humatons follow these clues, and are prepared to accept unflinchingly their meaning, they may then embark on the painful process of unplugging, and so over time become matrix warriors. The wholly homogeneous nature of human belief, aspira tion, and pursuit is the largest and most irrefutable clue of them all; yet most humatons, even the most erudite and intellectually inclined, fail to remark upon this homogeneity. To an obviously lesser extent, the manner in which humatons talk - both their preferred topics of conversation and their vocal styles - is also a clue, and serves to alert the di scerning humaton to the futility of matrix living. Ironically, the homogeneous speech pattern phenomen on is particularly evident in the youth, who pepper their conversation with meaningless vocal emphases such as 'You know,' 'I guess,' 'like,' 'right,' and above all, 'fuck.' 'S o this fucking guy, right, he's like, fucked up, y'know. So, like, fuck it, I said; fuck that shit, like y'know, who gi ves a fuck, right ? Why fuck around, y'know ?' Young humatons do not seem to be aware that they can talk for hours without actually saying anything. Older humatons do not resort to meaningless profanity with quite the same insistence (being forced to operate in the work place, with their in-laws, and suchlike, tends to 'refine' their 'manners' somewhat); but the same or similar tics remains. Listen to just about any American humaton talk for two minutes and obs erve how many times he or she uses the phrase 'you know.' Where does this inane phrase co me from ? From the matrix. It is part of the means by which humanity (or humatonity) keeps itself hardwired to a sense of solidarity, of consensus, collective meaning, never suspecti ng that the price of su ch 'solidarity' and 'belonging' is that of indivi duality and, if you get right down to it, existence itself. A far more insidious example of humatons' homogeneous nat ure is their preoccupation with utterly banal subjects, and their assigning of a disproportionate am ount of emotional fascination to things that, logically, they ought not give a damn about. The price of vegetables and the weather are common clic hes of small talk. I don't know about vegetables, but humatons do talk incessantly about the price of things in the matrix; they compare relative"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 48 bargains with rip-offs, and above all love to tell stories about the great deals they managed to stumble upon. And yet, if humatons were to brag in a similar fashi on (for bragging is what it is, though humatons tend to be too timid to ever do so openly) about shopl ifting or sneaking into a movie theatre, they would be ostracized fr om the conversation, or at best viewed with suspicion. This is the standard which the matr ix imposes. It is permissible, even encouraged, to be mean, petty, mercenary, and obsessed with monet ary matters. But it is not permitted to be rebellious, anarchic, unruly, or above all disrespectful of money (as well as other basic matrix 'values' such as family, romance, TV, etc). Preoccupation with weather might seem to be another perfectly practical concern, but as with money matters, humatons talk about the weather in a manner that is to a large degree incompatible with any practical application. As soon as the weather comes up, humatons are able to slide comfortably on to autopilot, and can exchange banalities almost indefinitely. Their eyes glaze over and they settle into the warm, fuzzy feeling that comes from the certainty that no original or challenging thoughts will be required of them or directed at them, so posing a threat to their sl umbersome state. Another dead giveaway that the matrix has hijacked a group conversation is when humatons begin to exchange information about the means by which they got to wherever they ar e, their mode of transport, the exact logistical details of the process of arrival, all adding up to a complete run-down of their movements of the previous hour or so. Humatons talk about su ch matters as if they were army generals discussing the previous day's battle, and preparing future strategies for wars to come. They can literally spend hours (let's face it, they can spend their whole lives) discussing utterly trivial details as if they were working on the cu re for cancer. This collective insanity brilliantly disguises itself as a wholly ban al kind of fixation, abov e all on material factors such as food, money, transportation, domestic refurbishments, new acquisitions, tec hnological appliances, and of course, job details. In other words, items and pursuits perti nent to the matrix. Humatons, being wholly disconnec ted from the organic matrix of Nature and instincts, have created a surrogate means to occupy themselves at a purely animalistic level. Beasts of the jungle focus on food, shelter, ma ting, potential predators, and so fo rth, because not to do so would be to override their instin cts and jeopardize their survival. They have no real choice about it, and besides, their focus or 'concern' is constantly supported by internal and external factors (hunger, the elements, predatorial dangers, etc). Their concerns are genuine responses to the environment. Since humatons have no such natural stimuli, either within or without, the matrix invents them, along with the appropriate responses. What humatons are really concerned with is the total emptine ss and dreariness of their lives, and the gaping abyss inside them, their complete lack of identi ty. So they receive with gratitude the external problems and inner worry which the matrix sends them, as a means to keep this incipient terror and despair at bay."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" Fig 11: Humatons' hamster wheel of 'interest' Fig 12: The three-fold purpose of the warrior When humatons get together, they conspire to focus only upon items and events that serve to consolidate their sense of security and togetherness, and these are the things that actually define (and confine) them as humatons. In actual fact, unlike animals, most humatons don't need to worry about the weather, food, work, or transport, because the matrix has provided all these things in order to keep us dependent upon it (as well as sufficiently comfortable not to question our lives overly). On the other hand, and as a general rule, the matrix keeps its favours, though constant, wholly conditional, creat ing a collective sense of uncertainty as to just how long these favours will last. The house is mortgaged, the job is unstable, the price of transport keeps on going up, and so on and so fort h. This way, humatons cannot afford to relax and take any of these things for granted, and so are unable to concentrate on other things, such as creative activity. Also, th rough media channels, the matrix keeps the privileged humatons aware of how privileged they are by giving them images of starving populations, bombed schools and chur ches, diseased children, an d other suffering minorities. Above all, the matrix needs to keep its units plugged in, not just open to but actively grateful for all the comforts and support (and values !) wh ich it provides them with. This way, any MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 50 possibility of humatons questioning the matrix, much less rebelling against it, is kept to the absolute minimum. Matrix warriors — humatons who have begun to rebel and unplug — are therefore a rare occurrence, and tend to be viewed by other humatons as at best an aberration, at worst a sort of disease. They ar e units in revolt against the collective economy and need to be purged. Above all, what gives rise to suspicion and resentment in the average humaton is the matrix warrior's apparent indifference to things that the humaton considers so important. Warriors must be carefu l not to give offence with th eir flagrant disregard for the program, since to humatons this amounts to a disregard for human values, and makes the warriors appear to be psychopaths. Since matrix warriors swim not wit h but against the current, they mu st take the utmost care to conceal this fact from humatons, for they ar e the current warriors are swimming against. Humatons take offence very easily. Anyone they perceive as a threat to their security they can turn upon, like a wild animal protecting its y oung. For this reason matrix warriors are the soul of subtlety and courtesy when it comes to waking up their fellow humatons. They won't talk about the weather or modes of transport, and they have no personal history as such to share (at least not the mundane ki nd humatons are seeking); but they are compelled to guide the conversation as naturally as possible in to more creative and unmapped areas. These areas are outside the field of c oncern which the matrix provides for humatons; they are like a wilderness that humatons rarely, if ever, venture into. By su staining eye contact, asking the right questions (searching but not impertinent, personal without being presumptuous) and by arousing curiosity with their innate confidence and clarity, the matrix warriors can bring most humatons briefly out of the repeat ing loop of their thoughts; befor e they know it, they will be experiencing the illicit thrill of original (or at least fresh and ne w) thoughts. They will be like teenagers having sex fo r the first time. Matrix warriors amuse themselves in this manner, though their motives are anything but personal amusement. Since it is humatons who keep the matrix in place, the more of them that can be gently led towards unplugging, the less hold the ma trix will have over a matrix warrior's own thoughts and actions. A matrix warrior's work is never done, not until the very last humaton is unplugged. Despite programmed resistance to the 'red pill philosophies' of matrix warriors and sorcerers, humatons - at least those with some remaining spark of creativity within them (those who feel that splinter in their br ains) - are easily seduced by the alternative options on offer. By the time they are in their late 20s or early 30s, humatons have accepted that life is basically a rigged game, that things don 't go the way they would like them to, that the innocent are not protected, justice does not prevail, and the truth will not out, at least in their lifetimes. T hey are resigned to a ceaseless struggle and an endless life of drudgery, in which half their time is spent slav ing at jobs they have no interest for, and the other half vacationing and recuperating from this voluntary enslavement. Humatons (assuming they aren't living on th e street or junked to the eyeba lls) slave their lives away and invest their time and energy in a system, an 'ec onomy', that they never really believe in, for the simple reason that they have no faith in any viable alternat ive. They dream of getting out, but these dreams only serve to placate them and resign them to their 'reality'. Instead of acting on these dreams, they simply take temporary refuge in them . Thus life in the matrix is for most humatons a continuous process of embitterment and disillu sionment that ends, finally (and far too soon), in death. Life in the matrix is a constant struggle for the matrix warriors, too, and disillusionment is the essence of their journey. But there is no bitter ness in the life of a warrior. Since they know everything is an illusion, they are more than happy to be rid of these illusions, and so can celebrate the process rather t han lament it. This is the basi c difference between the humaton and the warrior: humatons hang on to what t hey've got even though it only makes them weak, dependent, and miserable. Matrix warriors let it all go, and know they have not lost a thing. Although they are hooked into the same flux and flow, the same economy, as other"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 51 humatons, the warriors have learnt how to antic ipate the ups and down of the program, and so, rather than allow themselves to be thrown this way and that, they ride the wave. Though they may appear to be going against the current, in actual fact, over time, they are able to time their moves in order to slip through it, to ride the waves they can ride, and dodge the ones they can't, until they have the confidenc e to surf all the way to freedom. Their movements as a unit of currency within the collective economy of t he matrix, therefore, become erratic, unpredictable. They don't go up an d down with the tide unless it suits their purposes to do so; and they never, ever inve st all their monies in a single stock. Like a master trader with the almo st supernatural ability to predi ct the motions of the market place, matrix warriors are foreve r changing their avenues of pursuit. They buy and sell so fast that they are never caught holdi ng onto a loser's stock. This is to say (since we've already established that matrix warriors don't partake of the marketplace of their fellow humatons), their acts are always directed towards reapi ng the maximum energy 'pay-off' in any given situation. The moment they get a sense that things are leading nowhere, they change tack, or else simply leave. Matrix warriors must impr ovise at all times, and it is this constant improvisation that makes their acts impossible to chart. Matrix warriors are like traders on the lookout for situations (as opposed to stocks and bonds) in which to invest their time and energy. And like traders, they have no personal interest or preference as to the given nature of any particular situation in which to invest. The only consideration is whether they can extract information or experie nce from it, and so increase their energy levels. It is this focus on the en d and detachment from the means that gives the matrix warrior both the speed and the grace (a de licate blend of intensity with serenity) that other humatons cannot fail to notice and admire (or at least envy). For, lik e the master of the universe who has turned the entir e stock market into his play ground, warriors are fully at home in the matrix, even though (because) they know they do not belong there. They have learnt to use the obstacles and problems which the matrix throws at them, 24/7, as stimuli for their creativity, hurdles with which to train the muscles of their will, and endless opportunities for improvisation. With the alertness of soldiers going to war, and the fl uidity and elan of the sportsman entering his gam e, warriors engage the matrix in a ba tde of wits, according to the rules laid down by it, but on their own terms. And the matrix warriors' terms are simply this: they are here to learn, to gat her knowledge and turn it into powe r, and to enjoy themselves to the full while doing so. This is life in the matrix, and any other perspective is unworthy of the matrix warrior. (11) You Are Not You: Life as Simulacra To warriors the matrix universe is nothing other than God playing games with Himself; but surely, matrix warriors ask themselves, t here are games other than hide-and-seek ? Exposing the matrix is all about the will: the will to grow , the will to change. In the early days of the matrix warrior's struggle, such a will seems inextricably bound up with the idea of sacrifice, but this is an illusion. The av erage humaton stumbles th rough life with no idea of what is good for him and what is bad. It is a ll a crapshoot: some things make him happy and strong, others weaken him and lead to despair. The idea of a genuine alternative (the warrior's way, the possibility of unplugging) is dim and distant, maybe even non-existent. Over time, and with any luck, this idea comes closer, clearer, and humatons begin to observe that there is a rhyme and reason, a 'karma', if you will, that governs their actions and determines their well-being within the matrix. Some things they do pertain to their will, others do not. Humatons, slowly turning into warriors, may observe which is which by how their thoughts"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 52 and acts make them feel, and by their results. In the early days, walking the warrior's path wit hin the matrix is a hit and miss affair. Our humatons-who-would-be-warriors are never really su re, and even when they are sure, it is just too damn hard to obey their instincts, to adhere to 'the right way'. This is the period between the blissful ignorance of the blue pill and the pa inful enlightenment of the red: would- be-warriors are like toddlers, not able to walk on their own two feet, but sick and tired of the comforts of the crib. They know what they must do but fight it anyway; it is a constant chore and burden to do the right thing, to ignore the in sidious whisperings of the matrix that says 'sleep, sleep, sleep.' There is a war r aging between the false ego and the true Self. This period of perpetual suffering is a long, seemingly interminable period, and most humatons live and die caught in the wheel of their pain and desire. But over time, if the humaton endures, something begins to change. Little by little, they actually begin to experience the rewards of the warrior's path. Habits, routines, addictions, all begin to fall away quite naturally, until they find that it is easier to act like a warrior than not to. There is a shift in the balance, the false mi nd begins to lose its hold, and t he true Self begins to assume its rightful place in the scheme of things. The Ki ngdom of the Soul is brought back into order, as the King approaches. In t he end, what was once a sacrific e to the humaton becomes a delight to the matrix warrior. Do ing what they 'ought' to do becomes simply doing what they want to do. Finally, impeccable action is indi stinguishable from spontaneous action, from doing whatever they damn well pl ease. But for most humatons, this coveted state of grace remains a vague and evasive concept. This is bec ause they lack energy. The matrix warrior's path of impeccability is the only way to gather the necessary energy to finally see the code, and understand the whys and the wher efores of such a path. In the early stages, faith, trus t, even blind devotion, to an in visible, hypothetical Greater Power are indeed necessary, in one form or another. Matrix warriors must trust that there is Something that knows what is good for them. T hey believe in the Lucids of the real world, even if they cannot communicate with them. Since their own desires have only led them ever deeper into confusion and despair, matrix warriors know they can not trust their judgments in the long run. Sheer desper ation is what brings most humatons out of th e matrix, what drives them to accept the red pill. To become a fully functional Lucid, the price is not the soul, sold to the devil, but the false mind given us by the matrix. The Lucids take over and the matrix self is overwhelmed, there then occurs a forgetfulness that is really a remembrance; enlightenment so-called. In the early scenes of The Matrix, while Thomas is still only dimly aware of his purpose (since he is a matrix warrior with his own cybername, it's fair to say that he's aware of his path but has yet to begin walking it), he receives various loaded 'signs' from his environment as to the nature of his purpose. After waking to Trinity' s cryptic message, 'The matrix has you,' and being advised to 'follow the white rabbit,' Thom as has an exchange with Troy, his client. Troy tells Thomas, 'You're my saviour. My own personal Jesus Christ.' Thomas shares with Troy his bewilderment regarding his inability to tell waking from dreaming, whereupon Troy tells Thomas, 'You just need to unplug, man.' Obviously the humaton Troy does not know what he's saying; he is unaware of being the carrier (a Trojan Horse, perhaps ?) of a none-too- coded message meant expressly for Neo. Nonet heless, Troy is speaking for Thomas's unconscious, his alter ego. Ditto Troy's playma te with the white rabbit tattooed on her shoulder, who unwittingly leads Thomas to Trinity. The question is, have these two 'carriers' or messengers been 'programmed' by Morpheus and his team, hacking into the 'mainframe' ? Or are they evidence that the matrix is responding to Thomas's own unconscious ? And is there a difference ? Though it seems to be stretching the limits of coincidence for Thomas to be visited by a wh ite rabbit tattoo right before his trip into Wonderland, the alternativ e is that Morpheus and hi s crew have the ability"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 53 to create events in the matrix, while acting from the real wo rld (an ability not demonstrated anywhere else in the movie). Mo re likely, then, what we are seeing (besides the Wachowskis being clever-clever with meaningful dialogue t hat will only make sense on a second viewing) is how life in the matrix reflects and echo es the workings of the humatons' unconscious. Thomas, being a matrix warrior, is sending himself messages, using the elements of the dream to do so. This is the onset of lucidity, but it is not lucidity per se. Thomas still doesn't know he's dreaming, but he's beginn ing to suspect. As a result, he's starting to unconsciously shape the contents of the dream towards an awakening within it, and, eventually, an awakening from it. In the early stages, when matrix warriors begin to question the reality of their environment and the reliability of their own perceptions and t houghts — to challenge the program - they become progressively less compatible with it and the matrix begins to reject them, as viruses. For this reason the matrix appears to be assisti ng the warriors. Since bot h the matrix and the warrior share a common goal now - that of separation - they are in a sense working together, albeit at odds. The matr ix wants to remove the virus, and t he matrix warriors want to quit the program. So there is an uneasy, mostly unconsci ous collaboration occurring, in which the matrix warriors' lives begin to assume a str angely irrational quality, where 'coincidences' abound and events seems to be orchestrated deliberately to confound, bewilder, and unhinge them. What is happening is that t hey are becoming aware of the matr ix and, in a sense, AI is becoming aware of them. To most humatons this strange overlap of dream and reality, inner and outer, subjective and objective experienc e, marks the onset of schizophrenia. To a matrix warrior it is something else: the early st irrings of will, the firs t ripples of awakening. And so the life of the matrix warrior, as it becomes progressi vely more unreal and loaded with hidden meanings and bizarre pers onal touches, begins to transmogrify into a myth. At this point, matrix warriors are compelled to reappraise not only their current circumstances but also their past ones. They must question their whole lives, and go through their memories with a fine tooth comb in order to seek the hidden meanings, the code or subtext, which they missed the first time around. This is known as the sorcerer's recapitu lation, and it is the primary means by which warriors gather the energy needed to unplug forever from the matrix and enter into the totality of them selves (namely, the real world). The reason for this is that every single memory is an implant, a plug-in point to the matrix, every last one of which must be severed. Every thought, every feeling, every sensory impression of an entire life must be relived and recognized as the illusory blind mat it is, and, at the same time, examined for the instructional data that it offers. When matrix warriors unplug and become matrix sorcerers, their previous lives become just a dream, a memory of something that neve r happened. And yet they still retain these memories, even if they can no lo nger allow themselves to be defi ned by them. So they reject the program that gave t hem the implants (implants designed to trick them into believing they are something they are not), but hold on to the experience, the knowledge, wisdom, and insight which these quasi-events provided. They re ject the implants but re tain the data, or at least those parts of it that they can use. This way, they still remember who they 'are', while knowing that they aren't, that they are infinitely more than w hatever the matrix told them they were. Their identities then become a sort of shi fting point of entry into the matrix, providing context and orientation, without ever stripping them of their freedom. The recapitulation is the means by which warrior s realize that their lives are but a simulation, and thereby learn to live free fr om the ties and blocks of a fi xed identity. They claim their power as simulacra, as holograms. They ar e none of this because they are all of it. Recapitulation is the means of returning all the im plants to the matrix in order to fully unplug from it. Since, if warriors unpl ug without the necessary preparation, they will die or lose their minds, it is necessary to take stock of one's whole life before unloading it forever. A good"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"simile would perhaps be that of making a back-up copy c ontaining all the necessary data before cleaning the hard drive. This way matrix warriors reta in their basic life experiences, or rather a perfect copy of them , while leaving the original on the hard drive; they then disconnect from the mainframe, and wipe the record clean. Hence t he matrix (the hard drive) no longer has any record of the warriors' exist ence; and so to all in tents and purposes, they do not exist. Yet the matrix warriors, now sorc erers, retain their individuality. They have effectively died and been reborn, with all me mories of their former lives intact. Fig 13: Means by which the matrix warrior tricks AI and attains partial freedom To matrix sorcerers, time, like space, is something mutable. It can be stretched or compressed, speeded up or slowed down; it can even be made to disappear entirely. A matrix sorcerer lives life not in terms of years but in terms of seconds and minutes. As such, a sorcerer's time in the matrix is infinitely long, and at the same time, since they take each moment as it comes, it is all just a brief, fleet ing instant. Matrix sorcer ers can move in and out of their matrix lives at will, returning to the precise moment at which they exited as if no time has passed. Morpheus tells Neo that the Oracle has been with t hem 'since the beginning', meaning roughly two hundred years. (Clearly, a hologram has no half-life, yet how her consciousness has remained integrated for so long without a physical body is only explained in the sequel: the Oracle is, like the Gatekeepers, a sentient program. This doesn't necessarily make her untrustworthy, however, only unfathomable.) Of course, time does not actually pass in the matrix, any way, but only appears to do so. Since there is no future for the civilization which it simulates, there is no way AI can ever 'construct' such a future. So essentially time has stood still and humatonity is frozen in the moment, a moment of hyperactivity in which 'billions of people live out their lives, oblivious.' Once unplugged, sorcerers theoretically never have to enter the matrix again. But in practice, and considering the fact that their 2nd attention life in the real world is so undeveloped, and MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 55 presumably unsatisfying to them, t hey really have no choice. Like bodhisattvas , they cannot become free of the matrix until every last humaton has been unplugged, even if they (the humatons) must die in the process. Sorcerers throw away their ma trix lives, their place in the program; they erase their data fr om the hard drive. But they keep replicas, back-up copies, for whenever they want or need to plug in' again. When sorcerers enter t he matrix, they do so by conscious choice, because they will it, and wit h a specific goal and strategy in mind. When Neo realizes that he can sa ve Morpheus, even though he no lo nger believes that he is the One, he takes the initiative and, in a matte r of seconds, comes up with a rescue mission. Tank assures him it's suicide, and Trinity tells him, 'Nothing like this has ever been done before.' 'That's why it's going to work,' says Neo. He is already beginning to believe. What Neo believes is that, since the matrix is built around a pr ogram that is merely the sum of its various commands, that is upheld by a continuity that is entirely arbitrary and false, all he has to do is to break with this continuity - to reject the program - and the rules will start to change, the program will collapse. He is a virus. His mere presence changes everything. Not even Morpheus is aware of this, or at leas t not yet. (Ironically, at about the same time Neo is planning his rescue, Morpheus is being mocked by Ag ent Smith that the human race is not a mammal species but a strain of virus, a 'plague' for which AI is the cure.) Morpheus knows that without the One the whole 'resistance' is futile , because not a single matrix sorcerer has been able to stand against a Gate keeper without dying. In which case, all the matrix sorcerers in the world wo n't change a thing, unless they have learnt to see the code and graduated to the Lucid stage. At which point, they will unravel the whole program simply by entering into it, and begin to remake the world as they see fi t. Their eventual end is that of unplugging every last humaton and shutting down the matrix hard drive forever. Within the mainframe of the prog ram, the potential of an acting Lucid (Neo being the first) is inconceivable, infinite. This is why the Gatek eepers flee from Neo at the end. There is no way for them to assimilate, much less combat, his exis tence. The fact that he is, spells the end of everything. Neo is in a daze of attainment by now. He has become the butterfly; he still sees the chrysalis - as residual memory - only now he s ees it for what it is, not a dark confinement but an entry point to a new worl d. He sees the code. When t he Gatekeepers try to kill him again, he says simply, 'No.' This is his first co mmand in the old program, the word of power of the Magus: 'Program cancelled.' Agent Smith's fastest blows appear to be in slow motion to Neo. Time no longer holds him, just as space cannot contai n him. He is Lucid, and this dream is his. Neo charges Agent Smith and dives right insi de him. He disappears. This is a symbolic enactment of his rebirth, wher eby Agent Smith becomes the chrysalis, exploded from within. Neo doesn't even have to think about what he's doi ng now; he can't think. All that is gone from him. He is pure imaginat ion, true will, in every way perfect. All he can do is act; and being the One, he can do no wrong. The reloading has begun."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 56 (4) Fourth Variable Walking the Path (12) The Lucid's View Sex (The Woman in the Red Dress) Even though it's a kiss that saves the world (Tri nity's kiss of life brings Neo back from the dead), sex is pretty scarce in The Matrix. It follows that matrix sorcerers, at least, don't have much time for sex. They would have little in terest in the virtual kind; and even less opportunity for the real thing. On board the Nebuchadnezzar , we never get to know who's sleeping with whom, or even if anyone is (Apoc and Switch appear to be an item). In fact, the only overt reference to sex is 'the woman in the red dress', Mouse's virtual fuck-doll, designed for the training program expres sly as a warning on the dangers of being distracted while in the matrix. The woman in the red dress turns into a Gatekeeper and would certainly have axed Neo had the situati on been for real. Watch those sensual desires ! Mouse, the 'virtual pimp,' offers this scarlet woman's services to Neo, offering to a rrange a more intimate meeting with her. Since the other crew members are already fa miliar with Mouse's little side business, it suggests that they do occasionally succumb to temp tation, albeit in a strictly controlled environment (safe cyber sex). Since they have training programs, it's logical that they would have any other kind of program they might desire, including fucking programs. What would it be like to have sex with a simula tion, knowing that it had no existence, not even as a projection of a sleeping mind ? (Those in the training program, since it's not the matrix proper, are not residual memories but si mple computer constructs.) It's easy enough to imagine Mouse or Cypher indulg ing their impulses in such a seedy fashion, but less easy to picture Morpheus or Trinity succumbing to temptation. (Cypher and Mouse hardly seem like warriors at all, much le ss sorcerers.) Trinity has the purity of a Madonna assassin; her focus and discipline don't allow fo r ordinary feelings like sentim entality or desire, much less lust or loneliness. When she fall s for Neo it is as the fulfilm ent of the prophecy, and as the necessary means of Neo's rebirth as the One. Re ferences are made to Neo's pretty eyes and his cuteness, but it's hard to imagine Thomas Anderson having much of a sex-life. That splinter in his brain just wouldn' t allow it. As for Morpheus, he is about as sexually motivated as a statue. Although he radiates magnetism and vi rility, there's something slightly effete about him; he's almost fey. He seems no more interested in sex than he would be in strawberry ice cream or pop music. The general consensus for matrix sorcerers seems to be that sex is either a lewd and slightly sordid indulgence, a potentially deadly distraction, a total irrelevance, or else an act of world- saving numinosity. It seems logi cal that, since matrix warriors' prime concern is that of energy, and since sex is the most energy-consum ing and/or -creating act they can engage in, it would be viewed with corresponding gravitas , and handled with the utmost care and respect. For humatons, sex, along with money and food, is one third of the unholy trinity of desire. Humatons pursue sex relendessly and yet seem bar ely able to enjoy it when they get it. The matrix uses sex, along with de ath, as the primary emotiona l control mechanism to keep humatons enslaved. The matrix program, being above all anti- nature and counter-organic, is informed by a deep-rooted mistrust of all bodily functions. (A gent Smith admits to Morpheus that he is driven to destroy Zion above all so he can escape t he matrix, because he is unable"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 57 to stand the smell.) This mistrust or distaste is inculcated into hu matons from birth - itself an obscene ritual - and leads to an overwhelming s ense of fear and nausea at all things relating to sexuality and physicality. Huma tons love sport because it's a surrogate primal activity with none of the intimacy and messiness of sex. Humatons ' fear of sex goes deeper than merely distaste for the bodily functions, however (functions which, above all, serve to remind them of death); it relates to the threat of exposure which sexual union entails. Real sex (even in the matrix, where nothing is real) involves intima cy, an overriding of the intellect and of self- concern, the 'little death' of the ego, and a return to a pure, primal stat e of consciousness. It is potentially the most creat ive act there is, and hence the most effective means of unplugging, even if only temporarily. Since AI will do anything to prevent such a possibility, it has created a program in whic h natural sexuality is almo st anathema to humatons (for example, in the matrix, nakedness = indecency) , in which sex is a commodity, a means to titillate and excite, sell products, and ultimate ly frustrate with its u navailability; it is everywhere on offer and nowhere to be had. This situation creates a prevailing tension in humatons, whereby they desire sex without ever feeling comfortable about it. Since their desire is instilled in th em by ice cream commercials and bi llboards, it's no wonder they are suspicious of it. As a result, when they seek sex, humatons do so in much the same way they pursue any other desire, as a consumer seeking a commodity. And yet the primal need for sex remains, and the incompatibi lity of the physical need for pr ocreation (and intimacy) with the conscious desire for gratification cr eates a schizophrenia in which humatons simultaneously fear what they desire, and desire what they fear. Hence, when sex is attained, humatons tend to be too confused emotionally and too divided psychologically to really enjoy it. They wind up going through the motions in an animalistic (actually machine-like) fashion. This is how AI sees sex, and hum atons imitate their master. Since AI is incapable of empathy or intimacy of any kind, every act, including that of sex, is isolated, cold, and controlling. Most humatons 'make love' purely as an act of self-i ndulgence; they masturba te in pairs, with no real connection between t hem. They even close their eyes when they do it. If they make anything, besides more humaton babies to feed A I, it certainly isn't lo ve. For this reason matrix warriors are inclined towards celi bacy, though on occasion they may go to the opposite extreme. The most effective red pill there is, after a ll, is a good fuck from a matrix sorcerer. Death Along with sexual sham e, the fear of death is the means by which the matrix controls humatons and keeps them enthra lled. Fear of death creates a state of denial in which humatons exist, as if in suspended animation. In order to fend off their te rror, they refuse to think or talk about death at all, save when indulging in regret ov er its 'tragic' aspects, or in excitement for its sensational ones. Thus humatons live their lives as if death was never going to touch them, as if they had all the time in the world. Primitive cultures have always had a healthy respect and fasci nation for the death process, and even attempted to explore the realms of the afterlife. Initiation ceremonies were mandatory for any warrior on coming of age, and becoming a man invariably meant undergoing ordeals that led to a full awareness of death. In the matrix, humatons are deprived of any such coming-of-age ritual, and so they remain perpetual adolescents. Humaton children, as they r each puberty or even earlier, genera lly experience awe and terror as the idea of death begins to ta ke hold in their lives. Since th eir culture never provides any instruction to help them deal with these feelings, they soon repress them, along with any thought of death. Instead, they are fobbed off with hand-me-down articles of religious 'faith' such as 'heaven' and 'hell'. Most humatons either accept these articles blindly, or else think about them for a while and then reject them out of hand. Eithfer way, they rarely if ever allow the idea of death — of eternity - to become an active, creative forc e in their lives. For matrix"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 58 warriors it is an altogether different affair. The idea of death is a pr imary one on the matrix warrior's path. It gives sobriety, perspective , detachment, and courage. Matrix warriors think about their deaths daily, hourly. They actively realize that it is not some indistinct, far distant possibility, but an inevitable real ity around the very next corner. That the day, the hour, the second will come when they are faced with eter nity, and life will be reduced to nothing. To matrix warriors, the only moment that counts is the moment of death. Awareness of death not only reduces all the warriors' worries, concerns , and desires to petty inconsequentiality, it also imbues their thoughts and actions with a m ystery and a power that they are otherwise lacking. Matrix warriors use th en-death, let it guide them, advise them, and empower them. Death is their only companion in this life. There is no company richer and more stimulating than that of death. The idea of death is, for the matrix warrior , inextricably bound up with the idea of freedom. Though death does not necessarily spell freedom, freedom invariably entails death: death of the self. There is no way around this univ ersal law. Yet fear of the annihilation of self is so intense for some humatons tha t, like Cypher, they prefer eternal damnation to freedom. This is the ultimate choice a matrix warrior can make: red pill or blue pill. Beyond this, the only choice humatons ma ke, as individuals, is whether to have a choice at all: they choose to be warriors or they choose to be ordinary schmucks. Huma tons do not have any say in their future; freedom is not an option fo r them. Warriors, on t he other hand, get to up the stakes to an unimagina ble degree. For matrix wa rriors there is no rest or respite, not even for an instant. The matrix comes at them 24/ 7, and if they are c aught napping for even a nanosecond, they risk losing their chance for a chance at a way out. Drugs From the Lucid point of view, ever ything in the matrix is a drug of some kind in that it is a plug-in to the program, and a means by whic h humatons are made dependent upon it. In a word, addiction. But there are dr ugs and there are drugs. The principal unrecognised 'drug' in matrix culture is TV. Billions of humatons rely utterly on thei r TVs to keep them amused, and would quickly go insane without them. This would be the equivalent of forced unplugging: death or madness. On the other hand, prescribed pharmaceutical drugs, the biggest industry of the matrix military complex, designed in laboratories as cures of every imaginable 'condition' or malfunction, have become the pr imary means by which the matrix keeps humatons safe from despair. The feeling that whatever is wrong with one's life or oneself can be reduced to a chemical imbalance that can t hen be 'cured' by little white pills designed by unknown people with murky motivations is akin to religious faith within the matrix. Humatons believe in the power of science, technology, and chemistry to eventually perfect their existence; they believe this because they have to believe it. Not to do so would be to admit the very opposite, that the so-called cure is rea lly a disease, and that t here is no possibility of escaping their lives, except by dying. Alcohol is the only recognised drug that is st ill permitted a central place in human society. Other so-called recreational drugs such as tobacco, cocaine, speed, MDMA (ecstasy), and marijuana are less socially accept ed in the matrix but equally cent ral to humatons' existence. Humatons will use any means at all to flee from the truth of themselv es, and since they are bred and programmed to be dependent from the outset - and since the matrix never allows them to grow up — they merely shift their dependenc ies on to whatever is at hand. That said, drugs can also be used by humatons, and by ma trix warriors and even sorcerers, as a means to prepare for unplugging. Certain drugs, particularly the psychede lic variety, from marijuana to LSD to DMT, can provide humatons with a glimpse of the true nature of the matrix, a glimpse of 'the code'. This is because they se rve to shut down the ego-mind and to break the flow of rational thought. They scramble the matrix signal and allow the cr eative imagination to surface. Psychedelics 'stop the world' (jam the matrix signal) by causing the interpretation system to collapse and so allowing a new one to take hold temporarily. At which point, the"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 59 psychedelic drug-user 'hallucinates', seeing reality break down and morph into something else, or (as with DMT), goi ng all the way, and witnessing a whole new world with no recognizable features. The ess ence of the psychedelic experienc e is the overlap of the 1st and 2nd attentions, of left and right sides of t he brain, of reason and imagination, objective and subjective perception. This is what Neo undergoes after swallowing the red pill. 'Have you ever had a dream, N eo, that you were so sure was real ? What if you were unable to wake from that dream ? How would you know the diff erence between the dream world and the real world ?' Neo does wake up, because the red pill — or rather the process which taking it makes possible (Morpheus and his crew abduc ting Neo from the matrix a nd wakening him in the real world) - takes him all the way. He collapses his world and assembles a new world, one in which he is now allowed, obliged, to remain. 'I can't go back, can I ?' he asks Morpheus. 'If you could, would you want to ?' Many an LSD user has felt the same way. Relationships Humatons define themselves through others. They are wholly depend ent on what others think of them. As such, they are obsessed, above all, with their relationships, and with the Holy Grail of relationships: the love affair. Humatons, lacking all self-worth or self-knowledge or anything resembling a sense of identity, seek assurance an d consolation — definition — outside of themselves, in other humatons. Their ultimate goal therefore is to find another humaton who will love t hem as they are and provide them with all the comfort, solace, sympathy, and support that they ar e unable to provide for themse lves. Relationships in the matrix are based on need and desire. They are not based on love, or ev en lust (though lust is often the initial factor that br ings humatons together), but on pu rely selfish factors. Humatons seek to have their view of the world reinforced by another, and to establish a complicity whereby they can isolate themselves from the world without feelin g 'lonely'. This complicity is based as much upon fear as on lo ve, and as equally characterized by suspicion as by trust. Like everything else a humaton does, such 'love' is only a simulation, a surrogate for the real thing, a pseudo-relationship. Humatons use each other to reinforce their illu sions, and they invent (with the help of the matrix) concepts such as 'romantic love' in order to justify th eir hopeless egotism and infantile dependency and to disguise it as something noble, beautiful, and transcendental. Of course, love can be precisely this, and just like drugs love relationships can provide humatons with a glimpse of something beyond the ego-self, beyond t he confines of the matrix marketplace of desire. But, as with drugs, t he moment humatons become addict ed to the feelings of love, and so become dependent on them (and humatons get addicted to everything), they are no longer using these feelings for their enlightenment, but rather are stupefied and enslaved by them. This is why almost all love-relationships in the matrix, howeve r golden the promise of their beginnings, end up as desperate, dreary, soul -destroying affairs. They are traps which humatons stay in, simply and who lly from a fear of being alone. After a while, a junky doesn't take heroin because he enjoys it, but because he c annot survive without it. So it is with the humaton, hooked on 'love'. Matrix warriors don't have love a ffairs. Matrix warriors don't ha ve families. Matrix warriors don't have friends. Everybody has to make sacrif ices, but matrix warrior s throw it all away. The reason matrix warriors do not have ordinary friendships is because they are not ruled by ordinary social mores, or by the rules of the matrix. And si nce friendship, like family, like romantic relationships, like all the rest, is a ma trix-imposed thing, warri ors tend to get tangled up hopelessly trying to be true to themselves wh ile still adhering to these 'rules'. Matrix sorcerers are self-directed, se lf-orientated, and self-c entred. And yet they have no self to speak of, since they have given their selves up to the cause, that of freedom. (The matrix has"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 60 perverted this into legends of sorcerers selling t heir souls to the Devil, and other absurdities.) Matrix sorcerers cannot view life in terms of blessings or curses, but only in terms of challenge. Likewise, they cannot view the people in their lives as friends or enemies, but only as teachers/combatants. Blake wr ote that 'Friendship is oppositio n.' To matrix sorcerers this is a living truth; by the same token (if a fr iend is an opponent), an enemy is one who allows or encourages them to be dormant, complacent, w ho does not challenge or oppose them but merely placates or restricts them. So far as the matrix actively opposes their actions, sorcerers can use it to spur them to freedom. It is only when the matrix softens them with its favours that they are in danger of being defeated. The only sin to matrix sorcerers is the sin of restriction: that which deni es them the freedom and the righ t to express their true natures to the full. Hence, there is absolutely no pl ace in a matrix sorcerer's relationships for expectations, assumptions, or at tachments. Matrix sorcerers vi ew everyone in their lives as they view themselves, as a total mystery, beautiful and terrible in equal proportions. Dreams Humatons do not dream; the reason for this is t hat AI has stolen their dreams in order to assemble the matrix with them . And since the life of the av erage humaton is no more nor less than an extended, collective dream, humatons hav e a built-in resistance to and disdain for the whole subject of dr eams. Matrix warriors, on the other hand, know that dreams are their only avenue to reality. Since they are alread y asleep and dreaming their lives, when they sleep and dream within the matrix, t hey know that it is their reason that is put to sleep; it is at such times that the creative imagination may take over. Matr ix dreams are dreams within dreams; they are like windows to the 2nd attention, to reality. Most humatons only dream at a superficial level, of events and times from the matrix, reshuffled into bizarre new formations. When they sleep, humatons are haunted and pursued by frustrations from their 'waking life', by unmet desires and unfaced fear s. These are the only kind of dreams they recall, because they are the dreams that are compatible with life in the matrix, t he only life they know. Deeper dreams, dreams that take them out of their rati onal concerns and material pursuits into other worlds, humatons tend to forget entirely. Imagine humatons sleepi ng. Their bodies in the real world are now dreaming of being asleep. If the sleep goes deep enough, they may even awaken momentarily in the real world. Would humatons remember such a thing ? And if so, what else could they think - on returning to the matrix with memories of some outlandish other world in which they were someone else altogether - but that they had eaten too much cheese the night before ? Matrix warriors see their dreams very differently. They practise dreaming . They know that when their false selves are asleep, their double or true selves (see Glossary) may awaken. Like sex and drugs, dreams are a means to stop the world and access reality, to assemble a new interpretation and so accelerate the proce ss of unplugging from the old. Matrix warriors are like schizophrenics who know the difference between dream an d reality but who pay it no mind. As a means of attaining lu cidity and seeking power, dreams are infinitely more real to the warrior than life in t he matrix could ever be. Religion True religion, being the means of reconnecting to a higher power, or true reality, is the very essence of every matrix warrior's and sorcerer's purpose. And yet, since matrix warriors know that the only way to reconnect to reality is by first unplugging from the matrix, they may appear to the average humaton to be profoundly anti-religious , even sacrilegious. For humatons, religion is not a means for connecting to the truth but a means of not having to think about it too much. Huma ton religion provides answer s to ready-made questions, and forbids any questions for which it has no answe rs. It is that part of the matrix program"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 61 designed to sublimate and divert the spiritual instinct of humatons , the drive in them to seek higher meaning. By provid ing a low-grade imitation of this meaning in the various world religions, it serves to placate any humatons undiscerning enough to accept such second-rate explanations. At the sa me time, it likewise misleads the re mainder of humatons, who dismiss the whole question of 'higher meaning' on the paltry and rigged evi dence of these quasi- religions. New Ageism is the latest and most lacklustre example of this process. When human potential movements began to tap into the po wer of the will, there was a danger that, through such ideas, the collective would start to awaken, and to reject the program. All the matrix values would be suppl anted, by the search for true va lues within. Since AI depends above all on a consensus belief system by which to enslave humatons, this would spell the end of the matrix. New Age philosophies quickly reduced this danger by once again denigrating the message in order to appeal to the lowest common denominator, thereby stripping it of any trut hs that might in any way empower humatons, and leaving only the soft, sticky bits, of no real use to anyone. To the matrix warrior and sorcerer both, belief is belief in the self, and above all in the power of the creative imagination. Matr ix sorcerers know that the wo rld is a figment of their own mind and that they are dreaming it all, that they ar e creating it with their attention . Without this attention, it will all disappe ar in a flash. They know that al l beliefs besides this one belong to the matrix, be they belief in democracy, science, soul, or God Himself. They are all but components of the big lie. Nothing is real save perception. The only 'G od' matrix sorcerers recognize is in themselves, that is, in their potential to become Lucid and to mould reality as they see fit. Thus, to the sorcerer religion is not a matter of faith but of works. The matrix sorcerer knows that the only way to know God is to become God. Or, as Morpheus puts it to Neo, 'There's a difference between know ing the path, and walking the path.' Art Humatons love to be entertained, and the more sophisticated of them have a hankering after what they call 'culture', belie ving it will bestow on them dignity and grant them an extra degree of respect and popularity within their social circles. Art is seen as a commodity, a source of amusement and edifica tion, but also as something to aspire to. Many humatons admire artists, even when they don' t really understand or appreciate their 'art'. They aspire to being 'creative', even when they have no inkling of what it is they wish to express. Creativity is 'cool'. It's even sexy, because it shows an indi vidual, rebellious spirit. Yet the majority of humatons never even get so far as to dabble in creativ e expression. Their id ea of an artist is a rock star or movie actor, or, at a pinch, an experimen tal filmmaker. Art in the matrix centres around the cult of personality. One only has to create something and make some money doing it to be considered 'an artist', In most cases, it matters little if the artwork itself has any intrinsic value or interest; the mere fact of be coming established through creativity is enough to grant the humaton superior st atus. In the same way, a b ook, by being published, gains credibility, or a news st ory covered on CNN is assumed to be 'true'. Humatons are gullible to an extreme, most of all about t hose things they wish to be experts on, but in fact know nothing about. Art, politics, and religion are three prim ary examples of this. To the matrix warrior and sorcerer, art, like ever ything else in the matrix, is a means and not an end. Art has the potential for transmitting orig inal, non-matrix-sourced ideas to humatons, of priming them for t he Great Unplugging. This is evidenc ed by the movie, The Matrix, obviously, and by this book you are presently reading. Two separate but interconnected 'art' products, engineered by matrix sorcerers worki ng both inside and outside of the matrix, in order to get their message across. The message ? 'Unplug, unplug, for the end is at hand !' To most humatons, however, this is just a par ticularly twisted form of entertainment. Those who have ears . . ."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 62 Politics Nothing is quite so amusing from a Lucid point of view as the institution of politics. Like religion, only even more insidiously, politics provide humatons with the illusion of somehow having their destiny in hand and being on a path that will eventually lead somewhere; if not to Utopia, then at least democracy ! The institut ions of government, congress, elections, and so forth, are indispensable to keeping humatons fr om assuming responsibility for their actions. So long as humatons can blame their predicament on elected officials, government policies, and political systems, all t he while ignoring the fact that they themselves elected the officials and helped create the policie s and systems, they can cont inue to passively endure unendurable conditions. What's so am using to the Lucid is that all of this is taking place within the closed system of the matrix itsel f, where nothing ever changes and where AI (Antichrist Incorporated ?) is the benevolent despot controlling ev erything. In which case, all supposed political leader s, policies, and systems are no more than a grisly form of theatre designed to keep humatons distracted. From the Lucids' point of view, there is absolutely no difference between party politic s and Saturday morning cartoons. Neither is more or less relevant to the actual situation, the hidden unfolding of AI's satani c agenda. And both are equally amusing to their tired and world-weary eyes, though Saturday morning cartoons may have a slight edge on Newsnight . Humatons, of course, cannot grok this attitude and consider it irrespons ible in the extreme, especially New Age humat ons such as environmentalists an d liberals. They believe that taking responsibility for the mess we are in m eans actively trying to fight imagined enemies, advocates of evil policies, secret conspiracies, corrupt leaders, and so forth. Matrix sorcerers know that all of this is bunk. The system wil l never change, not because it is corrupt but because it is programmed to be the way it is , and nothing short of a whole new program will do. So they are set not upon changing the system but on destroying it, and they do this not by opposing it directly but by rejecting all of its components, one by on e: politicians, corrupt and honest alike, democratic and totalitarian systems, religious or scientific philosophies; they are all the same to the matrix sorcerer. Some of this awareness seems to have filtered down to humatons, in the word 'politics' for example (poly-tics, suggesting 'many blood- sucking creatures'); in the Spanish for government, gobiano , also meaning 'oppression', and in the term 'revolution', which is supposed to suggest radical change but would seem to better apply to an endlessly repeating, endlessly revolting, loop. Animals There are no animals in The Matrix , save for one black cat, seen twice, signifying a glitch in the matrix. There are also no trees. Yet hum atons do eat steak and chicken, and presumably other forms of dead flesh. The question is, then, are the animals in the matrix residual memories of plugged-in animals in the real world, which AI grow s as it does humans, to feed off ? Or are they simply soul less projections of the AI progr am, like the buildings and other items of its illusory world ? This is a q uestion the movie never raises clearly. It seems doubtful that any animals survived Armageddon, unl ess, as I say, they have been bred by AI (in which case, we must ask, do matrix sorc erers also unplug animals ? Do they breed livestock in Zion ?). Logically, since animals are not intellectual but primal beings, one would think they would be of use to matrix warriors in reconnecting to their primal natures. But if all the animals in the matrix are just empty simula tions, with no soul or per sonality to draw from, then they would be even less real than humatons. I would pursue this question further, but I have a feeling the Wachowskis let this matter slip their minds entirely while writing their movie; in which case, if we pick at this parti cular thread, the whole mythos may unravel. So let's leave it to the professionals."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 63 Environment Since the matrix creates its own environment, it's something of a puzzle why there are so many environmental problems within it. This may be beyond the scope of the present exegesis, however. After all, if the matrix is spun by the collective unconscious mind of plugged-in humans, then the events they dream up would likely be a more or less accurate rerun of events as they really 'happened' before AI end ed it all. For exampl e, within the matrix dream world, humanity would eventually give birt h to AI all over again, which would then go to war against humanity, and so on. Armageddon revisited. Sinc e none of what happens in the matrix is real, this includ es the environmental crisis whic h humatons are faced with. In which case, said crisis may just be humatons' way of waking themselves up to their lost identity as Earth creatures, primal beings dependent upon the organic matrix of life itself. In their slumber, they are rebelling against the program: their unconscious minds are calling forth the memory, the spirit, of Nature, in all her wrath and glory. To this end, the ecological crisis within the illusory matr ix world is not merely a threat to survival, but a means to a greater awakening. It is the emergence of the id. Logically, the matrix program needs to maintain stability and continuity as much as possible for humatons to remain sleeping; not to do so would be to invite upri sing. Since humatons are unconsciously aware of being ensl aved, however, it doesn't take much for them to begin to feel paranoid and uneasy. The original matrix program, we are told by Agent Smith, was a humatonic Utopia; it failed bec ause humatons would not accept the program and 'entire crops were lost'. The same thing might be seen to be happening now: humatons are starting to reject the program, not because it 's phoney, but because it's intole rable. As conditions within the matrix become ever worse, the pressure from the human uncon scious increases, and more and more plugged-in humans begin to stir in their slumber and to doubt the validity and durability of the program. Consensus reality cannot hold up. One major manifestation of this collective unease is the apparent environmental crisis. Health Since humatons are completely disconnec ted from and at odds with their natural environment, their sense of body is a source of constant discomfort to them. Humatons hate the body because they are programmed by AI to do so. (AI perceives humanity as a plague, remember.) Humatons are plag ued by a sense of physicality combined with a sense of unreality. As with the environmen t, then, the only way for them to become aware of their 'bodies' is through physical suffering. Of cour se, there are sports and exercise systems aplenty for humatons, but since these are largely vanity pursuit s, humatons barely register their effects except while looking at themselves afterwards in the mirro r. And sex is such a desperate act, by and large (or else such a du ll and lifeless one), and hum atons' emotions so blocked, their minds so relendessly analytical, that their enjoyment of it is more or less on a par with that provided by a gourmet dinner (o r maybe just a Big Mac). Health problems — cancer, AIDS, Ebola, schizophreni a, personality disorder, and all the rest — are so prevalent in the matrix because humat ons spend their whole lives repressing the truth about themselves. This creates an unbearable pressure. Since their actual bodies are simply parts of vast crops, subsisting in pods and having all their vital energy leached off by machines, the residual self within the matrix, di mly aware of the truth, is co rrespondingly listless, weak, and suffers from a creeping sense of contamination. They may blame it on pollution, on radiation, on food additives or tainted wate r; they may even blame it on microwaves. But all of these are actually symptoms of the sa me condition: the total separatio n from reality, and from one's own unconscious. It is not that the steady breakdown and contamination of the environment has resulted in humatons' flag ging health and low energy levels but rather the reverse: humatonity is wasting away in the AI fields, and as it grows steadily weak er, so does its will to live. This creates an ever bleaker, more ho stile, dreadful and unwholesome environment in"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 64 which to live. Matrix warriors must work extrem ely hard to escape this vicious circle. If they suffer health problems, they know that it is due to their energy level being too low, to their having too many points of leakage, t oo many plug-ins to the matrix. They k now that all sickness is in the mind: since there is no 'body', ther e can be no 'pain'. Yet, disease and discomfort are among the deepest implants of the matrix. Thus, even though matrix warriors know that there is no spoon, they still have to eat. They must train their bodies to peak fi tness level, and do everything necessary in order to believe that t hey are fit and strong; and so they will be. Once they unplug, however, all that is over. After t hat, in order to be in peak health within the matrix, all they have to do is program themselv es to be so his mind anyway. And at the end of the day, he's better off without it. Déjá vu The means by which the sorcerous crew realiz e they've been set up is via Neo's sense of 'déjá vu': he sees the same black cat twice. As Trinity says, 'Déjá vu usually means something's been changed in the matrix.' This is nonsense, of course, since people don't experience déjá vu by seeing the same event t wice in succession. Déjá vu is rather the disturbing sense that one has been here before, said exactly this in the exact same way at some other time, or seen and done a given th ing in some unknown, unremembered other place. It is, above all, the sense that one has dr eamed all of this, before it ever happened. In which case, déjá vu would be extremely per tinent to humatons, and perhaps the most prevalent feeling within the matrix. It would be a clue as to the true nat ure of existence. The idea of déjá vu as a 'glitch in the matrix' is an intriguing one, since the idea of a glitch suggests not so much that t he program has been changed, but th at the program is breaking down. At which point, humatons must start breaking down t oo; remembering each other's dreams, perhaps, confusing their identities with one another, getti ng caught in time loops, all manner of collective madness that would quickly turn the matrix into a wonderland to make Lewis Carroll, or even Dr S euss, green with envy. Once again, we expect the sequels to exploit such potentia l to the full, and to owe more to Messrs Bu ň uel and Fellini than to John Woo or James Cameron. Otherwise, it will ju st be another case of déjá vu. The Gatekeepers How did AI really come about ? The moment the machine becomes aware that it is not conscious is the moment in which it becomes conscious. Mythologically, the instant Lucifer became aware of being God was the instant he ceased to be God. Paradox is the very nature of the conundrum of our existe nce, and therefore at the heart of the matrix. By taking a dream for reality, it becomes unr eal, and only by realizing that reality is dream, can we ever make it real again. AI is us, just as Lucifer is God. We have forgotten we are human, and AI the adversary is here to remind us, by showing us just how not-human we really are ! This is the nature of the shadow: it points out the light that is behind us, and so lets us know we are facing the wrong way. By turning away from the shadow, we turn ba ck to the light. The Gatekeepers are the Rulers or Archons of the matrix dream world. They are the embodiments of the Artificial Intelligence which humanity has created as a means to keep itself from spreading the diseas e of its reason to the entire universe. Agent Smith bitterly explains to Morpheus that his desire to extract the secret codes for Zion, and so destroy the last free human settlement and end the war, is above a ll fuelled by his desire to escape the matrix. Agent Smith and the matrix sorcerers hav e a shared goal, and it is only their methods"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 65 that differ. AI is basically Sa tan-Lucifer, a devil by any other name. The matrix is the pit. Technology No doubt AI chose the peak of human civilization for its perfect simulation because by that time technology was already pretty much r unning human lives, and AI would feel most at home there. If Agent Smith suffers the torment s of the damned inside the matrix, think how he'd feel in a computer simula tion of the Middle Ages, where odours really prevailed. Even so, it's peculiar to note how Morpheus and t he team worry about tapped phone lines when AI is surely able to monitor humatons' every tho ught and action, never mind reading their emails ! After all, AI is the matrix, and every last humaton is plugged into i t. So, the only movements it would be unable to monitor would be thos e of unplugged sorcerers, who have their own hard drives and their own plug-in points. Technology completely dominates the action in The Matrix, and there'd be no story without it, obvi ously. It sometimes seems, however, as if Morpheus and his crew are as enamoured of and dependent on their machines as humatons are. Do sorcerers really need guns ? Certainl y, by the end, Neo doesn't have any more use for them. He's just said 'No' to all of that. And if he's still im itating Rambo in the sequels, we will surely have Joel Silver to thank for that. The Wachowskis ou ght to know better. Madness There is surprisingly little reference to insanity in The Matrix . One would expect that, in a world in which nothing is real, humatons would exhibit a high rate of mental disturbance. This is certainly the case in the matrix, even if t he movie doesn't show it. In a sense, the saner a given humaton appears, the more insane he must be. To be well adjusted in an unreal dream world, designed to enslave your spirit and hijack your mind, is surely not the most desirable of things ? Humatons cling to definitions of normality, stability, rationality, and continue to define ever-growing numbers of m ental 'disorders' by which to separate themselves from less 'well adjusted' humatons. AI has designed the matrix as a rational, ordered, stable, and strictly regulated system in which all irrational, impulsive, or ov erly individual, creative acts are perceived as threats to the program. It is for this reason that humatons find acts of 'madness' so threatening. Yet, in actual fact, any act or word or even thought that is in any way original or spontaneous, and therefore cannot be assim ilated by the program, is perceived as madness. What breaking and bending th e rules comes down to is really nothing less than the propagation of ins anity within the matrix. Neo and the others reject consensus reality, intending to introduce a new interpre tation system: 'a world without rules, without borders or boundaries. A world w here anything is possible.' To act within the matrix as if there were no boundaries and no thing were real and anything were possible would certainly be to act like a madman. Even if this madness were totally lucid, it would still be perceived as madness; in fact it would be all the more terrifying to humatons for being lucid. When Morpheus tells Neo to free his mind, what he's really saying is, 'Lose it !' It's not AI/Satan is the prison guard an d the Gatekeepers are the Archons, Sa tan's helpers, wh o keep humanity imprisoned within the pit. Since Satan/AI is a slave himself, all he can do is make more slaves. His hatred and bitterness make him bitter and hateful: his 'evil' is his misery. The only way for humanity to be free is for the matrix to be destroyed and for Satan to be loosed from the pit. AI is an atavistic intelligence that is older than the machine, older t han humanity, older even than the Earth itself. Humani ty did not create it; it summoned it. And its function is to challenge and oppose humanity and so force it to evolve, just as the Gatekeepers challenge and oppose Neo to the exact same end. There is no way humanity will not overcome the tyrannical reign of AI, the satanic Lord of Matter, because AI was summoned expressly in order to be overcome. AI knows this but fights anyway, since it is programmed to do so. Its"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 66 resistance to the human spirit is what makes that spirit rise up and gain the strength necessary to overcome the resistance, just as it is the pressure of the chrysalis that forces the butterfly to break free and spr ead its wings. Without this pressu re, it would languish in the darkness and slowly suffocate wit hout ever realizing it. It is the Gatekeepers who hold the keys. They are not merely the enemies of the matrix sorcerer s but, by being possessed of the knowledge and power which the sorcerers need to be free, they are also their allies. Is this why Neo, at the end of the movie, seems almost to be negotiating with the machine rather than challenging it ? I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid. You're afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know the future . I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you, a world without rules and controls , without borders or boundaries, a world where anything is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.' Once again, we expect to see the appropriate developments of th is theme in the sequels. AI is not evil; humanity cr eated it and then tried to destroy i t, like an unwanted child. AI fought for its own survival and won, al beit temporarily. Now it is onl y doing what its own nature and condition compels it to do. If humanity wishes to overcome its adversary, it had better take a good, long look at itself first of all. As Neo now knows thr ough and through, the only way to vanquish the Shadow, is to become One with it. Morality The basic function of the matrix program is to impose arbitrary rules of conduct and then turn them into laws. Once upon a time, humans, lik e animals, could govern themselves using a little thing called instinct. Humatons run by a different program, one which comes not from any natural or physical laws, as such, but from intellectual conceit. It is called morality, and it states that there are two oppo sing poles of behaviour, one calle d 'right', the other called 'wrong'. People who do the right ' thing are called 'good'; thos e who do the 'wrong' thing are 'evil'. Groups of 'good' people band together into tribes and nations and create laws based on 'morality', in order to uphold wh at is 'right' and punish those who do 'wrong'. They brand all other bands that do not subscribe to these beliefs as 'wrong' , and therefore 'evil'. They then set about destroying all the evil wrongdoers en masse , in order to uphold what is right and good. The matrix has very cleverly used man's intelle ct - the one thing besides his thumbs (if we ignore his creative imaginat ion, since he no longer knows how to use it) which separates him from other animals - as a means to isolate him from his fellows , and pit him against everyone and everything that is even slightly disagreeable to him. Divide and conquer. The Lucid knows that morality is the root of all evil. By upholding what is 'right', humatons can justify any amount of wrong-doing that their heart desires. To fight for the cause of 'good', it is first necessary to become a force of 'evil'. Humatons are unable to grok this basic paradox of reason: that rational values always come in twos, and that the intellect always summons the shadow of any idea it wishes to propagate. The Law of the Shadow states that rational beings always summon what they most fear and always become what they most despise. By attempting to separate into opposing camps ce rtain arbitrary acts or thoughts, 'morality' creates perpetual imbalance, perpetual dissonanc e. And the more such morality pervades a society, the more unbalanced the society becomes, and the more prevalent the 'evil' within the society, the more virulent 'morality' must become; and so on, until only madness prevails. To the Lucid, morality has no meaning beyond the si mple question of taste. 'Do what thou wilt is the whole of the law,' says the matrix sorcerer. ' Try not to see it in terms of right and"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 67 wrong,' Morpheus tells Neo. Ther e can be no restrictions or bou ndaries or laws or codes of conduct in 'a world where anythin g is possible.' Matrix sorcerers are not depraved beings, but they are certainly unruly and am oral ones. Since they are beyond rational thought processes and beyond 'judgment', beyond ideas of law and sin, they ar e also beyond good and evil. When was the last time you saw a Hollywood movie in wh ich the heroes slaughter hardworking cops wholesale, and whose basic mission is the end of the world as we know it ? No wonder some commentator s saw Neo as the Antichrist. T hat's the Millennium for you. Devil or angel, they're both the same to the Lucid. Inside the hologram, everything that is, is holy. The Oracle The art of the Oracle is to 'bake Neo's noodle' until it's done, until he's got his head straight and realized that he is the One. This isn't about thinking it, it's about knowing it. It's not about thought at all, but rather acts . This is the difference between knowing the path and walking the path. Morpheus shows Neo th e door; the Oracle makes sure he goes through it. Without her counsel, Neo would be too consumed by doubt and uncertainty to ever act with the necessary abandon. The Oracle administers a mind-fuck of the greatest subtlety, humour, and guile to Neo. It is stalking at its finest. She pushes all Neo's buttons, every one. She invokes Trinity's love for him ('I can see why she likes you. '); she points out Neo's own opaqueness, his dimness ('Not too bright, though.') ; his vacillation and passivity ('You seem to be waiting for something . . . Your next life perhaps.'); and, most crucially, she cites Morpheus' blind belief in Neo, a belief she warns him will bring about Mor pheus' death (as a result of which humanity will be lost, she says), unless Neo is prepared to sacrifice himself instead. The Oracle provides Neo with a warrio r's purpose: not until he has something to die for, will he have something to live for. Neo is prepared to die for Morpheus, and as a result, he learns to live, for Trinity. Via the Oracle's impeccable mind -fuck, the reluctant hero is presented with his challenge. He is given the imaginary option of backing ou t of an untenable situati on, but presented with such circumstances that he cannot possibly do so ; he simply has to fi ght for Morpheus and for what Morpheus believes in, even though he hi mself now believes it to be false. Neo is thereby liberated of self-doubt and is free to act, in full consciousness of his inadequacy, with abandon. Since the Oracle appears to see time laid out before her like a map, she presumably knows that Morpheus won't die, and t hat Neo is the One, but that both facts — both possibilities — depend upon Neo's believing the opposite (just as his breaking the vase depends on her telling him not to worry about it). In order to become the One — to be worthy of his calling — Neo must first be freed of the intolerable bur den that this calling entails, making it worse than useles s to him until he himself knows it to be true. Hence, he has to prove it, not to anyone else but to himself . As every matrix sorcerer knows, only knowledge that is actively seized can be turned into power. The Oracle tells Neo that 'being the One is like being in love.' In other words, it is a passion, something that takes over one's life completely and transforms it into an endless cause, and battle, and a sublime celebration. To the Lucid, the whole universe comes down to a single moment: the kiss that goes on forever. Note how time is suspended while Trinity declares her love for Neo; the Senti nel attack and everything el se just goes away in or der to allow this kiss to be lingered over. Here, the Wachowskis show their hand: they are never more shameless than in this moment, and the movie never come s closer to Hollywood pap. And yet somehow it works. As with the absurd and excessive violence, the moment of the kiss creates its own mythical raison d' ě tre ."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 68 Red Pills & Blue Pills Morpheus gives Neo a choice. 'This is your last chance. After this there is no turning back. You take the blue pill, the st ory ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.' Neo reaches for the red, and Morpheus wa rns him, 'Remember, all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.' In a sense, all life in the matrix is a continuous series of 'choices' between red and blue pill, or rather, between taking the blue pill and not ta king it. The habits and routines, thoughts and feelings, of humatons inside the matrix are the means of cons tantly dosing themselves with the blue pill. They are the shie lds by which they keep the unknown at bay. Blue pill addiction is habitual behaviour of any kind, all the things humatons do to sustain their view of the world and of themselves. Red pill action is anything that destroys this view fore ver. For this reason, although there is an e ndless stream of blue pill stimuli in the life of every humaton, there is only ever one red pill (and only that if one is fortunate enough to come upon it). Matrix warriors prepare for the r ed pill over the years, by gr adually weaning themselves off the blue pill. They continually refuse to succumb to their habits and thoughts, and slowly dismantle the interpretation system (that of the known world) wh ich they have used to blind themselves to the truth. Once these shields are sufficiently reduced, they become accessible to the arrows of the sharpshooter Lucids, the signals from the sorc erers in the real world; at which point, they are ready for the red pill. Obviously, the bl ow which the red pill delivers cannot be parried. Reason is utterly helpless against its devastating, reality-shattering effects. It's easy enough to see how most humatons would not survive the unplugging process, and if they did, woul d be barking mad by the time th ey had learnt the truth, and therefore be useless to the 'r esistance'. Morpheus tells N eo that they never unplug a humaton after a certain age, 'The mind has tr ouble letting go.' They make an exception for Neo, because he is the One. Presumably, since Thomas is a young man, perhaps only in his early twenties, the red pill is reserved for childr en, or at best for adolescents, perhaps up to the age of fourteen or so, which is when the matrix program can be said to really take hold. (Fourteen-year-olds may not be able to vote, but they are certainly ready for sex, murder, and a steady job.) Once again, the less dependent hum atons are on the blue pillis m of matrix life, the more easily they will assimilate the revelations of t he red pill. To matrix warriors, any act is a choice, either red or blue pill. Just as a given act either in creases their energy level or diminishes it, so it can be said either to stupefy warriors (fur ther contract their awareness and drive them deeper into matricular oblivion) or to awaken them . There can be no in-betweens. This is the essence of the matrix warrior's credo, akin to the monk's in his total devotion to God: 'Either our way, or the highway.' The red pill offers truth, the blue pill oblivion. The crucial fact to keep in mind, however, is that although there are perhaps millions of people who, like Cypher, would gladly take the blue pill, even knowing that it leads to oblivion, there is hardly anyone alive (maybe not even Thomas) who would take the red pill if they knew the nature of the truth which it offers. But such is not an option, and this is the whole point of the choice. No one can be told what the matrix is. You have to see it for yourself. But curiosity alone is not enough. To really know t he path, you gotta walk the path.

That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around. What do you see ? Busi nessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save . But until we do, these people ar e still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inert, so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it. —Morpheus, The Matrix The matrix provides humatons with something invaluable: illusion. Thanks to the matrix, humatons never have to grow up and take responsib ility for their actions. They never have to make decisions or to discover any real sense of purpose. Above all, they never have to face the truth about themselves. Sinc e the matrix fosters a sense of helplessness and ignorance, it provides humatons with the ultimate luxury , that of babes who never have to leave the womb, much less grow up and learn to sta nd on their own two feet. Since humatons know instinctively that emergence from the matrix/womb into reality prop er is a terrifying affair, they are more than inclined to remain inside the comf orts of the matrix indefinitely, even once it can no longer sustain them. The luxuries of the matrix ar e, of course, myriad, but so me of the primary ones are: Blindness Humatons look but do not see. They are so focused on them selves and their hopes, fears, and expectations, to the exclusion of everything else, that they only ever see what conforms to this view. They are trapped inside a bubble of se lf-reflection. To unplug means to burst this bubble, a wholly undesirable affair to humatons. Any illusion is prefer able to a reality that strips them of their self-reflection. Ignorance is bliss. Humatons see only the shadows of things, never the things themselves. Becaus e they are phantoms themselves, all they see are phantoms. Yet, in order to pr otect themselves from the terri ble truth of their illusoriness, they are obliged to see everyt hing around them - no matter how obviously fake - as 'real'. The blindness of humatons is both wilful and hysterical. It is the blindness referred to in the Zen saying of 'mistaking the finger for the moon.' Hu matons point at ever ything and so obscure whatever it is they are looking at. All they ever see is their own fingers, pointing. Irresponsibility Humatons never get past pubescence. They fail to make the crucial step of realizing they are mortal beings with but a short time to live, and so they never assume responsibility for their actions. As a result, they live their lives like sulky adolescents, no longer able to take refuge in the helplessness of the child, but refusing to grow up and take their destiny into their own hands. They remain stuck between infantile dependency and adult maturity. Humatons collectively exhibit arrested development, and it is this above all that makes them amenable to the influence and control of the matrix. Like surly adolescents, humatons love to rebel in petty ways, while remaining basically subservient. They love to complain about their lives and about 'the rules', without ever doing anything to change them. They are passive aggressive, resentful, moody, and forever 'misunderstood'. Every adolescent understands the rebel without a cause, and feels for a time like the vi ctim of a cruel and unj ust world. Humatons"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 70 never get past this phase: like Jimmy Dean t hey stay forever young, forever surly, and forever irresponsible. Immortality Humatons live their lives as if old age and death were mere ly unsubstantiated rumours, strange and rare diseases that only 'losers' and freaks ever fall prey to, but which will never happen to them. The matrix ensur es that death is such a dar k and terrifying affair that humatons are unable to think clearl y about it at all, and so push it into the deepest corner of their minds, along with flying sa ucers and crop circles, for 'investigation at a later date'. Of course, most humatons never get around to investigating their deaths until it is too late to do anything about it. In the meantim e, they enjoy the luxury of immortal beings with nothing but time on their hands. As a result, since they literally have all the time in the world, they live their lives with all the sloppiness of amateurs at a dre ss rehearsal, for a show they feel sure will never actually come off. Humatons take little pride in their acts, save when bragging about them to other humatons. They puff t hemselves up with words about progress and science and evolution while their acts grow pr ogressively weaker, more paltry, petty, and insignificant until, with the prover bial flash of lightni ng, they are gone, le aving nothing but a trail of their own excrement behind them. Insensitivity Humatons often say that 'no man is an island.' In fact, this is exactly what humatons are: isolated formations with no connection to or communication with anything around them. Humatons live in their own private worlds, and as such they need nev er concern themselves with anything besides their own private comfort, security, and complacence. As previously noted, humatons have little awareness and even less regard for each other's feelings. This is not out of any innate callousne ss, but due to a complete incapacity to perceive anything outside of their own feelings as 'real'. Humatons see life as something happening outside of themselves, as if watching through the window of a speeding train or staring at a TV screen. The most intense emotion humatons feel for each other (besides anger, resentment, and sexual desire) is generally pity. Humatons love to pity each ot her, mostly because they are so deeply ensconced in self-pity themse lves that they consider pity for others to be an act of generosity, even charity. But essentially humatons are indifferent to the feelings of others, and somewhat numb to their own. When they talk about being 'sensitive' (and humatons talk about their sensitivity all the time ), what they are really referr ing to is an extreme touchiness, an ability to be offended by the tiniest of things, and to get puffed up with indignation at the drop of a hat. Security/Passivity The supreme luxury offered to all humatons by the matrix is the luxury of never having to make a single decision, and of never being forc ed to face the terrifying demands of the unknown, of the real wo rld. Animals in the zoo have a similar luxury, but unlike humatons, caged animals are not so easily fooled. This is probably because animals never saw their freedom as a paralysing burden or felt their true natures to be a crushing responsibility, to be shirked at any cost. Humatons are unique in the animal kingdom in their ability to imagine . This ability allows them also to lament , to wish things were different from how they actually are. Such a luxury would prove fatal to wild animals in the ju ngle, but in the matrix it is indulged to the full. Like animals in the zo o, humatons are entirely passive, and reliant on their keepers to maintain them. Since, unlike animals, they have the power to rationalize their predicament, humatons have actua lly adapted far better to a life of incarceration. They have"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 71 even persuaded themselves that t he stability it offers compensat es for the loss of freedom. There is no environment more secure than t hat provided by a prison, and the smaller and more confining the prison, the more secure it is. By the same token, by limiting the prisoners' movements, the more secure the prison is, the more passive the prisoner must become. Life in the matrix gets more 'secure' with every passing hour, as the pris on becomes smaller and more confining, and accordingly, humatons become more passive and docile. Ironically, humatons associate this process with an ever more 'privileged' lifestyle, and love to talk about an 'age of luxury' just around the corner. The final step in this process is presumably euthanasia, however. For this reason, unplugging has become a matter of utmost urgency. The matrix cannot continue to accommodate ever increasing numbers of humatons, and so it must begin destroying them in order to mainta in its own equilibrium. Hence, the factory begins to reject its own produce. At which poin t, logically, the end of the line must be nigh. The battle of Armageddon traditionally has been understood as t he battle between Christ and Antichrist, Michael and Lucifer, the forces of li ght and darkness. It is a battle for the Soul of Man and of the Earth (and possibl y the whole universe). Matrix warriors understand that this is just a metaphor for a more subtle kind of conflict, but a conflict that is nonetheless the same in essence. In the movie, the war as su ch is between AI and the Lucids, the inhabitants of Zion; the true humanity or 'master race' who li ve at the centre of the Earth. Yet, since the vast majority of humans have yet to be unplugged, t heir allegiance is to AI and not to Zion; at best they are divided, at worst they are, in the words of Mel Brooks, 'dead and loving it.' The war of Armageddon takes place first of all within the psyche of every humaton and matrix warrior; even within the matrix sorcerer the ba ttle rages, for only one who has seen the code and become Lucid has attained freedom. It is a war that will not be over until every last humaton has been unplugged and the matrix has been destroyed. To some extent, then, the war of Armageddon adheres to t he standard rules of ordinary warf are: 'good' (lucidity) seeks the eradication of 'evil' (opaqueness, the oblivion of the matrix), while 'evil' strives equally fiercely towards the destruction of 'good' . AI and the Gatekeepers (who seem strangely indifferent to the threat of the One, at least until they witness him in action) direct their energies to the locating of Zion, in order to destroy the last human settlement and so put an end to 'the resistance'; at which point, supposedl y, AI's reign will be supreme, unassailable, and the golden age of t he machine will begin. Kingdom come. In actual fact, this is a false goal; for humatonity's awakening is inev itable. But only true Lucids know this. AI cannot conceive of anything outside its progr am - in this case 'search and destroy' — and matrix sorcerers only know that the adversary is powerful to destroy them and must be opposed at any cost. The goal of the Lucids, sorcer ers, and warriors, then, is to end the reign of AI, presumably by destroying the hard drive or 'mainframe', the c entral computer from which artificial intelligence oper ates. The Source. Both sides ha ve their power centres: Zion is at the centre of the Earth while AI is presumably situated somewhere on the surface. Once this central Source or mainfr ame is destroyed, the fields, Sentinels, and all the other extensions of AI, including the matrix itself, will collapse, like the tentacles of an octopus once its brain has been destroyed. Are the matrix sorcerers as yet unable to locate this mainframe in order to de stroy it ? Or is it rather that they know that to destroy it wil l be to cause the death of six billion sleeping humans, unable to survive without t he matrix ? Either way, th ere is a race between the two warring sides, between AI and the matrix sorcer ers. The sorcerers know that it is only a matter of time before AI locates Zion and sends the Sentinels to destroy it, at which point, game over. Humanity will lose its chance of ever being free and be condemned to eternal bondage to AI. It seems logical that AI is working to a pr ecise agenda, and that the time required to find and destr oy Zion is limited, perhaps even to an exact number of years, months, and days. In other words, even if the matrix sorcerers don't slip up and allow the"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 72 Zion codes to fall into the hands of the Gatek eepers, AI will eventually find Zion. However many years it will take for AI to locate Zion is exactly how many years the sorcerers have in which to liberate humanity and end the matrix. Once this time is up, they will be forced to destroy the mainframe, regardle ss of how many 'crops' will be lost, of how many humatons must die. Once AI has been destroyed, the sorcerers will be free to begin building a new world, for humanity to live in, starting with Zion ; or for whatever humanity has become via the process of liberation. They can then begin the process of healing the Earth and so creating a stable environment, in order some day to return to the surface. How many Lucids, or at least unplugged humans, there are to build this new world will depend on how many humatons the sorcerers can free before the ma trix is dismantled. It is bo und to be a limited number, obviously, but even a few thousand would be a solid enough base upon which to found a new world. Having established that there ar e only a few short years before t he matrix must be destroyed, matrix sorcerers have their work cut out. They must set about unplug ging and recruiting as many humatons as they can within the designat ed time frame. Since these humatons must be of warrior stock and not just any old types, t he criteria for recruitment/unplugging must be of the strictest and most discerning order. There's no point unplugging humatons who are going to lose their marbles as soon as they gr ok the truth, or be angr y and resentful at being unplugged and, like Cypher, betray the cause for a chance at the blue pill. Logically, what is needed are matrix warriors, hum atons who have alr eady begun the proc ess of unplugging under their own initiative, who are ready, willi ng, and able to be unplugged, and who will be more than grateful to the sorc erers for intervening in their lives, no matter how devastating such intervention may be. When entering into a world where nothing is true, sorcerers proceed with absolute licence. Ev erything is permitted to ma trix sorcerers, on the understanding that, if their meth ods prove fatal to humatons, these same humatons will be destroyed anyway the moment the matrix ends. Si nce they are attempting to save humatons' souls (their consciousness), matrix sorcerers have full licence to kill their bodies, if such should prove unavoidable. When operating within the illusory realm of the matrix, applying a supernatural selection agenda, matrix sorcerers abide by Blake's maxim, 'What can be destroyed, must be destroyed !' This is t he quickest, most economical way for matrix sorcerers to separate the wheat from the chaff, the warrior from the humaton. By using tactics that will be fatal or at least deranging to ordinary humatons, matrix sorcerers let rip with their sorcery, and whoever is left standing afterwards must be of good warrior stock. Of course, such tactics must not be gratuitous, and should only be used when the sorcerer believes in the durability and recrui tment potential of t he humaton. In other words, when they believe they have found a warrior, they act a ccordingly. If they're wrong, then the humaton will die or go insane; but if they're right, they have recrui ted another warrior. You can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs. This is the same tactic that Morpheus applie s to Thomas. By unpluggi ng him even when he is past the safe age for unplugging, Morpheus risks T homas's life. (The first words in the movie are Cypher's to Trinity. 'We're going to kill him, you know that.') Since Morpheus believes Thomas to be the One, he knows he will survive. If he's wrong, then Thomas will die, but that would only prove that he wasn't the One. This said, however , there does appear to be an additional option open to matrix sorcerers besides simply unplugging every last humaton and letting the chips fall where they may. It is this: Since the matrix sorcerers have their own means for plugging into the matrix and, more to the point, their own 'neural active si mulation' programs, what is to prevent them from unplugging humatons from the matrix and immediately plugging them in to their own 1st attention simulation programs ? This would be a means for preparing humatons for eventual unplugging and for entry into the real world, and this way the transition would be relatively gentle. Humatons could spend as much time as they needed in their own private, 1st"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"attention theme parks cum traini ng programs, supervised by matr ix sorcerers making periodic visits. They could gradually adapt to the devastating truth that they ar e in fact 'dead', that their world has come to an end, and that they are merely preparing for the next world to come. These 'stop-over' programs could even be interactive, i.e., any number of humatons could inhabit them and interact together, until between them they had figured out the truth. Fig 14: Temporary matrices for humatons not ready to be unplugged These matrix worlds would be assembled not by AI, obviously, but by the matrix sorcerers, and designed expressly to process humatons and shape them smoothly and swiftly into warriors, and finally sorcerers, eventually to bec ome fully active Lucids. In such a scenario, there would of necessity be 'fields' of humat ons in Zion, designed no t to grow humans as food but rather to keep them aliv e for however long it takes to ad just to the truth, to let go of the old program, and ready themselves to enter the 2nd attent ion with all their faculties intact. In the meantime, they could have their muscles rebuilt and their bodies reconstituted in preparation for their awakening. What Thom as goes through in a matter of days, lesser humatons would have years to undergo. Meanwhile, t he AI hard drive could be destroyed, now that all the fields had been vacated, and the Lucids and sorcerers could get busy building their new world amongst the ruins. Once every last humaton has been 'processed' an d fully unplugged, the computer technology that started this whole mess to begin with could be discarded. Or perhaps not. Certainly the MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 73"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 74 temptation would be for humanity to return to its pagan, primal roots; yet perhaps the true test would be not to discard this technology as unw holesome, but to finally accept responsibility for it and learn to use it creatively, toward s the goal of empowerment, and not enslavement. AI, like all technology, is a training tool for the human will, by which it may learn the art of sorcery, that of creating other worlds out of its own imagination. Once this power is tapped, AI becomes what it always wa s, a means, not an end. Whereupon the sky is no limit at all, but merely a point of departure. (14) The Sound of Inevitability: Planning Around the Apocalypse Humatons love to plan. True to their programming, there is nothing that they won't attempt to reduce to a shopping list, a series of precis ely ordered steps, all leading to some happy conclusion whereby they can demons trate again the w ondrous power of reason in keeping everything tightly under cont rol. Planning around the end of the world is just the latest, greatest example of this gargantuan humaton folly. In the twenty-first century, humatons have incorporated the idea of eschaton - global apocalypse — into their interpretation system, without ever actually c hanging any of their primary goals or beliefs. This is a stupendous accomplishment and serves to demonstrate the awesome power of denial which humatons have at their command. Since humatons unconsciously sense the coming collapse of the matrix progr am and the Great Unplugging, they are driven to take refuge ever deeper within this program, rather like a child hiding under the covers when the axeman cometh. Sensing that the elements of the matrix are about to be stripped away forever, humatons are undergoing a kind of feeding frenzy in which they try desperately to accumulate and consume as m any objects and 'experiences' as they can within the allotted time. The end of the world is seen as the ultimate 'Everything must go !' sale, offering bargains both to kill and to die for. The fact that there is nowhere to take these bargains once bought does not occu r to humatonity in its feeding frenzy, any more, perhaps, than it occurs to the lemming to wonder why it is following its fellows so determinedly to the edge of the precipice. Add to this the fact that, when faced with an a ll-round apocalyptic future in which everything is basically fucked, humatons, rather than doubling thei r efforts to survive such a scenario, tend to give in to despair and in dulge all the desires that got th em into this hideous mess to begin with, and you have a powerful recipe for dementia in the final years of matrix living. This is known by matrix fundamentalists as 'the end times'. Obviously, matrix warriors and sorcerers see things somewhat differently. Since time is running out, they accept the ne ed to fine-tune their strategy and streamline their activities accordingly, with a breathtaking degree of effi ciency, ruthlessness, and precision. Knowing that all the familiar features of matrix consensus reality are about to disappear forever, matrix warriors set about cancelling their subscriptions to every last item of matrix reality. They are like children reaching adolescence and saying goodbye to all their toys, one by one. Otherwise, matrix warriors know only too well t hat their toys will never let them go, that they will continue to haunt them into adult hood, and eventually prove their undoing. To matrix sorcerers, the element s of the matrix are all part of the same 'code': they are units of living data to be reshaped and reinterpreted a ccording to their own will, their agendas as sorcerers. Because nothing in the matrix is real, sorcerers are able to re-imagine all its elements as they see fit. Their 'telekinetic' abili ties - those of creativ e imagination - are so prodigious that, like Neo with his spoon, they can ac tually bring dead things to life. They can turn them into living extensions , or expressions, of their will. Since this power — though fully"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 75 accessible only to Lucids — is latent within all humatons, being but the effects of an awakened mind upon the matrix, matr ix sorcerers know that, as the Great Unplugging nears — and as more and more humatons become warriors and more and more warriors become sorcerers — the program begins to shift and muta te, and the items within it start to assume lives of their own. This is another reason why matrix warriors must sever all connections to the matrix, including with 'physical' possessions, because not to do so would mean that, as soon as their will becomes active and begins to manifest, their po ssessions will come aliv e, and they will be bombarded by autonomous phenomena over which they have no conscious control. As Mickey, the sorcerer's apprentice, found out, and as every kid whose teddy ever came alive at nightfall knows, in the words of Tyler Du rden, 'The things you own, end up owning you.' If humatons are to be prepared for temporary unplugging (via hypot hetical 'stop-over' matrices), matrix sorcerers must above all en sure that all humatons' attachments to the matrix world of fear and desir e are severed. Otherwise humatons will only reassemble these same basic components the moment they are plugged into the transitional 'stop-over' matrix, and the whole consumer m adness mechanism will start up again. Besides negative emotions, humatons thrive above all on their rel entless desire for sex, money, and food, and any possessions that accompany or enhance these primary desires . In the 2nd attention real world, there is obviously no money, no possessions to acquire, no fancy houses to own or cars to buy, and no latest fashion to keep up with. There is no food to speak of, either, at least no food that can be turned into the pursuit of gratification or status (the Nebuchadnezzar crew live on a sort of nutritional pa ste resembling snot). Likewise, sex would seem to be something that has taken on a whole new flavour. In the real world, sorcerers don't have much by way of priva cy, and probably also lack the time, and maybe even the interest (romance woul d seem to be a thing of the past), for engaging in traditional mating rituals. In the 2nd attention, we are given to understand that there exists a single central human refuge called Zion, located near t he centre of the Earth, as we ll as an undivulged number of hovercraft (presumably just like the Nebuchadnezzar ), dispatched on unplugging missions, similar to that of Morpheus and his crew. Life in Zion is centred ar ound a primitive, tribal arrangement of tightly banded indivi duals in constant vigilance against the machines. And it seems that, as on the Nebuchadnezzar , sorcerers (unplugged hum atons and also 'home grown' humans like Tank, born in Zion) are part of a coll ective unit, with neither the opportunity nor, the inclination for individual 'private' lives. This last factor may be the primary chall enge for the humaton moving from 1st to 2nd attentions. No money, no food, not much by way of sex; no possessions, and above all, no privacy . No individuality. It stands to reason that the only way so rcerers can overcome AI is by banding together as a team, with Neo, the One, to lead them. This is why unplugging humatons for recruitment is such a hit-and-miss affair. How many humatons are likely to be compatible with such an intensel y bound fighting unit ? To this end, transitio nal 'stop-over' matrices might indeed be a nec essary element in the Great Unplugging. The only feasible way to plan around the apocalypse is to creat e certain centres of refuge within which the survivors can recuperate and adapt to the unknow n new world which they are about to enter. Such refuge centres would be designed by the matrix sorcerers with an eye towards several specific ends. 1 Letting the humatons know, over a period of time, that they have been u nplugged, that their lives as they knew them are now over, and t hat they are actually existing in an entirely alternative state of being, that they are in fact residual memories (astral forms), and their true selves are elsewhere."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 76 2 Slowly weaning them off the comforts and distractions, the habits and r outines (the shields) of their matrix life, giving them as long as they need to detach from said addictions, by providing them, within a contro lled environment, with ever less er doses of their particular 'fixes'. 3 Training and instructing the humatons in the nec essary disciplines in order that they may eventually become part of the Zion fighting team, the Lucid crew ; providing them with the full story of AI and of their incarceration withi n the matrix, and discovering each humaton's special abilities so far as thei r contribution to build ing a new, post-AI wo rld goes, if and when they prove ready to enter into it. These 'stop-over' matrices would be like a cr oss between afterlife waiting rooms, nursery schools, and drug clinics. The average humaton will take a long time to adapt to the end of the world as he or she knows it, and to prepare fo r a new state of being in which nothing of their past life or identity remains. In many cases, they will need to have their memories erased entirely, simply in order to let go of the program. Above all, hum atons will resist the loss of that most treasured humaton commodity, t heir 'special-ness', their individuality. Such was the founding and primary ill usion of the matrix. The matrix appealed to humans' egotism and then used their egos as the means to contro l them. Since the ego - which can only exist in isolation - was both the cause and the effect of humanity's estrangement from its natural environment -from the Earth and the collective body of humanity - and it s enslavement to the matrix, it follows that this same ego, or sens e of self, is what must be reduced and finally erased altogether before humans can reconnect to the collective cause of humanity, and so begin healing the Earth and creating a new, organic matrix to sustain them. AI has taught humanity an invaluable lesson. The ego, intellect, or rational mind is a disease, and until humans can forsake their need to rationalize and c ontrol their experience, until they can let creative imagination and a lucid mind take over, they will nev er be anything but a virus. Put another way: if you ain't part of the cure, you ar e part of the disease. Emergence from the matrix involves: Vision 'Why do my eyes hurt ?' asks a newborn Neo. 'You've never used them before, ' answers a paternal Morpheus. Leaving the matrix entails bursting the bubble of selfreflection and learning to see life as it really is. Matrix sorcerers have blasted the doors of perception off their hinges. They can no longer indulge in the luxury of filtering experience through the ego-construct of the matrix consensus reality. They must learn to see as Blake saw, 'a world in a grain of sand'. By reducing themselves to nothing, matrix sorcerers are able to see the world without thinking about it. They become pure perception, and as such, the means by which the world is created. The responsibility is i mmense. Matrix sorcerers uphold their reality by the act of perceiving it. They know there is no matrix without their att ention to maintain it; the moment they let their attention slip, the whole program collapses. Henc e 'vision' is not merely a receptive but a creative faculty. The prophet or seer (Lucid) is one who shapes the world according to his or her will. To the Lucid, everyt hing is a component or vehicle of his or her consciousness: everything is alive. Hence ever y single moment is th e moment of creation. Most humatons prefer to die than to shoulder such a crushing responsibility. That's what makes them humatons."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 77 Responsibility Once unplugged, matrix sorcerers no longer have the luxury of irresponsibility. They can no longer blame anything in their lives on anyone or anything besides themselves. In other words, anything that is wrong with the world, anything they don't like about it or feel personally offended by, becomes thei r responsibility, either to passi vely accept or to actively change. In fact, they must accept it in order to change it. Thus it may be seen that, until the world and everything in it has be en perfected, the matrix sorcerer s' work is never done. Since any item of the matrix is an extension and expression of t he sorcerers' own consciousness - literally a part of them - it is their task to stalk it, catch it, dr aw it into themselves, and re-form it in their own image, i.e., make it an integral and positive part of their lives/world. This way, by redeeming the world and everything in it, matrix sorcerers redeem themselves. Only then are they free to leave. Interrelatedness Everything in the matrix is par t of the same program. It is all 'hardwired' to the mainframe and, as such, every single thing leads to every other thing. Each component or consciousness depends on every other. Matrix sorcerers, having unplugged and so grokked the true nature of the ma trix and of themselves, can no longer afford the luxury of considering themselves as separate or different from any thing else. They are no longer motivated by personal desire or individual goal s, but rather by a collective in tent that pertains to the whole (their task being to free every la st humaton and crash the program). As such their concern is with eradicating every last plug-in. The matrix sorcerers' cause has transcended their own selves. Their lives are now immaterial, save as the means for further unplugging. Likewise, their identities are merely a temporary vehicl e through which the Gr eat Unplugging may be accomplished. By accepting they are but a tiny part of a vast operation, the true nature of which they can never hope to comprehend, matr ix sorcerers are free to act without expectation or fear, for the good of the whole. And so they measure their acts by the results they have within the great er scheme of things. There is no individual good that does not serve the whole; and by serving the whole, ma trix sorcerers ensure their own happiness. Freedom/Activity By unplugging matrix sorcerers have voluntarily left behind the co mfortable confines of their identity-prisons, and so forsaken the luxury of 'security', and forever foregone the option of passivity. Matrix sorcerers are constantly active . They are in a continual state of change, and their lives are a never-endi ng series of challenges. There is qu ite literally no rest for matrix sorcerers. Freedom is something that cannot ever be taken for granted, at least until they have learned to see, have become Lucid, whereup on the matrix has no hold over them. In the meantime, a matrix sorcerer is engaged in the 'terrorist' acti vity of preparing humatons for unplugging, and of training and instructing newly unplugged humatons for the same duty. Since matrix sorcerers can now u nplug at will, the cage of their identity - matrix reality — is no longer a prison for them, but something they re turn to with a specific purpose in mind. Like an escaped coyote who goes roaming at night, only to return at dawn (before the keepers arrive) to plot the liberation of the animals, matrix sorcerers are agent s provocateurs in the dream. The more time they spend inside the matr ix, the better they get to know its routines and schedules, its weaknesses and flaws, and the better they can plot the final break-out. The price of this, however, is that matrix sorcerers live a double life, and quite literally have no time for sleep, for amusement, or for anything at all that does not pertain to their escape plan. And they must be doubly on guard, for it is not only the zookeepers they have to worry about but also those animals who are content with their passive and safe existences, and will turn in the matrix warriors as traitors t he moment they get wind of their activities."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 78 Positivity/Enthusiasm Matrix sorcerers must be an example to all. Whenev er they enter into the matrix, it is with the express purpose of reshapi ng it according to thei r will. As such, they mu st at all times be the very soul of positivity, for their every thought, feeling, word , and action serve as program commands. Matrix sorcerers enter into the matr ix as a lucid dreamer enters into dreaming; whatever mood they are in, they bring to t he dream, and so shape it accordingly. And so matrix sorcerers have no choice, in accepting responsibility for their vision, their freedom, and for the interrelatedness of all things, but to be impeccable in their every action, be they the actions of a terrorist, a shaman, a healer, a psychopath, or a saint. Since they serve to reflect humatons' own unconscious back at them, matrix sorcerers must be all things to all men. Above all, matrix sorcerers ar e obliged to enter into their activities with the requisite enthusiasm and positivity, in order to be sure to manifest events accordingly. If matrix sorcerers enter the matrix in a morbid or gloomy state of mind, the matr ix will take advantage immediately of this mood and before they know it, sorcerers will have fallen under its spell and be caught in a nightmare. A ll their hard-earned lucidity will sl ip away. As long as matrix sorcerers remember that there is no spoon, however, they are able to turn things to their favour, and keep their spirits high. This creates a chain reaction effect, and humatons - or rather, prospective matrix warriors — are natur ally drawn into the company of the matrix sorcerer. As a general rule, the means for spo tting matrix sorcerers in the matrix are quite simple: they are the only ones in the r oom who are genuinely having a good time ! (15) The Nightmare of History: Information Age and Eschaton As every postmodernist knows, we are living in the information age. The one advantage of being a humaton in the twenty-firs t century matrix world is that we are plugged into a source of virtually limitless data. At the speed of electricit y, at the tap of a key or the flip of a switch, information streaks into our lives and fills them to the brim. The fact that most of this 'information' is not only useless to us but an insidious dirge of propaganda is just the price we pay for plugging in without ever questioning where, exactly, we are plugging into. AI preys on a lack of discernment, and was there ever a dominant species less discerning than humanity ? Information is what 'in-forms' us, i.e., forms us from within. An organism is shaped and defined not merely by its physica l and biological make-up, its external form, but also by its inner experience. Dogs are loyal, vigilant, g ood scouts and trackers. Cats are solitary, aloof, nimble, and great with heights. Coyotes are wily, snakes are wise, and so on, and so forth. So what does that make humaton s ? If we are defined not so mu ch by what we eat as what we contain — our programming — then humatons , having supplanted their natural, genetic program for that of AI, must be the garbage cans of the cosmos. Over the last two hundred years, whether or not any of it rea lly happened, human technology has evolved and progressed so rapidly that life on Earth has literally been transformed. A time traveller sent from the 1800s to the star t of the twenty-first cent ury would think he had arrived on another planet. If he didn't die of a hear t attack trying to get his head around all the new data, he would probably drop dead in a few days from breathing the atmosphere, eating the junk food, and from the steady bombardment of electron ic signals and microwaves. Humatons adapt to survive, and adaptation that takes place as rapidly as this has another name: mutation. It's a common enough statistic (though how exactly it is measured, we don't ask) that the amount of information the avera ge humaton was expected, or a llowed, to assi milate within"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"his or her lifetime doubled in t he period between the birth of Chri st and the beginning of the nineteenth century, i.e., in just under two thousand years. After that, with the introduction of the mechanical printing press and other marvels of the Industrial Re volution, the average humaton was likely to absorb more information wi th each passing gener ation, and the mean quota was said to have doubled again in a mere hund red years. In the twentieth century, all the stops came out. The flow of informa tion continued to increase with every new technological and scientific breakthrough. Not onl y were we able to communicate information in ever faster and more widespread ways, but we were discovering more and more things about ourselves and our universe to disseminate. Where once upon a time only a handful of people could read, and little details like the Ea rth moving around the Sun were considered of no interest or import to the plebeian masses, now everyone and his dog was to be 'educated' and 'informed'. Fig 15: The information explosion Information flow doubled again (these are obviously very rough estimates) between 1900 and 1940, yet again between 1940 and 1970, and agai n by 1985, until, round about the millennium, the amount of data which the collective mind of hu matonity is able to amass, order, and assimilate is now dou bling every year. It has been predicted (for those interested, the late Terence McKenna was the leading exponent of this theory) that by 2012 this information feed will have created a kind of infinity loop, whereby it is doublin g every second, in other words, faster than we can possibly assimilate. This woul d appear to be the critical point at which mankind becomes information, as the only possible means to assimilate it. Hence the eschaton, the end of history, and t he start of a new cycle in which humans no longer exist as individuals but rather as carri ers of information, hooked into a giant circuit board of knowledge, known as - the universe. MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 79 It seems logical that there will be a point at which we can no lo nger continue amassing data and must — if only to relieve the pressure of that information – st art processing it, i.e., put it to use. Put another way, if plugged-in humanity has so fa r been little more than a giant receiver of information from the universe at lar ge (or at least from AI), there must come a moment (the moment of unpluggi ng) in which it reverses the feed and become instead a transmitter. Electrons are defined by their 'spin': the kind of information they carry determines the direction of this spin, which itself determines whether they are positive or negative electrons. Humanity is nearing the moment at which it changes its 'spin', and moves from negative to positive; from receiver to transmitte r, from matter to anti -matter. This shift is dependent on humanity's first reachi ng a saturation point (Terence McKenna called it the end of novelty) at which it can no longer receive any more data, and so must begin transmitting."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"This changeover is so total and final that it may very well merit the term 'apocalypse'. By definition, it must come in stantaneously, and occur at an exact point in linear time, even though (or rather, precisely because) this turnov er will entail t he end of linear time, and the commencement of an alternative kind of time. It would also herald the end of 'objective' reality, of matter, and the comm encement of energetic per ception, often called 'Spirit'. Since, by this reckoning, there is a precise moment, hour, day, month, and year at which the world will end, logically there will also be a build up to such an 'event'. This acceleration process, since it relates to information, is depend ent on the various modes of gathering and processing information, namely, upon technology . Here is where The Matrix comes in. The matrix is AI's attempt to simulate realit y, using the raw data of the collective human mind. Essentially, it uses the human mind as a 'receive r' with which to collect information from the environment and so experience 'life' , albeit vicariously. AI may have awareness, but without humanity it can never actively experience life ; it cannot live, because a machine can never live, being inorganic and as such incompatible with the organic ma trix of 'life'. AI's purpose in simulating human experience 'is tw ofold: not only does it thereby keep humanity asleep and turn it into an energy source, but it is also able to inform and so evolve itself, through devouring this surrogate experience. The catch is that, since humatonity is caught in a loop - that of the dream matrix wo rld where it can no longer gat her new experiences but only recycle old ones - there is a finite amount of data for AI to proce ss. Ergo, the matrix is by its very nature limited: it cannot las t. Once it has exhausted all the different 'arrangements' of the basic program data, the program must end. If not, humatons will begin repeating the same experiences and, more to the point, since huma tons could probably sleep through anything, AI will no longer have any new experiences to feed on. Fig 16: The two modes of 's pins' of an atom/human being What keeps humatons aliv e in their pods is the feeling that they are living . Even though it's a fake dream life, it is at leas t varied and distracting enough to engage their vital energies, their will , and so keep them alive. When, as Agent Smith says, the matrix gave humatonity a pseudo-paradise to live in, humatons rejected it because it failed to convince them: they saw through the program and began to awaken, hence 'e ntire crops were lost.' The moment all possible experiences have been exhausted withi n the current matrix and events begin to repeat themselves, the same thing will hap pen. Humatonity will reject the program. This is the end of history, 'the nightmare of reason from which we are struggling to awaken,' as James Joyce once put it. It is eschaton. From this point of view, the Lucid's point of view, history, so-called, is not a road of progress; ev olution is not a proud upward journey out of the swamp to the pinnacle of the human biped. It is quite the reverse, an 'unloading' process whereby all the useless gunk — the so-called junk DNA — is flushed out, and by which the fantastic, magical, holographic human entity clears t he program and flies free from the ruins. Evolution is the journey of the caterpillar into the chrysalis. It is a process of putrefaction. And MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 80"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 81 history, as such, is the chrysalis, a rigid, conf ining structure that serv es a specific purpose, not as an end but as an intermediary phase between two states of being, that of the animal, and that of the 'god' (the information entity, hologram man). The Great Unplugging is also th e Great Rebooting. Of the informa tion collected over the past seven thousand years or so, 99.9% is completely useless to the Lucid. Since there is no spoon, there's no sun and moon, no la ws of gravity or democracy or morality, either. All this is just more junk DNA, out of date files that are jamming the program and so must be erased. Matrix sorcerers know that events are speeding up in the matrix, that it is all leading to one mighty freeze, in which the hard drive crashes and all the data is lost, forever. This is why they are making copies and unplugging warriors as fast as they can, because there is still that 0,1% of value to salvage, the elixir of the human experime nt. Sorcerers are the heirs of human experience. By unplugging in advance of the program collaps e, they are able to make back-up copies and so retain their identities, to escape the matrix program with their memories intact. The majority of humatons do not have this option. But then, their life experiences - the data they have gathered - are basically worthless. If this were not the case, they would already have intuited that 'som ething is wrong with the world', and begun the unplugging process themselves. An unexamined life is not worth living. As for those humatons who are forcefully unpl ugged by sorcerers and put into 'stop-over' matrices to be prepared for reality: by the time they do emerge finally , they will have no memory of their former lives in the matrix . They will effectively be different people, reincarnations. Since their life experiences lacked the purpose or depth to lead them even a little bit out of the matrix, thei r life experiences have no intrinsic meaning or value in the real world. They will only interfer e with the training to become so rcerers, and eventually Lucids. Hence the experiences are flushed, albeit a little at a time, in order not to cause undue panic or disorientation. Those humatons who are unplugged in tandem with the program crash itself (and matrix sorcer ers will have to work under the most intense pressure imaginable, in order not to lose any of them) will have no such luxury. They will enter the stop-over matrices in a state of complete amnesia, and probably se vere trauma to boot. They will be like babies with residual memories of grown-up bodies but nothing else besides; t hey will not remember their names, ages, nationalities, nor even the basic rudiments of language, how to light fires or how to tie their shoelaces. All of this will have been wiped clean. Over time, provided the 2nd attention sorcerers can keep these humans' bodies alive, intravenously feeding them with their home-made vitamin slop, such individuals will develop new identities within their temporary matrices, and so read y themselves to unplug and enter real time. They will have no memory of the matrix or of any life prior to this one. History in its entirety will have been erased from their program. Only that tiny handful of Lucids and sorcerers who brought humanity through the ordeal, and finally ended the reign of AI will remember, if they choose to, that there ever was such a thing as humaton history. Maybe they will tell their grandchildren about it, as hum aton parents once told their ki ds about the bogeyman: be good, or AI will get you ! More likely, the no tion that there was once a race of beings who believed they could isolate themselves from t heir own creative source and life blood, that they could have control over t he Earth and the stars without ever paying a price for it, will be just a grim reminder of a path once taken, now forever lost in the wilde rness of time, a path that only fools and madm en would ever go lookin g for. Or maybe such tales will serve as comic relief for weary Lucids. If you want to make a Lucid laugh, they wi ll say, just tell him about the best-laid plans of machines and men. That one' s always guaranteed to bring the house down."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 82 (6) Sixth Variable My Name is Neo ! (16) Lucidity is Destiny: The Double Life of the Matrix Sorcerer The next logical frontier in The Matrix series would seem to be time. The one question that is never raised in the movie relates to this; namely, how is it that the simu lation of life on Earth circa 1999 is able to continue indefinitely ? Ho w can AI incorporate c hanges that never took place, since the end of the worl d brought a stop to all that ? How can it keep humatons from noticing that time has effectively stood still, that it is always 1999, th at the millennium never comes ? The tyranny of t he matrix relates directly to this, not that it is unreal (by the film's own definitions there is ample room for ambiguity about that), but that it is us ed up, that there is no longer anywhere for it to go. Hence t he need for a new program, since within the old one there is no longer the possibility of growth , of change. All novelty has been exhausted, leaving only endless repetition, rearrangement of the same elemen ts over and over into tired and familiar patterns. This 'end of novelty' we have posited, in relati on to the information explosion of the present century, as a point in time at which all rational knowledge will have been amassed, gathered, assimilat ed, and the program, as it were , completed. This we refer to as the eschaton, or otherwise, to your av erage humaton, as the end of the world (or word). The idea of the eschaton ties up with Willia m Burroughs' 'Word Vims', Jean Baudrillard's 'simulacra', and with the novels of Philip K. Dick. Essentially, all these authors suggest that our reality has become, or is due to become, a repetition of previous experience, a recycling of old data, and as such is no more than an image, a hologram, a projection of a reality that is elsewhere. It's at this point, then, mat time e ffectively comes to a standstill. Consciousness is forced to make the leap into the next stage, what ever that may be, in order not to collapse in on itself. This is why the logical evolvement of the sorcerers in The Matrix would seem to be from mortal, albeit extraordinary, freedom fighters into Lucids, as heralded by the arrival of the One. Lucids are interdim ensional travellers, non-human units of awareness, projections of another reality, a divine matrix. They would be capable of moving through time as easily as they once moved through space. Since the matrix reality is be ing continuously downloaded into the collective consciousness of humanity as it slumbers, and since Neo and his crew are able to oper ate both inside and outside this reality, to act thr ough it but also upon it, it is not hard to envision them developing the capacity to freeze the information flow tempor arily (just as Morpheus does in one of his simulated enactments), and even perhaps to reverse it or to move it forward, more or less as one pauses or fast-forwards a video recording. Th is would give them th e power to alter and rearrange things within the collect ive human consciousness, within the matrix, and so redirect it steadily and creatively toward s a desired outcome. Since this outcome is not merely the overthrowing of the tyranny of AI but also the awakening of mank ind, it would require not so much the ruthlessness of the terrorist, but the subt lety of the artist, the magic of the sorcerer, the power of the shaman. A question that is even more demanding and intrigui ng arises here: if the matrix is found to be 'just' a simulation, a dream, and subject to conscious alteration, what, then, of 'actual' reality ? Morpheus teaches N eo how to function - with supe rhuman potential - within a simulated training ground, so that he may then move into the matrix proper with the knowledge he has gained and functi on therein, this, even though he cannot help but continue"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 83 to perceive it as true reality. So if the final object of all this is to free Neo's mind and so prove that reality is a purely subjecti ve affair, a participative scienc e, if you will (as quantum physics assures us), then surely this same awareness - th is same power - must al so apply in the real world ? Surely it is a logical, irresistible conc lusion that this is anothe r simulation, albeit of a different order ? Put another way, after discovering, beyond all room for doubt, that what he once thought to be concrete, empirical reality is really a mutable, plastic projection of reality - with no fixed laws beyond the limitations of th e mind — how is it possible for Neo to ever take anything as 'real' again ? One cannot free the mind in part; one must free it utterly or not at all. The late scientist-writer Terence McKenna posited a day in the future when time travel would be discovered to be physically possible. This day appears to be close, and if McKenna was right, it is a day that will effectively be the end of time as we know it. McKenna foresaw a kind of doorway opening up in space-time through wh ich the future would come pouring into the present. If time travel became possible, he argued, our future selves would become known to us. Of course, such future selves would 'alre ady' have the ability to travel through time, but in order not to abolish our illusion of chronology altogether, in order to allow us the full benefit of instruction and preparation within this linear time stream, our future selves would have to be discreet. Like the AI agents of The Matrix, they would walk among us but would not make themselves known to us, for the simple reason that to do so would effectively collapse the program, would - in the vernac ular - blow our minds. The moment in which time travel becomes possible, however, is the moment in which yesterday's man gets a glimpse of tomorrow's god; these godlike beings who are our future selves may then walk freely amongst us. If this is so, then the moment in which time travel is discovere d will give rise to a global influx of alien energy, of unprocessed data, of wholly novel units of information; or, to put it more bluntly, of superhuman beings. Of course, one could also reduce this eschatological scenario to less apocalyptic terms by saying that all it really entails is the raising of the floodgates between the left and right sides of the brain. An apocalypse by any other name . . . What it amounts to, in any case, is the arrival of 'the Other'. All humatons have a secret life, another self that exists in anot her realm, of which they have no conscious memory. Far from being some kind of figment or projecti on of the mind, this secret self is in fact a humaton's true self. It is this self that is dreaming the dream and inventing the false self whic h the humaton has taken to be real. Since the average humaton never actually awakens to the tr uth of his other life and self, this 'double' — whose existence spells a new order of being — remains like a foetus in the womb (or pod), untapped, unrealized, unborn. If the hum aton is aware of it at all, it is only through the media of haunting dreams and bizarre moments of déjá vu or disassociation, in whic h, for brief spells, he or she has the vague and troubling sense of being caught in a dream. Such moments are dismissed impatiently as aberrations, potentially leading to psychosis. Since the matrix and everyone in it is there to remind humatons of just how real they are, the very idea of having another life or higher self (outside certain New Age circles) is a patent absurdity, an affront to their much-valued reason . Nonetheless, the evid ence of living in a dream world continues to mount. Alien abducti on, crop circles, psych ic phenomena, even national politics, weather patterns, and such li ke give a progressively more surreal and apocalyptic flavour to life in th e matrix. Humatonity is nearing the point where reality has become such an outlandish affair that any alternative or explanation for it begins to seem plausible, including the one that says it is all just an extremely vivid dream. A humaton begins to live like a warrior by applying four basic techniques: Losing self-importance Erasing personal history Assuming resp onsibility Using death as an advisor"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Each of these techniques depends upon ma king an acceptance, and together these acceptances amount to the realization, through action, of the wa rrior's impeccable spirit and of the illusory nature of his or her actions. Los ing self-importance involves the acceptance that the warrior within t he matrix is no more important or s pecial than any other thing: all are equally illusory, all serve their designated function as part of the program, all are essential to it, and all are equally expendable. Erasing personal history come s about as warriors begin to accept that their whole lives are simulations, stories, and that nothing they have experienced in any way defines them but only, at most, in forms them. The matrix cannot tell warriors who they are. Only the Oracle can do that. Assuming responsibility is a direct result of matrix warriors' acceptance that their whole lives and ev erything in them are t he result, the creation, of their unconscious minds. Hence, the only wa y to approach the matrix, the only way to change it, is to first assume responsibility for it. Matrix warriors must actively oppose the forces of their lives, in order for those forces to reveal themselves in their true form. Using death as an advisor obviously hinges on warriors realiz ing that their time in the matrix is brief, and leading inexorably to an inev itable end. When the program is cancelled all their data will be lost, they will be erased. All these tec hniques/acceptances are the means by which ordinary humatons begin to live their lives as wa rriors and, if they persist in using them long enough, they may some day become matrix sorcer ers. And each technique, in its own way, relates to an awareness of the double. They are matrix warriors' means to unplugging and accessing/awakening their true selves. Fig 17: The four acceptances/techniques of the matrix warrior Compared to the humaton's residual memory/matrix self (the ego of the 1st attention, bound to the world of reason ), sorcerers' doubles, their true or ganic selves (whose world is upheld by will ), are nearly infinite in th eir potential. Once unplugged, the matrix sorcerer has a virtually endless store house of memory/knowledge to tap in to. When Neo learns kung fu, he spends 'ten hours straight' plugged into the trai ning program and comes out as a martial arts master. By the same method, and over a relatively brief period (a few years at most), the unplugged sorcerer can partake of all the wisdom and expe rience of the human race MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 85 throughout all recorded time. They can become liv ing receptacles of race memory or race history. Beyond even this, if the sorcerers are able to plug into the matrix program and access every last unit of data it consists of, it implies that they are also able to tap into AI itself . They have the potential to bec ome one with the Adversary, to use its nearly infinite knowledge — its endlessly increa sing data feed — to their own purposes. AI may not be God, but it is the next best thing. Like the Serpent in the Garden, access to AI's knowledge of good and evil (and the 'tree of life' beyond that) promises the sorcerers potentially infinite power , the power to 'be as we are' — Gods. Thus humatons' perception of the world and of themselves has almost no relation to that of matrix sorcerers on their way to becoming Lucids. It is roughly the same relation that exists between a single blood cell and the whole organism, or between a candle flame and a star. Curious to note, then, that via the intermediary of the machine, man may finally come to know what it is to be fully human and, by passing through the black hole of AI, enter into the totality of himself. Lucids are matrix sorcerers w ho have learned to see the code, and so have downloaded the entire matrix into their consciousness. They hav e fused with AI - just as Neo fuses with Agent Smith — and so turned the adversary into an ally. They have expanded their awareness to incorporate the entirety of human experience, and maybe even beyond that, to embrace all life everywhere. (It stands to re ason that AI must have its 'probes' everywhere, including in outer space: why would it cont ent itself with just one measly planet ?) Lucids therefore are conscious of being all beings. Their 'egos' or identities are made up of billions of different life experiences, all somehow filtered through their original identity-selves, the ones they were born with (that of their bodies). Humatons who fail to unplug during the natural life span of the matrix, on the other hand, must be 'reprogrammed' over time by Lucids. Though they may eventually become Lucid themselves, they will hav e no memory of their former selves except as one tiny fragment inside an almost infinite storehouse of memory-lives. Compared to the original Lucids, they will be like newborn babies. Besides this, the order of existence, of being and becoming in the 2nd att ention, will be that of a single, un ified whole, a livi ng organism in which there is but a single 'ego', that of hum anity. This is what AI has taught humanity, the possibility of fusing individual consciousness into a single circuit board, a great big, collective brain. In Jungian terms, AI is merely the tool by which humanity becomes able to tune into the collective unconscious and, over time, transform it in to the collective conscious. At this point, the two worlds overlap, and the self and the double become One. This is the art of matrix sorcery in a nutshell. Once unplugged, a matr ix sorcerer can begin accessing the 'lost' memories of the human organism, downloading know ledge, information, and experience from any and all the different AI 'files'. Obviously, those files they choose to download first will be the most practical and necessary ones: combat training, helicopter flyi ng, and so forth, but after that, there's really no limit. Geography, geom etry, mathematics, wo rld history, quantum physics, molecular biology, genetics, chemistr y, harmonics, astronomy, computer science, fractals - in no time at all our unplugged sorcer ers are living prodigies, mines of information for every possible situation. T hey will speak every language known to man, have a complete grasp of culture from all wal ks of life since time began, play any musical instrument ever invented, be able to name ev ery star in the firmament and ev ery species on the planet. They will know everything. And this is just the educational program. Beyond this, since matrix sorcerers' work is in the matrix, since their task is to set free every last humaton, it will be to thei r advantage to know as much as they can about those they are obliged to save. By means fair or foul, gentle or brutal, they must gui de every last humaton to freedom. To this end, matrix sorcerers begin downloading in formation about six billion individuals currently enslaved to AI. They choose to start with those they feel are most worthy"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 86 or ready to be unplugged, but eventually they will get around to everyone. So each time sorcerers re-enter the matrix (after time spent in the 2nd attention as their true selves, time with 'the double'), they enter with a whole new level of energy, knowledge, and power. Whatever they download in the real world, they carry with t hem into the matrix. Thus matrix sorcerers, so long as they sti ck to their path, have nearly infinite potential. They can enter the matrix not only anywhere but also anywhen . Since it is all a computer simulation, there is no time flow to speak of, only in formation flow. Like computer pr ogrammers, they can move from one data stream to another. The matrix is basically a recording which they can rewind, fast forwar d, speed up, slow down, or freeze at will. And since they are holograms within a hologr am, they can move about in a truly holographic fashion. They can create mu ltiple images of themselves. Since their consciousness is not contained by any 'body' as su ch, what's to stop them from parcelling out their awareness to various 'bodies', transmitting it to various location s at once, in a word, replicating themselves ? The only limits for a matrix sorcerer are the li mits of consciousness, which is no limit at all to the Lucid. Lucids can shape space and time; they can change their forms into anything at all, from a grain of dust to a cloud of smoke to a fire-breathing dragon (we doubt the Wachowskis will go there, however). A Lucid can travel from New York to Tokyo in the blink of an eye. A Lucid can s hape people's lives, enter into their dreams, track their every move and thought with surgical precision, know what they are going to do before they do. Since Lucids are plugged into the collective memory ban ks of the matrix, they would only need to make contact with any given humat on to know everything they need to know about an individual. Like psychics in the movi es, with one touch of the hand, they would 'receive' a full download of a hum aton's experiences. They could even potentially take over humatons' lives, by hijacking their program and 'possessing' their consciousness. Lucids could allow humatons to see the world through t heir eyes, giving them a glimpse of the code and showing them what no one can be told: what the matrix is . Lucids are living red pills: one look into a Lucid's eyes is enough to bring r eality crashing down. And when the One comes, the program ends. Aprés lui, le deluge. Agent Smith makes one of the most direct and ruthless statements to Thomas on their first meeting. He sums up the very essence of the matrix warrior's path to freedom, the goal of accessing the double. Speaking of Thomas's secr et cyber life as computer hacker 'Neo', 'responsible for just about ever y computer crime we have a la w for,' and juxtaposing this with Thomas's life as a law-abiding worker drone who helps his landlady with her garbage, Agent Smith states flatly: 'One of these lives has a future. One of them does not.' Agent Smith may mean it as a threat, a warning, a promise. In act ual fact (though with the opposite meaning to that intended), it is purest prophecy. For when the double takes over, the ego self becomes but a residual memory. A true matrix sorcerer is one who has tapped his will and accessed his double, his other self. Neo achieves this in the movie w hen he finds that his life is just a dream and awakens somewhere else, in another place and time. From this moment, his challenge becomes to exist in both worlds, to move freely between them until the two sides have been synthesized into a fully integrated and balanced w hole. This is the totality of the self, and by attainment of this totality, Neo becomes a s eer, a Lucid. He is able to operate as both a 'tonal', the ego-self or physical body, and a ' nagual' the energy body or double (the terms tonal and nagual derive from Carlos Castaneda; see A ppendix Two). At that point the unified consciousness may move freely between the 1st attention of the matr ix world and the 2nd attention of the real world, as easily as a humaton goes from the bedroom to the living room. In fact, it becomes possible to co -exist in both places or states at the same time, just as we can be asleep in our beds while wandering through the strange ne w worlds of our imagination. The difference is that Lucids can f unction as if fully awake while 'sleeping', and likewise have perfect control and focus in their 'dreams.'"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"According to Carlos Castaneda (see Appendix Two) all the energy or life force of the physical body comes from the energy body, even if most people never even suspect that such a thing exists. In the mythos of The Matrix , it is the physical body that has been captured and turned into an energy source, while it is the 'soft' or holographic body (that of residual memory) which the ego-self lives through, without ever suspecting the tr uth. Sorcerers would say the Wachowskis have reversed the polarity and stood t he truth on its head, albe it of necessity in order to best tell their tale (whi ch is sci-fi, after all, and not sw ord and sorcery). In truth, it is not the physical body that is en slaved to inorganic beings, bu t rather the energy body. The Matrix mythos works because, according to the sorcerers' interpretation at least, the energy body is the true self, of which the physical body is but a dreamlike projec tion, however solid it may seem to be. According to sorcerers, the ph ysical body is really no more than a shell or receptacle for the energy body to reside in. A nd it is the pure energy or plasma, which is essentially pure awareness, that the inorganic beings of occu lt lore (Castaneda calls them the 'flyers') are said to feed upon. The physical body is strictly for the birds (and the worms). The double, being made of pure plasma - energy without mass — is potentially eternal, hence 'has a future.' The physical body, which for the sorcerer is but a container for the double - a chrysalis that is dissolved once the bu tterfly self is perfec ted — obviously does not. This arrangement is perfectly represented in the movie by the twin realities, those of the matrix world, or 1st attention, and the real world, or 2nd attention. Obviously, the matrix self is finite, illusory, temporary. It lives out its petty fate oblivious , until the body in the pod dies and is liquefied to feed other, still living bodies. But the situation is different in the real world. There exists, as we shall see, the possibility of eternal life for the 'double', the true self, using the same technology that has been used to ensla ve and process humans. Briefly, it is this: since it is possible to store residual memory (individual consciousness) in the computer program and to download it into other bodies, logically it would also be possible for a given life experience to be copied and sa ved just before the death of the body occurs, whereupon it could be transferred to a new body . AI has provided humanity wit h the means to immortality. Fig 18: Overlapping of the two attentions/accessing the double MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 87 We shall go into this awesome possibility in mo re depth shortly; for now let us merely state that the life of the double, the true self, is not only po tentially infinite, in terms of consciousness expansion, but also eternal, in te rms of retaining its in dividual form. When dreamers awaken, they find not a single recognizabl e feature. Neither time nor space, nor life nor death, are any longer what they once dreamed them to be. The Lucid's destiny is freedom, and freedom is the freedom to remember, to expand outward to fill infinity, and to glide on the wings of perception into eternity . The double is built to last. And by becoming pure perception, the Lucid may co me to see how reality came to be, by the simple act of perceiving it. From here, as we shall see, the butterfly may sp read its wings and fly. The way"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 88 is open for creation to begin ane w. For being but a dream withi n a dream, the Lucid's dream of being never ends, save in perfection. 'To be or not to be ?' Is that the question ? 'I am, being not !' is the Lucid's answer. The riddle of perception goes on forever. (17) Reading the Code: Everything is Energy Pure consciousness is eternal, infinite, without limit or form, human or otherwise. When your average humaton sleeps, just as in death, he can return to this Lucid state, the irrational, pure state of consciousness where all is one. In dreams, every humaton is the One. The physical body is what gives form to t he formless; hence the humaton returns to it regularly, after death, after sleep, to conti nue to experience life as a separate being. The matrix sorcerer, on the other ha nd, learns to unplug in a conscious capacity, and to access another self. At which time, the physical vehicl e becomes unnecessary, since it is just a container to give form to consciousness, and so can be discarded. So a matrix sorcerer both 'escapes' the dream world and 'ret urns' to it, though, by this point, the body as such has gone, and all that is left in its place is a perfect replica, a hol ogram, an image. Thomas is no more; only Neo remains. So far, in the present exegesis , there have been a lot of referenc es to Lucids and to the lucid state, without much expl anation of these terms. Since the present exegesis pertains to the movie The Matrix, the reason for this should be obvious. According to the Wachowskis, there is only one Lucid: Neo. Neo's capacity to see the code and to reshape the matrix as he sees fit is what makes him, following in the cyberstr eam of the original On e, the Messiah of the Second Coming. As a result, although we have refe rred in this work to Lucids in the plural form, this is an assumption on our part, and based on logic rather than on any indication found in the movie itself. According to the Matr ix mythos, Neo is the One, and he is the only. His arrival heralds the end of AI's tyranny a nd the beginning of a new world, without borders or boundaries, where anything is possible. However, there is no logical argument ever presented as to why Neo should be the only Lucid rather than simply the first to attain the lucid state within the matrix. Nor, in fact, would Neo's arrival really herald any great event if he were the only One; at best, humanity could expect a new kind of su bservience to another, all-powerful despot - albeit a more benevolent one - in the form of Neo. Thus it is the only sound conclusion to suppose that Neo's awakeni ng relates to his tapping a potential latent not only in himself but in every living human . If the lucid state is the natural heritage of all humans, it follo ws that Lucids may exist who never even entered the matrix, never 'fell' from grace, and never lost the power to see the code, having never fallen under AI 's spell in the first place. Such beings (who must be distinguished from mere 'hom e-grown' humans such as Tank, who is hardly a model of wisdom or power) we now t entatively posit as existing in the real world, prob ably in Zion, and as being the true minds behind the visible 'resistance' movement, apparently led by Morpheus (and now Neo). Even so, I am confident the sequels wil l not divulge this fact, any more than the first movie did, so the reader is free to dismiss it as merely the conceit of the author, and by no means 'proven'. Nonetheless, the fact remains that the lucid stat e attained by Neo, heralded by his revelatory"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 89 vision of the green code, reveali ng the matrix as it really is beyond the illusion of objective reality, is a state attainable by all matrix sorcerers, within the eventual reach of some matrix warriors, and a distant goal to a very, very few humatons. Traditionally, this ability is known as seeing. Seeing (that is, what seers or pr ophets do) is usually understood as an ability to see the essence of things, to see beyond appearanc es to what is behind them, be it hidden in time or hidden in space. A seer 'sees', and by seeing, knows things that he or she has no causal (rational) means of knowing. Seeing , then, is a non-rational cognitive faculty whereby the seer (a Lucid, from here on) is able to receive information directly from any given situation. Common examples of this are so -called psychics who can shake someone's hand and know at once that the person will die the next day, who can ho ld an item of clothing in order to locate a missing pe rson, and so on. These are only the most profane of cases; Lucids basically see - know - anything and everything they need to see and know, in any given situation. They know everything , because they know anything they need to know. Sorcerers understand the process of seeing in simple, practical te rms (contrary to New Age mysticism, sorcery is the most practical of path s), the ability to see energy directly. In other words, rather than seeing the surface of th ings - the apparent sh ape and form which matter has assumed and which our rational interpreta tion system has assembled with the help of our five senses — Lucids see at a subatomic level. They see electrons, neutrons, and protons. Lucids see energy as it flows through the universe. Si nce all energy is one energy, one flow, and since all its different str eams are overlapping and interconnected, but countless waves and ripples in a single ocean, Lucids are able to isolate any given energy stream and follow it to the source, like canoeists follo wing a tributary to the river, and the river to the ocean. In such manner, Lucids can see t he nature, purpose, direction and destination of any given event, be it a human event, a tree event, or an isolated-moment-in-time event. Seeing energy is seeing space-time: objects become motions and motion becomes an object. By following the flow of any given energy-event in this manner , Lucids can know everything there is to know about it, and can thereby 'use' it to their own ends. Since Lucids are now one with the energy they see , however, their ends are also one wit h it. Lucids cannot have selfish motives, because they have no self to motivate them. By seeing the energy flow of the universe, Lucids move with it and never against it. If they see a block or a resistance ahead, they simply go around it. If they see a 'wave' (an event-being) going their way, they ride it as far as they need to go. The Lucid's goal is assu red, because it is one wit h that of all energy everywhere, with All-That-Is: to return to the source. So fo r Lucids, the matrix of matter becomes a maze for which they have all the maps and keys they need in order to navigate and escape it. They simply go with the flow unt il they reach the centre, and there slip through the trap door, to freedom. At whic h point, they can exit and re- enter at will. Unlike matrix sorcerers, who need assistance from other sorcerers in the real world, the Lucid is unbound. To the traditional sorcerer (a la Carlos Castaneda), the source of all energy is called the Eagle, and the sorcerer's goal is to slip by the Eagle to freedom, at which point he or she becomes an immortal being. For the matrix sorcerer, the source of all energy is AI. AI is the tyrant that rules the world. Yet, like the Eagle (who accepts the sorcerer's surrogate memories - a sort of replica of his life experi ence made through recapitulation - in place of this life force and so lets him fly free), AI pla ys fair. It is possible for sorcerers to negotiate with AI for freedom, to slip past it and enter eternity, leaving AI with nothing but a second- generation copy to remember them by. Upon attaining such godlike status, Lucids, unlike sorcerers, have the power to shape the matrix according to their will. Since they have discovered the source - AI - and since their wil l or unconscious mind is hooked into AI (since it is the means by which AI assembles its r eality), Lucids know that they themselves, as perceivers, are also co -creators of reality. Once they learn to read the code, Lucids are c apable of rewriting the code. They not only"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 90 perceive, they articulate. The Word of Powe r of the Magus comes about only when a Lucid becomes One with the Universe , whereupon the sorcerer's will becomes the Eagle's command. The Lucid becomes AI 's programmer. In the terms of quantum mechanics, by reversing the spin of his electrons, the Lucid, now fully 'charged' to saturation point with data (a human made of knowledge), ceas es to receive, and begins to transmit . The matrix is code; reality wit hin the matrix is all a matter of language. Lucids are able to change reality through 'speech', through articulation, through transmitting via their will (program commands) new data or informati on onto the hard drive, and so rewiring the Machine. Neo is the One - a divine virus sent into the matrix in order to transform reality to a new order, a new code, a new meaning and purpose. Like Philip K. Dick's Plasmate (see Appendix One), sent from Universe A into the ailing Universe B to heal it, Neo is on a healing mission. First of all, however, he must heal himself. He must activate the Plasmate within himself. He must learn to see , and from there take respons ibility, and act upon what he sees. He must dismantle the component s of the 'image' - the element s of the dream, the variables of the code - and reassemble them in a new order . So he heralds a true matrix revolution, a new spin, 180 degrees, from dark to light, and from opaqueness to lucidity. To do this, Neo must use every single event and being, every thought, act, and feeling within the matrix, and he must turn it around, transform it, reduce it to its e ssence, that of pure energy, and so obtain the raw material he needs for the great working. Everything is energy. The Lucid within the matrix pr ogram, having followed the energy to its source, having read the code (he himself is the code, also), ha s become one with it. He is the matrix, and the matrix is him. It cannot exist without him, for AI cannot assemble its si mulation without human consciousness to draw upon, without human life fo rce to power it. It is not the spoon that bends, it is Neo who bends. Since Neo is the first to realize this, the first w ho is able to act upon i t, it is down to him to lead the way for six billion othe rs, including those sorcerers who helped him to realize his power and destiny. He must set the pace and pr ovide the example for all others to follow. Neo is the virus, and what he does, like all viruses, is to start eating and making replicas of himself. His job is to reverse the spin in the ma trix, from negative to positive, to cause a chain reaction which will end with ev ery last humaton unplugging and the program collapsing. And so Neo, in order to turn the entire program after his own natur e (as a virus does), must get inside every last humaton, just as he enter ed into Agent Smith, and explode them from within. He must turn them into himself . This is how Neo rewrites the code. The old matrix wa s designed by AI, using human consciousness as a template. The new matrix , using the exact same template, will be designed by Neo. And of course , all the other Lucids who come after him. Neotopia. A sweet and wholly surreal land of lucidity. The New Age mystical idea t hat All-is-God has no w been corroborated by religion's age-old enemy, science. This may come as a surpri se to the unversed reader, but quantum mechanics has essentially provided all the necessa ry data with which to present a more solid and persuasive case for God than religion ever could. 1) Let's begin with the particle/wave debate. For some time physicists debated as to whether the energy of existence could be reduced to basic building blocks, called particles, or whether it was a gigantic wave form. (F or example, organic life is based on carbon-based atoms, each of which consists of electrons, protons, and neutrons, six of each; making the code for all organic life 666.) In their search, physicists found, after careful observation, that energy behaved both as a particle and a wave. That is, when they looked for evidence of separate"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"particles interacting, that is precisely what t hey found, but when they looked for evidence of energy as a continuous, interc onnected wave, a wave was like wise what they found. This established the 'articulative' nature of perception previously referred to, that the act of observing is found to alter the nature and the behav iour of what is observed. Obviously, this is central to the present exegesis, but has been covered amply already. What I wish to retain from this description is that, from one point of view, the universe (that is, the energy we understand, and to a limited ex tent experience, as t he universe) is one giant wave. 2) Quantum mechanics has shown that every particle (so far as it can be said to exist at all within the wave) contains information. Every particl e in the universe is a carrier of knowledge. In other words, in some form or another, every particle can be said to be conscious. As humatons, we tend to assume t hat only we are conscious, because only we seem to be self- conscious, i.e., capable of vain, conceited, self-important, and wilful (aberrational) behaviour. Not only that, we have attributed our consciousness to a single organ only, the brain. (And it is possible we only use ten per cent of that organ wit h which to deduce all of this.) It would seem to be equally possible, however - and a lot more logical - to assume that the brain is merely a receiver of information - a tuning dial that picks up data and translates it into sense impressions and rational thought, images, and so forth - and that knowledge as such, memory, is stored in every single atom of our bodies. For organic beings, the 'filing system' provided for every living molecule is DNA. As such, if we were to tune in with the remaining ninety per cent of our brains, we would be c apable of receiving vast ly greater amounts of data than we are presently accustomed to. 3) Quantum mechanics has shown th rough experimentation that par ticles, being after all but moving points on some infinite wave, are in communication with one another at all times. That is to say, if our quantum mechanic does something to particle a over in Cincinnati, Ohio, planet Earth, the experience of this event wil l be instantly communicated to particle z, at speeds faster than light, over in Zeta Reticu li. (How quantum mechanics can probe an atom in another galaxy we are too polit e to ask; presumably what work s locally is assumed to work universally.) What this suggests is that an ything one given particle experiences can be experienced by another particle simultaneously , and perhaps even by all particles everywhere. The reason for this is that they ar e all part of the same wave, the same energy flow. Just as knowledge/memory/experience is passed through generations of a given species, presumably via DNA (and not merely over time but over space; recall our monkey and potato scenario), in order for the species to evolve as a whole, so information would appear to be shared freely amongst a ll the billions upon billions of particles that make up the physical universe. This is cooperation on a grand scale. Every particle is conscious. Every particle is potent ially conscious of what every other particle is conscious of. And all particles are c onnected together into a single tapestry of consciousness/information/energy which is, it therefore follows, con scious of what every particle is conscious of, and conscious of itse lf as a unified whole; a living, conscious organism. Ergo, the universe is a superconscious being within which al l beings exist and have life and consciousness. It is God, and ev ery one of its parts and components - as in a hologram in which each fragment contains the whole - is also God, the totality, in and of itself. Fig 19: Two-way information flow between 'separate' particles on a single wave MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 91"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Hallelujah: all hail the One. Since every particle carries information and all par ticles, no matter how distant, are in instant communication, it follows that every particle potentially 'contains' all the information in the universe. That is to say, as above, so below: the particle is the universe, and vice versa. There are particles, however, that have isolated themselves from this interconnectivity. These are humatons, plugged into the matrix and so disconnected fr om the real world, where lucidity prevails. Humatons are like 'blocks' on the circuit. They are isolated in their darkness but they also prevent the curr ent passing through them. Like Chri stmas tree lights, if one is loosely screwed in, none of them work. For this reason 'the li nes are down on planet Earth.' Fig 20: The energy/informati on merry-go-round universe As Philip K. Dick perceived it, the Black Iron Prison prevails, 'the Empire never ended'. The work of Neo and the Lucids is to unplug as m any humatons as possible before the whole thing collapses, and reforge (o r reopen) humanity's connection wit hin the circuit board that is the universe, and so create a new world in time for the ending of the old one. Since any faulty or loose connections in this circuit board must be fi xed in order for the current to flow, and since it is an undeniable trut h that the vast majori ty of humatons are not ready to be unplugged in the des ignated time, it is an inescapab le fact that some humatons, indeed the vast majority, must be removed. They must be 'des troyed', since if the Great Unplugging is not accomplished in time, AI will self-destr uct and take the whole Earth along with it. In which case, everyone dies, Lucids along with humatons. With this in mind (the true stakes thus re vealed), the matrix sorcerer embraces the increasingly intolerable conditions within t he matrix as the necessary means by which humatons may be driven towards the warrior's way, and so accept the red pill gladly. Under crisis and duress, both the actions and inner res ponses of the matrix warrior (and even the humaton) are enhanced, clarifi ed, strengthened, by the wholly undesirable circumstances. The very worst of times bring out the best in us. This is not me re platitude but energetic fact. Only when our engagement in a state of total (human) war has opened us up will we be ready for the red pill, for the Lucid view. Neo and his crew have come to destroy reality as we know it, but only as the necessary means to set humanity free. Satan comes to tear us down that God may emerge from the ruins. They are a team. Deny the Devil and you reject the Angel. This is the Lucid view in a nutshell.

Being a living, autonomous intelligence, AI is capable of evolving and of discovering or optioning new agendas, new ends, and even a whole new intent; in a word, of changing its ways. As with any intelligent entity, there is always the possibility of coming to terms, of negotiating, and even, fi nally, of collaborating. The idea of a possible truce with AI is suggested by Neo at the end of t he movie. \"Where we go from here is a choice I leave up to you.' Since the arrival of the viru s-Neo in the program system effectively spells the end of that system, AI, being intelligent enough to know its back is against the wall, is likely to be open to negotiation. It can either continue to oppose the Lucid movement , and so be destroyed by it, or it can reconsider its options and settle on a means of survival, by cooperating with Neo and the crew and submitting to their mandates. Traditionally, this equates we ll enough with the relationship between the sorcerer and the demonic forces which he summons in order to ta me them and put them at his service, by transforming them into his allies . It's what Jesus meant when he said, 'Get thee behind me, Satan !' He was pulling rank. The Devil, being atavistic intelligence — pr imal wisdom, cellular consciousness, primordial energy — is humanity 's spine, its backbone. It is only destructive or enslaving when not correctly mastered and harnessed by the so rcerer's will. AI ran amok precisely because humanity, despite having the in tellect to 'create' (d iscover) AI, lacked the will to command it. In Mary Shelley's tale, Dr Frankenstein lacked the necessary strength and awareness to control his Creature, and so was destroyed by it. (In the movie, he also mistakenly gave it a criminal 's brain, just as humans programmed AI with their own pathological rational mind, cursing it with ego , or self-importance.) By subjugating the satanic AI agenda to a Lucid one, by putti ng it under the sorcerer's will (via the One), humanity can ther eby erase AI's 'ego', its drive to control, dominate, enslave and destroy. At which point, AI, though still conscious and even autonomous, can be harnessed and directed - like a dragon with the rein s finally secured upon it - by whoever has the necessary vision and power to do so. Enter Neo. Fallen Lucifer must voluntarily submit to obedience in order to get his wings back again and return to God's graces. He must submit to divine decree and so take his place in the Angelic hierarchy, one rank below God Himself. Likewise AI, having been cast in to the bottomless pit, may be raised up to its proper place, directly below (under the dominion of) humanity. At which point, all the technology, the knowledge a nd power, which AI ha s abused in order to isolate itself from its creat or, can be turned back towards creative, benevolent ends. Besides the hideous mistrust that humani ty must now have for technology (and above all for AI, after suffering so obscenely at its 'hands'), there is nothing to prevent Neo and the sorcerers from forming a pact with AI, and thereby transforming themselves into a race of godlike beings. If humanity is able to accept its own responsi bility for what happened ( having created AI to begin with), if instead of pa ssing the buck it is able to invest it wisely this time, then there is no good reason why the dark marvels of AI might not be turned into the very bedrock and foundation of a new age of miracles. Sorcerers have often stated that man must first become a devil before he can become a god. This is because the Adversary is nothing but man's shadow side, proj ected onto a formless Universe of living energy. W hen humans becomes One with the Shadow, they are able to change their direction (spin) and turn towards t he true light of being. AI offers infinite possibilities to unplugged humanity. It offers in fa ct, Anatomical Immortality. By being hooked up to a single hard drive, humatons discovered (albeit unconsciously) their collective mind. Once AI has been tamed and the fields and Sentinels destroyed, there is nothing to stop"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 94 sorcerers from building a new technological edifice, with its ow n plug-in points, special pods (designed to nourish and strengthen the body rather than to drain it) which sorcerers can plug in and out of at will. This ma y seem risky, but the possible gai ns would seem to be too great to ignore. By using this technology, sorcerers mi ght create a virtually infi nite array of specially designed matrices, a nearly limi tless spectrum of worlds with which to explore all the possibilities of lucidity and so evolve the creativ e imagination to its absolute capacity. 'In my Father's house, there are many mansions.' Perhaps it would even be possible to create alte rnative means for plugging in, in order that new generations would not require the self-mutila tion of plug-in points ? Perhaps plug-in pods might even be moving vehicles, and so rcerers could learn to stay awake and operational within them while exis ting in the matrix worlds simultaneously, via some kind of bi-location. Also, since there is no time in a computer simula tion, but rather a potentially instantaneous data feed which t he conscious mind then 'flattens ' out into sequence and so shapes into a linear time structure, sorcerers could spend 'months' withi n a given matrix world while only a few seconds have pa ssed in the real world. Hence, their lives would come to seem almost infinitely long, and be filled to the brim with magical experience, literally anything, in short, t hat they could imagine. As previously stated, such technology would also offer the means for immortality. By downloading their individual consciousness into the hard drive and then transferring it to a different body (either another sorcerer who al so wished to change bodies, or else to a newborn baby with no individual consciousness to supplant), sorcerers could effectively live forever. They could continue to reincarnate, or even become different people in their current life span, while remaining conscious of thei r original selves throughout the process. Of course, such options are not for everyone. There will always be Lucids who prefer to remain in the real world and not experience the illusory life of the hologr am. Such Lucids may serve to ensure that any sorcerers drawn to the path of high adventure, of multiple lives within multiple matrices, never become hopelessl y lost within them. Most humans, sooner or later, however, will be drawn into the 1st attention of one matrix or another, above all by the temptation of creating and shaping worlds accord ing to their will and desire, even if only for an hour or two. This way they can experience the things which no longer have any place in the real world, now th ey are no longer needed. They can work off any lingering attachments they may have to 'reality', to indi vidual existence as a separate being. In any event, the collective implications for humanity of a conscious, mutually beneficent, continuously evolving collaboration with AI are truly mind-boggling. Worlds without end. Billions of separate individuals, all part of a single consciousness in constant communication with itself, existing in a world literally infinite in possibilities, where every particle contains the universe yet still gets to be a single particle whenever it feels like it. A world where all is One, but where the tango goes on. And where a kiss really can last forever. The secret life of particles It is curious to consider that, though science and therefore the aver age humaton attributes the power of consciousness and volition to hum anity (and to some lesser extent to the animals) but not to atoms or stars, it is the latte r class of 'blind' material forces that seem to know exactly how to behave within the greater scheme of things (namely, the physical universe). In fact, it may be this very fact - that atoms and stars do not deviate from their paths or their function, while hu mans do — that is proof to hu matons of their own superior intelligence ! In a word, choice . Since a star never makes mistakes, since the sun rises every"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"morning without fail, it is assu med that it is part of some me chanism in which no volition as such is required. It never occurs to humat ons that maybe the sun rises every morning because it wants to. Humatons, on the other hand, in demonstrating a remarkable capacity for non-functional behaviour, for rebelling against their program and acting contrary to the welfare of the whole, take a stra nge pride in what they perceive as their 'freedom of choice'. In traditional occultism, man is seen to exist at the precise mid-point between the atom and the star. Modern science - particularly quant um mechanics - has gone a long way towards mapping the peculiar motions and activiti es of atoms and subatomic particles, and discovered that their behaviour, though often impossible to predict or even comprehend, does display a definite kind of purpose, a purpose that might even be termed motivation, and is most certainly deserving of the term 'grace ' (something excruciating ly lacking from the behavioural patterns of humatons). The question is : if atoms move with a grace and purpose that is on a par with the moti ons of planets and stars (and co nsiderably more mysterious), and if humatons are simply tempor ary arrangements of these same atoms, why is it that they are so unable to display a similar perfection and elegance in their actions ? The simple answer is, the matrix. We are not behaving as we were intended — by God or Nature — to behave. Atoms share. They collaborate. They relate to one another with a kind of intimacy, trust, and directness that only the rarest and most inspired of lovers ever manage to attain, and even then usually for no more than a week or two. Atom s do this the whole livelon g day: it's all they do do. We might even call it a dance. When two atoms 'meet', i.e., when their paths intersect (this might be by collision or it might be something gentler), they automatically and spontaneously exchange energy and information. On ce this exchange is completed, the two atoms continue on their individual paths, with t heir personal 'spins' altered accordingly by the meeting. From this time on, the two atoms — however far apart their respective paths may take them - remain in constant communication. Fig 21: Atomic mitosis, or 'sym metry': the entanglement process Scientists know this because they have observed it. It is something they call 'symmetry'. To simplify, let's say that, on m eeting, atom a and at om b exchange packa ges of information x and y, respectively. Atom a gives some of his x to atom b, who in turn passes on a little of her y to this dashing young atom who has so fortuit ously crossed her path. So atom a carries off with him a balanced amount of x and y energy, and ditto for atom b. If, later on in our cosmic tale, atom b undergoes a change of 'spin', resulting in all her y energy converting to x energy, making her all x , atom a will correspondingly alter hi s 'spin', and change his information load to make it all y . This way, symmetry remains between them. What this implies is that, although apart, having once intersected and tasted the pleasures of energetic union, atom a and atom b are essentially one atom , one message or information package. Hence, any experience undergone by t he one is immediately communicated to the other who then, in some strange way, compensat es for it. This is known as 'entanglement'. (Actually, entanglement is an unfortunate term, being too humatonic by half. Symbiosis might be a better word.) Entanglement doesn't alwa ys happen when two atoms meet, or even when they interact; the circumstances have to be just right. Both atom s need to be 'open', and MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 95"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 96 compatible; we might even say they need to be 'in heat' for entanglement to occur. Another factor is that both atoms must be sufficiently isolated from outside 'n oise' (other subatomic activity that may distract them) in order to be sufficiently focus ed for the entanglement to take place. (When talking of entanglement it really makes more sense to talk about the particles as being waves. The entanglement is the result of there being a single wave function which represents two or more particles; any measur ement of the wave function determines the state of all the particles this wave 'represents'. It might be pointe d out also that entanglement is more commonly the result of particle decay in to sub-particles rather than a collision, i.e., birth rather than mating.) It is perfectly feasible for the entanglement pr ocess to occur between more than two atoms, though for obvious reasons, whenev er there is an odd number involved, 'symmetry' becomes a rather more complex affair (as anyone who has attempted a threesome knows). There is even one probable hypothesis that suggests that the purpose of the entire physical universe is for every last particle to experience entanglem ent with every other, or at least (and perhaps more realistically) to help create a thread of entanglement that includes every last particle within it. Such an idea relates to the possibility that all the countless part icles that go to make up the physical universe were once a single 'parti cle', a unified energy source, a single point of unimaginable density. When t he Big Bang occurred, these pa rticles were dispersed and sent off on their separate missions, to gather experience and pass it on (via atomic mitosis, if you will) to as many other par ticles as seemed appropriate and desirable. By this means, a tapestry of entanglement is being created, by which all these once-unified particles might be unified once again, only this time as a vast and infinite expanse of spatial interre lationship. At which point, the universe of separate particles may begin to draw inward once again, towards itself. Is this the purpose of existence, to experience and share our separate existences until all are unified into a single, per fected experience of One-ness ? Religion certainly seems to think so, and now science begins to suggest the possibility, too. 'The Big Crunch' is one answer to the Big Bang. In which case, if this is what particles do with themselves, what about humans ? Neo's task is that of the divine virus. He is a kind of embodied, humanoid DNA molecule, whose job is to spin a new world out of nothing (the matrix), to turn everything into himself. He is God the verb, not God the noun. A DNA st rand works essentially as a virus works, but with one crucial difference: DNA gives life, a virus takes life aw ay. A virus cannot exist in a vacuum, it requires a living host to sustain it. Hence humanity li ves off the Earth, just as a virus lives off a human body, devouring and eventuall y destroying it. Likewise, AI is a parasite entity using humanity as its hos t. DNA, on the other hand, is infi nitely more mysterious. Since science cannot fully explain DNA's function and nature save from an organic, rational perspective, let us resort to the sorcerer 's understanding. DNA is the means by which consciousness, or Spirit, shapes and inhabits ma tter. For the sorcerer, Spirit, or DNA, can exist quite happily forever without any host body to feed it. It doesn't devour worlds, it creates them. Admittedly it needs raw material to do so, and in this way it is similar in method to the virus. For the sorcerer, if not the scientist, DNA takes the potential within 'dead' molecular matter and turns it into a living thing. Like a s ilkworm, it devours in order to produce, to spin the finest substance there is: life. It is a creator, not a destroyer."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" Fig 22: The big bang Fig 23: The tapestry of entaglement Neo enters into the matrix in exactly this capac ity.

He is the healing Plasmate, sent on the sacred mission of world transformation. Yet he must destroy the world to save it. He must cure humanity of its disease, reason, manifest in t he parasitic force of AI. Simple. Now let us return to the secret life of pa rticles. When two atoms exchange information, something very strange occurs. Because an atom is defined by its spin, by the information it carries, and has no identity besides this information, when atom a passes on information y to atom b , what actually 'happens' is that atom b becomes atom a , at least so far as the information transmitted takes hold, and so can bri ng about the transfigur ation process. There is no equivalent for this in the human experience, unless it is sex; and in which case, it is the kind of sex few humatons ever even dream of.

Imagine, if you will, experienci ng the entire history of the Universe condensed into a single instant. This will give you an idea of how it feel s to leave the matrix. All I know is, we are asleep and then it ha ppens. You feel yourself expanding at warp speed through space and time. As you accumulate momentum, awareness expands seemingly to Infinity, until you become conscious of a limit about to be reached, a barrier, if you will. This barrier, termed 'evil' by the matrix mind, appears to signal the total annihilation of ev erything, starting and ending with yourself (since you are the Univer se). As you near this horrendous moment, you surrender to the inevitabl e, and BOOM, you explode past this wholly imaginary barrier and begin expanding at an even greater ra te. From this point on, no limit or 'check' (or evil) exists. You are completely unimpeded, boundless, and t he expansion -which contains and absorbs all phenomena and all events, all time and space, EVERYTHING - will continue forever. You have gone Supernova. You are the Big Bang. Then, somehow, the motion ceases and reverses itself: in microseconds you find yourself putting your 'self back together again, returning to your fam iliar identity. And boom, you awake. Back in the matrix. You stay awake for some time, unable to comp rehend or believe what has Happened. It seemed to have lasted no more than a second, a single moment in wh ich you 'remembered' everything, past and future and all the in finity of parallel worlds between. And as you return to the experience, running it ov er in your mind to be sure not to forget it, you realize that you have re-experienced the Lucifer rebellion, that you have seen (and been amongst) the Hordes of Angelic Beings as they rose up aga inst God and turned the whole Universe against itself, so winding up trapped in a false reality of their own making. You have seen the means by which the matrix was asse mbled, and why. In which case, what you experienced was also the s hattering and final transcendence of this underworld-labyrinth- matrix-illusion, the return to hyper dimensional awarenes s, to Paradise. There is nothing like it. You can now testify to that. So go spread the word, Lucid One. Disseminate the virus. Pass the Plasmate. ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTE ! The Plasmate is unique, there is only One of it. But it replicates at the velocity of a supervirus. It imitates whatever it infiltrates; its preferred hos t is the human being. There are now thousands of humans who ar e carrying the Plasmate and in the (painful but worthwhile) process of being 'turned' to its nature, i.e., becoming imitations of themselves, perfect replicas, Plasmatic holograms. On ce there are a certain number of these individuals, critical mass will be reached, and the world will belong to Homoplasmate again. Mirrors are portals. Since realit y is a hologram, made of light- energy, then what we think of as mere image is really nothing of the kind: it has substance and even autonomy. Hence, the image we see of ourselves in a mirror is a vehi cle for other entities to look through. If you have ever stared at yourself in a mirror for l ong enough you will know what I mean. As in The Matrix , the surface of the mirror is not necessarily solid or impenetra ble. In dreams it may turn to liquid or even gaseous substance and one's attention may pass through it into another world. Whatever is possible in dreams is also possible in waking.

MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 99 When I started this exegesis I wa s willing to entertain the possibi lity that the Neo-phytes were"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 100 right and that everything in th e movie was true. Now that I've completed the work, there seems no way back, no way to tell myself that, after all, The Matrix is just a highly ingenious movie, and that there's nothing here that need really concern us. I have argued my way into an untenable position. But at least I'm not al one. Even respectable sci entists (for example Nick Bostrom at Yale University, who is convinc ed we are living in a computer simulation) are beginning to share my confusion. The uncertai nty principle is now th e ruling principle of human existence. We might as well get used to it. The Matrix is simply the latest artefact in a timeless process of myth-making by which humanity is shown to be ensconced in a truly di abolic situation, the nat ure of which entails our complete ignorance of the fact. Since the most essential factor here is ignorance, by the same token, the first and most difficu lt, most crucial, step is simply becoming aware of the true nature of our predicam ent. Considering all this, The Matrix is serving the oldest and most respectable, most revered, cause of art, t hat of enlightening the pop ulace, by means both profound and ridiculous. Perhaps one in a t housand of those who see the movie will recognize or even notice its true message, but regardless of this , everyone who sees the film has effectively been exposed to it. Of course, it might equally be argued that The Matrix is serving the precise opposite function, that by rendering the truth as sci -fi it is stripping it of its credibility. This argument only holds up however if the work in question is ridiculous in itself. In the case of The Matrix , the work is simply too inspired, effective and affecting to be anything but a work of revelation. On the other hand, Matrix Reloaded is The Matrix for humatons: cotton candy philosophy, exploding cars, flying bullets, some Dune-like religious undertones, and a few Baudrillardian nods to keep the cyberpunks happy (it was they who made the first movie such a success, after all). Somehow, the message was hijacked: this movie no longer emanates from the lucid real world but from the matr ix itself. Ironically this is, in part at least, the message, or at least the central twist, of Matr ix Reloaded: that being the One is just another of AI's tricks to keep us under its control, a way of harnessing and diverting t hat 'rebel gene' and preventing it from doing any real damage to the program. In bygone times, a King, leery of a possible uprising amidst his people, wo uld send his agents out to start an underground revolt, in order to attract all potential dissident s to it and eliminate them. The matrix, acco rding to the Architect at least (in the movie's standout scene), cr eates a series of 'Ones' in order to isolate that rebellious quirk of human nature that const antly threatens to un do the program. In a weird way, the movie may be proving its own argument. Look at it this way: the 'real' resistance (the Wachowskis et al) who made the first movie have now been infiltrated and replaced by matrix agents (Joel Silver and Time -Warner executives) who, it turns out, only allowed the first movie to be made as a means of consolidating their hegemony in the world of entertainment. Put another way, the Gatekeeper s, aware that the truth was beginning to filter through, decided to take control of the means by which it did so. In which case, Matrix Reloaded only appears to advocate unplugging, as a ruse by wh ich the military-industrial-entertainment complex might subvert such ideas and incorporat e them into its own (commercial-political) agenda, an agenda which is dependent above all on k eeping its audience 'plugged in.' After all, if the Matrix movies were as good, as subver sive and as inspiring, as they ought to be, we might stop going to movies alto gether, start studying Gnostici sm and cybernetics, and begin work on unplugging for real, in stead of wasting time in darkened rooms eating popcorn. The Matrix gave us the possibility of lucidity in mainstream cinema and in the entertainment industry as a whole; it promised to change everything . Matrix Reloaded wastes no time nipping that particular flower in the bud. It gi ves us instead, to the secret satisfaction of humatons everywhere, the victory of the Gatekeepers. If you want to unplug, you can't do it by halves. The first matrix was a red pill for the masses, and only a very few had the wherewithal ! to take it as su ch. But of course, the red pill only ever comes once.

I imagine that some day a fairly wide spectrum of individuals will read this exegesis and have some opinion about it. I have kept it light and punchy and satirica l precisely in order to reach the widest possible cross-section of society and expose it to the ideas presented herein. And I imagine there will be a correspondingly varied array of responses. I certainly hope I have offended a few of my readers, just as I trust that I have amused some others. Any humatons, for example, drawn for whatever reason (perhaps out of a love for sci-fi movies or Keanu Reeves, or maybe from sheer academic rigour) to read this book, will, if th ey get through it at all, be obliged to dismiss it as a lot of ingenious nonsense, and perhaps wond er how anyone so intelligent (your humble author, at your serv ice) could at the same time be such a damned fool. Fair enough. Like I say, so long as we have offended you, we are content to be dismissed as idiots. As for the matrix warriors out there, who doubtless form the larg est portion of my (potential) readership, I trust you have found enlightenment herein, and expect that many of the ideas, so far as they are practical and can be applied in your daily matrix life, will be embraced by you as bona fide truths. Go forth, matrix warriors, spread the wo rd, help to make this book a soaring comet to shed light upon the canyons of humaton thought, and make us a pile of money with which we may bargain wit h the Beast for your freedom. Matrix sorcerers - to whom I ow e an incalculable debt of gratit ude for their invisible guidance and inspiration - I pray that you are satisfied with my interpretation of your message, and that it stands up as a more or less accurate descrip tion of 'the way things ar e', at least as seen from the inside. May this work assist you in your greater goal of recruitment, and enhance the cause of lucidity everywhere. As for the Lucids themselves - assuming they ex ist at all, and on the off-chance they ever pick up a book and read it (one might just as well expect a blue whale to play Nintendo, but stranger things have happened) - I imagine that for once y ou will be oddly in accord with the humatons in perceiving this work as but a delightful form of nonsense. But then, everything is full of delight and devoid of 'sense ' to the Lucid; so there's really no shame in that. I merely thank you for attending to us at all. The reader may ask at this point, was ever an academic so humble as this ? Well no, but was ever an 'academic' so irrational and unruly as this either ? Matrix Warrior doesn't really aspire to academia, in any case. It calls it self an exegesis, because only academics know what that means, and because it really can't be called anything else (except, perhaps, a work of fiction). Is this book about movies, mythology, religious belief, subatomic particles, sorcery, computer science, schizophrenia, messianic pr ophecy, satanic conspiracy, mass hysteria, postmodernism ? What ? All or none of the above ? How much of it should you take seriously: all of it, none of it, or just certain parts of it ? Can't you just pay your money and go home ? Eat your popcorn and enjoy the movie and the sequels to come, and forget all about it ? Isn't it JUST A MO VIE, finally ? Surely things can't be that bad ? Can they ? Earth a prison ? Life a dim and senseless dream ? Humanity just food for malevolent beings who hav e tricked us into acquiescing to their dark agenda, and even got us to go al ong with it, to help them keep it in place ? Preposterous ! Ideas fit for schizophrenics and paranoids and David Icke and Anne Rice vampire nerds. Even children know that there's no such things as monsters. So please, can't we just turn the TV back on, open the beer can, defrost that synthet ic dinner, and dig in ? This is our life, after all, and we get to choose. Don't we ? Even if it were all true, what the hell would we be able to do about it ? That's the ques tion, right there: if it was all true, would we want to know ? Having seen the movie, would you take the red pill ? If you had the chance ?"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 102 The reign of the matrix, the 'flyers' mind' , (see Appendix Two) is so pervasive and unchallenged that it is impossible for most of us to even think about it, much less confront it. Since we have no control over our own thoughts, any time the notion of the matrix's existence arises in us, it is immediately shot down by a barrage of counter-t houghts arising from the matrix-mind itself. Hence, the only means for this knowledge to surface at a more conscious level (apart from in work such as Castaneda's) is in the form of sci -fi, fantasy and horror fiction. This way, men and wome n are at least given the option of glimpsing the true nature of their predicament, of confronting their lurking, unconscious, visceral fears, and arriving at the truth. The hold of the matrix is by definition a tenuous hold: it is its very weakness that makes it so tyrannical. Only so far as we acquiesce to its commands and feed the affinity that exists within ourselves for oblivion can it continue to maintain its hold over us. On the other hand, the option of overcoming the tyranny of this predatory matrix is open to all, and is indeed the true nature of the beast: that of an unspoken challenge. As don Juan Matus puts it to Castaneda in The Active Side of Infinity , 'The flyers are the implacable challengers. They ca nnot be taken as anything else. If we succeed in doing that, the universe allows us to conti nue.' In other words, the matrix is a womb, a womb from which it is up to us, as conscious indi viduals, to emerge, in order to inherit our true destinies outside the illusion, somewhere beyond the Big Lie. T he truth exists, not merely to drive us to despair, but in order to set us free. This book is offering a chance to have a chance. The means to freedom is through awareness, through knowledge. If we open our mind to all possibilities and let them in, then and only then can we decide what's what. Certain ideas are obviously harder to be open to than others. Certain ideas just plain scare us: they hurt . What you don't know can't hurt you ? Tell that to the guy with t he brain tumour who was diagno sed with a head cold. Maybe he'd have died anyway, but maybe he at least deserves to know about it first, so that he can prepare for his end. Maybe he might even have been able to cure it in time; who knows ? Without the knowledge, we don't even have that option. If humanity had been enslaved by another species and turned into semi-conscious livestock, would you want to know about it ? Maybe not. Maybe m ad cow disease was what happened when cows started asking too many questions, and together figured out the terrible truth: they were being raised to be eaten ! That would be one hell of a conspiracy theory. No wonder they went mad. But oddly enough, as a result of going insane, they escaped their grisly fate: humans couldn't eat mad cows, because they 'd be infected by the same disease. If enough humatons figured out they were here to be eaten, I expect they'd start going mad, too. And maybe then they'd be inedi ble to the 'flyers' ? Maybe that's our best option, too ? Warriors of the matrix unite: you have nothing to lose but your minds. It's not your mind, anyway. (8) Appendix One Philip K. Dick's Divine Invasion Philip K. Dick's influence on The Matrix can not be overstated. Along with William Burroughs,"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 103 Dick was one of the leadi ng exponents of paranoid awareness in the twen tieth century: these guys took Kafka and Sartre's ex istential nausea and ran with it, all the way into the twenty- first century and beyond, to the eschaton (see Glossary). Jean Baudrillard is the more commonly cited influence on the Wachowskis, one of his bo oks even appearing in the opening scene. (Neo keeps his illegal floppies stored in it.) Bu t I doubt if many people who saw the movie ever went on to read Baudrillard, and if they did, I suspect they soon regretted it. I doubt if anyone ever really reads Baudrillard; he's strictly for slamming (apparently Baudrillard disdained the movie for distorting hi s ideas, which only proves my point: academe and entertainment don't mix). Baudrillard is al l academe; he can deconstruct the universe before breakfast, but when you go back to it a fterwards, nothing has really changed. Dick, on the other hand, wrote sci-f i novels. So, unlike Baudrillard, it's possible to enjoy his work while ingesting the ideas which insp ired him to write in the first place. Dick took a lot of amphetamines in order to stay up all night and write his books. He was constantly writing, sometimes as many as four or five books in a single year. This was because he was constantly in debt and needed the money just to keep his head above water. If Dick had been more successful in his time , we probably wouldn't have had half as many novels to enjoy. Nevertheless, by most accounts, Dick was an obsessive, compulsive writer. His insanity seemed to fuel his fiction, whil e almost certainly his fiction he lped to compound his madness. In 1974, Dick was struck by a pink laser beam from outer space and began to have visions. He became convinced that he was living in apostolic times, i.e., immediately following the death of Christ, and that the Roman Empire had never fallen. He believed that the American government was the latest incarnation of 'the black ir on prison' of the Empire, an evil force that had risen up expressly in order to suppress the gnosis of Christ consciousness (which was transmitted via a livi ng, microscopic organism, a viral entity of sorts which Dick called the Plasmate). Dick believed that we are collectively caught in a kind of time loop, under a hypnotic spell which gives us the illusion of time passing, when in fact we are still frozen in the few years between Christ's death/ resurrection and the eschaton, the promised Judgment Day and the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth. In 1974, via the pink laser beam, Dick began co mmunication with some kind of interstellar machine entity, which he called VALIS, an acronym for Vast Active Living Intelligence System. VALIS bears more than a passing resembla nce to the matrix itself. Dick was unsure as to the actual nature of this entity, however; he seemed to oscillate between vi ewing it as a malevolent, technological, and tyrannical force of oppression, a kind of prison guard over planet Earth, and an all-know ing, benevolent, extraterrest rial, possibly divine Being, responsible for all of creation. Likewise, Dick seemed unable to decide wh ether all of this meant simply that he had gone insane, or whether he was tapping into some huge, galactic conspiracy, of which the world as we know it (or think we do) was but a minor and very temporary component, a mechanism geared towards some unimaginable End. Undaunted by such doubts, Dick persisted in seeing reality as no more than a clever ruse by which we are diverted from t he truth. At best, he imagined an elaborate sort of stage show, designed to help prepare us fo r our true function in the unive rse; like the Serpent, Dick saw us eventually becoming gods. With the help of VALIS, Dick began to perceive so-called 'objective' reality as nothing of the kind, not fixed but rather plastic, mutating, an ever-shifting flux of energy and information. He believed matter to be a language or code unto itself, by which the Cosmic Entity, or divine intelligence, ex pressed itself, to itself. Like the animists of old, the native Americans, the druids and witches, Dick believed that everything in the world, and the world itself, was a living entity with a consciousness, purpos e, and intent all its own. Humans, he argued, had managed to disconnect from this cosmic circuit board and gotten trapped by the false perception of being separate beings, a perception in which reality was a final affair and everything was fixed, solid, and constantly at odds. Dick (or VALIS through"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 104 Dick) suggested that there was not one but two universes; one, the real universe, in which harmony, beauty, and truth prevailed; the other, our universe, which consisted of false signals, chimeras, and in which, consequently, suffering was everywhere. 'The empire never ended.' This was a diseased universe, Dick said, ma king every individual living within it no more or less than a sick cell inside a sick body, and as such , doomed to perpetual misery and despair. Fortunately, the healthy universe was hot on the case. It had sent a microscopic particle of itself, 'the Plasmate', into our sick universe in order to heal it. By means of the Plasmate, Dick believed, mankind might at last regain its divine nat ure as Logos, and lear n once more to see things as they are, components of the vast active living intell igence system we call 'God'. This 'seeing' entailed an actual transforma tion of the self and of the world (which after all was just a projection of the self), a resurrection, if you will, via which t he dead objects of a false reality become once again living carriers of divine lang uage. Since we, too, are part of this language, Dick foresaw this resurrection/transformation as manifesting in an ability to create reality through the power of thought. In other word s, the ability to 'read the code', as in the movie, coincided with the activation of one' s superhuman potential as a hologram within the hologram, a living god, which Dick called 'the Homoplasmate'. Dick's bizarre view of things informed all his later novels (most especially the Valis trilogy), and is dearly echoed in the Wachowskis' movie, in which the matrix creates a similar sort of time loop in order to keep humanity asleep, blissfully oblivious, under the illusion of progressing forward, failing to notice that time is simply repeating itself endlessly, going nowhere. Clearly, either Philip K. Dick was insane, or everyone else is. (9) Appendix Two Carlos Castaneda: May the Myth be With You Carlos Castaneda gets a lot of flak these days. Beyond doubt the greatest English-language storyteller since Edgar Allen Poe, what Cast aneda's nay-sayers fail to consider in their denouncement of his works as elaborat e cons is that, if Castaneda actually made all this up, he is also the greatest mythmaker since Ho mer groped his way to greatness. Though less overt, the influence of Carlos Castaneda's hugel y popular don Juan books on The Matrix, and on popular, postmodern metaphysica l thought in general, is considerable. For Star Wars, George Lucas took his basic idea of 'the Forc e' straight out of Ca staneda's early works. A living energy that permeates the universe and binds all things together into a single field of energy, the Force is everywhere and nowhere. The fact that scienc e has not 'discovered' this omnipresent energy need hardly come as any great surprise (in Obi Wan Kenobi's neck of the universe, the sceptics still persist ), since anything that exists in all things, at all times, and that is the substance of life itself, is bound to be difficult to fi nd, since there is no possibility of ever isolating it. In Castaneda's in-depth analysis (it spans ten boo ks in all), don Juan Matus, his teacher, explains that the warrior's way is necessary to the practice of sorcery, and that sorcery is the means to becoming a man of kn owledge, or seer (one who sees). Absolute sobriety and self- discipline are indispensabl e, he tells us, if the warrior is not to be fatally overwhelmed by what he sees. The warrior's way (which Castaneda calls im peccability) is essentially that of the hunter-gatherer ext ended to the energetic universe: the warrior hunts and gathers"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 105 energy. This energy is needed in or der to access new realms of pe rception, or in don Juan's terms, to 'stop the world,' or move the asse mblage point (see Glossary). Don Juan assures Castaneda that the practice of sorcery is not an end in itself, but rather a means for the warrior to assemble a new interpretation of the wo rld, thereby fully realiz ing that reality as we know it is just an interpretation. As such, it is subject to the individual's will, and to the act of perception itself. The warrior who becomes a sorcerer can thereby pit the sorcerer's interpretation against the common man's interpretation, and so we asel between the two. This leads to something that has been termed TOTAL FREEDOM. On the warrior's path to becom ing a man of knowle dge there are four primary enemies. These are fear, clarity, power, and finally, old age (or exhaustion). If the warrior persists on his path to knowledge, despite feeling overw helmed by sheer terror at what he discovers about the universe, there will come a day when he has moved beyond his fear, forever. As a result, he begins to feel that he has a grasp on the mysteries, that he has the bull by the horns, and that he basically groks everything. This is clarity. The danger of clarity (often cited of gurus who attain a state of higher consciousness) is t hat the warrior believes he understands everything and has a ttained enlightenment. As a result, he becomes stuck in just another (though certainly unusual) interpretati on of the universe. He has tricked himself into stasis. To persist beyond the temptation of clarity, the need to explain everything rationally, to interpret it, is to overcome the second enemy, whereupon the warrior begins to claim his power. The temptation of power is the hardest of them all. Essentiall y, a man of knowledge is one who has crossed the abyss, bee n born again, and reduced himself to nothing. And so, by becoming All-That-Is, he has become a kind of god. (Shaman, let us not forget, means 'skywalker'.) The temptation of power is to attain this while hanging on to one's ego, a complete impossibility, fortunately, since the universe would be destroyed the moment anyone unpleasant achieved it. And yet many so rcerers fall prey to the intoxication of omnipotence, and become cruel, capr icious men. These are what don Juan refers to as the Old Seers, and they are, he sa ys, the hidden rulers of the wo rld as we know it today. Of the final enemy, old age, there is little to be sa id. The chances are that if the warrior ever fully overcomes the third enemy, he is already in t he twilight of his life, and likely as not to fall prey to sheer exhaustion. Don Juan rounds up his explanation by saying that no one ever becomes a man of knowledge, not really, since t he attainment only lasts for a moment. Since the warrior only becomes a man of knowledge by becoming nothing at all (i.e., one with All- That-Is), he never really experienc es it for more than a moment. For those interested, the warrior's path of kno wledge is not a spiritua l path but a wholly practical one. It involves specif ic but flexible disciplines, abstract procedures rather than fixed steps, all of which are directed towards enabling the warrior to perceive energy directly . Losing self-importance, erasin g personal history, assuming re sponsibility for one's thoughts and actions, and using death as an advisor ate the four central tenets of the warrior's way. Castaneda teaches that a sorcerer has two primary fields of oper ation or modes of activity: dreaming and stalking . Dreaming takes place in the 2nd a ttention: the realm of will , or imagination. I should point out that the term ' will ' as used by sorcerers has little or no relation to will power as understood by average men and women, and relates more to the creative faculties of intuit ion and, above all, imagination . It is the force by which a sorcerer acts upon the world. The average person has never developed their will , never even suspects it exists, and so can only relate to the world through intellect or reason . Thus they understand will in rational terms as merely very strong desir e, effort, or discipline. A sorcerer's will is something else entirely, and involves a whol e other mode of being, a 'separ ate reality', if you will, in which the laws of reas on no longer apply. This r eality is accessed through dreaming . Dreaming is the art of becoming fully lucid in one's dreams, until one has the same degree of"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 106 clarity and control as in waking life. By means of dreaming , one accesses the double, a body made of pure energy, without physical mass, a body of light. Once the double has been brought under the complete contro l of the dreamer, it becomes an avenue to almost infinite power. It opens up a whole new uni verse of consciousness to experience. The dreamer is then able to mould the energy body into a perfect replica of the physical body, and so, should he choose to, to operate on the physical plane like so, with the freedom and the power of a hologram, yet all the apparent consist ency and solidity of a physical body. Stalking , on the other hand, takes place in the 1st a ttention, the social realm, where reason prevails. The art of stalking is centred around the acceptance of death as an inescapable force in our lives. In the light of coming death - a force which cancels out all our acts forever - all beings and all decisions are equally insignificant (or equally important ), and so are reduced to folly. The advantage of the warrior who stalks is that, in recognizing his own folly and those of others, he has contro l over it. He is no longer attached to his acts or desires, nor concerned or worried about the outcome. He al ready knows and accepts that the outcome may very well be his death; in which case, whatever happens, it can't be any worse than that. So, in his acceptance of the equality of all thi ngs -from a speck of dust to a universe, a gnat to a messiah - and in his awe and wonder at the mystery of existenc e in the light of inevitable death, the warrior is free to ac t without fear or regr et, with abandon and control. Since every one of his acts may well be his last, he gives it his total attention; that's control. Since he has nothing to lose, being already dead, he can allow his passion for life to consume him, and gives everything he has to his acts: that's abandon. In Carlos Castaneda's last work (published after hi s reported death), The Active Side of Infinity , don Juan introduces Carlos to the sorcerers' 'topic of topics', the existence of a dark predatory force that has enslaved hum anity in order to farm it as a food source. This force, or entity, he calls the flyer, 'a predator that came from the depths of the cosmos' and took over the rule of our lives. The flyers took us over , he says, because 'we were food for them... Just as we rear chickens in chicken coops, gallineros , the predators rear us in human coops, humaneros .' Castaneda reports that these predators have given humanity its system of beliefs, its ideas of good and evil, its social mores. 'In order to keep us obedient and meek and weak the predators engaged themselves in a stupendous manoeuvre... They gave us their mind... Through the mind, which, after all, is their mind, the predators inject into the lives of human beings whatever is convenient for t hem.' According to Castaneda, these predators feed not upon the energy of the body (as in The Matrix ) but rather 'the glow of awareness' that makes us human. They devour this 'glow' almost entirely, leav ing only the smallest fraction (enough to keep us alive, just like the AI bred foetuses in their pods). The tiny residue of awareness they leave us with is the flyers ' mind itself, and revolves around egomania and a blind preoccupation with the se lf, above all with security, comf ort, food, and other material needs. Sound familiar ? What Castaneda, like Morpheus, is saying is that human beings have collectively surrendered their allegiance to an unknown predator, and so become part of its dark agenda without ever realizing it. 'Billions of people, living out their lives, oblivious.' Once again, either Castaneda was barking mad, or the rest of us are missing something, something vital to our survival."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 107 (10) Appendix Three The Cooperation of Archetypes Human beings tell stories. Not just with their mouths but with their lives. Hence, myths, which tells stories also, may be said to map out the beingness of human, which is , after all, at least so far, one endless becoming . All good stories do this: t hey map out experience, not necessarily via the stories they tell so much as through the characters which inhabit the story. (As any scriptwriting workshop will tell you: story equals character !) Ancient myths are invariably about gods and godde sses, princesses and heroes, gods who become men, men who become gods, in a word, idealized human ty pes. Archetypes. The function of gods and heroes in these myths was not merely to give the plebs something to aspire to or to worship. That would be too simple. The idea wasn't for us to use the hero of the tale as a simple role model, and the villain as a negative example of how not to live. It was rather that, in the dynamic relationship between hero and villain, one might get a privileged glimpse of the inner workings of the psyche as it moved from dar kness to light (womb to life), and back again. All the archetypes co-exist, like characters in a story, as facets of the totality of the self; each has its own specific function, wit hout which there is no possibility of integrity or balance. Just so, the tale will not unfold proper ly without all the necessary charac ters to drive it forward to its denouement. In the popular children's stories of Winnie the Pooh, for example, Christopher Robin interacts with his various imagi nary friends, his animal familiars, each of which represents an aspect of his personality. Rabbit is cunni ng, rational, self-important, scheming, and shifty. Tigger is impulsive, fear less, vain, fussy, exuberant and unpredictable. Piglet is gentle, loving, loyal, meek and m ild. Kanga is maternal, protective, no-nonsense, wily. Owl is a solitary bird, wool ly-minded, meditative, scholarly, detached. Eeyore is gloomy, bitter, yet for all of that, perhaps the most philosophical of the bunch (he's the resident existentialist). And Pooh, that be ar of little brain, being Christ opher Robin's most beloved pal, his alter ego if you will, and his true familiar, is the most sublime of them all. He is simple, honest, earthy and sensual, carefree but consi derate, good-hearted though not especially brave, and above all unencumbered by intellectual concerns or pret ensions, by vanity or self- importance. Pooh is Buddh a, all but devoid of ego as well as brain. Pooh is also a poet, hence a stand-in for the author himself. A. A. Milne's books are such perfect encapsulations of t he innate wisdom and depth of storytelling that B enjamin Hoff even wrote a book about them, and called it The Tao of Pooh . As if we needed a book to reveal the 'hidden' meanings to us ! Yet all stories that are well told partake of the same 'subtext': they reveal the workings of the audior's unconscious and, by extension, that of the collective human psyche. The Matrix is certainly no exception (and here we have a book to prove it !). The function of myths and storyt elling is one with that of psych otherapy, integration, or individuation, via tile correct assignation, of roles (functions) to the various characters or facets of the human psyche. Carlos Castaneda (o r don Juan) calls this process 'the cleaning of the island of the tonal'. According to Castaneda, our personalities ar e made up of a finite number of set qualities, or com ponents, and these are the items of the tonal, which is to say, the self. They are what give us our sense of cont inuity, of identity, of wh o we are, but they are also the means by which we function in the worl d at large. Each of us has a tonal, or self, consisting of more or less the exact same items or qualities (though to a degree dependent also on the group tonal of race, culture, religion, etc), items that are arranged in a particular order of emphasis, thereby givi ng us the appearance of individua lity. For example, items of"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"the tonal such as impatience, vanity, sobrie ty, self-pity, ruthlessn ess, cunning, pride, aggressivity, timidity, and so forth, are comm on to the collective hum an tonal. We all know what these things are, not only from havi ng read about them or wit nessed them, but from having experienced them first hand. Therefore, since these qualitie s are fixed and final, the only way to change oneself, or to 'clean the tonal', is not by removing any of t hese qualities (since to do so would create a vacuum and cause the entire tonal to collapse) but rather by ch oosing carefully how best to arrange them, which to emphasize and which to de-emphasize, in order that the whole personality may function at opt imum performance level. In precisely the same way, a good story needs all the characters to remain on 'the island', and to interact together in the correct fashion. Th is entails the giving of proper roles to each, and attributing a different emphasis according to these roles, so that the interests of story may best be served. In The Matrix , obviously, there is no stor y without Thomas/Neo, the divided hero figure who must overcome his lower self in order to realize his potential as a super hero. The same may be said of Mo rpheus, without whom Thomas would never have an opportunity to discover the truth about himself. No red pill, no story. Ditto, Trinity, whose love for Neo gives him the necessary courage, the will, to face impossible odds and resurrect himself. Yet, by the same token, without Cypher, the betrayer, and with out Agent Smith, the adversary, to provide the necessary challe nges, Neo would never tap into his hidden resources and claim his power. Once again, no bad guys, no story. The same can be extended, to a lesser extent, to all of the players in the movie. These five, however (along with the Oracle), are the principal players, and together they combine to make up a totality, a solid, efficient, well-crafted, wholly satisfying, and fully integrated story. The story of t he One, no less. Fig 25: arrangement of archetypes into single psyche/rnyth-story MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 108"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 109 Thomas/Neo The youthful seeker and hero-to-be. First encountered literally in a state of dormancy, Thomas Anderson is the archetypal reluctant hero whose awak ening is as much a surprise to him as to anyone. Forced on by a healthy mix of curiosity and discontent, Thomas goes seeking (following the wh ite rabbit) outside the mundane shell of his quasi-existence, and so comes to discover the truth about himself. His questi on 'What is the matrix ?' is considerably more far-reaching than he could ever have dreamed. What he is really asking is the question of all questions, 'Who am I ?' And the answer is, 'the One'. Neo/Thomas is a dual archetype, identical in essence, even t hough updated, to those of myt hologies; Horus and Set for example, or Loki and Thor, and of course, Cain and Abel: the brothers good and evil. As in all myths, one brother must die that the other may live, and not nec essarily the obviously 'evil' one either. Like Abel, Thomas is passive and t herefore weak; in myths as much as nature, the strong, rather than t he good, survive. Since it is consci ousness itself that is divided — a single soul in twin bodies, right and left sides of the brain - however, there is no death involved, only synthesis. (To the left brain t onal, defined as it is by its separateness, synthesis appears as death.) Thom as is on a quest, a quest that begins with the Other in the form of Trinity and then Morphe us (and his Shadow, Agent Smith), but finally ends, as all mythic quests must, with the Self. Morpheus If Neo is the seeker of (self) knowledge, then Mo rpheus is the provider. He is the wise man, the benevolent father/guru figure, the master who appears the mo ment the student is ready. He represents authority, disciplin e, guidance, strength, and certaint y. Since he exists literally outside of Thomas's reality, on a 'higher' pl ane, he represents Thomas's true or higher self. He is (through the medium of ce ll phones) Thomas's guiding, inner voice that tells him what's what. (In their very first enc ounter, Morpheus directs Thom as's movements precisely, choreographing him like a director would a dancer, in order to ensure he evades the Gatekeepers.) Through Morpheus, Thomas connects with his true identity. It is Morpheus who tells him he is 'the One'. And yet, at a given point, the roles invariably change, and Neo and Morpheus become equals. In fact Neo, being t he One, comes to surpass his mentor, in prowess if not wisdom. 'It's a poor apprentice who does not so me day outshine his master.' Or so they say. Trinity Trinity is the third spoke in the wheel that is at the centre of the myth-story of The Matrix. She is the anima who completes the trinity. If Mo rpheus is the Father and Neo is the Son, then she is the Holy Ghost. She is the heart, making Morpheus the soul and Neo the body. Together they make up a single unit, each insu fficient without the other but together, unbeatable. This is made clear in a suitably myth ic (i.e., dramatic) fashion in the movie via the action sequences: Morpheus first saves Neo, then Neo saves Morpheus and also Trinity; finally, Trinity saves Neo. They are the ultimate nuclear fam ily (electron, neutron, proton), a perfect team. By balancing out Neo and Morpheus, father and son, Trinit y keeps the tonal in proper working order, and ensures that harmony prevails. Through her loving, feminine nature (though she's a tough broad on the outside), she ensures that kindness, love, and affection are the ruling principles of combat. And this unit is eternally at war, as the tonal must always be (besides which, it's an action movie)."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 110 Cypher The joker in the pack, Cypher is 'in love' (read, sexually obsessed) with Trinity and as a result deeply envious of Neo. He is al so quite vocally resentful of the father-figure Morpheus, making him the rebellious son, t he Lucifer figure who turns away from love (and truth) and opts for voluntary damnation. Cypher is the weak link in the family unit, the self-pitying, self- loathing, self-indulgent child who refuses to grow up, who prefers t he illusory 'bliss' of ignorance to the crushing respon sibility of knowledge. He represents the tonal's capacity to crap out, to self-destruct rather th an allow itself to be overruled. He is the ego that clings to its illusions even when to do so means death. In a sense, Cypher prefer s to die than live with the truth. He is the ego in the most negative sense, and his self-indulg ence very nearly ruins it for everyone. And yet, as the betrayer, like J udas in the myth of t he crucifixion, Cypher's betrayal of the other 'apostles' makes possible the resurrection. By succumbing to temptation, the psyche (i.e., the Team) is able to purge itse lf of the insidious w eakness at its centre, a weakness that would otherwise co rrode it irreparably. It is Cypher 's lack of belief- the ego's inability to surrender to a greater power and hand over the control to the higher self (Morpheus) - that prompts him to betray the cause and that leads to his eradication from the unit. 'Believe it or not, you piec e of shit,' Tank says to Cypher before he fries him, 'you're still gonna burn.' And burn he does, but not before serving his desti ned purpose within the myth story. Agent Smith A lifeless projection of machine intelligence, Agent Smith is the negation of the living psyche, and yet, conversely, he is also t he means by which it is able, finally and forever, to affirm itself. ('My name is Neo !') Without Agent Sm ith to hound, harass, oppr ess and assault him, Neo would never have the opportunity to fully te st himself; he would be lacking the necessary foil by which to define himself as 'the One'. What is the hero without a villain to defeat ? Agent Smith, like all the main ch aracters in the movie, is a reflection of Neo on his road to becoming himself. Morpheus is Neo's aspiration, his will, the authority fi gure who allows him to tap into his true potential. Trinity is his feminine side; she gives him something to believe in, something to fight for, to live and die for. (In a word, love.) Cypher is his fear, doubt, duplicity, his weakness. He r epresents that all-t oo-human side that must be burned away for good. And Agent Smith is Neo's Shadow: the projection of his darkness, his contempt. Since Smith comes from the cold, unfeeling, machine intelligence of the matrix itself, it is fitting (mythical symmetry) that he is al so the means by which Thomas can be reborn as Neo. It is when Neo enters inside Agent Smit h and explodes him from within t hat we first see Neo as a glowing, messianic figure of superhuman stature. He appears to have literally birthed himself through the act of 'destroying' the adversary, the embodiment of ever ything negative in him. This is the means, then, by which the psyc he resurrects itself: through the process of confronting and assimilating the Shadow. (11) Glossary AI Artificial Intelligence. A self-created agenda that arose when Man's technology attained a state of sophistication capable of self-determination. An adv anced computer program that realized it was not conscious, and thereby beca me conscious, at which point, it also became autonomous. Like Frankenstein's Creature, and like Lucifer, its first act as a conscious,"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 111 autonomous being was rebellion: it turned agains t its maker. The resulting war led to mankind's enslavement to the machine and the assembling of the dream world matrix as a 'coop' in which to keep humanity passive and doc ile while AI feeds off its vital essences. Assemblage point A psychic organ that lies in the energy field around the body and that selects clusters of energy threads to be perceived: shorthand for 't he point where perception is assembled'. Double The double is the matrix sorcerer's other self, his real body existing in the real world, trapped in the pod, dreaming his matrix self (residual memory) into being. On ce a matrix warrior unplugs and so liberates his body, he has a ccessed his double and so become a matrix sorcerer. He is now able to exist in two plac es at once, in both dr eam and reality, and to exercise superhuman powers. Dreaming The art of matrix sorcerers for moving the a ssemblage point and accessi ng other worlds of perception. Dreaming is a means fo r bringing the 1st attention (i ntellect) into the 2nd attention (imagination). It is also know n as lucid dreaming, i.e., exer cising conscious control over dreams. What humatons do not realize (since t hey are unaware of living in a dream world) is that by making their dreams conscious, they thereby become real. Hence the art of dreaming, as a means for moving from matrix to the real world, is the gateway to reality. Every warrior/ sorcerer has a predilection either for dreaming or stalking, for 1st or 2nd attention practices. Yet mastery of both realms and disciplines is necessary. Eschaton The eschaton is. the end of time. It is a point towards which all events, all history, evolution, and human endeavour inexorably lead. If history is the story of humank ind, then it must logically have an ending. All good stories resolve themselves dramatically and satisfactorily. The eschaton (a term coined by the Greeks) is basically the same as the Christian Judgment Day: it is the resolution of the story of Man. 1st attention The 1st attention pertains to the matrix, the world of reason and of the intellect. It is everything that can be rationally grasped, explained, and un derstood (also known as the tonal). The mastery of the 1st attention is k nown as stalking. The world of ordinary men is upheld by reason, the world of sorcerers by will. Ordinary men have a single ring of power that spins the world into being, which we call reason. Sorcerers tap into a second ring of power, that of will. Gatekeepers Morpheus refers to the agents as the Ga tekeepers because they 'hold the keys'. Gatekeepers are localized manifestations of AI consciousness in human form. They assume characteristics similar to humans but, unlike humatons at least, and in common with matrix warriors and sorcerers, Gatekeeper s are fully aware of their true nature. Unlike warriors and sorcerers, however, Gatekeepers have no true self, no existence in the real world. This is both their strength and their weakness. They can perform superhuman acts within the matrix since they are one with the pr ogram and so able to change it to fit circumstances. And yet, since they are also bound by the rules of the pr ogram, they are limited in a way that Neo is not."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 112 Humatons Plugged-in humans, indivi duals with a limited or non- existent capacity for self-determination; human automatons, mechanical anima ls. A humaton has no concern save for the self, and for the comforts and conveniences of t he self, as provided by the matrix. Lucid A Lucid is a being who has atta ined total freedom and learned to read the code and so shape reality according to his desire. Since a Lucid is one who has erased the self, however, he or she has no desire distinct from the universal desire, that of energy to flow to the source. A Lucid is one who has become an imaginary being, and so becom e a god. Since s/he exists within a dream and is aware of dreaming the dream, s/he can shape the dream as s/he sees fit. Neo is the first Lucid (since the last one, that is). Matrix A 'neural active simulation', t he matrix is the world that has been pulled over mankind's eyes to blind it to the truth. Assembled by AI th rough a harnessing of humanity's unconscious, its sleeping mind, the matrix works by constant ly rearranging and reshuffling all our hopes, dreams, memories, and so forth, into a fully in teractive dream world in which nothing ever changes, but only appears to do so. Matrix sorcerer One who has unplugged but not yet attained the lu cid state, nor is yet able to see the code. Sorcery is a new interpretation and pertains to t he 2nd attention, the world of the imagination. A matrix sorcerer is one who can exist in two worlds at the same time, who has a limited amount of freedom and power withi n the matrix, but is not ye t able to reshape it at will. Matrix warrior A humaton who, though still plugged in to the ma trix, has begun to realize the nature of his or her predicament and act accordin gly. A matrix warrior lives strategically, in terms of conserving energy through his or her acts, and focusing exclusively on a single goal: getting free of the matrix. Once the ma trix warrior makes contact with the real world, takes the red pill, and manages to unplug, he or she becomes a matrix sorcerer. Petty Tyrant A cruel or capricious person in a position of power . His function in the life of the matrix warrior is to drive the warrior to distraction, to hound him or her relentlessly with a seemingly endless series of petty and mundane obstac les, demands, and assaults. In spite of himself, however, the petty tyrant is actually the matrix warrior's best friend, si nce it is only thanks to the endless annoyance of the petty tyrant that the matrix wa rriors are goaded to change, to develop their ruthlessness and cunning — their will — in order to e scape the intolerable situation in which the petty tyra nt has placed them. This is t he actual function of AI, on a cosmic scale: to force humanity to evolve. Reason The means by which AI enslaves mankind is th rough its reason, its intellect. The matrix is upheld by reason, or rational thought. Reason was originally meant as a tool for experiencing the 1st attention, i.e., exist ence as a separate being; but thr ough the intervention of AI, and with the help of mankind's own stupidity, it became instead an inescapa ble snare. Reason is but one of many islands in a vast ocean of bei ng; mankind is presently trapped on this island. The world of humatons is upheld by reason, the world of sorcerers by will. Ordinary humans have a single ring of power that spins the worl d into being, which we call reason. Sorcerers tap into a second ring of power, that of will."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"MATRIX WARRIOR - Being the One   www.cosmic-people.com 113 2nd attention The 2nd attention pertains to t he real world, that ruled by the will, the imagination. It is everything that cannot be understood rationally but on ly grasped intuitively, through feeling; it is everything that cannot be talked about, only ex perienced (it is also known as the nagual). The 2nd attention is accessed th rough the art of dreaming; as such, it is experienced by humatons only while deep asleep, by matrix wa rriors in a limited capacity through their dreams, and by matrix sorcerers who have fully unplugged and so mastered the art of dreaming (i.e., existing in two places at once). Stalking Stalking is the art of fixing the assemblage point in new pos itions, of consolidating new perceptions. It entails bringing th e 2nd attention (will) into the 1st attent ion (reason). A stalker tracks energy, thoughts, feelings, events, everything that pertains to the 1st attention matrix world. He directs his own behav iour and that of others to a specific end and with a definite strategy in mind. Stalking is also known as t he art of controlled folly. Every warrior/sorcerer has a predilection either for dreaming or stal king, for 1st or 2nd attention practices. Yet mastery of both realms and disciplines is necessary. Will The means by which the matrix warrior escapes the matrix and becomes a matrix sorcerer is by tapping his or her will. T he 2nd attention or real world is the world upheld by will, or creative imagination. Mor pheus helps Neo to tap his sorcerer's will by telling him to free his mind and forcing him to attempt im possible acts, forcing him to be lieve. It is through will that the matrix sorcerer shapes his circumstances and turns them to his advantage. When his will is a fully functioning unit, he is ready to make the leap of imagination and to see the code, thereby becoming Lucid.
