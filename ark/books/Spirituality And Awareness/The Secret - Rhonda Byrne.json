I'd worked myself into exhaustion, my father died suddenly, and my relationships with my work colleagues and loved ones were in turmoil. Little did I know at the time, out of my greatest despair was to come the greatest gift. I'd been given a glimpse of a Great Secret—The Secret to life. The glimpse came in a hundred-year-old book, given to me by my daughter Hayley. I began tracing The Secret back through history. I couldn't believe all the people who knew this. They were the greatest people in history: Plato, Shakespeare, Newton, Hugo, Beethoven, Lincoln, Emerson, Edison, Einstein. Incredulous, I asked, \"Why doesn't everyone know this?\" A burn- ing desire to share The Secret with the world consumed me, and I began searching for people alive today who knew The Secret. One by one they began to emerge. I became a magnet: as I began to search, one great living master after another was drawn to me. ix"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"x Foreword When I discovered one teacher, that one would link to the next, in a perfect chain. If I was on the wrong track, something else would catch my attention, and through the diversion the next great teacher would appear. If I \"accidentally\" pressed the wrong link on an internet search, I would be led to a vital piece of informa- tion. In a few short weeks I had traced The Secret back through the centuries, and I had discovered the modern-day practitioners of the Secret. The vision of taking The Secret to the world in a film had become fixed in my mind, and over the following two months my film and television production team learned The Secret. It was imperative that every team member knew it, because without its knowledge, what we were about to attempt would be impossible. We did not have a single teacher secured to film, but we knew The Secret, and so with utter faith I flew from Australia to the United States where the majority of the teachers were based. Seven weeks later The Secret team had filmed fifty-five of the greatest teachers across the United States, with over 120 hours of film. With every step, with every breath, we used The Secret to create the The Se- cret. We literally magnetized everything and everyone to us. Eight months later The Secret was released. As the film swept the world, stories of miracles began to flood in: people wrote about healing from chronic pain, depression, and disease; walking for the first time after an accident; even recovering from a deathbed. We have received thousands of accounts of The Se- cret being used to bring about large sums of money and unexpected"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Foreword xi checks in the mail. People have used The Secret to manifest their perfect homes, life partners, cars, jobs, and promotions, with many accounts of businesses being transformed within days of applying The Secret. There have been heart-warming stories of stressed re- lationships involving children being restored to harmony. Some of the most magnificent stories we have received have come from children using The Secret to attract what they want, including high grades and friends. The Secret has inspired doctors to share the knowledge with their patients; universities and schools with their students; health clubs with their clients; churches of all de- nominations and spiritual centers with their congregations. There are Secret parties being held in homes around the world, as people share the knowledge with loved ones and families. The Secret has been used to attract all manner of things—from a specific feather to ten million dollars. All of this has taken place in the few months since the release of the film. My intention in creating The Secret was—and still is—that it will bring joy to billions around the world. The Secret team is experi- encing the realization of that intention every day, as we receive thousands upon thousands of letters from people across the world, of all ages, all races / and all nationalities, expressing gratitude for the joy of The Secret. There isn't a single thing that you cannot do with this knowledge. It doesn't matter who you are or where you are, The Secret can give you whatever you want.

BOB PROCTOR You've probably been sitting there wondering, \"What is The Secret?\" ill tell you how I've come to understand it. We all work with one infinite power. We all guide ourselves by exactly the same laws. The natural laws of the universe are so precise that we don't even have any difficulty building spaceships, we can send people to the moon, and we can time the landing with the precision of a fraction of a second. Wherever you are—India, Australia, New Zealand, Stockholm, London, Toronto, Montreal, or New York—we're all working with one power. One Law. It's attraction! The Secret Revealed 3"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"4 The Secret The greatest teachers who have ever lived have told us that the law of attraction is the most powerful law in the Universe. Poets such as William Shakespeare, Robert Browning, and William Blake delivered it in their poetry. Musicians such as Ludwig van Beethoven expressed it through their music. Artists such as Leo- nardo da Vinci depicted it in their paintings. Great thinkers includ- ing Socrates, Plato, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Pythagoras, Sir Francis Bacon, Sir Isaac Newton, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and Victor Hugo shared it in their writings and teachings. Their names have been immortalized, and their legendary existence has survived centuries. Religions, such as Hinduism, Hermetic traditions, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and civilizations, such as the ancient Babylonians and Egyptians, delivered it through their writ- ings and stories. Recorded throughout the ages in all its forms, the The Secret is the law of attraction! Everything that's coming into your life you are attracting into your life. And it's attracted to you by virtue of the images you're holding in your mind. It's what you're thinking. Whatever is going on in your mind you are attracting to you. \"Every thought of yours is a real thing—a force.\""},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Secret Revealed 5 law can be found in ancient writings through all the centuries. It was recorded in stone in 3000 BC. Even though some coveted this knowledge, and indeed they did, it has always been there for any- one to discover. The law began at the beginning of time. It has always been and will always be. It is the law that determines the complete order in the Universe, every moment of your life, and every single thing you experience in your life. It doesn't matter who you are or where you are, the law of attraction is forming your entire life experience, and this all- powerful law is doing that through your thoughts. You are the one who calls the law of attraction into action, and you do it through your thoughts. In 1912 Charles Haanel described the law of attraction as \"the greatest and the most infallible law upon which the entire system of creation depends.\" BOB PROCTOR Wise people have always known this. You can go right back to the ancient Babylonians. They've always known this. It's a small select group of people. The ancient Babylonians and their great prosperity have been well documented by scholars. They are also known for creating one of the Seven Wonders of the World, the Hanging Gardens"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"6 The Secret of Babylon. Through their understanding and application of the laws of the Universe, they became one of the wealthiest races in history. BOB PROCTOR Why do you think that 1 percent of the population earns around 96 percent of all the money that's being earned? Do you think that's an accident? It's designed that way. They understand something. They understand The Secret, and now you are being introduced to The Secret. People who have drawn wealth into their lives used The Secret, whether consciously or unconsciously. They think thoughts of abundance and wealth, and they do not allow any contradictory thoughts to take root in their minds. Their predominant thoughts are of wealth. They only know wealth, and nothing else exists in their minds. Whether they are aware of it or not, their predominant thoughts of wealth are what brought wealth to them. It is the law of attraction in action. A perfect example to demonstrate The Secret and the law of attrac- tion in action is this: You may know of people who acquired mas- sive wealth, lost it all, and within a short time acquired massive wealth again. What happened in these cases, whether they knew it or not is that their dominant thoughts were on wealth; that is how they acquired it in the first instance. Then they allowed fear- ful thoughts of losing the wealth to enter their minds, until those fearful thoughts of loss became their dominant thoughts. They tipped the scales from thinking thoughts of wealth to thinking"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Secret Revealed thoughts of loss, and so they lost it all. Once they had lost it how- ever, the fear of loss disappeared, and they tipped the scales back with dominant thoughts of wealth. And wealth returned. The law responds to your thoughts, no matter what they may be. JOHN ASSARAF The simplest way for me to look at the law of attraction is if I think of myself as a magnet, and I know that a magnet wilt attract to it You are the most powerful magnet in the Universe! You contain a magnetic power within you that is more powerful than anything in this world, and this unfathomable magnetic power is emitted through your thoughts. BOB DOYLE AUTHOR AND LAW OF ATTRACTION SPECIALIST Basically put, the law of attraction says that like attracts like. But we're really talking at a level of thought. The law of attraction says like attracts like, and so as you think a thought, you are also attracting like thoughts to you. Here are more BOB DOYLE"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"8 The Secret examples you may have experienced of the law of attraction in your life: Have you ever started to think about something you were not happy about, and the more you thought about it the worse it seemed? That's because as you think one sustained thought, the law of attraction immediately brings more like thoughts to you. In a matter of minutes, you have gotten so many like unhappy thoughts coming to you that the situation seems to be getting worse. The more you think about it, the more upset you get. You may have experienced attracting like thoughts when you lis- tened to a song, and then found that you couldn't get that song out of your head. The song just kept playing over and over in your mind. When you listened to that song, even though you may not have realized it, you gave your full attention and focus of thought to it. As you did that, you were powerfully attracting more like thoughts of that song, and so the law of attraction moved into action and delivered more thoughts of that song, over and over again. JOHN ASSARAF Our job as humans is to hold on to the thoughts of what we want, make it absolutely clear in our minds what we want, and from that we start to invoke one of the greatest laws in the Universe, and that's the law of attraction. You become what you think about most but you also attract what you think about most."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Secret Revealed 9 Your life right now is a reflection of your past thoughts. That in- cludes all the great things, and all the things you consider not so great. Since you attract to you what you think about most, it is easy to see what your dominant thoughts have been on every subject of your life, because that is what you have experienced. Until now! Now you are learning The Secret, and with this knowledge, you can change everything. BOB PROCTOR If you see it in your mind, you're going to hold it in your hand. If you can think about what you want in your mind, and make that your dominant thought, you will bring it into your life. MIKE DOOLEY AUTHOR AND INTERNATIONAL SPEAKER And that principle can be summed up in three simple words. Thoughts become things! Through this most powerful law, your thoughts become the things in your life. Your thoughts become things! Say this over to yourself and let it seep into your consciousness and your awareness. Your thoughts become things! JOHN ASSARAF What most people don't understand is that a thought has a frequency. We can measure a thought. And so if you're"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"10 The Secret thinking that thought over and over and over again, if you're imagining in your mind having that brand new car, having the money that you need, building that company, finding your soul mate ... if you're imagining what that looks like, you're emitting that frequency on a consistent basis. DR, JOE VITALE Thoughts are sending out that magnetic signal that is drawing the parallel back to you. \"The predominant thought or the mental attitude is the magnet, and the law is that like attracts like, consequently, the mental attitude will invariably attract such conditions as correspond to its nature.\" Thoughts are magnetic, and thoughts have a frequency. As you think, those thoughts are sent out into the Universe, and they magnetically attract all like things that are on the same frequency. Everything sent out returns to the source. And that source is You. Think of it this way: we understand that a television station's trans- mission tower broadcasts via a frequency, which is transformed into pictures on your television. Most of us don't really understand how it works, but we know that each channel has a frequency,"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The Secret Revealed 11 and when we tune into that frequency we see the pictures on our television. We choose the frequency by selecting the channel, and we then receive the pictures broadcast on that channel. If we want to see different pictures on our television, we change the channel and rune into a new frequency. You are a human transmission tower, and you are more powerful than any television tower created on earth. You are the most pow- erful transmission tower in the Universe. Your transmission cre- ates your life and it creates the world. The frequency you transmit reaches beyond cities, beyond countries, beyond the world. It re- verberates throughout the entire Universe. And you are transmit- ting that frequency with your thoughts! The pictures you receive from the transmission of your thoughts are not on a television screen in your living room, they are the pic- tures of your life! Your thoughts create the frequency, they attract like things on that frequency, and then they are broadcast back to you as your life pictures. If you want to change anything in your life, change the channel and change the frequency by changing your thoughts. \"The vibrations of mental forces are the finest and consequently the most powerful in existence.\""},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"12 The Secret BOB PROCTOR See yourself living in abundance and you will attract it. It works every time, with every person. As you think of yourself living in abundance, you are powerfully and consciously determining your life through the law of attrac- tion. It's that easy. But then the most obvious question becomes, \"Why isn't everybody living the life of their dreams?\" The only reason why people do not have what they want is be- cause they are thinking more about what they don't want than what they do want. Listen to your thoughts, and listen to the words you are saying. The law is absolute and there are no mis- takes. An epidemic worse than any plague that humankind has ever seen has been raging for centuries. It is the \"don't want\" epidemic. JOHN ASSARAF Here's the problem. Most people are thinking about what they don't want, and they're wondering why it shows up over and over again."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Secret Revealed 13 People keep this epidemic alive when they predominantly think, speak, act, and focus on what they \"don't want.\" But this is the generation that will change history, because we are receiving the knowledge that can free us of this epidemic! It begins with you,, and you can become a pioneer of this new thought movement by simply thinking and speaking about what you want. BOB DOYLE The law of attraction doesn't care whether you perceive something to be good or bad, or whether you don't want it or whether you do want it. It's res-ponding to your thoughts. So if you're looking at a mountain of debt, feeling terrible about it, that's the signal you're putting out into the Universe. \"I feel really bad because of all this debt I've got.\" You're just affirming it to yourself. You feel it on every level of your being. That's what you're going to get more of. The law of attraction is a law of nature. It is impersonal and it does not see good things or bad things. It is receiving your thoughts and reflecting back to you those thoughts as your life experience. The law of attraction simply gives you whatever it is you are thinking about. LISA NICHOLS AUTHORAND PERSONAL EMPOWERMENT ADVOCATE The law of attraction is really obedient. When you think of the things that you want, and you focus on them with all of your intention, then the law of attraction will give you exactly"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"14 The Secret what you want, every time. When you focus on the things that you don't want — \"I don't want to be late, I don't want to be late\"—the law of attraction doesn't hear that you don't want it. It manifests the things that you're thinking of and so it's going to show up over and over and over again. The law of attraction is not biased to wants or don't wants. When you focus on something, no matter what it happens to be, you really are calling that into existence. When you focus your thoughts on something you want, and you hold that focus, you are in that moment summoning what you want with the mightiest power in the Universe. The law of attrac- tion doesn't compute \"don't\" or \"not\" or \"no,\" or any other words of negation. As you speak words of negation, this is what the law of attraction is receiving: \"I don't want to spill something on this outfit.\" \"I want to spill something on this outfit and I want to spill more things.\" \"I don't want a bad haircut.\" \"I want bad haircuts.\" \"I don't want to be delayed.\" \"I want delays.\" \"I don't want that person to be rude to me.\" \"I want that person and more people to be rude to me.\" \"I don't want the restaurant to give away our table.\" \"I want restaurants to give away our tables.\""},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The Secret Revealed 15 \"I don't want these shoes to hurt.\" \"I want shoes to hurt.\" \"I can't handle all this work.\" \"I want more work than I can handle.\" \"I don't want to catch the flu.\" \"I want the flu and I want to catch more things.\" \"I don't want to argue.\" \"I want more arguing.\" \"Don't speak to me like that.\" \" I want you to speak to me like that and I want other people to speak to me like that.\" The law of attraction is giving you what you are thinking about —period! BOB PROCTOR The law of attraction is always working, whether you believe it or understand it or not. The law of attraction is the law of creation. Quantum physicists tell us that the entire Universe emerged from thought! You create your life through your thoughts and the law of attraction, and every single person does the same. It doesn't just work if you know about it. It has always been working in your life and every other person's life throughout history. When you become aware of this great law, then you become aware of how incredibly powerful you are, to be able to THINK your life into existence."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"16 The Secret LISA NICHOLS It's working as much as you're thinking. Any time your thoughts are flowing, the law of attraction is working. When you're thinking about the past, the law of attraction's working. When you're thinking about the present or the future, the law of attraction is working. It's an ongoing process. You don't press pause, you don't press stop. It is forever in action, as your thoughts are. Whether we realize it or not, we are thinking most of the time. If you are speaking or listening to someone, you are thinking. If you are reading the newspaper or watching television, you are think- ing. When you recall memories from your past, you are think- ing. When you are considering something in your future, you are thinking. When you are driving, you are thinking. When you arc getting ready in the morning, you are thinking. For many of us, the only time we are not thinking is when we are asleep; however, the forces of attraction are still operating on our last thoughts as we fall asleep. Make your last thoughts before going to sleep good thoughts. MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH Creation is always happening. Every time an individual has a thought, or a prolonged chronic way of thinking, they're in the creation process. Something is going to manifest out of those thoughts. What you are thinking now is creating your future life. You create your life with your thoughts. Because you are always thinking, you"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The Secret Revealed 17 are always creating. What you think about the most or focus on the most is what will appear as your life. Like all the laws of nature, there is utter perfection in this law. You cre- ate your life. Whatever you sow, you reap! Your thoughts are seeds, and the harvest you reap will depend on the seeds you plant. If you are complaining, the law of attraction will powerfully bring into your life more situations for you to complain about. If you are listening to someone else complain and focusing on that sympa- thizing with them, agreeing with them, in that moment, you are attracting more situations to yourself to complain about. The law is simply reflecting and giving back to you exactly what you are focusing on with your thoughts. With this powerful knowl- edge, you can completely change every circumstance and event in your entire life, by changing the way you think. I had a student named Robert, who was taking an online course I have, part of which entails email access to me. Robert was gay. He outlined all of the grim realities of his life in his emails to me. In his job, his coworkers ganged up on him. It was constantly stressful because of how nasty BILL HARRIS TEACHER AND FOUNDER OF CENTERPOINTE RESEARCH INSTITUTE"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"18 The Secret they were with him. When he walked down the street, he was accosted by homophobic people who wanted to abuse him in some way. He wanted to become a stand-up comedian, and when he did a stand-up comedy job, everybody heckled him about being gay. His whole life was one of unhappiness and misery, and it all focused around being attacked because he was gay. I began to teach him that he was focusing on what he did not want. I directed him back to his email that he sent me and said, \"Read it again. Look at all the things you do not want that you're telling me about. I can tell you're very passionate about this and when you focus on something with a lot of passion, it makes it happen even faster!\" Then he started taking this thing about focusing on what you want to heart, and he began really trying it. What happened within the next six to eight weeks was an absolute miracle. All the people in his office who had been harassing him either transferred to another department, quit working at the company, or started completely leaving him alone. He began to love his job. When he walked down the street, nobody harassed him anymore. They just weren't there. When he did his stand-up comedy routines he started getting standing ovations, and nobody was heckling him! His whole life changed because he changed from focusing on what he did not want, what he was afraid of, what he wanted to avoid, to focusing on what he did want."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The Secret Revealed 19 Robert's life changed because he changed his thoughts. He emitted a different frequency out into the Universe. The Universe must de- liver the pictures of the new frequency no matter how impossible the situation might seem.

No matter where you are now, no mat- ter what has happened in your life, you can begin to consciously choose your thoughts, and you can change your life. There is no such thing as a hopeless situation. Every single circumstance of your life can change!

You have to feel it. Ask once, believe you have received, and all you have to do to receive is feel good. When you are feeling good, you are on the frequency of receiving. You are on the frequency of all good things coming to you, and you will receive what you have asked for. You wouldn't ask for anything unless it was going to make you feel good in the receiving of it, would you? So get yourself on the feel- good frequency, and you will receive. A fast way to get yourself on that frequency is to say, \"I am receiv- ing now. I am receiving all the good in my life, now, I am receiving [fill in your desire] now.\" And feel it. Feel it as though you have received. A dear friend of mine, Marcy, is one of the greatest manifestors I have seen, and she feels everything. She feels what it would feel like to have what she is asking for. She feels everything into existence. She doesn't get caught up in how, when, or where, she Just feels it and it then manifests.

The difference between inspired action and action is this: Inspired action is when you are acting to receive. If you are in action to try and make it happen, you have slipped backward. Inspired action is effortless, and it feels wonderful because you are on the frequency of receiving. Imagine life as a fast-moving riven When you are acting to make something happen it will feel as if you are going against the current of the river. It will feel hard and like a struggle. When you are act- ing to receive from the Universe, you will feel as if you are flowing with the current of the river. It will feel effortless. That is the feel- ing of inspired action, and of being in the flow of the Universe and life. Sometimes you will not even be aware you used \"action\" until after you've received, because the acting felt so good. You will then look back and see the wonder and matrix of how the Universe car- ried you to what you wanted, and also brought what you wanted to you. DR. JOE VlTALE The Universe likes speed.

The first thing to know is that if you focus on losing weight, you will attract back having to lose more weight so get \"having to lose weight\" out of your mind. It's the very reason why diets don't work. Because you are focused on losing weight, you must attract back continually having to lose weight. The second thing to know is that the condition of being over- weight was created through your thought to it. To put it in the most basic terms, if someone is overweight, it came from thinking \"fat thoughts/' whether that person was aware of it or not. A person can- not think \"thin thoughts\" and be fat. It completely defies the law of attraction. Whether people have been told they have a slow thyroid, a slow metabolism, or their body size is hereditary, these are all disguises for thinking \"fat thoughts.\" If you accept any of those conditions as applicable to you, and you believe it, it must become your experi- ence, and you will continue to attract being overweight. After I had my two daughters I was overweight, and I know it came from listening to and reading the messages that it is hard to lose weight after having a baby, and even harder after the second baby. I summoned exactly that to me with those \"fat thoughts,\" 58 The Secret"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"How to Use the Secret 59 and it became my experience. I really \"beefed up,\" and the more I noticed how I had \"beefed up,\" the more \"beefing up\" I attracted. With a small frame, I became a hefty 143 pounds, all because I was thinking \"fat thoughts.\" The most common thought that people hold, and I held it too, is that food was responsible for my weight gain. That is a belief that does not serve you, and in my mind now it is complete balderdash! Food is not responsible for putting on weight. It is your thought that food is responsible for putting on weight that actually has food put on weight. Remember, thoughts are primary cause of everything, and the rest is effects from those thoughts. Think perfect thoughts and the result must be perfect weight. Let go of all those limiting thoughts. Food cannot cause you to put on weight unless you think it can. The definition of the perfect weight is the weight that feels good for you. No one else's opinion counts. It is the weight that feels good for you. You most likely know of someone who is thin and eats like a horse, and they proudly declare, \"I can eat whatever I want and I am al- ways the perfect weight.\" And so the Genie of the Universe says, \"Your wish is my command!\" To attract your perfect weight and body using the Creative Process, follow these steps:"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"60 The Secret Get clear on the weight you want to be. Have a picture in your mind of what you will look like when you have become that per- fect weight. Get pictures of yourself at your perfect weight, if you have them, and look at them often.

You must imagine, pretend, act as if, make-believe, that the perfect weight is yours. You must see yourself as receiving that perfect weight. Write out your perfect weight and place it over the readout of your scale, or don't weigh yourself at all. Do not contradict what you have asked for with your thoughts, words, and actions. Don't buy clothes at your current weight. Have faith and focus on the clothes you are going to buy. Attracting the perfect weight is the same as placing an order with the catalogue of the Universe.

If you see people who are overweight, do not observe them, but immediately switch your mind to the picture of you in your perfect body and feel it. You must feel good. You must feel good about You. This is impor- tant, because you cannot attract your perfect weight if you feel bad about your body now. If you feel bad about your body, that is a powerful feeling, and you will continue to attract feeling bad about your body. You will never change your body if you are critical of it and find fault with it, and in fact you will attract more weight to you. Praise and bless every square inch of your body. Think about all the perfect things about You. As you think perfect thoughts, as you feel good about You, you are on the frequency of your perfect weight, and you are summoning perfection. Wallace Wattles shares a wonderful tip about eating in one of his books. He recommends that when you eat, make sure you are en- tirely focused on the experience of chewing the food. Keep your mind present and experience the sensation of eating food, and do not allow your mind to drift to other things. Be present in your body and enjoy all the sensations of chewing the food in your mouth and swallowing it. Try it the next time you are eat- ing. When you are completely present as you eat, the flavor of the food is so intense and magnificent; when you let your mind drift."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"62 The Secret the flavor virtually disappears. I am convinced that if we can eat our food in the present, entirely focused on the pleasurable expe- rience of eating, the food is assimilated into our bodies perfectly, and the result in our bodies must be perfection.

JOE VlTALE Another thing people wonder about is, \"How long will it take to manifest the car, the relationship, the money?\" I don't have any rulebook that says it's going to take thirty minutes or three days or thirty days. It's more a matter of you being in alignment with the Universe itself. Time is just an illusion. Einstein told us that. If this is the first time you have heard it, you may find it a hard concept to get your head around, because you see everything happening—one thing after the other. What quantum physicists and Einstein tell us is that ev- erything is happening simultaneously. If you can understand that there is no time, and accept that concept, then you will see that whatever you want in the future already exists. If everything is happening at the one time, then the parallel version of you with what you want already exists!"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"How to Use the Secret 63 It takes no time for the Universe to manifest what you want.

It is no more difficult to attract, on a scientific level, something that we consider huge to something that we consider infinitesimally small. The Universe does everything with zero effort. The grass doesn't strain to grow. It's effortless. It's just this great design. It's all about what's going on in your mind. It's about what we put in place, saying, ''This is big, it's going to take some time.\" And, \"This is small. I'll give it an hour.\" Those are our rules that we define. There are no rules according to the Universe. You provide the feelings of having it now; it will respond—whatever it is. There is no time for the Universe and there is no size for the Uni- verse. It is as easy to manifest one dollar as it is to manifest one million dollars.

As you continue to rush, you will attract one bad thing after another into your path. In addition to that, the law of attraction is \"fixing up\" more future circumstances that will cause you to rush and hurry. You must stop and move yourself off that frequency. Take a few moments and shift yourself, if you don't want to summon bad things to you. Many people, particularly in Western societies, chase \"time\" and complain that they don't have enough time. Well, as someone says that they don't have enough time, so it must be by the law of at- traction. If you have been chasing your tail with thoughts of not having enough time, from now on declare emphatically, \"I have more than enough time,\" and change your life.

He asked, \"What is that?\" I explained it to him, and he started calling it a gratitude rock. Two weeks later I got an email from him, in South Africa. And he said, \"My son is dying from a rare disease. It's a type of hepatitis. Would you send me three gratitude rocks?\" They were just ordinary rocks I found off the street, so I said, \"Sure.\" I had to make sure that the rocks were very special, so I went out to the stream, picked out the right rocks, and sent them off to him. Four or five months later I get an email from him. He said, \"My son's better, he's doing terrific.\" And he said, \"But you need to know something. We've sold over a thousand rocks at ten dollars apiece as gratitude rocks, and we've raised all this money for charity. Thank you very much.\" So it's very important to have an \"attitude of gratitude.\" The great scientist Albert Einstein revolutionized the way we view time, space, and gravity.

As Bob Proc- tor advised in the first step of the Creative Process, Ask, start by writing down what you want. \"Begin each sentence with, I am so happy and grateful now that ...\" (and you fill in the rest). When you give thanks as though you have already received what you want, you are emitting a powerful signal to the Universe. That signal is saying that you have it already because you are feeling gratitude for it now. Each morning before you get out of bed, make it a habit to feel the feelings of gratitude in advance for the great day ahead, as though it is done.

In Charles Haanel's book, The Master Key System, written in 1912, he gives twenty-four weekly exercises to master visualization. (More important, his complete Master Key System will also help you become the master of your thoughts.) The reason visualization is so powerful is because as you create pictures in your mind of seeing yourself with what it is you want, you are generating thoughts and feelings of having it now. Visu- alization is simply powerfully focused thought in pictures, and it causes equally powerful feelings. When you are visualizing, you are emitting that powerful frequency out into the Universe. The law of attraction will take hold of that powerful signal and return those pictures back to you, just as you saw them in your mind. DR. DENIS WAITLEY I took the visualization process from the Apollo program, and instituted it during the 1980s and '90s into the Olympic program. It was called Visual Motor Rehearsal. When you visualize then you materialize.

Incredibly, the same muscles fired in the same sequence when they were running the race in their mind as when they were running it on the track. How could this be? Because the mind can't distinguish whether you're really doing it or whether it's just a practice. If you've been there in the mind you'll go there in the body. Think about the inventors and their inventions: The Wright Brothers and the plane. George Eastman and film. Thomas Edison and the light bulb. Alexander Graham Bell and the tele- phone. The only way anything has ever been invented or cre- ated is because one person saw a picture in his mind. He saw it clearly, and by holding that picture of the end result in his mind, all the forces of the Universe brought his invention into the world, through him. These men knew The Secret. These were men who had utter faith in the invisible, and who knew the power within them to leverage the Universe and bring the invention into the visible. Their faith and their imagination have been the cause of the evolution of hu- mankind, and we reap the benefits of their creative minds every single day. You may be thinking, \"I do not have a mind like these great in- ventors.\" You may be thinking, \"They could imagine those things, but I can't.\" You could not be further from the truth, and as you continue on this great discovery of the knowledge of The Secret,"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Powerful Processes 83 you will learn that you not only have the mind they had, but much more. MIKE DOOLEY When you 're visualizing, token you 've got that picture playing out in your mind, always and only dwell upon the end result. Here's an example. Look at the back of your hands, right now. Really look at the back of your hands: the color of your skin, the freckles, the blood vessels, the rings, the fingernails. Take in all those details. Right before you close your eyes, see those hands, your fingers, wrapping around the steering wheel of your brand new car. DR. JOE VITALE This is such a holographic experience—so real in this moment—that you don't even feel as if you need the car, because it feels like you have it already. Dr. Vitale's words brilliantly sum up the place you want to get yourself to when visualizing. When it feels like a jolt as you open your eyes in the physical world, your visualization became real. But that state, that plane, is the real. It is the field where everything is created, and the physical is just the result of the real held of all creation. That's why you won't feel as if you need it anymore, be- cause you tuned in and felt the real field of creation through your visualization. In that field, you have everything now. When you feel that, you will know it."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"84 The Secret JACK CAN FIELD It's the feeling that really creates the attraction, not just the picture or the thought. A lot of people think, \"If I think positive thoughts, or if I visualize having what I want, that will be enough.\" But if you're doing that and still not feeling abundant, or feeling loving or joyful, then it doesn't create the power of the attraction. . BOB DOYLE You put yourself in the feeling place of really being in that car. Not \"I wish I could get that car,\" or, \"Some day I'll have that car,\" because that's a very definite feeling associated with that. It's not in the now. It's in the future. If you stay in that feeling, it will always be in the future. MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH Now that feeling and that inner seeing will begin to be an open doorway through which the power of the Universe will begin to express. \"What this power is I cannot say.

JOE VITALE If you turn it over to the Universe, you will be surprised and dazzled by what is delivered to you. This is where magic and miracles happen. The teachers of The Secret are all aware of the elements you bring into play when you visualize. As you see the picture in your mind and feel it, you are bringing yourself to a place of believing you have it now. You are also implementing trust and faith in the Uni- verse, because you are focusing on the end result and experiencing the feeling of that, without giving any attention whatsoever to \"how\" it will come about. Your picture in your mind is seeing it as done. Your feelings are seeing it as done. Your mind and your entire state of being are seeing it as already happened. That is the art of visualization. DR. JOE VITALE You want to do this virtually daily, but it should never be a chore. What's really important to the whole Secret is feeling good. You want to feel exhilarated by this whole process. You want to be high, happy, in tune, as much as possible."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"86 The Secret Here's a tip about visualizing, which Dr. John Demartini shares in his Breakthrough Experience seminars. John said that if you create a static picture in your mind it can be difficult to hold that picture, so create lots of movement in your picture. To illustrate this, imagine your kitchen again, and this time imag- ine yourself entering that kitchen, walking to the refrigerator and putting your hand on the door handle, opening the door, looking inside, and finding a cold bottle of water. Reach in and grab it. You can feel the coldness on your hand as you grasp the bottle. You have the bottle of water in one hand, and you use your other hand to close the refrigerator door. Now that you are visualizing your kitchen with detail and movement it's easier to see and hold the picture, isn't it? Everyone has the power to visualize. Let me prove it to you with a picture of a kitchen. For this to work, first of all you have to get all thoughts of your kitchen out of your mind. Do not think of your kitchen. Totally clear your mind of pictures of your kitchen, with its cupboards, refrigerator, oven, tiles, and color scheme ... You saw a picture of your kitchen in your mind, didn't you? Well, then you just visualized! \"Everyone visualizes whether he knows it or not. Visualizing is the great secret of success.\""},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Powerful Processes 87 MARCI SHIMOFF The only difference between people who live in this way, who live in the magic of life, and those who don't is that the people who live in the magic of life have habituated ways of being. They've made a habit of using the law of attraction, and magic happens with them wherever they go. Because they remember to use it. They use it all the time, not just as a one-time event. Here are two true stories that clearly demonstrate the powerful law of attraction and the immaculate matrix of the Universe in action. The first story is about a woman named Jeannie, who bought a DVD of The Secret and was watching it at least once a day so that she would absorb the message right into the cells of her body. She was particularly impressed with Bob Proctor, and she thought it would be wonderful to meet him. One morning Jeannie collected her mail, and to her utter amaze- ment the mailman had accidentally delivered Bob Proctor's mail \"We all possess more power and greater possibilities than we realize, and visualizing is one of the greatest of these powers.\""},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"88 The Secret to her address. What Jeannie didn't know is that Bob Proctor lived just four blocks away from her! Not only that, but Jeannie's house number was the same number as Bob's. She immediately took the mail to deliver it to the correct address. Can you imagine her utter delight when the door opened and Bob Proctor was standing before her? Bob is rarely at home as he travels all over the world teaching, but the matrix of the Universe knows only perfect timing. From Jeannie's thought of how wonderful it would be to meet Bob Proctor, the law of attraction moved people, circumstances, and events throughout the Universe so that it happened. The second story involves a ten-year-old boy named Colin, who had seen and loved The Secret. Colin's family made a weeklong visit to Disney World, and on their first day they experienced long lines at the park. So that night, just before Colin fell asleep, he thought, \"Tomorrow I'd love to go on all the big rides and never have to wait in line.\" The next morning, Colin and his family were at the gates of Epcot Center as the park opened, and a Disney staff member ap- proached and asked them if they would be Epcot's First Family of the Day. As First Family they would be given VIP status, a special escort by a staff member, and walk-on passes for every big ride in Epcot. It was everything and more that Colin had wished for! Hundreds of families were waiting to enter Epcot that morning, but Colin didn't have the slightest doubt as to why his family had been chosen First Family. He knew it was because he had used The Secret."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Powerful Processes 89 Imagine discovering—at the age of ten—that the power to move worlds lies within you! \"Nothing can prevent your picture from coming into concrete form except the same power which gave it birth—yourself.\" JAMES RAY People hold that for a while ; and they're really a champion at it. They say, \"I'm fired up. I saw this program and I'm going to change my life.\" And yet results aren't showing. Beneath the surface it's just about ready to break through, but the person will look just at the surface results and say, \"This stuff doesn 't work.\" And you know what? The Universe says, \"Your wish is my command,\" and it disappears. When you allow a thought of doubt to enter your mind, the law of attraction will soon line up one doubtful thought after another. The moment a thought of doubt comes, release it immediately. Send that thought on its way. Replace it with \"I know I am receiving now.\" And feel it. JOHN ASSARAF Knowing the law of attraction, I wanted to really put it to use and to see what would happen. In 1995 I started to create something called a Vision Board, where I take something that"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"The Secret I want to achieve, or something that I want to attract, like a car or a watch or the soul mate of my dreams, and I put a picture of what I want up on this board. Every day I would sit in my office and I would look up at this board and I would start to visualize. I would really get into the state of having already acquired it. I was getting ready to move. We put all the furniture, all the boxes, into storage, and I made three different moves over a period of five years. And then I ended up in California and bought this house, renovated it for a year, and then had all the stuff brought from my farmer home five years earlier. One morning my son Keenan came into my office, and one of the boxes that was sealed for five years was right at the doorstep. He asked, \"What's in the boxes, Daddy?\" And I said, \"Those are my Vision Boards/' He then asked, \"What's a Vision Board?\" I said, \"Well, it's where I put alt my goals up. I cut them out and I put all my goals up as something that I want to achieve in my life.\" Of course at five and a half years old he didn't understand, and so I said, \"Sweetheart, let me just show you, that'll be the easiest way to do it.\" I cut the box open, and on one Vision Board was a picture of a home that I was visualizing five years earlier. What was shocking was that we were living in that house. Not a house like it—I actually bought my dream home, renovated it, and didn't even know it. I looked at that house and I started to cry, because I was just blown away. Keenan asked, \"Why are you crying?\" \"I finally understand how the law of attraction"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Powerful Processes 91 works. I finally understand the power of visualization.

It is the preview of life's coming attractions.\" You can let your imagination go wild with a Vision Board, and place pictures of all the things you want, and pictures of how you want your life to be. Make sure you put the Vision Board in a place where you see it and look at it every day as John Assaraf did. Feel the feelings of having those things now. As you receive, and feel gratitude for receiving, you can remove pictures and add new ones. This is a wonderful way to introduce children to the law of attraction. I hope the creation of a Vision Board inspires parents and teachers worldwide. One of the people on The Secret website Forum put a picture of The Secret DVD on his Vision Board. He had seen The Secret but didn't own his own copy. Two days after he created his Vision Board, I felt inspired to post a notice on The Secret Forum giving away DVDs to the first ten people who posted. He was one of the ten! He had received a copy of The Secret DVD within two days of putting it on his Vision Board. Whether it is a DVD of The Secret or a house, the joy of creating and receiving is magnificent!"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"92 The Secret Another powerful example of visualizing comes from my moth- er's experience of buying a new house. Several people besides my mother had put in offers for this particular house. My mother decided to use The Secret to make that house hers.

She then imagined placing all of her furniture in that new house. Within hours of doing these things, she received a phone call saying her offer had been accepted. She was so thrilled, but it didn't come as a surprise to her because she knew that house was hers. What a champion! JACK CAN FIELD Decide what you want. Believe you can have it. Believe you deserve it and believe it's possible for you. And then close your eyes every day for several minutes, and visualize having what you already want, feeling the feelings of already having it.

Expect the things you want, and don't expect the things you don't want. Gratitude is a powerful process for shifting your energy and bring- ing more of what you want into your life.

Giving thanks for what you want in advance turbo-charges your desires and sends a more powerful signal out into the Universe. Visualization is the process of creating pictures in your mind of yourself enjoying what you want. When you visualize, you gener- ate powerful thoughts and feelings of having it now. The law of at- traction then returns that reality to you, just as you saw it in your mind. To use the law of attraction to your advantage, make it a habitual way of being, not just a one-time event.

So I grew up with a lot of beliefs about money; that if you had it, it made you bad, only evil people have money, and money doesn't grow on trees. \"Who do you think I am, Rockefeller?' That was one of his favorite phrases. So I grew up truly believing that life was difficult. It was only when I met W. Clement Stone that I began to shift my life. 95"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"96 The Secret When I was working with Stone he said, \"I want you to set a goal that's so big that if you achieved it, it would blow your mind, and you would knew it's only because of what I've taught you that you would have achieved this goal\" At the time I was making about eight thousand dollars a year, so I said, \"I want to make a hundred thousand dollars in a year.\" Now, I had no idea how I could do that. I saw no strategy, no possibility, but I just said, \"I'm going to declare that, I'm going to believe it, I'm going to act as if it's true, and release it\" So I did that. One of the things he taught me was every day to close your eyes and visualize the goals as if it's already achieved. I had actually made a hundred-thousand-dollar bill that I'd put on the ceiling. So first thing in the morning I'd look up and there it was, and it would remind me that this was my intention. Then I would close my eyes and visualize having this hundred- thousand-dollar-a-year lifestyle. Interestingly enough, nothing major happened for about thirty days. I didn't have any great breakthrough ideas, no one was offering me more money. About four weeks into it, I had a hundred-thousand-dollar idea. It just came right into my head. I had a book I had written, and I said, \"If I can sell four hundred thousand copies of my book at a quarter each, that'd be a hundred thousand dollars.\" Now, the book was there, but I never had this thought. (One of The Secrets is that when you have an inspired thought, you have to trust it and act on it.) I didn't know how I was going to sell four hundred thousand copies."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"The Secret to Money Then I saw the National Enquirer at the supermarket. I had seen that millions of times and it was just background. And all of a sudden it jumped out at me as foreground.

I want to interview you. Let me give you my card.\" As it turns out, she was a freelance writer who sold her stories to the National Enquirer. The theme from \"The Twilight Zone\" went off in my head, like, whoah, this stuff's really working. That article came out and our book sales started to take off. The point I want to make is that I was attracting into my life all these different events, including this person. To make a long story short, I did not make a hundred thousand dollars that year. We made ninety-two thousand three hundred and twenty-seven dollars. But do you think we were depressed and saying, \"This doesn't work\"? No, we were saying, \"This is amazing!\" So my wife said to me, \"If it works for a hundred thousand, do you think it'd work for a million ?\" And I said, \"I don't know, I think so.

We put it to the test. It absolutely worked, and now I live my life from that every single day. The knowledge of The Secret and the intentional use of the law of attraction can be applied to every single subject in your life. It is the same process for everything you want to create, and the subject of money is no different. To attract money, you must focus on wealth. It is impossible to bring more money into your life when you are noticing you do not have enough, because that means you are thinking thoughts that you do not have enough. Focus on not enough money, and you will create untold more circumstances of not having enough money. You must focus on the abundance of money to bring that to you. You have to emit a new signal with your thoughts, and those thoughts should be that you currently have more than enough. You really do need to call your imagination into play and make believe you already have the money you want. And it is so much fun to do! You will notice as you pretend and play games of having wealth that you feel instantly better about money, and as you feel better about it, it will begin to flow into your life.

Every negative thought, feeling, or emotion is blocking your good from coming to you, and that includes money. It is not that the money is being kept from you by the Universe, because all the money you require exists right now in the invisible. If you do not have enough, it is because you are stopping the flow of money coming to you, and you are doing that with your thoughts. You must tip the balance of your thoughts from lack-of-money to more- than-enough-money. Think more thoughts of abundance than of lack, and you have tipped the balance. When you need money, it is a powerful feeling within you, and so of course through the law of attraction you will continue to attract needing money. I can speak from experience about money, because just before I discovered The Secret my accountants told me that my company you look at the check, feel the feelings of having that money now. Imagine spending that money, all the things you will buy and the things you will do. Feel how wonderful that is! Know it is yours, because when you ask, it is.

Then I discovered The Secret, and everything in my life—includ- ing the state of my company—was totally transformed, because I changed the way I was thinking.

I put exactly how much I wanted to see in the bank. So I thought, \"What if I just visualized checks coming in the mail?\" So I just visualized a bunch of checks coming in the mail Within just one month, things started to change. It is amazing; today I just get checks in the mail. I get a few bills, but I get more checks than bills.

As you demon- strate faith in giving, the law of attraction must give you more to give. There is a big difference between giving and sacrificing. Giving from a heart that is overflowing feels so good. Sacrificing does not feel good. Don't confuse the two—they are diametrically opposed. One emits a signal of lack and the other emits a signal of more- than-enough. One feels good and one does not feel good. Sacrifice will eventually lead to resentment.

Therefore, our wishes, thoughts, and feelings are very important because they will manifest. One day I went into the home of an art director, a very famous film producer. In every corner he had this beautiful image of a naked woman draped with a fabric, kind of turning away as if she were saying, \"I don't see you.\" I said to him, \"I think you might have trouble in your romance.\" And he said, \"Are you clairvoyant?\" \"No, but look. In seven places, you have exactly that same woman.\" He said, \"But I love that kind of painting.

Paint yourself with three women, and hang it in every corner of your living space.\" Six months later I saw him and asked, \"How is your love life?\" \"Great! Women call me, they want to date me.\" \"Because that's your wish,\" I said. He said, \"I feel great. I mean, for years I did not have a date and now I have three dates a week. They're fighting over me.\" \"Good for you,\" I said. Then he told me, \"I really want to stabilize. I want marriage now, I want romance.\" I said, \"Well, then paint it.\" He painted a beautiful romantic relationship, and a year later he got married, and he's very happy. This is because he put another wish out. He wished it in himself for years without it happening because his wish could not manifest. The outer level of himself—his house—was contradicting his wish all the time. So if you understand this knowledge, you just start playing with it. Marie Diamond's story of her client is a perfect demonstration of how Feng Shui reflects the teachings of The Secret. It illustrates how our thoughts create powerfully when we put them into action. Any action we take must be preceded by a thought. Thoughts create the words we speak, the feelings we feel, and our actions. Actions are particularly powerful because they are thoughts that have caused us to act."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"The Secret to Relationships 115 We may not even realize what our innermost thoughts are, but we can see what we have been thinking by looking at the actions we have taken. In the story of the film producer, his innermost thoughts were reflected in his actions and surroundings. He had painted many women, all turning away from him. Can you see what his innermost thoughts were? Even though his words were saying he wanted to date more women, his innermost thoughts did not reflect that in his paintings. By deliberately choosing to change his actions, it caused him to focus his entire thought on what he wanted. With such a simple shift, he was able to paint his life and call it into exist- ence through the law of attraction. When you want to attract something into your life, make sure your actions don't contradict your desires. One of the most wonderful examples of this is given by Mike Dooley, one of the teachers fea- tured in The Secret, i n his audio course , Leveraging the Universe and Engaging the Magic. It is a story of a woman who wanted to attract her perfect partner into her life. She had done all the right things: She got clear about what she wanted him to be like, made a detailed list of all of his qualities, and visualized him in her life. Despite doing all these things, there was no sign of him. Then one day as she arrived home and was parking her car in the middle of her garage, she gasped as she realized that her actions were contradicting what she wanted. If her car was in the middle of the garage, there was no room for her perfect partner's car! Her actions were powerfully saying to the Universe that she did not believe she was going to receive what she had asked for. So she immediately cleaned up her garage and parked her car to one side,"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"116 The Secret leaving space for her perfect partner's car on the other side. She then went into her bedroom and opened her wardrobe, which was jammed full of clothes. There was no room for her perfect partner's clothes. So she moved some of her clothes to make space. She had also been sleeping in the middle of her bed, and so she began sleep- ing on \"her\" side, leaving space for her partner. This woman related her story to Mike Dooley over a dinner, and sit- ting next to her at the table was her perfect partner. After taking all of these powerful actions and acting as if she had already received her perfect partner, he arrived in her life and they are now happily married. Another simple example of \"acting as if\" is a story of my sister Glenda, who is the production manager of the film The Secret. She was living and working in Australia, and she wanted to move to the United States and work with me in our U.S. office. Glenda knew The Secret very well, and so she was doing all the right things to bring forth what she wanted, but months were passing by and she was still in Australia. Glenda looked at her actions and realized she was not \"acting as if\" she was receiving what she had asked for. So she began to take powerful actions. She organized everything in her life for her de- parture. She canceled memberships, gave away things she would not need, and she got her suitcases out and packed them.

I ended up in the hospital completely paralyzed. My spinal cord was crushed, I broke the first and second cervical vertebrae, my swallowing reflex was destroyed, I couldn't eat or drink, my diaphragm was destroyed, I couldn't breathe. All I could do was blink my eyes. The doctors, of course, said I'd be a vegetable the rest of my life. All I'd be able to do is blink my eyes. That's the picture they saw of me, but it didn't matter what they thought. The main thing was what I thought. I pictured myself being a normal person again, walking out of that hospital. The only thing I had to work with in the hospital was my mind, and once you have your mind, you can put things back together again. I was hooked to a respirator and they said I'd never breathe on my own again because my diaphragm was destroyed. But a little voice kept saying to me, \"Breathe deeply, breathe deeply.\" And finally I was weaned from it. They were at a loss for an explanation.

That's a day I will never forget For people who are sitting out there right now and are hurting, if I wanted to sum up my life and sum up for people what they can do in life, I would sum it up in six words: \"Man becomes what he thinks about.\" Morris Goodman is known as The Miracle Man.

In our society, we've become content with fighting against things. Fighting against cancer, fighting against poverty, fighting against war, fighting against drugs, fighting against terrorisim, fighting against violence. We tend to fight everything we don't want, which actually creates more of a fight. HALE DWOSKIN TEACHER AND AUTHOR O F THE SEDONA METHOD Anything we focus on we do create.

Resistance to anything is like trying to change the outside pictures after they have been transmitted. It's a futile pursuit. You have to go within and emit a new signal with your thoughts and feelings to create the new pictures. As you resist what has appeared, you are adding more energy and more power to those pictures you don't like, and you are bringing more of them at a furious rate. The event or circumstances can only get bigger, because that is the law of the Universe. JACK CANFIELD The anti-war movement creates more war. The anti-drug movement has actually created more drugs. Because we're focusing on what we don't want—drugs! or suffering, we're adding our energy to it. We're pushing ourselves, and that only creates resistance. \"What you resist persists.\""},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"The Secret to the World 143 LISA NICHOLS People believe that if we really want to eliminate something, focus on that. How much sense does it make for us to give the particular problem all of the energy, as opposed to focusing on trust, love, living in abundance, education, or peace? JACK CAN FIELD Mother Teresa was brilliant. She said, \"I will never attend an anti-war rally. If you have a peace rally, invite me.\" She knew. She understood The Secret. Look what she manifested in the world. HALE DWOSKIN So if you're anti-war, be pro-peace instead. If you're anti- hunger, be pro-people having more than enough to eat. If you are anti-a-particular politician, be pro-his opponent. Often elections are tipped in favor of the person that the people are really against, because he's getting all the energy and all the focus. Everything in this world began with one thought. The bigger things get bigger because more people give their thoughts to it after it has appeared. Then those thoughts and emotions keep that very event in our existence, and make it bigger.

As you focus on the negative events of the world, you not only add to them, but you bring more negative things into your own life at the same time.

The news services and the newspapers are not in any way to blame for broadcasting bad news. As a global community, we are responsible for it. We buy more newspapers when a huge drama is the headline. The news channels' ratings skyrocket when there is a national or international disaster. So the newspapers and news services give us more bad news because, as a society, that's what we are saying we want. The media is effect, and we are cause. It is just the law of attraction in action!

Won't everyone just make a run for it and bust the hank? MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH What's beautiful about the teaching of The Secret is that there's more than enough to go around for everyone. There is a lie that acts like a virus within the mind of humanity. And that lie is, \"There's not enough good to go around. There's lack and there's limitation and there's just not enough.\" And that lie has people living in fear, greed, stinginess. And those thoughts of fear, greed, stinginess, and lack become their experience. So the world has taken a nightmare pill. The truth is that there's more than enough good to go around. There's more than enough creative ideas. There's more than enough power. There's more than enough love. There's more than enough joy. All of this begins to come through a mind that is aware of its own infinite nature."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"148 The Secret To think there is not enough is to look at the outside pictures and think that everything comes from the outside. When you do that, you will most surely see lack and limitation. You now know that nothing comes into existence from the outside, and that everything first comes from thinking and feeling it on the inside. Your mind is the creative power of all things. So how can there be any lack? It's impossible. Your ability to think is unlimited, and so the things you can think into existence are unlimited. And so it is with everyone. When you truly know this, you are thinking from a mind that is aware of its own infinite nature. JAMES RAY Every great teacher who has ever walked the planet has told you that life was meant to be abundant. \"The essence of this law is that you must think abundance; see abundance, feel abundance, believe abundance. Let no thought of limitation enter your mind.\" JOHN ASSARAF And so just when we think that resources are dwindling, we find new resources that can achieve the same things.

They took a brave step forward to drill for oil in Spanish Lookout, and in one short year their dream and vision became a reality. Belize Natural Energy Limited discovered oil of the highest quality, in abundant flows where fifty other companies had failed to find any. Belize has be- come an oil-producing country because an extraordinary team of people believed in the unlimited power of their mind. Nothing is limited—not resources or anything else. It is only limited in the human mind. When we open our minds to the un- limited creative power, we will call forth abundance and see and experience a whole new world. DR. JOHN DEMARTINI Even though we say we have lack, it's because we don't open up our vision and see all of what is around us.

Recognize the beautiful and wonderful things around you, and bless and praise them. And on the other side, the things that aren't currently working the way you want them to work, don't spend your energy faulting or complaining. Embrace everything that you want so you can get more of it. Lisa's wise words, to \"praise and bless\" the things around you, are worth their weight in gold. Praise and bless everything in your life! When you are praising or blessing you are on the highest fre- quency of love. In the Bible, the Hebrews used the act of blessing to bring forth health, wealth, and happiness. They knew the power of blessing. For many people the only time they have blessed some- one was when they sneezed, and so they have not used one of the greatest powers to their full advantage. The dictionary defines blessing as \"invoking divine favor and conferring well-being or prosperity,\" so begin right now to invoke the power of blessing in your life, and bless everything and everyone.

As you praise and bless, you will feel yourself shift into a new frequency with the feedback of good feelings. DR. DENIS WAITLEY Most of the leaders in the past missed the great part of The Secret, which is to empower and share with others. This is the best time to have ever been alive in history. It's the first time we've ever had the power to gain knowledge at our fingertips. With this knowledge you are becoming aware—of the truth of the world, and yourself. My greatest insights into The Secret on the subject of the world came from the teachings of Robert Collier, Prentice Mulford, Charles Haanel, and Michael Bernard Beckwith. With that understanding came total freedom. I truly hope that you can come to the place of that same freedom.

And then there is energy. So there are a lot of levels to think about, but everything in the Universe is energy. When I discovered The Secret I wanted to know what science and physics understood in terms of this knowledge. What I found was absolutely amazing. One of the most exciting things about living in this time is that the discoveries of quantum physics and new science are in total harmony with the teachings of The Secret, and with what all the great teachers have known throughout history. I never studied science or physics at school, and yet when I read complex books on quantum physics I understood them perfectly because I wanted to understand them. The study of quantum phys- ics helped me to have a deeper understanding of The Secret, on an energetic level. For many people, their belief is strengthened when they see the perfect correlation between the knowledge of The Se- cret and the theories of new science. Let me explain how you are the most powerful transmission tower in the Universe. In simple terms, ail energy vibrates at a frequency. Being energy, you also vibrate at a frequency, and what determines your frequency at any time is whatever you are thinking and feel- ing. All the things you want are made of energy, and they are vi- brating too. Everything is energy. Here is the \"wow\" factor. When you think about what you want, and you emit that frequency you cause the energy of what you"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"The Secret to You 157 want to vibrate at that frequency and you bring it to You! As you focus on what you want, you are changing the vibration of the atoms of that thing, and you are causing it to vibrate to You. The reason you are the most powerful transmission tower in the Uni- verse is because you have been given the power to focus your energy through your thoughts and alter the vibrations of what you are focused on, which then magnetically draws it to you. When you think about and feel those good things that you want, you have immediately tuned yourself to that frequency, which then causes the energy of all those things to vibrate to you, and they ap- pear in your life. The law of attraction says that like attracts like. You are an energy magnet, so you electrically energize everything to you and electrically energize yourself to everything you want. Human beings manage their own magnetizing energy, because no one outside of them can think or feel for them, and it is thoughts and feelings that create our frequencies. Almost one hundred years ago, without the benefit of all the sci- entific discoveries of the last hundred years, Charles Haanel knew how the Universe operated. \"The Universal Mind is not only intelligence, but it is substance, and this substance is the attractive force which brings electrons together by the law of attraction so they form atoms; the atoms in turn are brought together by the same law and form molecules; molecules take"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"158 The Secret BOB PROCTOR I don't care what city you're living in, you've got enough power in your body, potential power, to illuminate the whole city for nearly a week. \"To become conscious of this power is to become a 'live wire/ The Universe is the live wire.

When the individual mind touches the Universal Mind, it receives all its power.\" JAMES RAY Most people define themselves by this finite body, but you're not a finite body. Even under a microscope you're an energy field. What we know about energy is this: You go to a quantum physicist and you say, \"What creates the world?\" And he or she will say, \"Energy.\" Well, describe energy. objective forms and so we find that the law is the creative force behind every manifestation, not only of atoms, but of worlds, of the Universe, of everything of which the imagination can form any conception.\""},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"The Secret to You 159 \"OK, it can never be created or destroyed, it always was, always has been, everything that ever existed always exists, it's moving into form, through form and out of form.\" You go to a theologian and ask the question, \"What created the Universe?\" And he or she will say, \"God.\" OK, describe God. \"Always was and always has been, never can be created or destroyed, all that ever was, always will be, always moving into form, through form and out of form.\" You see, it's the same description, just different terminology. So if you think you're this \"meat suit\" running around, think again. You're a spiritual being! You're an energy field, operating in a larger energy field. How does all of this make you a spiritual being? For me, the an- swer to that question is one of the most magnificent parts of the teachings of The Secret. You are energy, and energy cannot be cre- ated or destroyed. Energy just changes form. And that means You! The true essence of You, the pure energy of You, has always been and always will be. You can never not be. On a deep level, you know that. Can you imagine not being? De- spite everything you have seen and experienced in your life, can you imagine not being?

Know anything from within the field of our own consciousness, which ultimately is Universal consciousness that runs the Universe.

So we are the creators, not only of our own destiny, but ultimately we are the creators of Universal destiny. We are the creators of the Universe. So there's no limit, really, to human potential. It's the degree to which we recognize those deep dynamics and exercise them, the degree to which we harness our power. And that really has to do again with the level at which we think. Some of the greatest teachers and avatars described the Universe in the same way as Dr. Hagelin, by saying that all that exists is the One Universal Mind, and there is nowhere that the One Mind is not.

It means that every possibility already exists.

Every creation and invention in history has also been drawn from the Universal Mind, whether the person consciously knew that or not. How do you draw from it? You do it through your awareness of it, and by using your wonderful imagination. Look around you for needs waiting to be filled. Imagine if we had a great invention to do this, or imagine if we had a great invention to do that. Look for the needs, and then imagine and think their fulfilment into being. You don't have to work out the discovery or the invention. The Supreme Mind holds that possibility. All you have to do is hold your mind on the end result and imagine filling the need, and you will call it into being. As you ask and feel and believe, you will receive.

You cannot be harmed unless you call harm into existence by emitting those negative thoughts and feelings.

If you hold a grudge or blame someone for something in the past, you are only harming You. You are the only one who can create the life you deserve. As you deliberately focus on what you want, as you begin to radiate good feelings, the law of attraction will respond. All you have to do is make a start, and as you do, you will unleash the magic."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"The Secret to You 167 MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH The beautiful thing about the law of attraction is that you can begin where you are, and you can begin to think \"real thinking,\" and you can begin to generate within yourself a feeling tone of harmony and happiness. The law will begin to respond to that. DR. JOE VITALE So now you start to have different beliefs, like, \"There is more than enough in the Universe.\" Or you have the belief that, \"I'm not getting older, I'm getting younger.\" We can create it the way we want it, by using the law of attraction. MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH And you can break yourself free from your hereditary patterns, cultural codes, social beliefs, and prove once and for all that the power within you is greater than the power within the world. DR FRED ALAN WOLF You may be thinking, \"Well, that's very nice, but I can't do that.\" Or, \"She won't let me do that!\" Or, \"He'll never let me do that.\" Or, \"I haven't got enough money to do that.\" Or, \"I'm not strong enough to do that.\" Or, \"I'm not rich enough to do that.\" Or, \"I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.\" - Every single \"I'm not\" is a creation!"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"168 The Secret It is a good idea to become aware when you say, \"I'm not\" and to think about what you are creating as you say it. A powerful insight shared by Dr. Wolf has been equally documented by all the great teachers with the power of the words I am. When you say \"I am,' the words that follow are summoning creation with a mighty force, because you are declaring it to be fact. You are stating it with certainty. And so immediately after you say, \"I am tired\" or \"I am broke\" or \"I am sick\" or \"I am late\" or \"I am overweight\" or \"I am old,\" the Genie says, \"Your wish is my command.\" Knowing this, wouldn't it be a good idea to begin to use the two most powerful words, I AM, to your advantage? How about, \"I AM receiving every good thing. I AM happy I AM abundant. I AM healthy. I AM love. I AM always on time. I AM eternal youth. I AM filled with energy every single day.\" In his book The Master Key System, Charles Haanel claims that there is an affirmation that incorporates every single thing any human being can want, and that this affirmation will bring about har- monious conditions to all things. He adds, \"The reason for this is because the affirmation is in strict accordance with the Truth, and when Truth appears every form of error or discord must necessar- ily disappear.\" The affirmation is this: \"I am whole, perfect, strong, powerful, lov- ing, harmonious, and happy.\" If it sounds like work to drag what you want out of the invis- ible and into the visible, try this shortcut: see what you want as"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"The Secret to You 169 absolute fact. This will manifest what you want with the speed of light The second you ask, it is fact in the Universal spiritual field, and that field is all that exists. When you conceive something in your mind, know it is a fact, and that there can be no question about its manifestation. When Henry Ford was bringing his vision of the motor vehicle into our world, people around him ridiculed him and thought he had gone mad to pursue such a \"wild\" vision. Henry Ford knew much more than the people who ridiculed him. He knew The Secret and he knew the law of the Universe. \"Whether you think you can or think you can't, either way you are right.\" Do you think you can? You can achieve and do anything you want with this knowledge. In the past you may have underestimated how brilliant you are. Well, now you know you are the Supreme Mind and that you can draw anything you want from that One Supreme Mind. Any invention, any inspiration, any answer, any- \"There is no limit to what this law can do for you; dare to believe in your own ideal; think of the ideal as an already accomplished fact.\""},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"170 The Secret thing. You can do anything you want. You are a genius beyond description, so start telling yourself that and become aware of who you really are. - MICHAEL BERNARD BECKWITH Are there any limits to this? Absolutely not. We are unlimited beings. We have no ceiling. The capabilities and the talents and the gifts and the power that is within every single individual that is on the planet, is unlimited. All your power is in your awareness of that power, and through holding that power in your consciousness. Your mind can be like a runaway steam train if you let it. It can take you off to thoughts of the past, and then take you off to thoughts of the future by taking past bad events and projecting those into your future. Those out-of-control thoughts are creating too. When you are aware, you are in the present and you know what you are thinking. You have gained control of your thoughts, and that is where all your power is. So how do you become more aware? One way is to stop and ask yourself, \"What am I thinking now? What am I feeling now?\" The moment you ask you are aware, because you have brought your mind back to the present moment."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"The Secret to You 171 Whenever you think of it, bring yourself back to the awareness of now. Do it hundreds of times each day, because, remember, all of your power is in your awareness of your power. Michael Bernard Beckwith sums up the awareness of this power when he says, \"Re- member to remember!\" Those words have become the theme song of my life. To help myself become more aware, so I would remember to remem- ber, I asked the Universe to give me a gentle nudge to bring me back to the present whenever my mind has taken over and is \"having a party\" at my expense. That gentle nudge happens by me bumping myself or dropping something, a loud noise, or a siren or an alarm going off. All of these things are signals to me that my mind has taken off, and to come back to the present. When I receive these signals I stop immediately and ask myself, \"What am I thinking? What am I feeling? Am I aware?\" And of course in the moment I do that I am aware. The very moment you ask yourself if you aware, you are there. You are aware. \"The real secret of power is consciousness of power.\" As you become aware of the power of The Secret, and begin to use it, all of your questions will be answered. As you begin to have a deeper understanding of the law of attraction you can start to make asking questions a habit and as you do, you will receive the answer to each one. You can begin by using this book for that very"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"172 The Secret purpose. If you are seeking an answer or guidance on something in your life, ask the question, believe you will receive, and then open this book randomly. At the exact place where the pages fall open will be the guidance and answer you are seeking. The truth is that the Universe has been answering you all of your life, but you cannot receive the answers unless you are aware. Be aware of everything around you, because you are receiving the answers to your questions in every moment of the day. The chan- nels those answers can come through are unlimited. They could be delivered in the form of a newspaper headline that attracts your attention, or overhearing someone speaking, or a song on the radio, or signage on a truck passing by, or receiving a sudden inspiration. Remember to remember, and become aware! I have found in my own life and in others' lives that we do not think well of ourselves or love ourselves completely. To not love ourselves can keep what we want from us. When we don't love ourselves, we are literally pushing things away from us. Everything we want, whatever it may be, is motivated by love. It is to experience the feelings of love in having those things—youth, money, the perfect person, job, body, or health. To attract the things we love we must transmit love, and those things will appear im- mediately. The catch is, to transmit the highest frequency of love, you must love yourself, and that can be difficult for many. If you focus on the outside and what you see now, you may trip yourself up, because"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"The Secret to You 173 what you see and feel about you now is the result of what you used to think. If you don't love you, the person you see now is likely to be full of faults that you have found in yourself. To love yourself fully, you must focus on a new dimension of You. You must focus on the presence inside of You. Take a moment and sit still. Focus on feeling the life presence inside you. As you focus on the presence within, it will begin to reveal itself to You. It is a feeling of pure love and bliss, and it is perfection. That presence is the perfection of You. That presence is the real You. As you focus on that presence, as you feel, love, and praise that presence, you will love yourself fully, quite possibly for the first time in your life. Any time you look at yourself with critical eyes, switch your focus immediately to the presence within, and its perfection will reveal itself to You. As you do this, all imperfections that have manifested in your life will dissolve, because imperfections cannot exist in the light of this presence. Whether you want to regain perfect eyesight, dissolve disease and restore well-being, turn poverty into abun- dance, reverse aging and degeneration, or eradicate any negativ- ity, focus on and love the presence within you and perfection will manifest. \"The absolute truth is that the ' I ' is perfect and complete; the real ' I ' is spiritual and can therefore never be less than perfect; it can never have any lack, limitation, or disease.\""},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"• Everything is energy.
