As each expands within the process of self-identifi- cation so does the ability to allow the flow of “Isness” to move through their experience. Each will attract into their aware- ness knowledge to live into wisdom. The vibratory rate of the planetary environment and of the members of humanity on Earth is low enough that this ability is currently virtually inac- cessible. To assist willing members of mankind to access the necessar y information to provide a way to transcend this cur- rent aberrant state, various volunteer awareness points within higher vibrational frequencies have acted as booster stations to focus this information through those willing to participate on the Earth plane. Knowing the custom of Earth’s inhabitants requiring the “personify to identify” mode, names from the ex otic to the ridiculous have been given as sources of this infor- mation. The information included exercises in discernment, most participants failed the discernment tests. Much was filled with profound truth, but much of it was drained of ener- gy by the continual parade of victims wanting their personal pr oblems solv ed for them. The information became distor ted as the foci were withdrawn and the volunteers winged it (faked it) on their own for their sincerity was lost in the notoriety and gr eed that r esulted. I n vie w of this histor y , it was the mutual agr eement between the parties involved in the dictation/translation/ transcription pr ocess for these messages that the foci inv olv ed would r emain unidentified and ther e would be no monetary rewards whatsoever involved. Further, there would be no personal information disseminated for any one"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Becoming 2 individual’s benefit. The totality of the foci involved is for the benefit of the planet and its inhabitants, period! The truth of the messages is to be discerned and used for the benefit of humanity first and then gleaned by the individual to apply personally as part of the wholeness to which it is focused without the necessity of personal names to identify truth. If that is not understood, then the messages need to be read again to transcend this need into commitment to the holographic intention of the information they contain. It is hoped that the succinctness of this message is accepted in the tone of impor tance in which it is intended. The window of opportunity to accomplish the necessary monumental consciousness transition is small compared to the obstacles within the human belief systems that must be literally dissolved so that the whole may be transformed. It is sincerely hoped that the truth contained will be a swor d that cuts through the armor of deception and lays open the hearts and minds of the necessary quotient for suc- cess."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Becoming 3 Prologue The messages contained in this, the third book of mes- sages, are a continuation of information provided for the transition of the hearts and minds of those of humanity that ar e willing to be a catalyst for change. It is an undeniable truth that the current pattern of use and abuse of the plane- tary resources will lead to the end of its ability to sustain life forms. The human body and awareness are being deliberate- ly overwhelmed physically, psychologically and magnetically. The majority of humanity fails to understand that unseen forces surrounding them are affecting their ability to survive. These are hidden within the “modern” conveniences pow- ered by alternating electrical current; through radio, televi- sion, and many other low frequency emanations that now alter the individual ’ s and the planet ’ s magnetic fields to an unimaginable degree. Just as human scientists experiment using what are con- sider ed “lesser species” with little concern for their suffering and death in the name of “scientific advancement,” so also is humanity considered a lesser species to be used in like fash- ion. “You” are being used in exactly that way with the full knowledge and participation of those humans who believe themselv es a par t of the contr olling hierar chy . These mis- guided humans are under the direct supervision of those beings that desire to continue to control this planet and oth- ers.

These interactions have been both face to face and telepathic. The evidence indicates the pres- ence of outside powers trying to continue the long standing control of Earth and its solar system. There are also those that are a positive presence hoping to be of assistance to an awakening humanity that must be willing to take on the responsibility for determining its own future in order to receive this available help. Humanity has itself blocked the answer to its long stand- ing cry for relief from enslavement by the outside forces, because it has been educated to ask for its “rescue” to come from an unknowable being that is in actuality a part of the contr olling forces. Deception for control has been very suc- cessful for thousands of years. “Worship your controller” has been the ploy. Mankind has very little time left to wake up to this strategy and cooperativ ely agr ee that it is time to end this charade once and for all. Those who would assist must be a group that is willing to research and prove to itself bey ond a shadow of a doubt the truth of this astounding pronouncement of the global situation.

Both the positive and negative forces that are focused on this planet ar e awar e that multiple cycles are culminating in this time sequence which will be to the advantage of either humanity or its colonizers, depending upon which one has the support of the overall planetary consciousness.

Rich min- eral reserves have been transported from this planet and others in this solar system for thousands of years to enrich the lives of beings that have failed to steward their own planetary resources wisely. Reports of large “mother ships” are true and they are present for that purpose. It is time for humanity to wake up and people to come together in the understanding that they are wise enough to control their own destiny and ask for help to “help them- selves for the highest and best good for all concerned.” That is a prayer that can be affirmatively answered! Until such time as humans can prove themselves to be cooperative and non-aggr essive toward their benevolent neighbors, all help will be given indirectly: that is these beings will not walk among you until it is safe for them to do so. The help that can be offer ed will be v er y effective, but it must be asked for and accepted as assistance and not as rescue. A victim, be it individual or a planetary mass consciousness, has not ev olved to a level of responsibility that warrants assistance. A victim consciousness must move through the need to look outside of itself and instead look at its o wn choices to find the cause(s) of its imperfect situation. Freewill is the freedom to choose, and all continuously choose, even if it is to choose not to choose. Ther e are always forces willing to make choic- es for those unwilling to make their own. It is time for humanity to make its own choices. These messages were written to help with that important process."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Becoming 6 III-1 The time of bringing the belief system into harmony with the actual physical reality situation in order to avoid the doom of destruction that is now awaiting the majority of earth’s population is now. The important focus is not to dwell on the doom: it is the pivotal point that is now avail- able to humanity that must be used as the impetus of change. Shocking as the facts are regarding the primrose path that humanity has been blindly following, these must be accepted and then the focus turned away fr om the decep- tions toward creating a new reality. What is this new reality? How can it be created if there is no knowledge of what it is that should or could replace the present situation? It would appear that this reality as it is cre- ated would be nothing but a hodge-podge of each one’s desires based on the programming that is already present within each. Who would hav e the ability to release what is known and envision new concepts that would not be taint- ed with dreams of the past?

For example, if benevolence has been sought from outside sources, is it indeed available from within one’s own aware- ness? If freedom has not been found in either authoritarian systems or in the pursuit of individual freedoms, then where is it to be found? Could it be obtained within moral and eth- ical standards that gift the individual within an agreement made by co-operating groups? Could the size of the groups also be arranged by agreement? Could the groups find com- mon ground for agreement within common desires for sim- ilar defined freedoms? If co-operation was the key ingredient rather than competition and the need to be/feel superior, then all things are possible. If common interest and desire were the defined beginning point around which all else is drawn b y attraction to intended definition of desired experi- ence, successful interaction is possible. If freedom to with- draw and find a more adequate experience within another gr oup was encouraged and allo w ed, successful adventure in self-definition would be assured. The experience of the search for the most perfect expression could be an end unto itself. Though gr oups would be visited on a regular basis, it would be the commitment to a flexible and expanding focus that would enable them to continue until a satisfactor y accomplishment was made by all involved. Thus no commitment to forever continuity would be a part of the goal, as expansive experience cannot place fences ar ound itself and function within its intended expression. It is understood that expansive conscious- ness can only continue its expansion within a context of chang- ing conceptual understandings.

The introduction of apparently conflicting information resolves into integration of the apparent dichoto- my and allows for progression into greater concepts. In other words, stagnation through holding to static beliefs halts the desired process. The safety of known apparent truths is a trap, which the progressing consciousness must purposefully avoid. The ability to accept this conceptual understanding of the ground rules for participation within manifested experi- ence requires a stretch in the belief system that is indeed quite phenomenal in and of itself. However mind boggling it is, it is the beginning point that is necessary if mankind is to extricate itself from the mire in which it now finds itself. The controlling over-lords are intent on returning this plan- et to a bare minimum of tightly enslaved beings so they can r eturn to their original intent of stripping the needed min- erals for the salvation of their own civilization at the expense of this planet and its inhabitants. It is the destiny of the inhabitants that belong to this planet b y bir th and adoption to take on the responsibility of changing this destiny and there is little sequential time remaining for them to accom- plish this monumental feat.

The light workers are the focus of “God,” as you have chosen to name the outplay of creative energies that bring into being galaxies, solar systems, planets and individualized awareness to acknowledge and experience these manifestations. These now begin their work in earnest. Indeed each individual awareness has within itself that cre- ative energy that is theirs to acknowledge and to know per- sonally. It is the focus of that subtly powerful energy that is who each really is. It appears to be apart from the personali- ty/ego that is capable of comprehending the understanding of the concept of it. It is the “becoming” of this apparently larg- er than life beingness that is the difficult accomplishment. Yet, there is “no other God.” That which each is in this larger r eality is the only doorway to understanding the concept of what is called God. God is not a focus of personality – individual thought pr ocesses or a benev olent cr eator separate from you. God is the combination of the focus of all Its parts coalesced into the composite of all. Each awareness is blocked from being a par t of that composite until each realizes that it is a part of this composite. Being told that it is, means nothing at all. It is the r ealization that one ’ s self is a viable part of that com- posite that encompasses the totality of the being, that is what “becoming” is all about. One must become that reality and r ealiz e it is a viable aspect of the totality of God and that its input to that reality is the truth of who they are. It is not a mental realization, but one that registers total agreement within the mental, emotional, physical and spiritual levels of the total self .

The body must register this understanding through the totality of its brain-nervous system resulting in what is called a realization that then registers as a sudden feeling sen- sation accompanied by an all encompassing understanding. It allows for a total change in perception with regard to the self and how this self fits into the composite picture of expe- rience. This results in a change in the perception of “God’’ which suddenly allows for an understanding that “God” equates to cosmic/galactic citizenship rather than a father/child relationship. It is a shift from “being or experi- encing as powerless” to the awesome responsibility of being a contributing portion to the totality of what constitutes “God” or the creative energy of potentiality being focused into experience in or der that it can be defined and under- stood. The pivotal point at which this change takes place is not a shift fr om negativ e to positiv e. It is rather an uplifting to a new point in the spiral of experience that allows for a greater understanding and ability to utilize the positive/negative energies that ar e part and parcel of the outflow of creative energies in the individual and collective foci that result in the larger matrix or design of the whole pattern of a galaxy . I t is easier to grasp the larger picture of this description than to define it at the level of each individual awareness. Each being comes to the point of their o wn r ealization in unique ways and by unique combinations of experience and wisdom. The point is often approached and rejected many times before the actual crossover acceptance happens. It requires a great deal of courage to cr osso v er to a ne w and differ ent perspec - tive of the life experience. It requires releasing well-learned"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Becoming 11 lessons and entering into a completely new consciousness of what reality truly is. For those who are on the planet Earth now, the deceptions are of such magnitude and the truth of what each being is, so well hidden, that the acceptance of the truth by the masses is such a gigantic leap in consciousness that it appears to be impossible that it could possibly happen. Yet, happen it must if this segment of the human race and this jewel of a planet are to survive. When viewed from the larger perspective, the deceptions as perpetrated on the human race of this planet are so total- ly illogical that it is quite amazing that so few humans have figured out the truth. Granted, many when they are first introduced to the possibility that they have been deceived, immediately resonate with the idea and begin to contem- plate its possibility and arriv e at the truth of its probability. However, those that cling to the deceptions with tenacity are in the overwhelming majority. It is therefore to be anticipat- ed that much chaos will be experienced befor e a mathemat - ical coefficient of beings making the realization/change of consciousness is reached to bring about a shift in the future experience on this planet. I t is then to be anticipated that the planet itself may or may not be able to survive the abuse that is being loosed upon it. T o enable mor e help from the galac- tic citizenry to assist in this situation, a large number of “responsible Earth citizens” must request this help to save the planet first and the citiz enr y second.

Our concern is that the “composite concept of God” that each awareness is entitled to contribute to as a realized consciousness, become the next focus of concern for those awake and aware humans awaiting the next step in their assignment. III-3 In the final accounting, it is the transition of conscious- ness into citizenship responsibility that is the goal. All else comes as a result of that choice. It was once offered as a part of the experience of bringing the US of A into being, but the consciousness of the individual people was not at a point that the goals could be maintained. Instead the exploiting of the resources through greed was greater than the commit- ment to soul agendas. Thus these experiences were allowed to be play ed out for the lessons to be learned. I t is y et to be seen if these lessons will be discerned and brought into wis- dom by a sufficient number to salvage this planet. Choices must be made to place the whole as equal to the individual in the consideration of the result desired. Those asked to give their lives for the purposes of defending their country or placing the ideals of their lead- ers above those of others and attacking them, have allowed the illusion of a whole as being mor e impor tant than the individual. It is a supreme sacrifice. When the whole and the individual consideration have equal weight, then war is not an option unless imbalance is acted out as an attack. Then all other options ar e consider ed first befor e a defense is appropriate. When there is balance, there is progress. It is to be r emembered that the play of positive and negative"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Becoming 13 energies brings forth the spiral of progress. However, the extremes of both bring forth regression, or loss of upward progress. Another ingredient that must be taken into account within the context of war, is the familiar consideration of the victim consciousness. It is to be remembered that the law of attraction causes the victim to draw to its experience those who have a like consciousness but are on the other side of it, like the two sides of a coin. Those who feel abused draw to them those who will provide more of that experience until that attitude is shed. Thus war serves its purpose through forcing the victims to come together and experience the power of throwing off the aggressor. Then either the empow- erment is retained, or the former victims return to one or the other side of the victim experience. This trading of sides con- tinues until a realization is made that allows for transcending this experience. It is this outplay in the extreme that is upon this planet no w . It is understanding of this situation from its larger per- spective that will allow those who are about assisting the planet and its inhabitants to mo ve through these experiences and continue their chosen work. The experience for those inv olv ed cannot be changed for them. The consciousness within each involved group must shift and move both indi- vidually and collectively. The consciousness of the group that each leader r epr esents will affect that leader’s decisions. No amount of outside influence on that leader will change that and the only control that can be used is to “replace” that leader, usually through assassination. In that way the process can be slo w ed or changed b y the chaos that accompanies the change in leadership, usually by tricking the group into"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Becoming 14 believing the death of their leader was perpetrated by the other side. In this case, discernment is the key and it is the one time that the observer group may be able to influence the outcome by circulating the truth. Through the comprehension of the larger picture, it is within possibility that those who have volunteered to assist the “God focus” can realize that their participation is a key to the transition of this planet and its inhabitants into a greater experience of manifested life. As taught by the reli- gions at this time, personal power is transferred to and through an unknowable power and governmental bureau- cracy. Both of these entities have been created for purposes of enslavement. The problem of education of the masses then presents itself. It is to be remembered, that it is the first fe w who are awakened and make the realization of this hoax that are the most difficult to convince of this reality. Thus, those precious few are to be valued and the education pr ocess continued for the pr ocess will become easier as the numbers increase. Though it seems but a pitiful few in view of the billions of beings that constitute the mass conscious- ness of the planet, it must be r emembered that it took the opposition literally eons of time to reach the current control lev el. A change in the understandings that they have slowly and carefully nurtured can be accomplished in a very, very short time because they defy logic. The mind of conscious beings constantly searches for logic in order that each may stay posi- tioned within the linear perception of time and life experience. Illogic is a form of chaos and to assimilate illogic into a logi- cal sequence r equir es a gr eat deal of concentration. I t is one of the reasons that rest or recreation away from this process is"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Becoming 15 craved. Once illogical ideas are identified, then the sequential thought process reprograms itself, rather like a computer changing its internal arrangement of data to a more efficient combination of sequences. When illogic is perceived and the rearrangement of data takes place, then other illogical data is identified and the search is on to further identify any other illogical data present and to eliminate it also. Through this process, great changes in the mass consciousness can be accomplished. III-4 As the Light Workers on this planet comprehend the larger pictur e, it is helpful to them to continue to broaden the picture to include a greater understanding of the galactic wholeness in which they are playing such an important part. This understanding is to enable them to enhance their observer roles and thus see through and past the chaos that each will find going on around them. Through the process of observation while experiencing the chaos, each will be able to place themselv es in a position that allo ws them to be in places of safety, not in hiding, but in movement within the chaos. It is an experience of observing the self in movement, a process of literally being in two fields of awar eness simultaneously . Simply put, an example to begin the process is being aware that each individual is at the same moment in sequential time an individual with its o wn life agenda and also a par t of the family , community, state, nation and planetary whole. Each status is an awar eness that is separate and y et a composite of the whole ear thly experience. Each shifts their thought processes between each role and yet maintains their stability."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Becoming 16 Further, a truly good actor can be their own personality and can also assume the personality of the character they are play- ing and move between them without losing the awareness that they are both. The Light Workers, ground crew, whatev- er each chooses to call him/herself, must learn to walk in two worlds simultaneously. It would be wise for each to begin to practice the art of this split awareness. It is nothing more than an acceptance of the situation as it is. There is the world of deception and the world of knowing that the deception is being perpetrated on the planetary inhabitants. Each also knows that a new and different world of expe- rience awaits birthing, but until the one that is known to the inhabitants begins to crumble into chaos, there is no way to birth the new one. As the current known reality reaches a specific degr ee of disintegration in the chaos, the new one can begin to come into manifested reality. The question is which one will materialize, the one planned by the dark planners or the one that is envisioned b y the Light Workers/Ground Crew and those drawn to the dream of the New Paradigm. There is the planned world of disharmony with the galactic composite plan or one that is cr eated in har- mony with it. The critical number of humans desiring a har- monious existence within the surr ounding energies of poten - tiality that constitute this Galaxy must be reached in order for the New Paradigm to come into a reality recognizable by those beings in harmony with it. B ased on a mathematical formula it is less than might be thought considering the number of humans on Earth. One of the reasons for this is that those who desire this harmonious experience will be focused upon that desir e. E v en though ther e ar e many humans that are now focused on the deception, during the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Becoming 17 chaos they will lose that focus and become caught up in the chaos. Their focus will be on the chaos, thus nullifying a great deal of the power that those of dark intent have estab- lished. It is during this time that the most important work for the Light (those of positive intent) will be done. This is the reason that it is important for those of positive focus to become aware of their purpose for being here and learn to lift themselves out of the influence of the chaos and know that those will be the moments of most productive service to this planet and thereby to their fellow humans. The exact knowledge of the nature of the New Paradigm is not all that important at this time, it is the desire for it that is important. It is the commitment to being part of the positive/Light focus that is important. It is the practice of walking within mor e than one awareness by acknowledging them as a part of everyday living that is primary. Each must learn to choose in the moment which awareness is the predominant one and change fr om one to the other b y intent. Awareness is the focus of who and what each is. Each has a multifaceted opportunity to learn to use latent/unused abilities that ar e available. The knowledge and use of these have been hidden and denied, for to use these would bring fr eedom fr om contr ol. There are many that would seem quite miraculous. These are indeed simple applications of mathematical laws that exist but are unknown. Many of these will be included in the lessons to follo w , not explained in confusing terminology, but as guided, simple lessons in application. When practiced and applied to daily living situ- ations, they will become a part of each one’s life experience and av ailable when needed in the experiences coming in the sequential times to come."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Becoming 18 It is suggested that each begin to observe the various roles that are available in situations and thoughts about situations in daily experience such as being part of the deception and observing the deception. During one’s thoughts, which role is being played out, the family member, the citizen of the local community, the church member, the dismayed U.S. citizen when learning of the latest aggression by the govern- ment, the state citizen reading the news of the latest activity in the legislature, etc., etc. What observer role or active role is each one (are you) playing in the moment? Is it the role that you desire to play? If not, then can you change “hats” so to speak and observe from a different role? It is important that each of you learn to discern through self observation where you are in the scenario that is occurring in your per- ception at any giv en moment. In the practice of this role playing, much safety in the future can be gained. III-5 In the days to come, those who intend to hold the focus for this transition of the planet and its inhabitants will need every positive word to encourage them to continue in the process. It is the intent of this material to add to the positive intent of those committed to the pr oject b y pr o viding prac - tical and easily used techniques to assist in holding this intent in place. It is necessary that this intent be held on a continual basis b y the constant input of many . I nasmuch as manifestation can be traced backwar d to thought, to light, to intent/focus, to potentiality , it can be seen just wher e the intent to par ticipate in this pr ocess fits into the flow of cre- ation. For whatever purpose, be it positive or negative, the"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Becoming 19 process is the same and available to be used. It is the ease of the flow, that makes the difference, for as the previous mate- rial has revealed, when the intent/focus resonates with the higher creational intent manifestation results more easily. Any desired manifestation that is in harmony with the high- er/finer intent receives reinforcing energy and therefore is able to receive advantageous assistance in manifesting with- out needing to be aware of what it is or how it came. In other words, that which resonates with the greater plan of whole- ness draws to it through the law of attraction added sup- portive energy. Manifestation that lacks this resonance and is initiated at a level below the highest source of purpose or intention requires a more intense focus and careful attention to the continual need to hold the plan firmly in the center of atten - tion. The smallest detail that deviates from the plan can cause a ripple effect that changes the planned outcome at many lev els of the manifestation pr ocess. There is no auto- matic support process to dovetail these changes into the plan harmoniously. This then makes the resistive plan vulnerable to deviations that can be dev astating to the total plan with- out the knowledge of those initiating it and holding it in place with their intention. It is important that those who are supporting the mani- festation of the New Paradigm understand this and hold this comparison of the differ ence of the two sets of cir cumstances that underlay the situation at hand that they have chosen to participate within firmly in mind. It is entirely possible that by being familiar with as many of the details of the opposi- tion ’ s plans, discouraging and demoralizing as they appear to be, when deviations do occur in it, it is possible to sense the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Becoming 20 panic and frantic activity that goes on as attempts are made to counteract the effects the deviation may have wrought. Those are then occupied in making changes in the details of the overall plan to compensate for the effects that naturally ripple through the entire situation. This then opens the pos- sibility of being able to add to the effects to further compli- cate the recovery they are trying to accomplish. Thus we offer two tools for holding the focus for the New Paradigm firmly in place. The first being the under- standing of the overriding higher purpose of the creational flow bringing with it intelligent coordination of energies that resonate with the higher purpose. The second using the greatest possible understanding of their plan as the basis of observing their process and finding moments and opportu- nities to add to their complications in maintaining their focus. Simply focusing attention on their dilemmas can place great stress on their ability to correct the flow of inten- tional energy , for that which is contrar y to the Light, must be done in secrecy and darkness. Knowledge is thought which flows from the Light of understanding. This then points out the need to kno w as much as possible about the plans of the dark intention for the enslavement of this planet. It points out the impor tance of the wor k that has been done b y those com- mitted to investigating, observing, drawing obvious conclu- sions and then sharing with any and all who will listen and read about what constitutes the dar k plans. Those who have com- mitted their life focus to exposing this plan serve their fellow human beings and this planet well. This information is critical to the transition through this process that must be made by the planet and its inhabitants. I t must not be the focus, but must be the background upon which the New Paradigm will begin"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Becoming 21 its building process out of the chaos that the dark plan will cause. Thus in its own way, looking at the bigger picture, the situation instigated by the dark forces will in the long run serve that portion of humanity and the planet that choose to take advantage of the opportunity offered as a boost on their path of evolvement. III-6 The rapidity of the coming events into manifestation has been allowed in that the chaos will serve the birth of change. Though those of you who dread its onset, knowing the addi- tional suffering that will be endured by the many you consid- er the pawns of innocence is understood, y et indeed are they innocent? The same opportunities that have been afforded you, though they may have been clothed in different appear- ances, hav e been offered to all. It is the few that have opened their conscious thought to the possibilities and the probabili- ties that now find themselves in awareness of what the true picture is that faces the planet and its inhabitants. This group must also understand that the dilemma will be solv ed in what is called Divine Order.

It is through the Handbook of the New Paradigm, Embracing the Rainbow and this book to the known few who are at this time actively focusing their thought energy to this purpose, that this agreement in active corrective movement can be made known. Though the group doing this seems pitifully small, it is extremely effec- tive. Those involved in this activity are not entities of small experience or ability.

However, the ability to make the change once accepted and decided upon by earth’s human residents will flow easily and irrevocably once the sufficient percentage of those desiring change has been reached. What exactly the Galactic Council will decide to do to assist this is now the question. It means that those who are misusing the laws that underlay manifested existence no longer have the same degree of energy input to support their activities as they have had at their disposal. There will be a waning or lessening of this supportive energy. This will bring about an unraveling of their overall plan. Those carefully planned strategies will begin to have unexpected results that will cause unexpected ripple effects that do not bring about either the expected results or the degree of expected results in order to accomplish the anticipated goal. The plan as kno wn to those awake and awar e humans is “the plan.” It is their anticipated and embroidered plan. It is not necessarily what that plan is in reality. It is important that the differ ence be understood clearly. The actuality of “the plan” is skeletal indeed. It is open to many variations and has many w eaknesses that ar e unkno wn to them.

The plan of enslavement is based on the intention to destroy and enslave large portions of humanity as a method of solving a problem that was caused by those who have controlled this planet and its inhabitants. This situation was brought about by the controllers’ own decisions regarding the use of the planet and its inhabitants in the very begin- ning. This has been further complicated by the addition of various groups of humanity from various other places in the galaxy being added to the citizenry against their will. There does then exist a complex citizenry that brings to the mix an interesting dilemma for those who desire to control the planet. Ther e is a direct opposition of intentions, those of slav- ery and those of freedom. If it were not for the added citi- zenry, the plan of enslavement would have been accom- plished long ago .

That intention, which is in harmony with the galac- tic intention for evolvement through freewill choice of expe- rience, then becomes a powerful tool of change in the “hands” of those who understand its usefulness and learn to wield it in a timely fashion and at moments of greatest effect. Through the knowledge and understanding of the intentions of the opposing force, this understanding can be used to great effect for the purpose of freeing this planet from its heretofore use as a source of minerals and as a dumping grounds for human misfits.

There is a point at which the thought patterns mentioned above reach a place within the consciousness that causes a shift.

Through the research of the artifacts of past civilizations that are now available and have been studied, cataloged and conclusions drawn, it is clear to the few that have availed themselves of this knowledge, that humanity has been lead down the primrose path. One ideology after another has been thrust upon innocent mankind in their search for their purpose and their origins to keep them in darkness and igno- rance. The question is why? What purpose could beings of mor e intelligence have for deliberately causing their plane- tary relatives to be misled and their evolutionary progress diverted into a backwater rather than leading them onward and up war d into full citiz enship and responsibility within the Galactic family? Could there be a character flaw within the genetic expression of that particular group of beings? Could that character flaw hav e been carried on through to those of humanity that have the intermingled blood of those par ticular appar ently superior beings? The expansive flow of the Universal energies that under- lay the manifestation of potentiality into expression requires that kno wledge be experienced into wisdom.

In other words, what appear to those of less active mind/brain capabilities as experiences happening one after the other are indeed being played out in other experiential formats simultaneously. Thus a picture is being completed with more than one activity going on with no time constraints for beginning or completion, for all is in constant motion with only momentary rest periods of inac- tivity. These momentary periods of inactivity are those inci- dents of realization of wisdom acquired through the experi- encing of knowledge to points of understanding. Thus wis- dom is gained so that the process is continued expansively. The apparent character flaws that have held mankind in a delusional state of false and misleading knowledge that is impossible to experience into wisdom, has been a two fold situation. F irst the flaw by the more knowledgeable, self appointed over-lords of this planet who have jealously guard- ed their perceived superiority and the flaw of humanity in thinking they ar e lessor and thus the pawns of these beings. Because ones have less understanding does not make them of less potentiality. It is potentiality that is the measure of worth and mankind has equal potentiality with any and ev ery other expression of self awareness. It is in making this realization and demanding the oppor tunity to self-expr ess into this potentiality that will free mankind on this planet to accom- plish this purpose. This demand as a personal decision made within each one ’ s own inner knowingness will bring about the change from victim/slave to sovereign owner of his/her future individually and collectively.

As an overall composite from the point of view of a spiral of upliftment, the results are dismal to say the least. Whatever help has been given has been convoluted and shamefully diverted into disinforma- tion. What has been intuited has been hidden or destroyed and those gifted humans imprisoned or killed. Mankind has been purposefully held in mental, emotional and spiritual captivity. The age-old question arises as to “why God allows this to happen?” Here again we face the fallacy of what “G od” has been represented to be.

This brings the focus back to the understanding that each has of who and what they are. The self-awareness of each has the ability to choose and decide how to experience their manifested reality. It is the power that either takes them forward into greater experience through wis- dom gained or allows them to regress into lesser experiences of slavery and degradation. These are made, not in one great decision, but as a sum total of all the experiences from early childhood onward. Unfortunately, these decisions are greatly influenced by the parent’s experience from conception for- ward. Thus we find each generation saddled with the difficul- ty of overcoming this influence plus the planned misconcep- tions that are planted by those pawns of the self appointed overlords of this planet. O nly through recognizing and accepting this dilemma in its true dimensions can those committed members of this human race find a place of equilibrium from which to begin to build a viable understanding of who and what they ar e. I t is necessary to accept that the totality of human status is yet to be attained. It is totally possible to attain the full active status of the human potentiality , but it indeed will require assistance. This assistance, as has been stated before in these lessons, can be made av ailable after a sufficient number of humans on this planet accept the fact that their help must first come from within their own decision process. It is a pr er equisite that there must be acceptance that their only rescue is to be found in their own inner resources.

It is necessary to recognize and decide to become a part of this manifested awareness as a responsible and con- tributing part of it in order to proceed within its process. At this point, the question of the misuse of humanity by its self-appointed overlords returns to the focus of this dis- cussion. As brought forth within the prior discussion, the laws that allow for potentiality to express into manifested reality so that knowledge can be experienced into wisdom and progress provide the basis for this process. The basic law, is the law of attraction. Thus, mankind on planet earth has been influenced from the beginning to maintain the under- standing that knowledge and wisdom come from those of greater and superior knowledge and wisdom. Further that this kno wledge and wisdom is given out to them through adoration and worship of those holding this superior under- standing. This has brought an understanding that the humans on this planet exist at the whim of those holding this superior wisdom. As time has passed, this understanding has been manipulated into the belief by humanity that it is vest- ed in an unkno wable awareness that has all the attributes as wielded over them by their overlords. These ever present beings hav e hidden themselv es and operated thr ough this “unknowable God,” holding humanity hostage not only for the resources of the planet, but as a last experiment in manipulation and literal enter tainment.

This is within the action of the Universal Laws. It will remain so until humanity literally pulls itself out of this situation. lt is the desire of those of your galactic brothers and sisters who are aware of your planetary dilem- ma that you come into the realization of what is the true sit- uation. There is not an easy way to accomplish this inas- much as the human belief systems are so deeply ingrained with false information and deceptions. The hope is that the frustrations of enough of humanity have reached a great enough degree for them to begin to accept the possibility that virtually everything they have been taught to under- stand is inaccurate. The most important new understanding to be accepted is that without personal responsibility to change each person’s consciousness with regard to under- standing who and what each one is, this situation will not change. The whole of the planetary belief system will change only as its individual members change until a critical math- ematical quotient is r eached. H o w long this takes will depend on the spread of this understanding throughout all the groups that are now on this planet. It is the responsibil- ity of those who come into the understanding of this infor - mation to disseminate it. Then and only then will the future change.

The controllers believe that they are solely responsible for the creation of the human beings that inhabit this earth. Through genetic manipulations made in laboratory experi- ments and by birthing the first chemically manipulated embryos through their own bodies, the controllers believe the resulting humans are their product and solely their pos- sessions. What they do not recognize is what might be called the Divine connection that was present in the first place. The basic being that was available in the beginning was not of their creation and thus contained the possibility of evolving into fully functioning humans within their own time line. Those were present on this planet through the focus that indeed holds even the controllers within their o wn expression. It is necessary to go back further in the process of the laws of the Universe allowing for manifested awareness to be pr esent. P otentiality has bir thed itself to explore the possi- bilities that are inherent within it. In order to do this; there must be the ability to observe its processes of doing this. The ability to obser ve is what is called awareness. Thus to create situations, circumstances and observable phenomena and explor e the r esults, ther e must also be present within the totality the ability to observe and draw conclusions with regard to this process. The result is that various foci of this ability to obser v e, experience and draw logical conclusions have created endless varieties of foci with various abilities to do this.

Through a lack of understanding of the overall purpose of self-awareness and the presence of this greater awareness, these individual centers become caught up in their own experience, thus cutting themselves off from the totality to which they belong. What might be called power trips hap- pen. There is within your vernacular a cruder saying that refers to this situation. So, in this moment, humanity is sit- ting in the middle of that reference. Because of one ingredi- ent within the format of the Universal laws, the responsibil- ity for curing this type of situation must remain with those experiencing it. This ingredient is called freewill, or choice, or the r esponsibility of decision. Humanity has the freewill to choose to change its experience or to continue the current experience. This is not a new thought within the continuity of these messages, that is because ther e is no other solution. Because of this, it is repeated over and over from as many contexts and approaches as can be presented in order to make this point as clear and as emphatic as possible. Needless to say, if there were another way, it certainly would hav e been br ought for th in the information that is being made available to you. It is imperative that the respon- sibility for creating this change in experience be firmly plant- ed within the attitude and understanding of as many human minds as possible.

When mankind does direct its focus within the under- standing of its power to create through agreement to hold a single focus, there is no way in which it can be overwhelmed, particularly if that focus is in harmony and agreement with other citizens within the surrounding galactic community. The question then arises as to how to bring a squabbling group of opinionated beings into agreement. The controllers are attempting to do this, only for the purposes of its focus. In regimenting the thoughts of humanity toward their goal they are also regimenting the sub-conscious thought patterns more and more toward resistance and opposition to their planned goals. In other words, they are also helping to set up the possibility of the failure of their plans. In past experience, their plans hav e worked to keep humanity under their con- trol.

The material has thus far begun at a simple level and progressed through levels of understanding. We are now at a place to begin encompassing the understanding of those that would continue holding humanity in captivity. Just as they have attempted to know humanity’s capabilities for their purpos- es, it is also necessary that they be understood. Though their understanding of humanity has failed to include the “divine” connection which they have claimed exclusively as their o wn, humanity’s other attributes are well understood. In order for those that have contemplated the information within these messages to have a clear and balanced under- standing of the entire picture, it is important to know more about their counterpar ts. The expansive flow of creation extends itself not only in the manifestation of more planets, stars, galaxies, etc., it also allo ws for limitless expansion of the awar eness. It is difficult for the mind/brain that is not operating at its full capacity to contemplate the concept of what limitless and timeless could mean. Within this concept there is allowance for forays into both positiv e and negativ e expr ession that feed back to the wholeness of knowledge and wisdom within a collective composite. In the consideration of the wholeness, then each individual awar eness seems like a grain of sand on the beach and causes each to then wonder as to the impor tance of their personal experience. Is it of such little value that pain and"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Becoming 39 suffering are meaningless to this composite awareness? Is it even aware of all of its parts? Here again the mind/brain that has been focused only upon itself and its personal experience has cut itself off from this wholeness of which it is a part. It is the contemplation of the wholeness and its meaning that allows for participation within it. It is in stretching the awareness to purposefully include itself within the compos- ite that its importance to that composite becomes known. Having come forth through the auspices of a group awareness that is focused upon its own importance, that attribute has carried through to humanity. In contemplating a new paradigm of experience, it is this key of including itself within the composite wholeness rather than focusing only upon itself that will bring forth the freedom that humanity has as the impetus for change. To put this in less abstract terms, it is the desire to become participating members of the galactic family and to extend their perception that the purpose of life experience is gr eater than each individual experience and each planetary experience that will bring this forth. When it is realized that harmony of experience is found b y expressing within the immutable Laws of the Universe and not in ignoring them, then experience can be shaped into pr ogr ess and jo yful expression. Recognizing these laws as the basis within which all manifestation is expressed, it becomes possible to recognize imbalance for what it is and to transcend it. Technological progress is not a true measure for progress within the creative expansion of potentiality.

In this way, those who are again attempting to play at their control and destruction games have placed this planet and its inhabitants in danger of destruction. Imbalance as projected through failure to recognize the potentiality of self-aware beings to pursue their inherent evolvement processes has brought both the givers and the receivers of this policy to a point where the significant deci- sions each will make will influence their progress. Each will reap the results of these decisions. Each has the potential power to change the path of their evolvement by the actions taken through the next few sequential events to be shaped by the decisions made both individually and collectively. It is important to grasp that the individual does influence the collectiv e decision, both directly and indirectly. What that means is that though the individual is bound by the group decision through composite agreement, it also allows for that individual to fr ee itself fr om the gr oup decision by forming or becoming a part of a smaller group with a differ- ent focused purpose. This smaller focused group, by invok- ing the second Law of the U niverse, the focus of intentional manifestation, then separates itself from the greater group and does change the path or experience of its ev olv ement. I t is for this reason that the messages have encouraged the for- mation of smaller groups with the intended purpose of cre- ating a N e w Paradigm of experience. Those who have evolved beyond the need to participate in the victim con- sciousness that holds them within the grasp of the control- ling civilization and locks the two groups into this situation as it no w exists, hav e the oppor tunity to salv age this planet and its inhabitants.

III-12 What is a major drama to the inhabitants of earth is indeed an important pivotal point in the continuing evolution of con- scious manifested awareness. In the totality of the galactic expression that constitutes the known reality, it is wondered how this small, beautiful planet at the outer reaches of this defined ar ea can carry such importance. It is the transition through the taking back of personal power/control of individ- ual and collective destiny that is the central issue. Just as the consciousness of the leader of a countr y, self-appointed or elect- ed, expresses the composite consciousness of the people within that country, the planetary scenario that is being played out is the collective representation of the consciousness of the beings on that planet. This then is carried out into a fur ther compos - ite of consciousness in an expanding composite. We might say that earth is the collection point of victim consciousness, a point within a larger collectiv e of this unhappy experience within this area of the galaxy.

While it is understood by the counterparts who intend to hold humanity as their own to do with as they please, there is much interest in their attitude and treat- ment of those on this planet. There is no apparent inten- tion to redirect this continuing pattern of enslavement. This presents the dilemma of how to assist humanity and answer their calls for freedom from this experience. It also accounts for the concentrated effort on the part of the self appointed colonizers of this planet to maintain claimed ownership through members of the human race that are willing to be pawns. In this way, it may be portrayed that the control is not from outside, but indeed by humanity enslaving itself. As the saying goes, “saying something is tr ue, does not make it true!” Because the belief patterns of humanity, through govern- ments, religions, education and media have apparently so successfully shut do wn the minds of the gr eater por tion of the people, it is the opinion of the controllers that the game is won. Even though they are quite sure of this, they yet are car eful to keep all aspects in careful review.

However, the character flaw of power is also comparable to his intelligence. Fortunately, he is not the final “word” with regard to the future of this plan- et. There is a council that has influence beyond his. It is to this council that an appeal must be made. Though he has great influence and through eloquence has kept his control- ling influence alive over a long duration of time, it is this council in which greater authority rests. The question then arises as to how to make this all-impor- tant appeal. One or even a few cannot do it. It must be through combined and focused appointment/election of an eloquent and powerful emissary by a quorum of humanity. How can a divided, submissive and victimized humanity ever arrive at such an agr eement? Wher e will this idyllic emissary be found? Indeed, those are the questions! Further, how does this emis- sary contact and appear before this heretofore-unknown coun- cil? I t would appear that help is certainly going to be needed to accomplish this. There is help available when the quorum is gather ed and the appointment/election is made. F irst the impossible must be accomplished, and then help will available to assist. This is something that humanity must do in faith. Cer tainly ther e is belief in theories more illogical than this firmly held by large groups of humanity. These presently accepted concepts offer far less than freedom from bondage and acceptance of the right to continue on the path of evolve- ment.

All possible focus of intent is at work within the factions that are present. At the center of these foci are the dazed and incredulous human beings that hold not only their own future, but the ability to influence the entire galaxy with their decision process. What will you/they do? III-13 While mankind seems to face accomplishments that are of monumental proportions for a divided and quarreling group that from one perspective is more animal-like than divine, there is light at the end of the tunnel. The ability to continue on the current path is now reaching a point at which the path must divide. There are those who innately kno w that the time has come to make a decision. They must either continue on the path that is leading to a vibrational decline toward destruction or stop where they are and look for a way to change dir ections. H er ein lies the awakening process. The current choice that is offered by what has been called the “esoteric or new age” alternative lacks grounding in application of its principles within daily life. I t r equir es ignoring investigating and understanding the plan of the planetary controllers for “fear” of supporting them by recog- nizing their pr esence and actions. This “head in the sands” approach fails to appeal to the general population for it lacks practical application appeal.

This is particularly true because the sources for par-"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Becoming 45 ticipation comes from information perceived to be from beings whose teachings recommend disconnection from the apparent real world. Their teachings often are so idealistic as to leave their readers/followers feeling guilty and frustrated for they are unable to attain such levels within their current living situations. In the end, the ideals are abandoned. It is hoped that these messages contain information that guides its readers to concepts that contain practical challenges that uplift their desire for continued evolvement. It must be understood that this has to be accomplished within the practi- cality of the experience that is going on within what their 5 senses reflect as their present reality. The difficulty lies in accepting the fact that the inhabitants of earth are not alone in an inconceivably large galaxy. Thousands of visits have been made to this planet and hav e been plainly visible to extraordi- narily large numbers of people for literally thousands of years. It is totally amazing that this has been literally programmed out of the pr esent mass conscious awar eness. Aggr essive action has long been focused by the self-appointed controllers to block friendly, benevolent beings from direct interaction with humanity at large. This has been stepped up with the place- ment of powerful military capability into the hands of the human pawns. Again it is impor tant to understand the concept that this is for the purpose of “having humanity enslave itself.” As these messages circulate, a distillation process goes on continuously . The information is begun, put aside and then reread. Those that begin and complete it in a flow are few and far between. Reaching this point in assimilating the information has been accomplished by a very few. However, par ticipating in the pr ocess in a mor e leisur ely way does not indicate that this type of contribution is less effective. It is"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Becoming 46 accomplishment that is appropriate within the total pattern. Many will never read all the messages. Many will do so in a longer, on and off pattern of participation. It is the compos- ite of understanding that will bring about the necessary changes in the totality of understanding by the whole of humanity that is necessary. The entire process of reaching the minds, hearts and spir- its of those humans who have evolved despite the long stand- ing programs of control has been an ongoing focus of those of greater understanding among your Galactic brothers, sisters and cousins for a long time in your sequential counting. It has taken much effort on their part to create opportunities within the laws that they observe with care to assist whenever and wherever possible. The question arises as to why, if others bla- tantly disr egard those laws, are these beings so careful to observe them? Always remember that the basic law of attrac- tion works in its inimitable way. These beings know this and hav e no desir e to allo w their well-earned progress to be eroded in any way by forgetting this law. It may appear that those who ignore or break the Universal Laws that underlie the expression of potentiality into manifested experience gain b y doing so, however in the totality of it all, the piper will have to be paid. F or those of humanity that follo w thr ough on their desire to bring forth this change for this planet and themselves, much will be forgiven through the gift of “grace.” This is an oppor- tunity that is to be taken adv antage of b y those who are wise. The added difficulty of evolvement within such difficult cir- cumstances is being taken into consideration and value added for doing so.

That it contains some information that might be less than the total truth is plainly admitted. It was designed to bring its readers forward in an ongoing process of learning concepts and then leading each forward to accept others that opened new vistas of understanding. In rereading the material, contradictions will be found. It is hoped that those that do this will be able to understand the process and realize the purpose and methodology that was employed. The reeducation of an entire population is not an easy process when the basic understandings are purposefully con- tradictory in a planned and ongoing effort to cause conflict and separation between large numbers of people with incr edibly diverse cultural differences. To conceptualize the problem is to understand its prob- able impossibility, but that is exactly what the “controllers” ar e counting on. Let us make ev er y effort to surprise them. III-14 As the world situation evolves into greater and greater confusion and chaos, what is happening in the larger picture is impossible for the individual to perceive. Each can per- ceiv e only that por tion of the whole thr ough personal obser - vation and through what truthful media information is avail- able. This is further complicated by the filter of opinion, experience and feelings thr ough which each r eaches their o wn conclusions.

For what purpose is this being done if the abundance of “chemical weapons” would allow the annihilation of all or any portion of humanity at any time? If the human body is being deliberately debilitated through genetic food alter- ations, additives that are abrasive and destructive, diseases that are deliberately induced through vaccinations, destruc- tive medical practices, etc., to what end is all of this leading? It would appear that humanity is no different than the ani- mals that are demonically used as test subjects for the “good of humanity .” What then is to be the recipient of the “good” of the tests in which humans are the focus? In the larger pic- ture, are humans benefiting from the animal testing? F ollo wing that thought pattern, would anything of good be likely to result from the testing that is being carried out on human bodies? We again come back to the conclusion that this planet and its human population ar e but a virtual reali- ty game for those who consider themselves to be superior and in an “ o wnership ” position. We return to the conclusion that someone or some group is misusing their greater intel- ligence to perpetrate an injustice of great magnitude. The victim/abuser consciousness is being play ed out on a massiv e scale. Surely, it is time that outside intervention by the powers of “good” can intercede. Unfortunately that is not possible within the U niv ersal Laws that uphold all that has manifest - ed from potentiality into creation for the purpose of poten-"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Becoming 49 tiality knowing itself. All is held in continuity through the immutable laws that govern without deviation. If deviation would occur, all would end in chaos. How then is chaos of any kind allowed? It is here that we must return to a concept that is found within the creation process. Each of you expe- riences it in your life expression as breathing. Your physical expression depends on it. Without breath, your body can retain life but for a very short time. Within the expression of potentiality into manifested expression for the purpose of experiencing thought into wisdom, there is the necessity of investigating this process within self-awareness by various degrees of knowledge and wisdom. When an experience is complete or reaches a degree of imbalance, then it is neces- sary that it be dissolved. The energy is then made available to be r eused or recycled. This recycling process of dissolving and reusing this energy is called chaos and takes place in the larger reality in what might be compared to breathing. What is manifested, literally comes apar t into confusion and returns to energy that is available for reuse. There are as many patterns for this process as there are happenstances of cr eation; in other words it is unique each time it happens. The degree of chaos needed in order for the energy to be r eused is also unique to each cir cumstance. How much chaos is necessary for humanity to recreate its opportunity to evolve within a positive situation? That r emains to be determined b y humanity itself. It is obvious that the current situation has no way to progress without a return to chaos. Those who have evolved and those who have chosen to incarnate on this planet for the purpose of chang- ing the paradigm of experience on this planet hold the key within their conscious determination to play a leading role"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Becoming 50 within this drama that is playing itself out now. The deter- mination of who writes the final scenes for this current the- atre production is very much up to those present right now. It will not wait for another generation to pick up the task from another one that has ignored the responsibility and left it to the happenstance of “someone else” to do it. How much help can be contributed from the galactic community, it must again be pointed out depends on enough human beings rising above the victim focus and accepting responsibility. This is their only recompense. III-15 As the situation pr ogresses the intensity of the changes that will be experienced by each individual and by those of each culture will begin to become more apparent. Thus far, the changes hav e affected particular group experiences. However, as the warring factions become more widespread, individual experiences of chaos will expand correspondingly. Eventually there will be more areas of war and aftermath of war than ar eas of appar ent peace. I n other wor ds, this expe - rience will spread like a skin disease across the surface of the planet. In using the word war, that includes the usage of bio- logical agents as w ell as the usual destr uctiv e kinds of weaponry. It is difficult to understand what purpose all of this pain, misery and destruction of a beautiful planet can possibly ser v e. I t is in entering the obser vation mode of the larger pictur e that the true insanity that underlies the plan of the contr ollers becomes ob vious.

Indeed it is a possibility! It could be the cause of the end of an experiment birthed from poten- tiality that would be just another idea that didn’t work. It is something to contemplate. However, it is also possible that there is a counter balance for this type of freewill action that upon reaching a certain level of imbalance, an offsetting action is brought into play as a natural effect. If we continue to con- sider this from the prospective of the virtual reality game, there are always elements of surprise written into the game, not by the players, but by those that formulate the game in the first place. It may safely be assumed that the players in this game did not write the rules. That they are attempting to write new rules is apparent, but those do not supersede the rules that came with the game as brought into being in the first place. What ar e these surprises that cannot be overridden by new rules? Those can only be learned by playing the game. That is the point of all of these messages. All the players must play the game and sear ch for the strategies that will allow them to succeed and continue on in the game. The experiences of manifested life are never boring for those who sear ch for challenge by not allowing themselves to settle for what is given them, but strive to create what they desire. H o w ever, the Universal Laws must be observed in order that the progress made in the game is continuous in the long run. That does not mean that there will not be temporary set- backs thr ough err ors in choices, or that these choices will not be repeated until wisdom is gained through these repetitions. Thus, we find that humanity has placed its progress in the game of evolution in trusting that these controllers are their “ gods ’ ’ and that “ gods ’ ’ always ar e benev olent and have their best interest at heart or are fearsome and cruel and there"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Becoming 52 is no recompense that will buy off their wrath. It is time that humanity realize that in order to save themselves and their planetary home, it is time to take up the mantle of responsibil- ity and stand forth in their own power. In order to do this; fear must be put aside. Fear cannot be conquered. Those are words that tie humanity to what has held them in bondage. The very verbiage of the language contains programmed intimidation. Words of war such as conquer, vanquish, threaten, superior, force, intimidate, capitulate etc., etc. keep the focus on com- petition rather than co-operation. Mankind on planet earth will only transcend this situation when co-operation becomes the by-word of all interaction. Many experiences of a compet- itive nature can be experienced within the spirit of co-opera- tion, like sporting events, for they promote skills that are of use in other applications as w ell as in learning to appreciate the capabilities of the human body. It is contemplating how humans can stand forth in their o wn po w er that is the question. This is particularly true when considering the overwhelming organization and power that is being wielded by the controllers and their pawns. H owever, it is at the basis of this entire situation that the key is found. Humanity has allowed itself to be placed in a posi- tion in which it cannot match the opposing for ces chosen focus of power. It must now find a totally different approach. The one thing that a human possesses that cannot be taken away , though methodology is being dev eloped to attempt to do this, is the thought process. Even those that have experienced mind control techniques involving incred- ible experiences, are often able to regain their autonomy of thought. I t is the combined, co-operativ e focus on a simple concept that can and will place humanity beyond the situa-"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Becoming 53 tion that now surrounds it and threatens to overwhelm it. It is within the conscious choice to acknowledge the situation, leave victimhood behind and cooperatively focus on an ideal of experience that this power is available to mankind. When a consensus can arrive at this point, then a direct appeal can be made that will bring forth assistance and there will be an end to the current control of this planet. However, the vic- tim/abuser consciousness must be transcended or the process will be repeated until that knowledge becomes wisdom. Releasing victim consciousness will not be an easy transition for it is deeply ingrained within the population of this plan- et. It is an important element to be held in the forefront of future considerations. III-16 I t has been ingrained deeply within the consciousness of mankind that they are the servants of their “god” of the moment. Over the long space of time since mankind has been elevated into self-awareness those on this planet have been held in ser vitude and hav e been subject to the whims of the controller’s interactions between themselves. Further, as the manipulated progeny of these same beings, these attributes of contention and competition ar e a par t of this heritage. In truth and reality these deep-seated tendencies of competition and the use of violence to resolve the inevitable friction that r esults fr om this focus has ser v ed neither the contr ollers nor the enslaved. Both have remained over eons of sequential time stuck within the victim/abuser mode that has blocked both fr om ev olving. Failing to live in harmony within the Universal Laws"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Becoming 54 which includes living in harmony with the natural environ- ment of each home planet leads to the waste of its resources and eventual exhaustion of the ability to maintain life on it. The natural conclusion of that focus of experience is to look outside for another source to plunder. Earth is the source for those who have set that parameter at the basis of their pat- tern of experience. It is natural then for this same parameter to be the attitude promoted on its perceived colony. As these messages continue to contribute to greater understanding of the foundation upon which mankind devel- oped within a controlled and manipulated situation, it is hoped that those reading the information will come to understand their situation and their learned attitudes and understandings. In order to change deeply entrenched beliefs and experience, it is necessar y to see a clear picture of the present situation. Only then can a true decision be made as to whether this is the path that is desired to be continued or if it is time to stand forth within personal decision and change the course of human his - tory by writing each one’s own history and so the history of humanity. For eons of time, each generation has accepted the parameters of experience that has been thr ust upon them and waited to be led out of bondage. I t has been said, “ when the people lead, the leaders will follow.” This has not proved to be true, as each time it has been an isolated group that has attempted rebellion only to be dev astated b y weaponry that instilled even greater fear within them. This resulted because they attempted to stand forth using the same competitive, war techniques that had been taught them by example. Their purpose was to create an impr o v ed v ersion of the life they w er e leading, with again another “leader” to guide them to a Utopian societal experi-"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Becoming 55 ence. This in truth would have been simply a better version of the usual victim/abuser experience, temporarily. Even if a benevolent leader were chosen, the history of the influence of power in the following familial generations through the competition of the offspring has inevitably led to despotism. Thus there has been the hopeful expectation that better leadership would be provided by short-term election of leaders from among the people. In this way it was thought that the inheritance of power and the competition between heirs would be eliminated. It should be obvious that this method of choosing leaders has not provided a better solu- tion. Always the people have abdicated their individual power through desiring leadership/government to act as their shepherd or parent. What was desired was a larger experience of the family . A benevolent super being, a benevolent leader, and a benevolent parent, with the power vested in the masculine gender. What has been lost is self- r eliance within the balance of both masculine and feminine unique characteristics. Mankind has little if any faith in the unique distribution of characteristics and talents that if allo wed to exhibit indi- vidually would bring forth a composite that would birth the desir ed U topian experience. A t the basis of this experience would lie the spirit of cooperation. The question that arises immediately is how this could possibly even begin within the pr esent situation of separation, hate, distr ust, etc., etc. Herein lies the wisdom of the breakdown and chaos that is inevitable when circumstances reach a level at which the cur- rent situation can no longer maintain itself. An apple rotten at the cor e must disintegrate. Thus the comparison is ob vi - ous. In the midst of chaos, groups will come together in"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Becoming 56 cooperation for the purpose of survival. If there are enlight- ened ones among these groups with understanding and fore- sight, these can begin a new experiment that suits the mem- bers and the group focus. They must not lead, but only advise and promote the new experiment. If there are enough of these groups all focused upon this new concept of human existence, all understanding the history and the need to leave the past in the past, there is hope for a new paradigm of experience for this planet. Difficult as it is to accept, not all of humanity will be able to participate in the bringing forth of this concept. All that incarnate on this planet understand this before doing so. To all, the opportunity to experience manifested reality is worth the experience of it. Much wisdom is gained and despite the limited understanding no w held by the mass con- sciousness, is worth the experience. Though humanity dreams of attaining immortality within the body, that too carries with it r esponsibilities that counterbalance per ceiv ed advantages. That known as self-awareness is immortal. To add to it a body that is immortal includes dimensions bey ond the ability to understand by mind/brains that are not fully active. It is a situation of first things first. III-17 As the situation continues to develop, the picture becomes mor e confusing fr om the perspectiv e of humanity , ho wever from the greater perspective, it appears as move- ment or change.

None of you are asked to be anything but human in your reactions other than to know the truth of what the bigger picture indi- cates. It is by moving through situations rather than resisting them or ignoring them that experience becomes wisdom. If experience is denied, then the opportunity to gain wisdom is lost. The knowledge of the history of humanity’s birth into self-aware beings, the addition of other families of humans to the mix and the constant interference and prevention of evolvement by the controllers have contributed to the con- fusion and frustration of those of you who are present now. W ithout the understanding of who and what you are, there is little hope for change. This is the reason that this infor- mation has been deliberately destroyed, withheld, or misin- terpr eted. The av ailable historical information is presented in different ways because of different interpretations of the documents and artifacts. This has happened partly through deliberate intent and sometimes because of bias and igno - rance. It is thus important that more than one source be sear ched in or der that each individual can discern those aspects of truth contained in each. Again the conclusions may vary, but enough of the truth will be discerned by each to r each far mor e intelligent understandings of the total sit- uation.

The fact that the colonizers knowingly gave this ability to the beings that were already present on their arrival makes the situation even more objectionable on moral and ethical basis. To further complicate matters, it is the responsibility of the inhabitants to prove that they have the ability to govern themselves and to steward their planet by changing the situation through their own freewill decision. They must discern how to accomplish this within the Universal Laws and, in this case, despite largely not knowing what these specifically are. Most know that the system that surrounds them is orderly and must be to contin- ue, but what supports that orderliness is an unknown. Searches for this orderliness are convoluted into theories of origin that ar e of little or no importance in understanding how it operates. The simplicity of the Universal Laws escapes the under- standing of scientists who thrive on complications. Simple as they ar e the div ersity and interactions within the application of them cause confusion when the search is for the cause behind the effects. It is so much more efficient to begin with the cause or the laws in their simplest form and then follo w their effects forward into experience. The written/spoken enumeration of the laws is fully suppor ted mathematically . I t is important to begin at the beginning. The big bang theory does not allow for understanding to be elicited from a holo- graphic pr ocess for it is again a sear ch from manifestation back to cause. The diversity available within holographic parameters is so encompassing that to find the cause within its available infinite variety is to be compared with finding the needle in the haystack. The process of layering information adds to a greater"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Becoming 59 understanding of the whole in which mankind on this plan- et finds itself. It builds a holographic understanding that enables those who study this material to change their ability to perceive and discern more of who and what they are and to know more about the controllers. There are many more incredible facts that are available to be known. The question is, “how much is essential in order to bring forth the neces- sary decisions that will free this planet from the situation in which it is mired?” There is a point at which further infor- mation becomes more detrimental than helpful. It is the search for this point that brings forth these messages. It is hoped that commitment and action in the application of the suggestions included will signal the end of the need for more information. At the basis of all action is the transition of consciousness and the decision to answ er the call to respon- sibility that has been ignored and refused for so long by the composite group on this planet.

When the information available is considered from the largest perspective possible, the evidence of the presence of the controllers on this planet and their influence in the his- tory of mankind is glaringly evident. The further evidence that their presence has been deliberately ignored and pur- posefully withheld from humanity is obvious. This is further supported by the “sightings” of craft capable of interplane- tary travel that have not only been experienced and reported by people now: reports of it happening all through recorded history have been found by those researchers that have cho- sen to investigate this area. Personal memorabilia and news- paper r eports offer conclusive support. There are too many reports from the past to be considered hoaxes because there was too little exchange of communication to allow for a wave of suggestion to cause imagined encounters. What puzzles and confuses the average person experi- encing the multi-media programmed information being for ce fed to them is why on the one hand “alien presence’’ is promoted, and on the other denied at the same time. It accomplishes its exact purpose, confusion. The mind on one hand wonders at its possibility and yet is supported in its denial because such presence threatens all that has been taught o v er the millennia. The presence of this influence that has totally affected the lives of humanity since before their self-awareness was given to them, has always been the cause of great trauma and mass annihilation of segments of the population.

In all truth, without outside influences such as cosmic cycle completions and information such as these messages, the desire to leave these behind and to move forward into creating the opportunity of a new paradigm of experience would not be available for a long time in your sequential counting. The concern and support of humanity by cosmic/galactic fellow citizens have been focused in answer to those who have asked within their prayers and supplications for a longer period of time than most people realize. It is that within the laws, as has been mentioned over and over in these messages, only a certain amount of help can be given, for those who have progressed beyond the level of earth’s consciousness cannot give direct assistance without inv olving themselves within the rescuer/victim/abuser expe- rience. Only those volunteers who are willing to risk for the sake of humanity have made this decision. W ithin the confusion of the conflicting information regarding outside presence and its influence in the ongoing history of this planet is the opportunity for the seeds of truth to be planted and to gr ow into acceptance of the long denied truth of humanity’s real history.

Once discerned and believed it can spread quickly and then, as you put it, the jig will be up . The pieces of the puzzle are present, however few have put them all together into a discernable whole.

It is your particular source and it is a personal decision as to whether to accept it as tr uth and also a decision as to its v alue. Each individual deter - mines whether or not a decision is made to accept an active role and continue its expansive spread. The future of life on this planet depends on these individual decisions.

Inasmuch as what is actu- ally happening within the holistic interaction is observed in a sequential fashion by those of you that are within the expe- rience, it is difficult for you to comprehend the true pro- gression of the process. This is further complicated for what is known of the true happenings is given only in part and in distorted fashion. Thus humanity is left to grope through the experience. Only through the decision to create a new expe- rience and the further decision to keep the attention focused on the desired outcome rather than the unknowable current situation, an increasing amount of energy will be directed into the manifestation of the new paradigm. As the chaos accelerates those who have the desire for this new “dream” of existence as an ideal or archetype will find it will provide a focus of stability that will become mor e and more attractive within their thought processes.

The need to have concepts and principle analyzed by breaking them down into minute details diverts the energy of them and allows for divergent trips into dead end ventures. The wast- ed effort these adventures involve can be limited and often avoided altogether by intuiting the proper direction a focus can follow to reach the intended goal. The process of literal- ly feeling out the direction that is appropriate through imagery also allows for each to ascertain the appropriate group each feels offers greater growth opportunities. Within the practice of freedom of choice, much progress is available to the individual and this flows outward into the gr oup and to the totality of the whole.

Thus the mind is stretched during the consideration of this concept and its possibilities of expres- sion. It then becomes conceivable to realize that mankind has been limited to an incredibly narrow and controlled pattern of experience within unlimited possibility. As this pattern of experience is purposefully compressed into an even more confined and restricted ability to express, the freedom to evolve becomes even more remote. This greater restriction produces an energy crisis both individual- ly and collectively. This causes the restrictive boundaries to be necessarily more and more heavily controlled. When the number of beings on the planet is considered, it is under- standable that plans are laid to reduce that number and that the choices of the intended survivors have very selective pro- files. I n order to choose these survivors, a great deal must not only be known about the ideal but also about which groups offer the most prototypical candidates. Since the tiniest of details can expand into pr oblems in the futur e, the genetics are most important in these selections. It is difficult if not impossible for most humans on the planet to comprehend the detail of genetic information that is av ailable now for this selection process. The limited brain/mind cannot comprehend the amount of kno wledge that is accessible to the pr ocesses of the fully active brain/mind. The potentiality of the brain/mind is in direct proportion to the mathematical odds for the possi- bilities that ar e latent within the galactic matrix.

The awareness is the immortal undeniable focus that is free to search for its ultimate expression within the incalculable potential available. That is its birthright. However, how it is to do this is within its own freewill choic- es. There are holistic levels of self-awareness that are not known to the human mind, and that is emphatically acknowledged here and now. The understanding of this wholeness of the self-aware unit of which the human is a part has been hinted at, but requires an expansion of the brain/mind function in order for it to be assimilated. Access to the necessary understanding of the greater aspects of human experience hinges on transcendence through the vic- tim consciousness into personal r esponsibility. Again this is a repeat of the theme of lifting the consciousness from the degradation brought about by dependence on dogmatic leadership .

Within this system, there is no true freedom for mankind to determine who and what they are. There is no freedom to understand that the “God’’ con- cept as taught is one perpetrated for one purpose only, to enslave and control beings that have the potential of becom- ing totally equal to and surpassing the evolvement of those who ar e foisting this enslaving situation on the humans liv- ing on this planet.

What appears to be chaotic to the participants is a well planned strategy to keep the inhabitants in a state of confusion so that there will be no organization by them to exchange information in a real way toward an understanding of what is their intended future. It is imperative that a portion of mankind think careful- ly through these messages and come to see the logic and sense of them. These awake and aware people must then begin to actively share this information with all that have the ability to stretch their awareness to understand and accept these concepts through logical thinking and to begin to become aware that the potential of personal power far exceeds their victim reticence. Further they must understand that this personal po wer need not and must not be measured in aggressive tendencies, but in the measure of mental, emo- tional and spiritual focus. It is important to understand that the spiritual focus is not that of the traditional “ r eligions ” toward a benevolent or malevolent “God’’ outside of the Self. Each must come to understand that their power rests in the r ecognition that each has the opportunity to participate within the consciousness of galactic citizenship that con- tributes to the composite of ho w the cr eativ e expansive ener- gies of potentiality are directed either toward positive or neg- ative group experience.

It is this goal that underlies the purpose of these messages. It is this change in consciousness that can be the catalyst that can bring about change and the end to the extremely negative experience that has held this planet and others within its web. These mes- sages are but part of an organized effort to awaken humani- ty on this planet. By opening to the possibility that the infor- mation contains Truth with a capital “T” it is possible to begin to find verification of it through other published mate- rial. It must be remembered that available information is published through the perception and prejudice of the per- sonal interpretation of the authors. Thus contradictions will be found. Truth can be perceived as existing at the center of a circle with opinion and interpretation focused on it from 360 degrees of observation. It does exist and the more degr ees fr om which it is obser ved, the clearer the perception of it becomes. It is the openness to its existence that allows for the clarity and understanding of what is the Truth that is grasped. That mankind was purposefully pushed along its path of ev olv ement for r easons of servitude are at the basis of under- standing the situation the inhabitants of this planet find themselves in at this moment. What must be further under- stood is that the gift of self-awar eness allo ws mankind to understand they are not limited to this servitude.

Each must however, accept the gift and move into the available citizenship and accept not only its benefits, but its responsibilities by first real- izing and accepting the true situation that surrounds them and deciding it is time to change it, not some time in the future, but now. There are now available shifts in cycles and other coincidental phenomena to support the necessary change in consciousness. These will assist humanity if the wisdom to take advantage of this perfect time for change is utilized. III-21 The time to prepare for the adversities to come is now. What can be done? I t is imperative that each begins not with the outer concerns but with that which is within. By that, it is meant that each must come into the realization that the attitude and opinions about who and what each one is must be the basis. It must be fully understood that time and con- sent are the two necessary ingredients to be contributed by each. The time is now and the consent is to accept a total change in the understanding of who and what each of y ou are. Each is to begin by opening to the idea that virtually all that has been taught with regard to the past, present and futur e of all of humanity on this planet has been a deception. It is necessary to accept as true reality that which has been told as myth, that which has been denied and what has been pr edicted/pr ophesied as the inevitable futur e.

It requires rethinking most awareness processes. The training to ask permission to literally exist is begun at the earliest stages of development and is presently programmed into virtually every focus of ongoing life expe- rience. Once the truth of the deception is accepted, then the change of belief is met in each day’s myriad small decisions. Each momentary choice must be examined in the beginning to determine if it is influenced by personal inner knowing- ness regarding its appropriateness in light of the new foun- dation for understanding. The right to personal decision as to what to do carries with it the choice not only as to the appropriateness with regard to the person making it, but also with regard to how the decision will affect those to whom the effects will ripple outwar d and touch. This requires the acceptance of responsibility with regard to a larger picture. The effects can no longer be transferred to the “power” that formerly was r esponsible for granting the desir e and must be accepted by the individual making the decision. The effects of the decision must be accepted and born by the decision- maker . Thus the acceptance to participate in the creation of a new picture of human experience entails the process of maturation into citiz enship rather than subor dination to an overseeing entity. Through the careful consideration of this concept it can be seen that acceptance of the disadvantages of “ slav ery” has also had the advantage of ducking the responsibilities that taking control of one’s own experience carries with it.

The most important will be found within their own con- scious awareness, for it will be there that the decisions will be made that determine the outcome of humanity’s future for a very long time to come. The coordination of cosmic cycles that are available to assist in this epic consciousness change will not be available to assist again for a long time in linear counting. The focus of awareness by cosmic/galactic forces will allow the mass conscious decision by humanity to rule its future and turn their attention elsewhere. Earth’s human population has this opportunity to mature and grow into greater evolvement, but it will not be forced upon them. The opportunity is just that, an opportunity offered. It must be accepted and acted upon in or der to bring about the changes that are available. It cannot be accomplished by only a few, but those few must spread their understandings with con- cer ted effor t and z eal in order that the necessary quotient can be reached. It will not be easy. It cannot be put off any longer or left for someone else to accomplish. The window of oppor tunity will remain open for a mathematically exact time and when it closes, it simply closes. If it does, the future of ear th ’ s inhabitants and the planet is bleak indeed. Both will continue to be exploited without mercy. The influence of forces from outside this planet and this solar system underlie all that is happening on this planet. This is a posi - tive given.

But this goes unde- tected because the larger picture is obscured by deception from the awareness of the most educated and supposedly informed. The lack of the ability to put all of the puzzle pieces together into a coherent and logical picture leaves confusion as the only available conclusion to all but a few. The neces- sity to continue to enlarge the picture beyond what even the most informed and analytical minds have done holds the truth beyond understanding. The picture is very, very large indeed. As has been said, “truth is stranger than fiction.” Even the most imaginative science fiction writers have not grasped the reality of what is the true picture. It is important that this large picture become known and it can only become kno wn when earth’s people, one by one, accept the truth of victim consciousness being the first layer of the foundation that must be torn out and replaced. It must be replaced with the understanding that humans on this planet ar e not sec - ond class citizens. Claiming the ownership and governing of their planet is their rightful inheritance. It is their duty and their r esponsibility. The planet rightfully belongs to its citizens, not to those of another planet or solar system. I n or der to contr ol their own planet, earth’s citizens must control their own attitude and thoughts about themselves. They must know themselves to be wor thy of self decision without permission fr om other beings or imaginary “god or gods.” This requires courage and the ability to respond to challenges.

The results of the decisions to be made by the readers of these messages are critical not only for those doing the reading, but for the future generations of humanity on this planet for a long time to come, if, indeed, there are to be any future generations. This will depend upon which of the vying forces may indeed win out if humanity drops the ball. III-22 There are areas of focus that the human mind is totally unaware would serve in the change of direction from sub- servience to freedom of choice. Where the mind is focused determines where the totality of experience will arrive. When the awareness is bombarded with a confusion of ideas and experiences, the holding of a single or singularly coordinat- ed gr oup of ideas, thoughts, opinions and desir es becomes difficult indeed. It does not require the effort of what is termed concentration, but does require the broader and mor e easily managed process of focus. Focus allows for peripheral awareness of events and information that can be noticed and allowed for short-term inclusion without dilut- ing or taking away from the intended direction of the intent of the overall focus. It allows participation within the cur- r ently per ceiv ed r eality while y et holding in the awareness the intended direction of desire, of intended purpose. Humanity must first allow itself to accept the possibility that it is their bir thright to ste war d this planet and manage their o wn ev olv ement without inter fer ence or dir ection fr om outsiders. Once that possibility is allowed to take root, the desir e for this experience will grow within the awareness, for"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Becoming 75 it is well established within the psyche. It is latent, or buried under the mind control programming that has been layered within the social and religious structures on a worldwide basis for thousands of years. This entire program of control (literally) surrounds mankind’s understanding of itself like a tough skin. It is necessary to literally squirm within this skin of deceptive understanding and shed all of it in order to per- ceive and create a new experience. If this were not possible, then there would be no necessity to place so many layers of false information into the minds and to hold it there through intimidation and fear. This need for control at all cost is the clue that the armor is fragile and that the fear of the controllers is far greater than your own. If mankind dis- covers its power and its true heritage, there is no answer for them but to destr oy all but a few and to begin through intimidation to rebuild the population based on the same deception and fear program. Try as these beings have, it is not possible for them to change the necessar y DNA pr o - grams to reverse the evolvement and return mankind to a more animal like being. I n reality, mankind’s saving grace at this moment is the number of outside influences that are vying for control of this planet. I ndeed, ther e is mor e than one. Is earth that valuable? It is the competition for supremacy that is the important point insofar as the outside interests are con- cerned. Each has their influenced faction among the deceived. And deceive you they must with clever and decep- tive techniques. For those awake and aware human beings, it is possible to perceive these as factions vie for control.

There is conflict and competition between various warring factions so that if discernment is practiced the con- tention and factions are obvious. Many of the visions and esoteric prophetic experiences being reported are nothing more than another form of mind control. When these prophesies include future Utopian life without responsibili- ty, beware. What is important to these factions is which one can win the prize, regardless of the condition of the prize at the end of another phase of history. Meanwhile, mankind has the opportunity to sleep on amid this virtual reality game or to awaken, stand forth in its own awareness and claim the prize, the planet, right out from under the warring factions’ noses. They need only to come forth into personal and group awareness of their birthright and collectively stand for th in declaration and ask for help from that point of con- sciousness and it will be given! The key is that mankind must evolve to a point of matu- rity that indicates the ability to accept galactic citiz enship . To be a planet of full-fledged citizenship, earth must be self-gov- erned. Otherwise, this planet is considered a colony, avail- able to be o wned and ruled by outsiders. Until humanity is ready to be responsible for itself and its planet, it cannot par- ticipate in the galactic family . Then it must decide betw een being a positive or negative expression. Both experiences exist. Difficult as that is to accept, that is how it is. Help is av ailable, but only on a consulting basis. Citiz enship hinges on and results in total self-responsibility. It is not a case of aggression versus regression. It is aggression versus progres- sion. Earth has been caught up in the process of rule and contr ol b y negativ e, stuck expr essions of the expansiv e ener - gies of potentiality. If this opportunity to change the situa-"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Becoming 77 tion is taken advantage of, then the decision must be made to simply continue that which has been the victim side of the coin by expressing the other side through aggression and abuse as you have been used, or to indeed create a new par- adigm of experience. As has been mentioned before, when citizenship is a real- ity through a quorum of humans declaring their indepen- dence and self-responsibility, then the opportunity to observe and receive consultation on what other expressions of positive experience are currently in practice will be avail- able. The space in sequential time to synthesize the new par- adigm will be given and protection will be provided. Only a framework need be idealized. The proof of the pudding will be in the individual personal changes demonstrated by those humans that ar e able to shed the skin of manipulation and deception. These must walk their talk, so to speak and live their conviction of personal and group self-responsibility. It goes bey ond a change of mind to living the conviction. Where does one go when there is no capricious god to direct one’s wishes, desires and fears toward? Can that empty place that was once filled b y the “God” perceived to give and take, answer or not answer, hear or not hear, depending on whim ev er be filled again. I ndeed! N ow is the time to remember the Laws of the Universe and to read them again and to practice them. Each must become the god in their liv es, for the laws ar e the premise of life expression. The mes- sages are written so that each time they are read a different perception is received, more is understood and the desire to experience real freedom is kindled.

These are people who are most sincere and have no idea that it is arriving in forms of thought manipulation. The elements of truth give credence to that part of each that must have verification in order that the messages are accepted. Much is known as to the way the human psyche functions. The ar t of manipulation of the mind/brain/body-coordinat- ed functions is well understood. Those that are concerned with perfecting these technologies have much experience in this ar t for it has long been practiced on beings of lesser evolvement. Because of the free will element and the adapt- ability of the DNA of humans on this planet, this branch of mankind has pr oven to be a frustrating challenge to those intent on restricting and reversing the natural evolvement process. The frustration is twofold. Not only does this make humanity difficult to control, but these beings find there are elements of evolvement present that they desire to incorpo- rate into their o wn life expr ession. H o w ever, thus far, most have not been able to accept the desired changes within their own strands of DNA. Some changes have been accepted, but not the ones most desir ed b y them.

All players but one in the larger picture have had control of the planet at one time or another. The only player that has not had control is human- ity itself. The others want the control of the planet and its inhabitants now. The winning of the competition between them is as important as the prize. Unfortunately, the physi- cal resources of the planet are of more importance than the inhabitants are. Thus in the final confrontations, if the pop- ulation cannot be controlled, and in order to gain the prize, it is necessary to destroy them, it would be done. Further, considering the technological development of those game players, what chance does humanity have to come through this scenario? To answer that question, it is necessary to return to the basic fundamentals as giv en at the beginning of these mes- sages. The 4 Laws of the Universe govern all potentiality in expression. Thus it can be observed that those that vie for the contr ol of this planet hav e drawn to themselv es others that also vie for the same thing. The inhabitants of earth, at this moment, are not involved in that same focus. When and if the inhabitants of ear th focus cooperatively and decide to take ownership of their own planet for the purpose of creat- ing a ne w paradigm of experience, they ar e r emoved from the scenario. If they choose to change their perception from victim to self-responsibility for the use of the expansive ener- gies of potentiality , then the pictur e changes.

While humanity is caught up in the games of others and refuses to see itself as a prize in a giant game of one-upman- ship, it cannot free itself. It is of primary concern that this picture be given to them in order to see the illusion that has been fed to them for the purpose of keeping them under control while the players continue to vie for overall owner- ship. The power players are evenly matched; thus each move is so decisive that sequential time is of no importance. The life spans of these players range from virtual immortality to generational changes in which the focus is locked in so that life span length makes no difference to the final outcome. It would be easy for those humans who do awaken and accept the tr uth of the bigger picture to feel themselves so insignif- icant as to have little if any power to change the situation. In truth, they are the only ones in the scenario that do have the po w er to change it. The other players are so locked into their side of the victim/abuser expression that the chances of their changing that perspective are slim to nothing. Humanity has been calling for help , begging the very “gods” who have per- petrated this situation on them, to get them out of it. What chance is ther e that these beings will do that? N one! The human beings becoming on this planet, if they are to become now, must do this for themselves. They must accept who and what they ar e, learn of the existence of the basic Laws of the Universe that have been denied them, put them into practice and create their own new expression of potentiality.

Because of the flow of energies that are now focused within the magnetic field of the earth and those thought energies that are available, a mental and emotional discom- fort is being experienced by many. These feelings and under- standings that something is out of the ordinary are motivat- ing these people to search for a cause and an end to this uncomfortable state. It might be said that cosmic burrs are being planted so as to get the attention of those who are energetically yet outside the level of submissive indoctrina- tion. These are the ones who will find and read these mes- sages and identify with the content and its purpose. The search for the cause and the solution will end with the read- ing. Then will begin the commitment to a purpose that calls for fulfillment in a way that is difficult to ignore. Once the seeds of a purpose are ingrained within the awareness, it roots and becomes aware of opportunities to express and par ticipate within its expr ession.

As the laws begin to act and interact with and within each other, the process of thought thinking begins, thus opportunities and synchronicities begin to be incorporated into the experience of those hold- ing the intended focus in their consciousness. It is critical that those in the beginning phases hold the general intention of creating change through their own desire to do so. Out of this intention will blossom the birth of this new experience. Mankind has been held in bondage and ignorance long enough. There are enough evolved humans present now on this planet who desire to take responsibility for the present and future of this planet to focus this intention into a new reality. It is a matter of getting the truth of the situation into their awar eness and offering them a solution that does not require them to sacrifice their life experience to the inten- tions of other detrimental plans for humanity. It merely r equir es that they change their attitudes and understand that they are the rightful owners of their own planet, provided they are willing to be responsible citizens of it and of the galaxy of which it is par t.

Now they despoil yours to continue their same pattern. Careful study of documented information and studied conclusions now available in printed form, leads the dis- cerning individual/group to the inevitable conclusion that indeed something is very wrong. It is time to change the sce- nario for the sake of humanity and to end the literal rape of this earthly domain that is the heritage and birthright of those whose home it is by birth and by adoption.

Doubt is a normal human trap, but when the desire for change is deeply felt and held in mental and emo- tional confidence, it must manifest.

It is up to the self to attain that desire through the application of those laws for the self and in cooperation with others. Thought properly intended thinks and acts through to completion if properly held in mental and emotional focus for positive change. Focus is “lightly” held by the mind. If you intend for your body to move from one room to the other, it simply does by acting on your intentional motivation for it to do so. It acts entirely within the Universal Law of Intention into manifested action. It is not even a conscious thought, it is an intended action, and it happens. The subtlety of this example demonstrates the power of intention that is “lightly held” but is yet confi- dently expected to happen. It would be well for this example to be contemplated and car efully understood. III-25 It is necessary for those who choose to become involved in this process to make a firm commitment to change the perspectiv e thr ough which their life experience is vie w ed, remembering that the perspective chosen is in accordance with the type of view that is available within each one’s per- sonal attitude.

Through this change in attitude, what is known as judge- ment becomes choices. It allows for others to observe and choose and it encourages the self to quest for more per- spectives and a broadened experience. The allowance for other possibilities to exist expands the life experience and brings the being into the flow of expansive energy that is the source of “All That Is” as it understands Itself through knowledge acquired and lived into wisdom through indi- vidual experience. It is difficult to comprehend that each life experience contributes to the composite that differentiates itself so that it can then gather those scattered experiences back into itself in a meaningful way. It can only be interpreted through intelligent beings obser ving their experiences and drawing conclusions, which is another way of saying experiencing knowledge acquired into the wisdom of understanding. This happens in both separated, individual experience and con - clusions as well as group and mass group experience data gathered and processed. The “mind” intelligence capable of doing this is bey ond the scope of its finite awareness to com- prehend. It is only necessary to be aware that the process is par t and par cel of who and what each is. I nfinite possibility is constantly being contemplated and investigated. Each and all are the instruments through which this process is going on. Thus it is impor tant to understand there is no “sin” or error, only experience to be lived into the wisdom of under- standing and infinity in which to do it.

There must be an under- standing and application of those laws by the requesting group before it is possible to give the assistance. When considering these messages, it is possible to see the tight circle of circumstance within which humanity on this planet finds itself locked. It is possible to see it as a wheel of existence from which there has been no escape and to under- stand why those who prefer this planet to remain as a colony rather than an independent self determining unit have employed all possible means to arrange this.

It is to be noticed how often those who have “outlived” their usefulness, and know the inner workings of the conspiracy to contr ol, seem to come to inter esting ends.

The solution lies in the abil- ity of Earth’s evolved human residents to lay claim to their planet by their own recognizance, for unknown to them, theirs is the first right of refusal. Colonization by outsiders is only possible through their permission, in this case by default through ignorance of their own ability to claim it and for the most part ignorance that they are a colony at all. Considering the carefully documented historical evidence of alien presence on this planet for millennia that is now avail- able in print and the myriad of “UFO” sightings, how this foreign presence goes without understanding is illogical and beyond comprehension by all outside observers.

This would result in those of like desire joining in this expression of intent and purpose in thought. Through the thought focus of this desire and the intent for this to become a reality for the good of the true citizens of this planet and the physical planet itself, the Universal Laws would begin to operate. The thought and emotional desire would begin to attract a greater thought process and energies would begin to coagulate into ev ents and circumstances that would support this process. The key is not in acting out resistance to the current appar ent situation, cir cumstances and appar ent events, but in focusing on the desired outcome. The act of holding the desired outcome within an emotional field of desire for the envisioned outcome is the application of the Law of Allowance. This is the most difficult of all of the Laws to apply , for the ev ents that ar e happening will still reflect the expression of the established process until the focus of the desired outcome begins to influence the total picture. The pr ocess of the two situations must ev olve into a chaotic dis- solution of the established process before the desired new process can begin to manifest into reality.

To indicate that the above statement is true, it is only necessary to avail oneself of the now abundant material available on the internet, talk radio and many published revelations of conspiracies that subju- gate the citizens of all countries through drugs, intimidation and war as well as physical, mental and emotional abuse. The deliberate attacks on the moral, familial and religious beliefs at the basis of human experience ar e now beyond the logical acceptance of a mind that is not already separated from its ability to logic and analyze data clearly.

Thus it is the wise who begin to assist themselves through choice to assist Nature in surviving by carefully deciding what foods and other products are allowed into and on their body, and further, what programming is allowed into their awareness. Almost all media is programmed contrary to the highest and best good of those who regularly expose them- selves to it. It does help to be aware of its purpose and decide to take from it only that which serves the highest and best good. It is wise to remember that too much media input overwhelms even the most adept at choosing what serves and does not serve them. Media includes music as well as spoken and pictur ed presentations.

Except for those who are committed to the agenda of the negative forces, these will be creating the necessary chaos that will allow for change. Therefore, it is necessary that those who contribute to that aspect of the change be released from any judgement on the par t of the creative group and allowed to make the contri- bution that is within their ability to do. Since many of those unable to allow themselves join in the creative focus will be friends and family , this will make it difficult for the “ground crew” to stay focused and to “allow” them to contribute to the chaos.

What is happening will be difficult to ascertain in the begin- ning and will appear in synchronistic occurrences that will not always be recognized. Further, once the momentum of people reading and resonating with the messages and the desir e for a new human experience begins to multiply, allow- able contributions by galactic neighbors can begin to mani- fest in further help. There will be those who simply begin to attune to the concept, as it becomes subtly av ailable within the mass consciousness, and begin to add their desire for a new experience without knowing about the messages.

The heroes, sung and unsung, of the new paradigm will be those who can commit, grasp the understanding of applying the basic Universal Laws and allow them to bring forth the desired goal through the breakdown and formation process. There will be no instant gratification. It will not happen overnight. The plan to dehumanize the population of this planet is too well established to be changed quickly . But, focused desire and purposeful intent can change it!

The time for the ground crew to redou- ble its effort and continue on is now. Hold the desire clearly in mind and sense the movement of the Universal Laws as they support humanity and be aware that there are many galactic fellow citizens that are awaiting the time to be of greater help when it is allowable. There are many cooperative facets that support this thrust for humanity to regain the right to determine its own destiny that are unknown. The ground crews are unaware of each other , however, what each does supports the others and the plan as a whole. There is a plan, of that you can be sure!

However. when those who are aware, no matter how few by comparison to the number inhabiting the planet, come together in agreement as to this choice, the balance of power is changed. This is even more powerful when these concert- ed foci are aligned within the action of the Laws of the Universe. It is to be remembered that when the action of one group involves interfering with the freedom to evolve of another gr oup, this is in conflict with the natural flow of creative expansion of the galactic/universal environment. A plan that is in conflict with the creative flow requires constant atten- tion and management in or der to maintain itself for ther e is no interactive creative thought to correlate the facets of activity into a naturally cohesive thrust into manifestation.

The orig- inating group will have no way to ascertain this point and so must initiate and continue to hold the desire and intention in place through the greater portion of the process lest they withdraw in over confidence before that unknowable point is reached. Desire and intention have been stressed many times, how- ever there is action also required. Physical resistance to the overwhelming forces of those who intend to intensify their o verseer roles is pointless and futile. Those that intend to change the destiny of this planet and its inhabitants must direct their action toward the spread of the concepts of manifesting the ne w paradigm.

This process is already beginning. The degree to which commit- ment is made and held as the subsequent events unfold will determine greatly to what extent the planet will need to cleanse itself. This commitment involves the shedding of the victim stance and the willingness to claim earth citizenship, including the responsibilities that this will involve. There can be no looking back, no blaming for the past and present experience, and decisions will have to be made with regard to repairing the damage to the planet.

However, this shift is accessed thr ough the freewill choice that is innate within each evolving human.

The point is, there is available a reser- voir of talent with exceptional abilities.

It is to be recognized that the spiritual aspect of self has little to do with the standard religious affiliation that is pushed upon the average person. What satisfaction is found by most has more to do with the victim stance requiring a promise of a res- cue connection than in actually finding spiritual fulfillment within the religious dogma programmed into their conscious- ness. In the search for more understanding of the empty feel- ings within them they are stuffed with more dogma and mis- understood information, and fe w ever find true satisfaction except by intuiting beyond the available concepts.

The functional brain of humans has had its activity purposefully lowered to prevent the movement toward freedom that these messages are designed to initiate. It is important that those who take this information seriously and intend to become part of the cooperative creative focus also intentionally begin to exercise their mental capacities.

It is through their application and understanding with the “knowledge” that they indeed do work along with the understanding of “thought thinking” as they move from focus and intent into real experience the application of them will become natural. It will take no more concentrated effort to apply them on a continuing basis than it does to decide to get up fr om a chair and move to the door or wherever else you intend without actually applying concentrated thought.

Learning through application to hold the intent “lightly” without attempt- ing to force its creation but again in “knowing” the valid- ity of the process allows for “practice makes perfect.” There is a great difference in the application and con- cepts of wanting, believing and knowing. Wanting only cre- ates more wanting, believing only says that one thinks the process will work, while “knowing” accomplishes the inten- tion. It is the degree of difference gained by the actual expe- rience of “ seeing” the application work that allows for the “knowing” to become accepted and applied with ease. The first attempts at application must be reasonable and believ- able in or der to r each the “kno wable” level of acceptance. The nuances of these concepts are important to contem- plate, bringing the understanding that deliberately applying the concepts of these laws may not be an easy task in the beginning. Thus to choose a single application with which to test the theories is of primar y impor tance. I t is the habit of man to want everything at once and to fail to take a new process slowly and deliberately. The learning of the applica- tion of the Laws is much like stringing beads, one at a time. What is challenging is to hold the concept to be manifested clearly in mind without adding nuances to it that complicate and slow or in fact halt, the entire process because of unnec- essar y detail. Again, thought thinks and often cr eates a far more grand application than the finite mind can conceive."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Becoming 106 The energies of the individual begin to change as inten- tion and the ability to hold an intention clearly strengthen and hold firm. It would be expected that one or more suc- cesses in manifesting a desired outcome would firmly inte- grate the process into the experience. However, that does not seem to be the case. Most find that old habits and assump- tions do not disappear from the experience easily. It takes many successes to raise the acceptance level to create a habit level for natural manifestation. There also are the instances when casual thought manifests as the sub-conscious applies the Laws to these casual thoughts. It is possible to bring into experience instances that apply to others that were never intended. Therefore the statement “of highest and best good for all concerned” is the best possible safety insurance and would be wisely added to all intentions to manifest a desir e. A consistent sprinkling of this statement within the contin- ual mind chatter that fills the void between meaningfully awar e thoughts is also wise. To meaningfully apply the Laws of Attraction, Focused Intent and Allowance requires purposeful desire to bring something into r eal experience. The simple experience unhampered by unnecessary add-on details is possible to manifest quite quickly , depending on the clarity , ability to focus the intention and emotional energy that adds impetus to the creational process. The degree of “knowing” is the final ingr edient in the mix. I t is difficult to determine the difference between believing and knowing. Again, it is an easy, almost effortless application of the desire, just as you know you can move from the chair to the door. There is an application of the doing of it that is totally without doubt and a knowing of exactly where one is going, but no thought as to"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Becoming 107 exactly what the muscular and other bodily efforts are that are involved, or what may happen during the process of arriving at the door. It is also necessary to continue to “know” one is going to the door all the way to getting there. Losing the focus may allow one to end up in the kitchen and wonder why one is there. In the same way, it is not necessary to delineate what is necessary in order for the desire to man- ifest. It is only necessary to know what the desire is and to add the minimal amount of focused cooperation that is nec- essary to set the process in motion while holding the inten- tion of experiencing the desire. It is often mentioned that one needs to be sure one really wants what one thinks is wanted. Most can think of casual thoughts or statements that have brought experiences with consequences not expect- ed. The creative aspect built into all is listening and takes those thoughts and statements literally, especially if the momentary intention is sincere and supported by emotional impetus. While the explanation seems complicated, the application is quite simple. It is a matter of simply doing it simply. The complicated par t is when doubt slows or destroys the effort entirely. To begin by choosing a desire that is totally contrary to the curr ent experience is to set up a formula for failur e. To attempt to move from poverty to affluence with one desire is sure to fail. It is best to begin with something small and sim- ple. I t adds to the pr ocess to act as if the desire is already hap- pening. Place an empty hanger in the closet for the new coat. Make space in the cupboard for a new dish or pot, etc. Then be patient and wait expectantly."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Becoming 108 III-31 It is through the application of the Law of Allowance that the greatest progress will be made with regard to the invocation for manifesting the new paradigm of experience. This is the most difficult of all the laws to apply for it requires the letting go of detailing the desired outcome. It is extremely difficult for the limited mind to focus on the out- come without feeling sure that it is necessary to also envision the process by which that outcome will come into being. It cannot be emphasized too much that it is the outcome that it is necessary to focus upon. The question then arises with- in the mind as to what indeed it should “look” like. The fact is the most impor tant aspect to “envision” is what it will feel like. Therefore, it is necessary to coin a new expression such as “enfeel” in order to bring the proper focus on this aspect of manifesting. What is called manifesting is indeed coming into the understanding and the application of the 4 Universal Laws. These have been simplified in concept and renamed to words that bring forward greater applicability for they fit within your normally spoken v ernacular . F ocus, intend and r elease with “ enfeeling ” to experience “har mony & balance ” is as simple as it is possible to place these wondrous Laws into your conscious awar eness. It is the intent of these messages to be focused at the planetary level for the greatest healing possible. However, that does not indicate that the individual for their o wn expe - rience cannot use these Laws. D o remember it would be easy for humans to become so caught up within their o wn “life drama ” that the gr eater purpose for the planet as a whole becomes lost and “falls through the cracks.” The point to"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Becoming 109 remember is that without the healing of the whole, the indi- vidual applications of the Law will do little to bring about the freedom of humanity from the planned scenario of con- trol. It is, therefore, imperative that any personal application of the Laws be focused “within” the greater planetary focus. Thoughts regarding this are most productive if all is “seen and felt” within a holographic picture of all applications contributing to the success of the planet as a whole. Within that focus, each individual success in applying the Laws then contributes to and strengthens the greater focus. Furthermore, the individual then draws a greater contribut- ing focus of energy from the planetary whole into their process, a wondrously helpful boost toward their desired goal. Again each is reminded to include the statement “for the highest and best good for all.” This releases the “thought thinking” aspect of the action of the Laws to utilize energies that otherwise would not be available to contribute to the whole (holographic) pattern. The Universal Laws when properly invoked can bring about wondrous changes in situations that otherwise would r emain stuck within their current motion and momentum. This remarkable process results in complete re-arrangement of energetic for ces that ar e in motion. This causes a period of chaotic energy shifting but can happen quickly if it is released (allowed) to complete the process without the input of imposed r estrictions to its motion b y the “intender” by continually adding thoughts to the process on how the Laws must bring about the desired focus. It is this necessary release/allowance that is the key. The educational process has br ought mankind many blessings, but it has also allo w ed for great limitations. The simple tribal experience with faith in"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Becoming 110 guided rituals often brought about remarkable changes with success based on previous experience and allowance of “unknown” energies to bring forth the desired change. It was the allowance of that “wise” outside energy to accomplish the feat that allowed it to happen. How much better it is to understand that the “outside something” is but the naturally existing Laws that underpin all of existence acting through the focus and cooperation of the mind/s involved. It is also important to mention again the added impetus that is gained when more than one mind agrees in basic con- cept on a desired focus. It is possible to “know” that the agreed upon desire for a new paradigm of experience can be the encompassing focus. It is possible for it to contain myr- iad individual foci each contributing to the success and ful- fillment of all when the “highest and best good of all con - cerned” is the releasing factor. The greatest success is accom- plished when the foci are concerned with the outcome and not the ho w , why , when and ifs that the human mind is so good at conjuring up to contemplate. It is this unneeded contribution that “gums up the works and throws the mon- key wr enches” into the process. This not only slows the process but can cause it to fail to manifest or worst of all bring for th a conv oluted v ersion of what was potentially pos- sible. Thus, it is again stressed that the discipline of holding the focus on the desired outcome is of the utmost impor- tance in allo wing the pr ocess of the Laws once set into motion to bring into manifestation that which will serve the greatest number to their highest and best good. This message will need to be read and reread in order to help each to keep in mind the exactness r equir ed in laying the foundation for the successful application of the basic"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Becoming 111 Universal Laws. The habits of the undisciplined mind are deeply ingrained. However, practice followed by success and holding to the simple repetition of the basics over and over again will bring about the desired new paradigm of experi- ence. The holographic concept of all fitting together within a matrix that contains infinite variety within a whole can and will allow for the freedom that mankind yearns to experience. It will be necessary to incorporate these concepts within the mind and the heart in order that these become the new “god” that each finds necessary to fill the void within. In this way, mankind can at long last come into the understanding that each is an expression of the Divine Order that is “God” knowing Him/Herself, All-ness in Self-contemplation. It is necessary to further let go of the need to “personify to iden- tify ” this greater concept of “God” and accept it as an on going process. Consider this carefully. III-32 The empo werment of humanity is of the utmost impor- tance in the outcome of the entire scenario. This empower- ment cannot come from the outside. This is an inside job that each individual human must accomplish on his/her own. This is not to say that there is not guidance available to trigger and assist. These messages ar e the per fect example as are the comments, articles, books and all other triggering phenomena that are available to accomplish the awakening of each and all. The o v erload of media av ailability to many of the curr ent world inhabitants ser v es the awakening pur - poses as much as it does as a mesmerizing tool. It takes con- stant r einforcement to keep the lid on conscious awareness."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Becoming 112 However, sudden discernment can cause all of the cleverly layered programming to fall away and understanding to instantly awaken when the proper triggers are activated. A simple statement that makes total logical sense within the thinking/nervous system connection causes a realization to register through out the awareness and in that moment there is a change in the ability to receive thought that has hither- to gone unheard and unnoticed. It is this process that is the purview of the “ground crew.” The agreed upon focus of the “ground crew” involves the awakening process as well as the primary focus of the desire for a new paradigm of experience through “outgrowing” the victim experience and accepting the responsibility for chang- ing the human experience on this planet. All who respond to this challenge ar e capable of accomplishing it, or the goal would not have appealed to each in the first place. The “Johnny Appleseeds” who plant idea seeds are “heaven sent” to do this. Consider car efully this idiom of speech. M any common sayings, when heard in the new context of change, have been speaking to the consciousness of each for a long time. Those will henceforth have great meaning and will trigger consciousness changes as they are noticed. The awak- ening pr ocess is ongoing once it is begun. Like a good mys - tery story, one clue leads to another in an ever deepening commitment and synchronicities will become a way of life. Chance comments, a wor d, a stor y line, a news note, etc., all will fit into a different context than previously. Particular friendships will have greater meaning and others will dimin- ish in importance as the focus of interest changes. The wor k, the focus of what it is necessar y to accom - plish, will redefine the thoughts and the available time. A"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Becoming 113 natural realignment to what is important will change with little direct attention as far as the personal life is concerned. When the focus and the intent are upon the outcome being for “the highest and best good for all concerned,” it will hap- pen of its own accord. What will be accomplished depends upon the strength of the foundation set forth in the very beginning. The simple statements of intent such as “help for all humans becoming” and “for the highest and best good of all concerned” set that foundation upon a firm and level beginning for they broaden the focal point beyond the per- sonal scope while yet including it. The globalization of inter- action and activity by humanity at this time no longer allows for experiential change to be limited to a country, a conti- nent or a hemisphere. In order to accomplish the transcen- dence of humanity on this planet as a whole, it was necessar y for there to be an inclusive global consciousness. Until this was possible, change was only piecemeal and easily destroyed fr om within as w ell as thr ough direct intervention by those who plan to continue their control. In considering the picture from a linear event observa- tional mode, timing seems inor dinately important. Within the understanding that a picture of wholeness can be filled in b y e v ents and circumstances that do not appear to be hap- pening in a sequential mode, it is difficult for those participat- ing to ascertain and comprehend the larger picture. Without understanding accomplishments as they fit within the bigger picture, it requires great self discipline to hold the desired out- come firmly in intentional focus. It is because the increasing inflow of newly awakening awareness requires those of greater understanding to constantly r edefine the purpose and the intent. This then in turn refreshes and renews their own focus."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Becoming 114 From an energetic pattern point of view, this provides for a spi- raling of greater available dynamism. It is the entry of more and new awakening awareness that provides this important momentum and allows for a continued increase of available energy that offsets the inevitable fallout of those without the ability to maintain their commitment. Many of these will be drawn back into the activity and again provide the addition of needed impetus. As the focused pattern begins to clarify and increase in momentum, its drawing magnetism will begin to be felt within the planetary mass consciousness. It is when the pattern begins its clarification and its ener- gy begins to draw from the negative focus that the greatest difficulty will be encountered. The assumed superiority of that group is unquestioned in their minds, thus they feel lit- tle if any concern about the attempts being made b y orga- nized groups to change the perceived future of earth and its population. It is the lack of organization and the emphasis on individual change and par ticipation that does no w and will continue to allow the transcendence of consciousness to reach the momentum and pattern clarity necessary to change the synthesis of the mass consciousness. O nce this point is reached, then the methodology as employed by them to con- tr ol large segments of the mind of humanity will er ode quickly, provided the momentum can be maintained. Indeed, critical points will be reached and must be moved thr ough. I t is then, in answer to focused and deliberate requests, that outside help can intercede in subtle ways that will assist in moving through those crisis moments. “Help to become” will be answered. Thought thinking will provide the exact needed assistance. I t will not come as inter v ention, but as assistance. There is a very important nuance in the differ-"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Becoming 115 ent meanings of those words to be contemplated and under- stood. There will be no mass invasion of extra-terrestrial ships to rescue humanity. That would not allow mankind to work out its own solution to the dilemma in which it is now embroiled. At all times, humanity must create its own solu- tion to invoking a new destiny story. There must be no mis- understanding of that fact. Victimhood and galactic citizen- ship are two opposite poles of experience to be understood and deliberately chosen. This is done by way of myriad small decisions and actions as experienced on a daily basis by indi- viduals in their own life experiences. These experiences then gather their own energy pattern reflecting a larger experience by an intentionally focused group of humanity. That is what will bring about the changes so greatly desired, prayed and begged for b y suffering humanity through this long and dif- ficult period of its history. III-33 This is the sequential period of time that is the leading edge of the chaos that has been mentioned many times in these messages. The pattern of existence as it has been known on the planet in recent millennium has begun to dis- integrate. As in all cases of disintegration, portions of the coagulated (manifested) energy do not dissolv e, but tend to break into pieces that become destructive to the portion that remains intact. In order to understand this; think of energy in a formation that r esembles a lo v ely sno wflake. Picture it as made of a stur dy material and see in your mind’s eye por- tions of it br eaking into pieces and being tossed about and causing other por tions of the pattern to br eak down from the impact. Since all manifestation consists of solidified energy,"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Becoming 116 this is a reasonable comparison. Once energy is solidified, it does not return to its origin (light/thought) without being broken down by the same creational process in reverse. However, that process is not an assignment for this ground crew. The larger picture that encompasses the totality of Earth and its inhabitants transcending the currently planned future contains many separate foci in order to bring the new paradigm of experience into being. It is only necessary that as much understanding of the process as it is possible to explain and is helpful be included. It is more important that each segment of the whole focus on the portion that is their agreed upon assignment. While all are curious about what the “big” picture looks like, it would indeed be impossible to explain. It is to be r emembered that as “thought thinks,” nuances of change can cause major differences in outcomes. Because freewill is a major component in the process of creation and allows for diversity within wholeness, the mediating factor within the wor king of the Laws of the Universe is the ability for thought to think within the whole. In other words, “thought thinking” can con- sider all nuances of change thr oughout the whole and com- pensate for effects that the finite mind has no way of consider- ing. I t is the wisdom that ev olving consciousness striv es to emulate. The Laws of the Universe are totally compatible and cooperative. When the Laws are invoked, and intent and pur- pose ar e in cooperation with them, ther e are never disagree- ments or discussions as to what, how, or which method or approach is right. It is simply done in the most advantageous way! There is no ego involvement as is present in situations of less ev olv ed thought pr ocesses. I t is these ideals that ar e sought in the dimensional progress of evolving consciousness. As these"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Becoming 117 are mastered, each progressive life experience provides for new and different challenges to be lived into wisdom. Presence on Planet Earth in these times is not and will not be lacking in challenges. Opportunities to live challeng- ing experiences into wisdom will abound. Those who can focus their intent and purpose to take advantage of these opportunities will benefit greatly. That is indeed a glib state- ment that in the moment has little meaning. However, if when others are in panic, one can “keep his/her head clear” and listen to the “knowingness” that is available to all that will listen within, decisive action will prevail in the moment. It is a matter of taking that second or two to listen/feel what is the appropriate thing to do. It is a skill that is acquired by practice. Applying it now in the small decisions that are made each day can pr ovide practice. Much is done by mere habit. As the situation changes, those habitual actions/reac- tions may no longer be appropriate. It is important to begin to pay attention to the thoughts and feelings, especially those that reflect apprehension or concern. It is time to begin reprogramming the conscious awareness to be more and mor e active in moment to moment decisions. “To do or not to do?” That is the question to be asked within each con- scious awar eness. I t is of utmost impor tance that these ques- tions are asked of the individual self-awareness rather than asking others for their opinion. Only the individual is expe- riencing the decision and is in the situation: the decision may require action in brief moments. Through practice, confidence and trust with that inner knowing part of self will be built. B ecoming inv olv ed thr ough commitment to the “ground crew” requires focus of intent and purpose.

This connection involves a bal- ance of responsibility and compensation in direct proportion to contribution. It does not reward foolish input that endan- gers the outcome. Development of the “feeling” of appropri- ate words and actions is a prerequisite to wise participation. The major portion of the process will be accomplished by individual awareness and consciousness change along with dedicated intent and purpose to create the desired new par- adigm of experience. It is the focus on the intended outcome through “knowing” the desired outcome can manifest when participants are in harmony with the Laws and truly desire “ the highest and best good for all humanity on P lanet Earth.” It is to be expected that as the influence of this focus of intent to change the planned destiny of mankind begins to affect circumstances and situations, the usual method of destruction will be employed, that is to infiltrate and destroy fr om within the organization. However, there will be no organization to destroy. No doubt, individuals will be “ r emo ved” from the focus, but there will be few if any records to indicate what individuals are responsible for the change taking place. Once the triggers change the conscious thinking pr ocess of those par ticipating that will be the only connection that can be made, on a one by one basis.

With the acceptance of self and planetary responsibility, the brain/mind will activate to a greater and greater degree. Though purposefully imposed, the limited brain capacity was held in place by the victim consciousness. That in turn was held in place by the desire to be rescued by a source out- side the self and humanity as a whole. This further provides the understanding for the weekly programming lessons str essing the need to ask outside help in all areas of life, to turn over life to outside greater wisdom, and the media depiction of the constant stream of victim situations. All is car efully coor dinated to keep the victim consciousness firm - ly anchored within the mass consciousness.

Within each is the"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Becoming 120 source of such guidance. The ability to tap into this wisdom is present within all and latent within most. The lessons in learning to discern what is appropriate and what is not are many and frustrating. For most, these are trial and error with difficulty in figuring out what purpose experience serves in life. Once the concept of discernment is understood, it is learning to use this important tool that is at the basis of many of life’s trials. It then becomes a useful tool that enhances experiencing knowledge into wisdom. It is to be understood that discernment is a tool that replaces what has been called judgment. Each can then release the self-deprecation that comes from “judging” self and others as being right or wrong. Discernment is an inter- nal process that eliminates looking outside of one’s self for the cause of the seemingly difficult experiences that plague the human life. The dictionary lists “insight” as an appropri- ate synonym. Discernment can be applied in a before or after mode. I t is wise to consult one ’ s inner feelings carefully before undertaking an experience. It can be further applied in retrospect to understand what lesson can be gleaned from an experience that is happening or has happened. U nless a lesson is learned, it is likely to be repeated until it is “dis- cerned.” Then a r ealization of what the intended lesson is/was happens within the understanding of the individual or group. The practice of discernment is par t of the application of the Law of Allowance. To consider the appropriateness of an undertaking in either the before, during or after mode requires a letting go of the emotions involved in the experi- ence so that the logic of it can be consider ed. This may be an ongoing process of consideration before the totality of the"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Becoming 121 lesson is gained. Even partial understanding and realization of its purpose in the totality of the life experience allows for greater knowledge to become wisdom which in turn allows the individual to apply this and change their pattern of expression to include different possibilities. In order to con- sider the situation and its circumstances there is a letting go that is necessary in order to allow the mind to consider the possibilities of the who, what, why and how of the total pic- ture. If there is considerable open mindedness, possible sce- narios can be played out in order to determine the greatest number of possibilities. Through this process, the more log- ical meanings become clear. Through this release needed solutions often become accessible because the mind has been allowed to reach inward to access the available wisdom from within. Each has a stor ehouse of available wisdom that is obtainable through the practice of discernment. There must be a desire to lift personal experience out of the daily morass of pointless r epetition, judgement and blame. In order to shed the victim consciousness the individual must be willing to turn their view of life from looking outside for the cause of situations and cir cumstances to looking inside for the causes that invoke what the Law of Attraction has br ought into experience. These causes ar e to be found within attitudes, opinions and self-talk, for the mind is speaking with- in in a constant flow of chatter. Within this internal conversa- tion ar e the keys to many of the patterns of thought and behav - ior that set up the situations and circumstances that are being experienced. Changing these patterns that are the basis for the creation of the life pattern is not a simple task, but a good beginning can be made with the awar eness that it all begins with discernment. The world does not just happen to anyone."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Becoming 122 It is invited through the Law of Attraction, for like attracts like. A victim attitude draws not only fellow victims into one’s life, but also abusers to provide the victim experience. As each begins to accept the responsibility that the cause is within their own pattern of experience, and is willing to accept this idea, then the practice of discernment is possible. The discerning individual will find it necessary to logically assess their attitudes and opinions. Are they judgmental and blaming of others? Are there always reasons that the self is not responsible for what is going on in the life experience? If so, then denial of personal responsibility is blocking all progress and the cycle of victimhood is established. Until such time as this can be looked at with logic and the pattern discerned, it remains locked into the experience. It is necessary to desire to change these basic contr olling factors, look and listen to what is thought and said and purposefully change the basic pattern. The results will take time and diligent correction in order to see the changing pattern in experience. H o w ever, the pattern must change if the intent and purpose are held in focus and thought and words are changed. Statements made can be restated in a positiv e mode, this then changes the first statement. Thoughts can be “re-thought.” S imple as this message content is, ther e ar e few if any who cannot find application of these ideas in their daily experience.

III-35 As the sequence of events seems to accelerate and lineal time to pass more quickly the chaos will grow. Each individ- ual will experience their own sequence of events that are only a small portion of the total picture. The controlled media will report only segments of the true picture. When viewed fr om the perspectiv e of the planetar y whole, ther e is a far greater degree of chaos now present than can be perceived by humanity. Those yet in zones of calm have little frame of ref- er ence for the experiences of those who are in the midst of war, geological or weather phenomena. Though greater glob- al awareness is present, yet there is little exchange of actual experiential trauma between these separate experiences.

This plan to deliberately"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Becoming 124 upset the balance by increasing the chaos beyond the plan- et’s ability to retain its balance is based upon the theory that once the imbalance reaches a certain point, it can be pushed into a negative vibration that will block its access by positive energy foci. In other words, the planet would then be whol- ly owned by those of negative energy vibration and would then be no longer accessible by those of balanced or positive energy vibrations. In order to accomplish this it has been thought that it was necessary to lower the vibrational fields of the inhabi- tants to a point that survival of some would be possible when the conversion to pure negative energy is completed. The installations of massive energy converters in order to bom- bard the ionosphere have been planned for this purpose. The testing of these conv erters appears to be for reasons other than what is planned. Indeed they are to “protect” the plan- et from positive foci and appear to the planners to be accom- plishing their intended purpose. The question remains as to whether the theory on which all of this is predicated is one that will produce the desired change of polarity and if it w ere applicable, what are the impli- cations that would accompany the result. When change is under taken within the Laws of the U niv erse, the “thought thinking” principle can and does work through all the possi- bilities and probabilities and reaches a conclusion as to feasibil- ity . When change is attempted without this inclusive aspect of wisdom, there is the inherent danger that unknown factors are disregarded and the outcome is likely to be unstable at some point in the process. This then brings the situation to the con- sideration as to ho w far fr ee will can be allo w ed to operate if the use of it involves massive risk to whole segments of creation."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Becoming 125 Freewill with regard to individual experience is inviolate. However, when “will” is focused into a situation that is for the deprivation and destruction of not only the freewill choice of evolving consciousness, but to the point of destruction of the soul energy at the basis of life expression, then careful con- sideration must take place as to how this situation may be han- dled. The situation not only demands consideration and deci- sions, but also involves the decision of what intelligent foci may be involved in making that decision. In other words, a stacked deck cannot exist either for or against the continuation of the experience. This creates a considerable dilemma in coming up with a consortium of qualified and empowered “beings” will- ing to become involved in such a situation for serving in this capacity puts their own evolution at risk. Evolution is in reali- ty a gr owing participation in responsibility. It is not a move- ment to a Utopian existence of lesser involvement or fewer responsibilities.

The foundation of victim consciousness has been carefully laid within the religious foci from the very beginning. It has allowed for control of the progress of mankind not only in the discovery of the “god- like” qualities that are inherent to all, access to the under- standing and application of the Universal Laws, but also to the understanding and ability to relate to the “creator mind” that is available within the outflow of undifferentiated ener- gy at the basis of all Creation. The key to the entry of the gathered wisdom foci is held within the collective mass consciousness of humanity. Unless the individual and collective desire of humanity for freedom from the oppressive outside intervention that has been pre- sent on this planet for thousands of years is focused toward an end to this situation, it cannot and will not change. The only possible help that can be given at the moment is to focus energies into the available thought realms surrounding the planet in the hope that individuals will accept these sub - tle suggestions to augment the desires that are already there to bring forth a change within the collective thinking of mankind as a whole. This seems like drops into an ocean of misery, but in accordance with the freewill principle, noth- ing fur ther can be done. The presence of craft from positive origins, what are called extra-terrestrial visitors, among those of negative and ear thly origin as w ell as visible energy patterns imprinted on the surface of the planet has been increased.

The electri- cal charges that are being forced into the energy fields encir- cling earth are being placed there in an effort to block all positive support for the planet and its inhabitants. Fortunately, all efforts in harmony with the Laws of the Universe are supported by the intelligence of “thought thinking” which finds ways to circumvent such plans. If mankind can indeed be triggered to desire its freedom, despite the plans to block any such assistance, then the Universal Laws can and will support them. However the focus is to be held on that which is desired instead of retali- ation and r esorting to the old methods that have failed to bring mankind manifestation of their desire for change in the past. In other words, the focus must not resemble that which it is desir ed to leav e behind. The human population that desires to experience the opportunity to evolve in freedom from oppression must focus on what is desir ed and let go of the experiences of the past. These have led them in a continuous circle of repeating what has been taught to them b y the example of their oppressors. The same blood/DNA of those oppressors flows in the blood of humanity. The question remains as to whether ther e ar e enough humans on this planet that have evolved beyond those genetic aberrations that do not serve their advancement.

It would seem that each individual life expression can har dly be a blessing to the planet and its inhabitants as a unit, but that is very much the case. Each has the opportu- nity to focus her/his life experience for the “good of all con- cerned.” That inclusion is far reaching indeed! When this intention can be coupled with harmonious application of the Universal Laws a great contribution to the planetary con- sciousness is made. Fame or fortune need not accompany this contribution. Most often, the greatest contributions are made in obscurity and often without the conscious knowl- edge of the person doing so. These individuals simply expe- rience life as a pleasant and harmonious sojourn.

As mentioned previously, each lifetime is a contribution to a greater totality of experiencing into wisdom. There exists a holograph of experience that requires the completion of var- ious segments of experience in order that completion may be experienced. Therefore it is unwise for individuals to decide what is good or bad with regard to the behavior of others as well as their choice of lifestyle. Each is to striv e to accomplish what seems important in the moment and to listen to the inner guidance that is available to all.

Through ethical intention the first two Universal Laws are invoked. If “ethical” is a prerequisite, then why indeed does evil seem to succeed? It is because the Laws work regardless of who employs them. It is the outcome that is measured by the ethical intention of the “highest and best good of all con- cerned.” The intended manifestation process that is contrary to the “good of all” must reach a crossover point where unknown instability destroys what is not harmonious in the larger picture for there are no individual minds capable of interpreting all possibilities. It is the clarity and duration of the intended focus that does hold a “ evil” situation in mani- festation beyond the normal point of destruction. Knowledge of the Universal Laws is not normally an unkno wn. Ther efore, those who plan to hold onto Earth as a colony know and understand their application well. It is the human population that has been denied the knowledge and understanding of them so that they cannot use them to help free themselves from the plan to continue their enslave- ment.

By absenting themselves, the true rulers have hidden their influence behind blind faith augmented by cruel punishment for disobedience meted out by “a God of love.” The paradox of this claim has kept mankind in a constant turmoil and exactly where it was planned that they be.

In no way is this intended to be a threat but as encouragement to look carefully into the inner awareness as to the validity of these messages and to “feel” what is the appro- priate response. Participation within this phase of the plan is not appropriate for every human. To become aware that there is a plan that can lead to freedom to evolve can then lead these that do not fit into this particular focus to diligently search for their proper place within the effort to birth the new paradigm. Humanity stands on the brink of what is opportunity or disaster. Those are blunt words, but it is not to the advantage of an entire planet to mince words and walk softly. The process is proceeding according to both plans and a conver- gence point is looming in the not too far distant future, as it is experienced in sequential time. Those in awareness must focus and direct their intent to participate and to involve as many as possible within their focus of intent. Tomorrow is not soon enough to begin. What has been known and experienced is what is expect- ed to continue in at least a somewhat familiar format. This will not bir th the new paradigm. Atlantis, whether believed as real or as a myth, is an example of this. The story that is kno wn is of a continent containing a gr eatly adv anced civi- lization with a well developed scientific community and a very strong religious priesthood that controlled the develop- ment of all phases of the civilization. Though ther e were sur- vivors, most of these were reduced to what is termed “cave- man” status for their tools of advancement were lost under the sea.

Behind these in real- ity are the extra-terrestrial true rulers making sure that their colony stays under their control. The reduction of mankind to utter poverty of physical and religious experience failed to allow them to maintain a destiny of continuous enslavement. Unless a focused portion of the population is willing to take on the responsibility of deliberately intending to change the repeating cycle of apparent advancement followed by the return to poverty of body, mind and spirit, nothing will change. The age-old question of “Why does God allow this if He truly loves his beings?” rises to the minds of humanity over and over again. The answer is always the same, freewill! If self-aware beings choose victim consciousness, the Law of A ttraction will provide them with fellow victims and abusers to maintain the experience. The desire to move through the victim experience thus experiencing it into wisdom with the intention of cr eating a ne w paradigm of experience for the whole of mankind and this planet is the purposeful intent that is necessary. This must be held in the forefront of all thought r egarding this process. Will this salvage the planet and all of the human awareness units on the planet? Only those who ar e willing to par ticipate. Who these will be will be decided within the soul matrix of each individual. Participating in life experience at the 3rd dimensional lev el blocks fr om the understanding the activity of creation that goes on in the higher dimensions of experience.

Using this example, it is necessary to understand"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Becoming 134 that the pyramidal experience is supported by focused thought that may be understood to be its energetic counterpart, thus creating a double pointed structure. That which is seen or experienced is supported by an energetic format of focused thought and these interact on an ongoing basis. If this thought format were to be withdrawn, the manifested portion would cease to exist. Each human life is supported by an energetic focus that holds it in format. Each mountain and grain of sand is held in focus by its energetic counterpart. To illustrate this principle within the life experience, a business or organization is held in experience by the thoughts of those who participate by their focused thought. If that is withdrawn, it no longer continues to exist. It continues or it fails based upon the factors required and whether or not these were included in the focus of attention and intention. The information contained above can be carried over into the previous discussion of placing attention and inten- tion within the application of the basic Laws of the U niv erse. By releasing them in harmony through proper intent, the action of the “thought thinking” function of the Laws can and does supply the factors r equired for true manifestation of the desired outcome to the highest and best good of all concerned. I f the intent is held firmly in mind and hear t and at the same time released and allowed to manifest through the action of the Laws, the outcome will assuredly be har- monious.

Recognized or not, until each identifies what their particular dominant purpose is, there is a need to search and find it. This leads to physical changes in location, career changes and frequent visitations to various churches as well as other community and athletic endeavors. Often times it necessitates fervent participation within a focus that does not satisfy the empty the need in hopes that more of the same will eventually be fulfilling. Mankind has been denied the understanding of how to com- mune with the greater aspects of that part of him/herself that has placed their awar eness into this life experience. This aspect is alluded to in religious literature but with little meaningful guidance. Meditation is taught, but the overload of media input along with the str essful life style of “modern” life seldom allows most to reach a point at which the mind is able to free itself to reach the quiet point required to com- mune with the focusing aspect. It is as though the brain cells are stimulated to an operating mode that cannot slow down to a r esting point of awar eness. I n this state of stimulation, the thought processes do not function normally. The thoughts are not comprehended and considered and are instead, simply pr ocessed thr ough.

This franti c mode is further pictured in life styles that"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Becoming 136 reflect constant busyness through hurrying from one task to another. Relaxation is musical noise, TV, movies or videos. Sleep is induced with alcohol, sex, drugs, or late night eating resulting in exhaustion of the body’s functions. Simple quiet time such as sitting to observe a sunset and contemplating the joy of being alive, of counting one’s multitude of blessings is seldom done, even by the older members of the current cul- ture. The learned busyness is continued until disease or infir- mity demands a slow down. The point to be made here is that those who choose to participate in this focus of intention to create a new paradigm of experience must realign their priori- ties. In order to create something new, a separation from the attachments to the old must be eventually made. That does not say participation must be given up, but their importance must be allo wed to diminish. In order to contemplate what is new, there must be quiet space within the awareness to do this. Priorities must change to allow for slowing down the partici- pation in meaningless endeav ors and a gr eater peace sought through choice. Quietness must be redefined from boredom to peacefulness. S eeking peace in proximity to urban noise, airwaves filled with unseen but very present vibrations and living amid cr o w ded visual surroundings is challenging. Artificial light inhibits the ability to observe and enjoy the evening twilight and the view of the star filled heavens. What coun- tr yside is close b y is also filled with exterior lights.

Humanity at large is on a “taking binge” with little understanding of the necessity of a return flow of energy to the planet through appreciation and honoring the provisions that maintain life. How then do those who accept this change of focus come into balance and harmony with the global whole in order to enhance and magnify their presence into a focus that will augment the necessary transition? The way is through applying the Laws of the Universe within their own experience. It can be done through intention and attention to what choices can be made to bring as many peaceful moments into each day as possible. The Law of Attraction will work when the attention and intention are clear. Time off from frantic activity, even a small space of quiet time, can hav e a “grounding” or quieting effect. Positive prayer that centers on appreciation and blessing of the self and others rather than on what appears to be lacking in life will change the experience. Who one thanks is of little impor tance, for this again is the need to personify and identify. “The power that Is” is sufficient identification. It is the thankful “heart” (feelings) that is impor tant. One cannot expect to create a more abundant experience if one is not appreciative of what is alr eady within the curr ent experience. B y honoring what is, the Law of Attraction is invoked. Thus it is important to find positive attributes in the cur- r ent experience to appr eciate and honor even as a new para- digm of experience is desired. This is the paradox that is found throughout creation.

III-39 As the sequence of events begins to accelerate, it is time for those who are committed to the change of experience for humanity on this planet to seriously focus on the idea of the realization of the new paradigm. In order for it to manifest into the reality of experience, it must first become real in the minds of those who identify with this idea. It is rather like pulling the proverbial rabbit from the hat. The event as seen requires focused intent “behind the scene” and a great deal of practice in focusing on this desir e in or der for it to appear . The event itself is a manifestation of the intent that precedes it. What appears as a magical event to the observers involves instead focused practice and the intent to mystify and sur - prise. There is a direct correlation to the birthing of the planned new paradigm of experience. The new paradigm will arise out of the “grass roots” desire of humanity to end the current descent into slavery. Under what appears as com- placency and ignorance of what is going on in the life of the “average” person is the feeling that “things are not quite right.” Beneath that awareness is a cognition that is sending for th a signal calling for balance and harmony within the planetar y experience.

It is upon this critical foundation that those who r ead and identify with"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Becoming 139 these messages have permission to dream/imagine the frame- work that will begin manifesting into reality the desired new experiences. The key to the survival of this focus lies in its lack of organization. There is nothing to infiltrate and nothing of substance that appears to support its existence. But exist it does! It exists in the minds of growing numbers of individu- als and answers untold uttered and unuttered prayers to countless ideas of divine power that is believed to possess the ability to intervene. In truth, it is the manifestation of these prayers and the underlying desire for balance and harmony that is coming forth as the “messages” and the focusing of these through individual minds into the mass consciousness. This is then the answer to these “prayers” and desires. The divine inter vention is manifesting through those who desire it. The invocation is made through thought and is being answered in like manner. Since thought is the impetus for all cr eation, the inv ocation and the answ er are in the most pow- erful and yet subtle form. It is also the most defensible when it is firmly held and emotionally powered. No amount of subliminal influence can alter the emotionally held convic - tion that is focused upon a desired manifestation. Desire, firmly held in mind with emotional kno wingness that the possibility of its actuation is feasible, can and will manifest. It matters only that the perception that is held by many is gener ally identifiable thr ough statements of purpose.

The hoped for return to prior known experiences would in no way hold these dark inten- tions in check. It must be clearly understood that all hope must be focused toward the invocation of a new paradigm of experience. The past must be allowed to become the past.

The available help can offer protection which enables the natural expansion to continue rather than be contained by those who would prefer that this intentional focus be aborted or die in its infancy. It is this kind of help that it would be wise to invoke during prayer or meditation or focused thought. It is “help to help yourselves” so to speak. It is requests for help to open up the path of mankind before them so that it can be seen and understood as it is experienced into reality. That kind of help fits within the Laws of Galactic Citizenship to be exchanged between its members, freely asked for and freely given. “Help us to help ourselves!” It invokes no indebtedness between members. It is the way of advancement in which all that can, help all that ask, but those must be willing to help themselves in the pr ocess. It cannot be done for them.

Once the experiential chain of sequential events has reached a completion point of its cycle and a reality is experienced as complete, a perspective of the entire event can be glimpsed. However, it is only one perspective of a holo- graphic whole. The concept of time that is the basis for perceiving sequential events exists and is experienced differently within each level of manifested reality. With the ability to perceive a greater and greater perspective of a whole, the importance of minute by minute time calculation becomes less relevant. What becomes important is the encompassing process that contains the situation or event as it is completed into a whole experience. It is like watching the sweater being knit- ted as a whole from freshly spun yarn. As it is knitted, it becomes the backgr ound for the embroidery of individual experiences. The same sweater background is perceived and embroidered by each individual who is living within its influence. Each sees their v ersion of the sequence of ev ents, situations and circumstances that then makes up a larger and larger group experience as perceived by all from a myriad of perspectiv es.

Some are lost in various group foci that exploit their fellow humans, etc. Underlying the whole chaotic scene are the mind manipulators that carry out their influencing experiments on their human sacrificial guinea pigs. Mind programming, medical experiments in the form of prescrip- tion drugs and vaccines, illegal hard drugs, food additives, food combinations, unseen vibratory waves from commonly used communication devices, appliances, etc., all influence the human body and the vibratory/electrical spark of life that animates it.

What is measured as time by this self-awareness as it progresses and is refined appears as short segments in what appears as a long process.

Thought thinking is wise indeed! Some things are better left to resolve themselves through allowance. However, remember that allowance is not indifference, it is watchful observance with emotional expectation anticipat- ing the outcome of purposeful intent. It is change through conscious participation in expressing the principle of Life that is known through the gift of self-awareness. It is found by perceiving what is known and felt within the feeling aspect of awar eness through logical consideration of ques- tions asked within the thinking process. It is thought think- ing within the individual consciousness and testing its con- clusions thr ough the feeling aspect as to their v alidity in quiet contemplation knowing there is no need to compare the conclusions to any one else’s process of decision.

This then carries with it the right of sovereign owner- ship of this planet, not as an individual, but as an individual part of the family of humanity. It takes little review of the past history of “royal families” to see the pattern of behavior that is present within that segment of the mass conscious memory. The review of history in light of the influence of those governing directly or in manipulating the members of humanity that were chosen to fulfill that role points vividly to greed, deceit and treachery as standard operating proce- dure. Indeed, there is little of enduring value to be gained in repeating the experience of humanity in this past chapter of planetary history other than to create a deep and abiding desir e to transcend it into a totally new pattern of evolve- ment. This is not to indicate that there has not been a great deal of progress and much experienced into wisdom. It is meant to indicate that all that is practically possible to learn has been gleaned and it is prudent to release the need to con- tinue and to move on to a more rewarding pattern of expe- rience. As the consciousness shifts to allow a more encompassing vie w of the human experience, a differ ent way of per ceiving the content of the mass consciousness allows the observer to more easily perceive and acknowledge the influences at work that ar e deliberately pr ogramming the overall attitudes and opinions that shape it.

To attempt to separate and maintain an indi- vidual focus accomplishes little of value whereas joining a larg- er focus of intent to change the planetary experience offers a solution of enough value to incite a commitment. As has been mentioned before, a change of individual expression does lit- tle to change the experience of others, while a planetary change will affect all individual experiences within its scope. These messages continue to follow a theme of clarifying the current situation with its probable continuity for humanity in a downward spiral of experience into abject slavery and the intended destruction of the soul energy that is the focus that places and holds the spark of life within each body . That spark is experienced as individual self-awareness. Stripping this aspect of life from the human expression would return it to the animal state and to what is thought to be an ideal slav e ar chetype. That is the simplest explanation of the planned future. The greatest problem is the desire of the controllers to retain a percentage of intelligence that is linked to the self-awar e state. Thus, experiments and contin- ual testing go on to determine what techniques of mind con- tr ol and physical adaptability can bring about this ideal pr o - totype. It is hoped that this planned scenario that awaits those who continue to accept the indoctrination, the vacci- nations, the r egimentation and the subor dination of their will to powers outside themselves is now vividly envisioned by those who read and accept the possibility that the content of these messages contains truth.

It is possible to change the experience by conscious choice and by deliberate intention through aligning that intention with the basic Laws of the Universe. These bring about deliberate empowerment by allowing the Law of Attraction to release requested help to assist rather than to rescue. At the basis of this plan is the essential change in the perception of the situation at hand and the change in con- sciousness from victim to responsible creator of a new para- digm of experience. Releasing all of this into the flow of cre- ative expression is the desire that all happen for the highest and best good of all concerned! It must be understood that this is not to be intended for beleaguered mankind only, but all that are involved in the entire scenario, whether they appear to be of positive or negative intent.

It is necessary that there be formed what might be called an enlightened or knowledgeable nucleus. These messages are intended to serve that purpose. As these are read and reread, those that resonate with the infor- mation contained within them form a pivotal core for the attraction of greater numbers to join the growing momentum toward the creation of the new paradigm of experience. To desire change is one level of involvement, but to desire change within a feasible format that is based upon a logical sequence that allows for a group consensus of agreement brings about a momentum that has within it the promise of success. As the momentum begins to build within this focused core of belief in the success of the process that is now well initiated, it is not experienced by these same individuals seeing the actual results for those ar e and will continue to be unknown from a practical sense. It will be experienced instead as an inner knowingness that all is working exactly according to plan. Though mankind has long sought to obser v e and contr ol as many aspects as is possible within their life experience, in this case it is known from the beginning that it is necessary to “trust the process.” That permits the Law of Allo wance the scope to manifest what is invoked through the Law of Purposeful Intention (deliberate intention to cr eate.) I t is necessar y to understand that in order for an intended creation to manifest, it must be allowed to manifest. This happens through holding the intention firmly in intellectiv e vie w in the full faith and anticipation that it is already in energetic thought form and deliberately drawing to itself the molecular experiential for- mat that will allow it to come into perceivable reality.

These laws have been introduced in their most basic formats along with simple explanations of both the sequential and interacting processes that allow them to serve as a purposeful vehicle of creation. The Laws are responsive to intention and thus are often, if not most of the time, operating from a perspective of default, meaning they are manifesting whatever is being held in focus by any and all thought held in place. Thus those whose thoughts are on poverty and lack are creating within their experience more poverty and lack. Thoughts on victimhood are drawing more experiences of victimhood. Thoughts of hatred and revenge bring experiences of being hated and of vengeance. Focus on “ wanting” particular experiences or things, brings more “want- ing,” not the manifestation of the objects of the wanting. Thoughts of appreciation of abundance, happiness and joy bring mor e of those. I t all depends upon the perspectiv e of the focusing conscious awareness. The Laws are real and the results they bring forth when pr operly applied are real. The doubt that arises during the linear sequence of time that is experienced between the invo- cation of purposeful intent and the manifestation into r eal - ized experience is the trap. Manifestation between energetic thought formation of the matrix to the realizable experience v aries with the quality of purposeful thought that is held in place during this interim. The quality is influenced greatly by the emotional excitement that is contained in the antici- pation with which the event is awaited. Though emotional suppor t is experienced periodically , it is difficult to maintain the necessary level of anticipation through “knowing” the"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Becoming 155 matrix is indeed drawing to it the required condensing ener- gy to bring about completion. Thus, it serves the process to have multiple foci contributing to the thought pool that is holding the pattern in place. Here again, it is the generally understood desire for a new paradigm of experience that is the organizing force fueled by the input of contributory data to support this desire from myriad points of view. The focused energy input within a delineated pattern that is defined within a process in harmony with the outflow of Universal expression moves through manifestation with a maximum of efficiency. By funneling the thought energies through an agreed upon organizing focus a dynamic is estab- lished that elicits an attractive force that brings to the process more thought energies that in turn adds further empowerment to all phases. Thus it is seen to build upon itself because it is acting in harmony with the creative outflow of potentiality which can be understood to be energy that is yet without pur- pose or form. This unformatted energy is mor e quickly imprinted with the desired expression. It is not necessary to break down or reformat energy already imprinted. Since the Law of Allo wance is free to ascertain the most appropriate combination of available essential elements that will benefit the whole, manifestation is within a harmonious flo w . It is to be remembered that all manifestation that is attempted that is contrary to the creative flow that maintains the whole must of necessity b y held tightly in focus within carefully delineated guidelines.

The Laws working together freely have available self-direction within the process utilizing wisdom that is beyond comprehension. That is a decided advantage in the birthing of the new paradigm. III-44 Each and all ar e surrounded by the energy that focuses the awareness that each knows as him or herself. It is the consciousness that allows choices and observation of the self within those choices. The variation and the extent that this selection involves varies with the willingness to confront the situations and circumstances that are present and to make decisions that encompass the range of greatest to the least effect upon the status quo each is experiencing. This begins during childhood. It is then that parents wield great influ- ence through their approval or disapproval of the choices that each child makes. Until about the age of 12 parents are the “gods” of each child’s life experience. The relationship established between the child and its parents influences the pattern of decision making that will be lived out during the r est of that lifetime. The child may decide to follo w the pat - tern as set or they may choose to use it as a guide for change. Again, it is the conscious awareness making a decisive choice that will influence the pattern of the life experience. The confidence or lack of it that is acquired during childhood influences the courage and adventurousness that each applies during the life experience.They ar e fur ther influenced not only by the input of other interactions and experiences but also b y the genetic inclinations that ar e inherited thr ough"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Becoming 157 cellular memory passed on through previous experiences of prior generations. All of these influences are continuously interacting within the consciousness as well as those attach- ments that are made to objects, circumstances, situations and relationships with others. As the ability grows to inter- act with more and more influences in what is deemed the “modern world” with its global travel and global media exchanges, it is easily understood that life is anything but simple in this time and place. It is considered progress to find the awareness surround- ed by complexity. If that is true, then mankind should be extremely content and experiencing both mental and spiri- tual evolvement. A few are able to “put it all together,” but certainly not a sufficient number to lift the conscious expe- rience of the many . It then becomes necessary, if evolvement is to become a step forward, for a sufficient number to pri- oritize their life choices to bring this purpose into a mean- ing ful focus. I t has been the intent of these messages to assist in bringing the understanding of the necessity of doing just that in order that a shift in the planned future of mankind on this planet take place. I t has been pointed out many times that it can only happen through the concerted efforts of enough individual humans b y their o wn choice to do what is appropriate to cause this to happen. It must first begin within each individual self-awareness with the desire for it to happen on a planetar y lev el. This is the foundation for all else to build upon.

Until that choice of personal responsibili- ty is made, some other unit of awar eness will be happy to do it. The inheritance of the DNA used to introduce the origi-"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Becoming 158 nal genetic enhancement that pushed the evolvement rapid- ly into self-awareness for those originally inhabiting this planet causes the natural group tendency to inevitably lead to competition and power struggles rather than cooperation. It therefore becomes clear that a purposeful choice must be made between competition and cooperation. This would lead to a major shift in the overall group experience. It would lead the human experience on a totally new path of expres- sion. It seems such a simple choice in light of the profound change that would result. As is the case in all life experience, the simple choices are often the most profound and life changing. While the messages are dealing with the simple truths that lie at the basis of evolving experience, the masters of contr ol continue to complicate and confuse by causing chaos at points all over the planet. It is their plan to cause enough chaos and confusion to overwhelm their overly independent (in their opinion) wor kers into giving up any thoughts of freedom in order to have order and peace. As the confusion and chaos grow, all memories of the past seem to have had mor e of the order and peace that is desired. This is what is planned and presented through subtle suggestion. The more complex the experience surr ounding humanity , the mor e easily it is believed it can be herded into asking for outside control to reorder their existence. Then it can be said, “humanity asked for their help!” I t is in understanding their methodology that it can be clearly seen that in order to free itself, humanity must make exactly the opposite decision. It must decide that control by outsiders in the guise of “gov- ernment,” especially as “ a single world go v ernment ” will not bring about the desired Utopia.

Help is available to initiate this opportunity. Advice to assist is avail- able to be accepted or not, as chosen by those who take advantage of this opportunity. These messages return again and again to the underlying theme of choice and responsibility. It is hoped that this understanding and this attitude are becoming a premise for the choices that are made by each individual. These individ- uals are now forming a growing nucleus of informed thought that is focused on the purposeful intent to claim the inheri - tance that belongs to the human population of this planet from this day forward in sequential timing. It can only be claimed b y kno wing it as tr uth and declaring it as the basis for every act of choice. Through purposefully desiring a new paradigm of experience, with cooperation as its focus of empo werment for “the highest and best good for all con- cerned,” the energetic framework is put in place. The pattern then begins filling in as the harmony of agr eement corr esponds with the action of the Laws of the Universe. The ripples of added conscious agreement continues to build as the messages r each mor e and more people and the pattern strengthens. As the “ground crew” continues in their committed focus, so also does the anticipation that fuels the purposeful intent. Help in various forms of interventional formats begins to assist.

It is meant to be understood that it is a cooperating group that is now receiving informational help to support them in completing the assignment that was agreed upon before incarnating in human bodies to assist in bringing this planet out of bondage and into the full opportunity to evolve. These have taken on the human limitations of their earthly genetic parent’s histories, but have brought with them strengths to blend into the mix of evolutionary advancements made by those humans that have evolved or have been aban- doned on this planet. These ask for nothing but the commit- ment and cooperative help of all who will understand the opportunity that is being offered. It matters not what the rea- son is that each individual v olunteers. All are necessary con- tributors to a worthy and vastly rich opportunity at the indi- vidual and planetary level that will ripple outward to an extent that is bey ond imagination.

The vibrator y rate of manifested experience and observable matter or objects to be experienced in 3rd dimensional reality requires the concept of"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Becoming 161 time to be comprehended within a sequential format. This requirement separates simultaneous events and manifestations into identifiable segments thus dividing multiple coactive hap- penings into recognizable units. It is then difficult to discern a reasonable and essentially accurate picture of complex situa- tions using only the known pieces. Arriving at a bigger picture by assembling information from a stream of passing informa- tion requires a process necessitating the activation of a portion of the brain that is latent in most earthbound humans. The known factors may not contribute enough information to indi- cate the integral picture, but certainly the parts considered sep- arately in no way indicate the combined elements forming what is true. In other words, the 3rd dimensional experience is extremely limiting. This is the reason it is so difficult to tran- scend it thr ough individual effort. The addition of multiple media providing mass amounts of information has been instructive in allowing the realization that situations that are larger and mor e inclusiv e exist than ar e being revealed. The amount of conflicting and deliberately misleading data includ- ed in the available information makes accurate conclusions dif- ficult to formulate. S ituations change, the available informa- tion changes and the end result is overwhelm and confusion. I t is impor tant to understand that the deliberate confu - sion that is being foisted upon humanity by the use of both ends of the information continuum is purposeful. Too much information along with too little tr uthful and per tinent information is presented simultaneously. This purposefully prohibits thoughtful and intelligent humans from deriving accurate conclusions and reasonably true pictures from the ongoing flo w of information about ev ents and situations. The frustrating search for needed information leads con-"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Becoming 162 cerned members of humanity either to acquiesce or contin- ue to search futilely in order to intuit at least an indication of the true scenario that is going on around them. Knowing there is no way to ascertain all the information, each draws conclusions in the best way possible and experiences confu- sion and distrust. Is there a solution to this dilemma? Consider that it may be best to accept the situation as it appears. It is possible that the confusion and chaos that are planned for humanity to experience and accept are exactly the experience needed. It is expected that mankind will resist and condemn the chaotic conditions and desire an end. If instead these conditions are accepted as a part of the process of the eradication of the very chaos and confusion that are being experienced so that these can be r eplaced with a totally new experience, a shift in the total scenario is inevitable. Indeed, it can be considered that what is going on is inevitable. The current system must br eak do wn in or der that a new one can be put in place. It provides the opportunity for mankind to intercede and cre- ate for itself what it desires. The question at this time is what is it that mankind desires to create? It will be either a continuation of the colo- nization of this planet b y outsiders or the declaration of so v - ereignty and ownership by asserting that the true ownership of this planet belongs to the evolving human population. To this end, these messages ar e dedicated to educating all humans who can be contacted, all those that will take up the gauntlet and recognize their true identity as citizens rather than owned slaves. These must dedicate their life focus to the purpose of declaring the fr eedom of the entir e planet. The scope of thought must be toward recreating the whole. From"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Becoming 163 this perspective it can be seen that the push for a global iden- tity serves this purpose well. Indeed, there are no accidents. The impetus of the desire for the “highest and best good for all concerned” can and will use all facets of existing experi- ence for the greater good when it is released and allowed to do so through focused and encompassing purposeful intent. It requires mature and intelligent beings to thoughtfully consider an unprecedented plan of cooperation for a purpose of the highest possible intention for an entire civilization. This sets forth an opportunity that can, if considered, call forth the memory of the reason why each has incarnated at this time on this planet. All the experiences that have hap- pened thus far in this lifetime pale when compared to the prospect of providing assistance to a beleaguered planet and its numer ous inhabitants that are now denied their rightful freedom to evolve in a positive and supportive environment. This assistance would end the rape and pillage of a richly endo w ed planet and solar system that ar e now being used to support civilizations that have failed to care for their own planetary homes. The change of consciousness fr om victim to sovereign responsibility is the necessary foundation for the fundamen- tal change of the planetar y experience. Commitment to a cooperative focus that clearly delineates the benefits available to be experienced is an impetus for joining a worthwhile cause.

Seldom is such a “sales pitch” given to entice mesmerized units of consciousness to awaken and to activate their previously intended participation. However, this is a well orchestrated and long standing situation that is finally ripe for transition into a different manifestation of human experience. Full participation is welcome indeed. III-46 The information as presented so far has brought forth for each individual a greater understanding of the reason each is present and what each has come forth to accomplish. There have been transitions to contemplate through considering possibilities of the origin and evolvement of mankind on this planet that are far different than those presented by main- stream religion and the organized scientific community. It is inter esting to note that definite and thor oughly r esear ched available artifacts found at many different sites around the planet support the theory of the forced evolution of the orig- inal life forms for the purpose of ser ving outside ownership interests. These facts logically fill in the gaps that the main- stream anthropologists are unable to explain and in doing so discredit their historical conjectures. Through the willing- ness to consider all the possibilities, including the two com- monly debated conflicting origin theories, the thought process has been enhanced. Once “possibility thinking” has been incorporated into the mind/brain process, it changes the way all incoming information is consider ed.

This, of course, is purposeful to shape the collective/mass conscious- ness of the planetary whole to fit within the plan to control and re-engineer the human worker down the evolutionary scale rather than to allow it to spiral upward normally. Once this understanding is firmly established in the minds of the readers of these messages, it naturally focuses the intent toward thwarting this plan by outsiders that is clearly only for their benefit. No intelligent conscious aware- ness desires devolution rather than evolution. It also becomes quite clear that in order to change the future expe- rience, it is not possible to use methodology that has been purposefully introduced and encouraged by the outside influence that obviously has psychologically planned every human experience to fit within their o verall strategy of con- trol. It becomes necessary to understand that in order to out- maneuver these planners, it is necessary to move to a strate- gy that is at least one step abo v e their model pr ogram proce- dures. Their methods of operation involve using the Universal Laws in a focus that is not in harmony with the flo w of energy generated by the expression of pure poten- tiality into greater self-contemplation. The plan of devolu- tion of the humans on this planet is in dir ect opposition to this flow. It is then obvious that the intent to create a differ- ent experience is established by purposefully invoking the U niv ersal Laws to act within the flow that moves expansive- ly through evolution of species. There is no manifestation of experience or object with- out thought first conceiving and then projecting the desired design into the limitless field of undiffer entiated energy that is available and waiting to fill the mold created by the"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Becoming 166 intended design. When the Laws are invoked in harmony with their purpose and released to fill in the details of the basic pattern, wondrous results happen. In contrast, as has been stated previously, to use the Laws in a contrary flow, every detail must be delineated and held firmly in concen- trated focus not only to create the design, but also to hold it in place. Consequently as the pattern becomes more and more detailed, it also becomes more and more fragile. If the focus is released, the natural “thought thinking” process would recognize the disharmony with its original purpose and begin a self-destr uction process. The overview provided by this discussion allows for the reader to comprehend a larger picture/understanding of the situation in which the planet Earth and its inhabitants find themselves at this moment in its history. The word “transcend” means to “rise above, transform, excel.” In order to continue on their path of ev olution, humanity must “transcend” this current expe- rience. To do that, it must “rise above” those that would thwart that natural progress. Because thought is the basis of creation, it then becomes apparent that mankind must “think” in a way that is “above and beyond” their jailers, using a “ transformativ e ” conceptual pattern as their basis of intent. This could be further assisted if variations appear in humanity’s behavior pattern that is inconsistent with what is “ expected ” to be their reaction to the programmed plan of contr ol. V ariations in humanity ’ s pr ojected ster eotype behavior cause attention to shift away from the concentra- tion needed to hold their expanding pattern in place. This then would w eaken their ability to hold their fragile model in form. The question comes to mind as to how this all impor-"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Becoming 167 tant “pattern of control” is held in place by the varied groups that make up the support focus provided by the members of humanity that are in league with those that are now in con- trol of the planet. The answer is very simple! Ritual! At the basis of all-ritual, religious or fraternal, public or secret, either similar wording or similar intent is present. All of these are purposefully mind controlling and limit the behav- ior of those that take part in them even after these may have left the group and no longer practice the rituals. The con- cepts imparted continue to exert influence. The impact of par ticipation in ritualistic routine designed to limit and control is thorough and often difficult to transcend. This is so because the patterns of limitation at the basis of its pur- pose tend to permeate many areas of thought and influence decisions that limit “possibility thinking.” Are all rituals devolutional? That depends upon the basic purpose and whether or not those practicing the ritual r emain free of any desire to control or use the ritual for any devious purpose. It is difficult to invoke and hold a ritual to its original intent for any length of use. Consequently, spontaneity in medita- tion/prayer is strongly suggested. I t may seem that just about all components of curr ent life on the planet are tainted in some way with purposeful harm in mind. Certainly far-reaching efforts are being made to contr ol ev ery possible attitude and opinion. The human psy che has been examined extensiv ely for the purpose of limiting and reversing the progress that has been made by the human beings either of origin or transplanted her e.

That in itself should indicate the tenuous success of the plan that is being foisted on humanity . It is time to begin thinking indepen- dently including as many possibilities “as possible” about what is being provided as guidance from all sources meant to influence experiencing the gift of life. Consider the source and what might be the purposeful intent.

This is a constant and ongoing process with regard to all information received from all sources. How much change happens within each reality format depends upon the flexibility of the individual psyche. What is gleaned from the messages as acceptable information varies with each individual.

While it is focused toward birthing a new paradigm of experience for the human expe- rience on this planet, it brings with it other changes that will benefit those choosing to incorporate greater flexibility into their concept of experience within a body. Experiencing an active roll in the creation process at the present density of earth’s vibratory level requires the ability to acknowledge, internalize, analyze, and express emotions within the pur- poseful intention of living within the “highest and best good of all concerned.” This is setting up interaction that ripples outwardly in far reaching effects beyond the finite mind’s ability to comprehend. It is the release of the format of expe- rience that must limit to control that has its basis in fear. Control is believed to offset fear in order that change can be slowed and a modicum of “peaceful existence” can be experi- enced. H owever, the control mode requires more control measures to support the original limits and is a self-perpetu- ating negatively expanding cycle. It is the mode that has been adopted by those who would own and “control” this planet and its inhabitants. The intention to create within the U niv ersal Laws focused for the “highest and best good for all concerned” deliberately invokes change. It is through the release of this intention into the Laws that change flows with- in a coor dinated cy cle that is logical and effortless. It is with- in this context that “ fr eedom ” is experienced. When all ar e included, then abundance is experienced in myriad different modes.

It is through wisdom; knowl- edge acquired by living actual realized experience, that greater freedom is realized. This is the reason that life on a 3rd dimensional planet is honored and desired by units of self awareness. To “know” greatly accelerates the evolution of the greater soul matrix of which each is an intricate interactive part. Through this process, a greater understanding of who and what each one is becomes gradually ackno wledged and realized. This carefully discovered self-realization is the foun- dation of all progress. Each recognition adds to the basic understanding, the knowing that each is an essential aspect of the essence of the whole. This whole is incomplete until the totality of it is gathered into the awareness of the true nature of whatev er adventure is the focus to be thoroughly investi- gated and understood in this grand cycle. Forever is incomprehensible. “Now” is the only seg- ment of power available to the conscious awareness. 3rd dimensional awareness continues to focus on the past and the futur e, which r emo v es the consciousness fr om participa- tion in the only available point of influence. Past memory is meant to serve as an informational source to prevent repeti- tion of pr evious inappr opriate experience. The future is an unkno wable point that is av ailable to r eceiv e the experience that will manifest based on intentions and actions made in the “ now” of the current moment.

It has been pointed out that if all the past and future thought was subtracted from the total human focused thought on this planet at any given second, there are very few people actually present. It is something to contemplate carefully. The question then arises as to what is the difference between being absent in future thought and in intending a change to manifest in the future. When a conscious aware- ness is intending a creative thought, that awareness is expe- riencing as if it were actually present in the midst of the intended cr eation. In other words the future intention is being pulled into the present moment as if it already exists. The imagination has that individual either pictorially or emotionally or in both modes, experiencing what is intend- ed as if it already exists in the present moment. How is that possible if only the basic framework is known? The answer is to pr etend that it is known and play with what it might actually be like. Even if only one tiny segment of the whole is examined in the exercise of imagination and enough are simulating this, then a whole will formulate. The thought- thinking segment will coordinate and revise the complexi- ties into a balanced and harmonious format that will ex ceed all expectations. The birth of the new paradigm of experi- ence will begin the change by reorganizing mankind’s daily happenings.

In its collectivized thought process it seems to be coming to the conclusion that enough is enough and that it is time to begin a retaliating process in order to release itself from the relentless onslaught of destructive activities that its boarders are deliberately engaging in at “her” expense. As all manifestations ar e a balance of energies, it may be consid- ered that the Earth is a “womb” or receiver/receptacle of the creative energies that are focused through the star (sun) energy that is the center of this planetary system. At the moment it is the only planet in this solar system supporting 3rd dimensional evolving humans on its surface. While currently known history of this planet seems like a long time in the human r eality system, planetar y history covers what seems like measureless time periods when con- sidered in a sequential time mode. Difficult as it is to encompass, ther e are other logical systems of perceiving the ev o lutionar y pr ocess.

As the perception expands to encompass the greater energetic picture, the self-awareness changes in correlation to this expansion of comprehension abilities. Through the expanded ability to perceive a situation from a more inclusive viewpoint, it is understood in a differ- ent dimensional point of view. In this way, it can be said that life is being experienced within a greater or higher dimension- al plane of observation. This does not indicate an “easier” level of experience, but one that is more inclusive of causes and details that w ent unnoticed within prior available abilities. Acuity of thought along with the desire to know more in order to express more precede dimensional changes. In other words, the ability must be developed and practiced before it is possi- ble to move into the higher dimensions of experience. The move does not come before the development of the skills to experience and maintain the necessar y focus needed to remain at that dimensional level. The shift to higher dimensions is earned (or remem- bered) by practicing now. At the basis of dimensional shifts is appreciation of the gift of self-awareness. This is not accomplished thr ough or in tandem with self-depr ecation. The “self ” always does the best it can within the environ- ment that is provided by its own surrounding thoughts. As it is immersed in self-appr eciation it gr ows in expression.

Each rises within its own world of self-awareness. What others think or what self thinks it has accomplished compared to others is of no value in the over- all journey through 3rd dimensional experience. Each jour- ney is self-contained. Others are present as mirrors in which to observe the self. What is seen in others is the reflection of what the self is unable to see by looking within. It is said that, “each is alone in a hall of mirrors.” Until the self is willing to recog- niz e “itself ” in these mirrors, there is no way to find the door out of the hall. Finding the door already open is always a surprise, for it is impossible to determine when one has reached the ability to embody the facets of self-awareness necessary to integrate into the next dimensional experience. Much hype is circulating about the shift in the earth’s vibra- tions that will “ carry” its inhabitants to a higher dimension. It is firmly stated here and now that humanity’s capability to exist at the next higher level of dimensional experience will determine whether or not individuals will make that change. The earth can and will make such a shift.

If it were not for the horror of “know- ing” the truth of the genocide and enslavement that is planned; few would have the necessary incentive or courage to make the choice. It is simply an “either-or” choice. There is no in-between place to go. Looking at it from that per- spective, certainly creating a new experience based on self appreciation that transcends the victim experience is far more appealing than riding the descending spiral into a long standing gr eater victimhood. There are no rescuers in sight that care to become involved with those with too few “guts” to help themselves.

Countries where the population has little or no access to communications other than government propaganda will require intervention of another kind. Trust that this prob- lem is being given very special attention. Also, remember the hundredth monkey theory. In this case, include a request for special methods of reaching these fellow humans in prayer and meditations. Help can be given for the high- est and best good of those segments of humanity when it is requested for them. In reality it is in support of what they ar e already asking for themselves. The tighter the oppressive situation, the greater the silent outcry of those experiencing it. Freedom to evolve is innately desired by all from the deepest levels of awareness. What may not be spoken, can be thought with great emotion. Though emphasized frequently throughout the mes- sages, the po wer of thought as the prerequisite for the spo- ken word is powerful indeed. When thoughts and words are focused by many in agreement with passion and enthusi- asm, a momentum is built to manifest the desired intention. As more contribute added momentum, the ripples become wav es. When agr eement and cooperation focus a positiv e desire for the highest and best good possible, there is little that can prevent the manifestation of what is intended. What is cr ucial to understand is that in the pr ocess of the cr eation of the ne w , the old must cease to exist, for both cannot share the same space, except as one is declining and the ne w is coming into reality.

It is extremely important that all members of the “ground crew” have a firm understanding of the purpose of the period of chaos. It must happen in order to clear away the old and make space for the new. It also provides added available energies to be siphoned from the chaos and reformatted into the new intended pattern. It will be very challenging to acknowledge the breaking down of personal life patterns when they happen to each one as well as many others and know it is absolutely neces- sary in order to manifest a vastly improved way of life. This is the r eason that the messages began with admonitions to prepare for change in the best ways possible. This is extremely challenging in view of the urban life style the majority of “modern” humanity lives, depending on the availability of food from stores and restaurants that require supplies to be delivered daily from far away sources. Jobs depend on utilities and lines of communications, for fe w produce actual products that would aid in survival. 50 years ago, in times of stress, most people had family living on farms that could assist in providing basic food necessities for at least a period of time.

There are too few of them left to feed the urban multitudes outside the established import system. This is a true picture worldwide. Humans, when there is necessity, can be amazingly cre- ative. But could the modern urban dweller survive if all the modern conveniences were to disappear? Those who have spent their lives in an urban environment would do well to research and plan some “what if ” scenarios with their fami- lies. What would be true necessities if there were only crick- ets for enter tainment? Basic survival necessities are seldom found in the modern urban household. If the faucets don’t provide water, where would it be found and how could it be made drinkable? It is time to consider this basic issue with logic and planning. The answers will not be found on TV, in videos or the movies. There are excellent “homesteading” information sour ces available—magazines and books. There are military survival handbooks, etc. Some are out of print and difficult, but not impossible to find.

Variations are constantly being recalculated to continue their inclusion with- in the whole, which is far greater than can be imagined by finite minds. Thus it is that catastrophic events cause chaos and recalculation down to intricate details and these ripple outward influencing the Universal whole. The greater the cat- astrophe, the greater the chaos during the period of restoring unanimity. Knowing this, great focus is concentrated on areas to prevent such happenings if possible, or at least to lessen the causativ e factors. This is not always possible for the “free will” factor of those intent on causing such episodes cannot be denied. If all the individuals within the area of disharmony are not in agreement with the disruptive focus, then there can be intervening action to counterbalance the intended disruptive action if those in disagreement specifically ask for help to off- set the intended plans. Agr eement with the disruptive plans does not need to be informed agreement. In other words, the plans need not be generally known or understood. Passive agreement through ignorance is still agreement. This is the reason that so much effort has been put forth b y v arious individuals and organizations to aler t and inform the people of this planet that there is indeed a subversive plan moving toward completion. This plan, if allowed to r each completion, will deny natural ev olvement of life on this planet and will allo w sur viv al and enslav ement of only chosen ideal candidates. Those who do become aware of and choose not to agr ee with these plans must then come togeth- er in agr eement to focus on a plan of their o wn to cr eate a different scenario for the populace and ask for what is called Divine intervention. However, this cannot be asked of an"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Becoming 181 unknowable God that may capriciously choose whether to answer or not, depending on His mood that day. Such a God does not exist. Pure potentiality exists with multiple levels of awareness within its expression all the way “down” to 3rd dimensional awareness and even below that level. All these multiple levels of awareness combined may indeed be considered “God.” There are levels within this composite of awareness that are very great indeed. Consequently certain levels of this “God Awareness” can and do hear and answer prayers that are addressed to them correctly, either acciden- tally or thr ough the understanding and application of the Basic Laws that all manifested awareness exists within. To ask is the first important step. To continue to ask never allows the process to move beyond the asking stage. First ask, assume the answer is on its way and then continue to express appreciation that it is happening in its own perfect wisdom and timing. That “wisdom and timing” is greatly influenced by the one asking and how well that awareness is able to follow through with the two remaining steps after the initial asking. This is often called prayer. Nothing can happen until there is first asking. Then the next two steps, assuming it is happening (continued focus of intent) and expression of appreciation (allowance) controls the manifes- tation. It is that simple! A few additional details are helpful. Ask within a frame wor k that allows what might be called “D ivine I ntelligence ” or thought thinking to fill in the details.

It is true that there are those who live in harmony within the “God Energies” that promote evolvement at all levels of potentiality expressing itself. This is the composite of all accumulated wisdom knowing itself and continuing its expansive experience. All awareness is a part of that magnificent pool of intelligence. It is also true that through free will, there are those that are experiencing in disharmony with expansive intent. It is important to understand that self-awar eness can purposefully destroy itself by continuing its negative experience to the point of destruction, because the negative focus lessens (literally pinches off ) the focusing energies of the soul. However destruction by this method of weakening the connection to the soul is very difficult to do. Awareness can “muck ar ound” in negative experiences for the learning that can be gained and then return to harmonious experience. Many of those that might be considered to have great wisdom and experience have pursued both paths. To have a body destroyed by those experiencing within what is consid- er ed negativ e experience does not destr o y the self-awar eness.

The deciding capability is determined by how the resources are shared and for what intent these are used by the inhabitants. If the intent is for the “highest and best good” of all the inhabitants and these are shared in ways that provide for an abundant life experience for all, then the carrying capacity of inhabitants on the planet is considerably greater. It is obvious that that does not describe the curr ent situation. I t is also patently obvious that the curr ent situation cannot continue if the planet is to sustain itself in its present form. The current story line can only end in disaster for both the inhabitants and the planet itself .

It might be said that the alarm bell has been ringing within that awareness for some time now causing the planet to now know that it is time to begin survival maneuvers or its current mode of expression will end. Because of the awesome power of the weaponry of both the planetary inhabitants and those vying to “own” this planet, its total destruction is not outside the realm of possibility. This precarious plight is now known to the totality of awareness that governs the action/reaction of the planetar y processes that are what is called “nature.” The sum total of mining, tremendous weights of water held within dams, surface and underground construction and weapons testing has caused internal pressure anomalies within the planet that are causing the various natural frac- ture lines to become extremely unstable. These fracture lines r emain from previous pressure anomalies and as natural “zippers” to allow for normal shifts and changes in surface features. Add to this the contents of the mass consciousness that include pain, starvation, disease and an enormous out- cry for change and relief. This exists along with the opposite intent to compr ess the human awar eness into a w eaker and weaker embodiment.

The planetary choices are made in the areas where the greatest weakness is found in the earth’s surface areas.

A shift of great enough proportion has not taken place for there to be a weaker point elsewhere on the planetary surface. Other factors enter into the greater picture. The focus of consciousness with regard to concern for the planet and its inhabitants helps to balance that area and r elieve the planetary stress. It is a form of protection for that area. In this way, often the timetable of factual predic- tions of future happenings is slowed or prevented. The mass consciousness of humanity is a powerful component of the planetary whole. That is the reason that such an intense effort has been made to instill involuntary endorsement of the plan for continued outside o wnership by the majority of human inhabitants. Deliberate misinformation and mind control from multiple sources have controlled the basis of human experience for generations in preparation for the favorable shift in multiple cosmic cycles that is hap- pening no w and in the near futur e.
