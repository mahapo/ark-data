I decided to write two volumes which would not onlyexplain the aims of our Movement, but also would reveal the birth of theMovement. I believe my story will be more beneficial than a simple historicaldescription.This work will allow me to describe my own growth in the Movement and assist incrushing the falsehoods about me created by the Jewish press. My writing is not for strangers, but for those heart-strong supporters of theMovement, and those whose minds need enlightenment.I know that men are more rarely won over by the written word than they are bythe spoken word and that every great movement in this world owes its growth togreat speakers, not to great writers.Still, writing is necessary to create a unified doctrine we can distribute. Imust lay down its principles for all time. These two volumes, then, are meant toserve as stones which I hereby add to the foundation of the Movement.Adolf HitlerThe authorLandsberg on the Lech Prison Fortress On November 9, 1923 at 12:30 P. M., thefollowing men who believed in the resurrection of their people, fell in front ofthe Field Marshall's Hall in Munich (Hitler dedicated the first volume to thesemen.

Adolf HitlerVOLUME ONE -- AN ACCOUNTING1. CHILDHOOD HOMEToday, I am pleased that Fate chose the city of Braunau on the Inn of NorthernAustria as my birthplace. This little town is on the frontier of the two Germanstates whose reunion, at least for those of us from the younger generation, willbe the accomplishment of a lifetime. We must do everything we can to reunitethese states.Austria must return to the great German mother country. Not for economicreasons. No, the economics are unimportant. Even if it did not make economicsense, it must still take place because common blood belongs in one commonrealm.The German people have no moral right to setup remote colonies when they cannoteven unite their own children in a common state. The people will only earn theright to acquire foreign soil when the Reich has expanded to include everyGerman. The plow will become the sword, and the wheat which becomes the bread ofposterity will be watered by the tears of war.This little frontier city has now become the symbol of a great undertaking, butit also has a past that we should take as a warning today. More than a hundredyears ago, this humble place had the privilege of being immortalized in Germanhistory as the scene of a tragedy which shook the whole German nation. It wasthe day of our Fatherland's deepest humiliation when the bookseller JohannesPalm, a citizen of Nuremberg, an unapologetic \"Nationalist\" and hater of France,died for the Germany which he loved passionately even in her time of misfortune.(Johannes Philipp Palm was a book dealer in Nuremberg and in 1806 sold apamphlet denouncing France titled Germany's Deepest Humiliation, but Francepreviously invaded and was in control of Bavaria at that time. The Bavarianpolice chief turned him in. He refused to name the author and Napoleon orderedPalm to be shot at Braunau on the Inn, where Hitler was later born and wherethere is a monument to Palm.) Palm stubbornly refused to reveal the names of hisfellows who believed as he did. He was very much like our Leo Schlageter (LeoSchlageter fought in the First World War, joined the Nazi party in 1922, andcommitted acts of sabotage against the French occupation of the Ruhr, and wasbetrayed, tried and executed by the French. He was viewed as a hero in the Naziparty). And, like Schlageter, Palm was betrayed to France by a governmentrepresentative. An Augsburg police director was responsible, and this act laiddown the framework that formed the modern disreputable official Germangovernment under the Reich of Mr. Severing. (Carl Wilhelm Severing was a SocialDemocrat Official in the Weimar government controlling Germany at that time whorefused to make an effort to stop the execution of Schlageter.) This little cityon the Inn, which was made golden as a result of the German martyrdom Imentioned, was German-Bavarian by blood and Austrian only by borders. It is heremy parents lived in the late Eighteen-eighties. My father, a conscientiousemployee of the state as a custom's official, and my mother, occupied with thehousehold, were both, above all, devoted to us children with unwavering love andcare. I do not remember much from that period. After only a few years, my fatherleft the little frontier town he was so fond of so he could take a new post atPassau in Germany itself. In those days, Austrian Customs Officials traveledfrequently. Soon afterward, my father went to Linz where he retired from work.This does not mean the old gentleman had a chance to rest.His family could be called very poor farmers and, even in his earliest days, hehad not lived in a happy home. Before he turned thirteen, the small boy packedhis knapsack and ran away from his home in the mountainous section of lowerAustria. Against the advice of villagers, he chose to go to Vienna and learn atrade. This was back in the Eighteen-fifties, so it was not a simple decision totravel into the unknown with only three crown coins. But by the time thethirteen-year-old turned seventeen, he had passed his journeyman's examinationto be a cobbler, yet he had still not found contentment. To the contrary, thelong period of economic problems back then, the unending misery and wretchednesshe encountered only strengthened his determination to give up his trade andbecome something better. When he was a poor boy in the village, he thought thatthe church pastor embodied the highest possible summit of human aspiration.However, his experience in the big city replaced this notion with the dignifiedpossibility of becoming a state official. With the endurance of a man who hadgrown old through grief and distress while still half a child, theseventeen-year-old mustered up his new determination and became a customsofficial. When he was almost twenty-three, I believe, he decided that he hadachieved the goal he set so long ago. The poor boy had once taken a vow not toreturn to his native village until he had become somebody. He had reached hisgoal, but when he returned, no one in the village remembered the little boy ofyears earlier. As he looked around, he found the village had grown strange tohim. It was no longer the village he remembered from childhood.When he finally retired at fifty-six, he could not stand to live a single day asa donothing, so he bought property in the neighborhood of the Upper Austrianmarket town of Lambach, farmed it, and thus completed the circle of a long andhardworking life by returning to the point where his forefathers began.I believe it was around this time that my first ideals were forming. My constantromping around outdoors, taking the long road to school, and my association withextremely rowdy boys sometimes gravely worried my mother. It also kept me frombeing a stay-at-home soul. So, the few serious ideas I had about my futurecertainly did not point toward my father's career. Even then, my gift forspeaking was developing more or less through violent disputes with my playmates.I had somehow become a little ringleader among my group. I had no troublelearning and completing my lessons at school, but otherwise I was fairly hard tohandle.In my free time, I had singing lessons at the Catholic Monastery's Chapter inLambach, and here I was dazzled by the dignified and magnificent church musicalfestivals. Just as my father had once looked upon the little village pastor, Inow looked at the local religious leader as an ideal to aspire to. At least fora while this was the case. My father did not think very highly of hisquarrelsome boy's vocal talents, and he did not see a future in the church forhis offspring. He had no appreciation for such youthful ideas either. He musthave watched anxiously as my nature clashed with my desires.My desire for that calling soon disappeared and was replaced by hopes that werebetter suited to my temperament. In rummaging through my father's library, Ifound various military books. There was a popular edition of the Franco-PrussianWar of 1870-71; two volumes of an illustrated magazine from those years nowbecame my favorite reading. It was not long before the great heroic battle hadbecome my greatest spiritual experience. From then on, I became more and moreenthusiastic over anything connected with war or at least with being a soldier.This was important to me for another reason. For the first time, I was forced toask myself if there was a difference between the Germans who fought thesebattles and the Germans around me, and if they were different, how were theydifferent? Why did Austria not fight in the war? Why did my father and all theothers in our city not fight? Were we not like all the other Germans? Did we notall belong together? This problem stirred in my young brain for the first time.I learned that not every German was fortunate enough to belong to the Empire ofBismarck. I could not understand this at the time, so I began my studies.Based on my character and especially my temperament, my father decided thatattending a classical secondaryschool (Gymnasium or high school attended fromage 10 to 18 which teaches in Greek or Latin classics, but not vocationalsubjects), would conflict with my personality. He thought a vocational schoolwould be more suitable. His opinion was confirmed by my obvious ability to draw.That was a subject which he believed was neglected in the Austrian humanisticschools. Perhaps his own hardworking life made him think less of classicalstudies, which he considered impractical. Being a man of principle, he hadalready decided that his son should, no, must, become a state employee. His owndifficult youth naturally made his later accomplishments seem even greaterbecause they were the product of his own iron strength and ability. The pride ofbeing a self-made man led him to want the same or better for his son. Hebelieved his own hard work would make it easier for his child to succeed in thesame field.My outright refusal to follow a career that had been his whole life was, to him,quite inconceivable. So, my father's decision was simple, definite, and clear,and, in his eyes, he had an obvious course of action. His lifetime struggle forexistence had made him domineering, and he would have never left an importantdecision to a boy he saw as inexperienced. This would have seemed anunforgivable weakness in the exercise of his parental authority over his child'sfuture. It was impossible for him to reconcile it with his concept of duty. Andyet, it was all destined to end differently.At the time, I was barely eleven, and for the first time in my life, I wasforced to oppose my father. Steadfast and determined as my father might be incarrying out the plans that were fixed in his mind, his son was no less stubbornand resistant in refusing this unappealing idea. I would not enter the civilservice.Neither pleading nor reasoning with me had an affect on my resistance. I wouldnot be an official, \"no\" and again, \"no\". Every attempt to arouse my interest inthat calling through descriptions of my father's experience had the oppositeeffect. I yawned myself sick at the thought of sitting in a government office,not being the master of my own life, but a slave devoting my entire existence tofilling out various forms.What affect could this possibly have on a young boy who was anything but \"good\"in the ordinary sense? I did my school work with ridiculous ease and had so muchfree time left that I was outdoors more than in.Today, when my political opponents scrutinize my life with such loving care---searching back even into my childhood for the satisfaction of uncovering somepiece of deviltry this fellow Hitler was up to in his youth---I thank heaven forthem giving me a few more memories of that happy time. Field and forest were thebattleground where my constantly recurring differences in opinion were settled.Even the attendance at the secondaryschool which followed did little to restrainme. But now another dispute had to be fought out.So long as my father's intention to make me into an official clashed only withmy general dislike of the career itself, the conflict was quite tolerable. Icould withhold my private views and I did not have to make a constant issue ofthem. My own determination never to become an official was enough to give me aninner calm. I clung to this determination firmly.The situation became more difficult when I developed a plan of my own thatopposed my father. This happened when I was still only twelve. I cannot recallhow it happened, but one day it was clear to me that I would be a painter, anartist. My talent for drawing had been clearly demonstrated, and in fact, it wasone of my father's reasons for sending me to a secondaryschool; however, hewould never consider giving me professional art training. On the contrary, whenI rejected my father's pet idea once again, he asked me for the first time whatI myself wanted to be. Without thinking, my decision suddenly popped out. It wasclear my choice had already been firmly planted and would not be changed, andfor a moment my father was speechless.\"A painter? An artist?\" He doubted my sanity and then thought perhaps that hehad not understood correctly. But when I explained it to him, and he saw I wasserious, he was against it completely. Any talents I might have were simplybeyond his consideration. \"An artist! Never, not so long as I live\". But sincehis son had inherited, among various other qualities, a stubbornness like hisown, my answer was equally stubborn. Both sides stuck to their guns. My fatherheld to his \"never\", and I redoubled my \"nevertheless\".The result was not pleasant. The old gentleman was embittered, and, though Iloved him, I was equally bitter. My father forbade me even to hope that I wouldstudy painting. I went a step further and declared that in that case, I wouldnot learn anything more. Of course, I came in second with such a declarationsince the old gentleman began to ruthlessly assert his authority. I then learnedto keep silent in the future, but I did carry out my threat. I hoped that whenmy father saw my lack of progress in school, he would have to let me pursue thehappiness I dreamed of.I do not know whether my calculation would have been correct or not; the onlycertainty was my obvious failure in school. Anything else I learned wassomething I thought I would use later as a painter. Whatever I thought was notconnected to painting, or whatever failed to interest me, I sabotaged. My reportcards from that point on were always in extremes. Next to \"Good\" and \"Excellent\"rankings were \"Passing\", and \"Below Passing\". By far, my best performances werein geography and particularly in world history. Those were my two favoritesubjects.When I look back now, so many years later, I see two facts that are especiallysignificant. First, I became a nationalist. Second, I learned to understand themeaning of history.Old Austria was a national state that consisted of many states. At that time,someone who was a subject of the German Reich could not grasp what this factmeant to their daily life. After the great march of triumph by the army ofheroes in the Franco-Prussian War, the Germans of the Reich had gradually becomeseparated from German elements elsewhere. They did not understand the value orthey were no longer aware of the value in it. The GermanAustrians were tooeasily confused and as a result, the Imperial dynasty decayed along with theotherwise sound and healthy people.They did not understand that if the Germans had not been of the best blood, theywould never have had the ability to impress their character on a state offifty-two million Austrians. The mistaken idea took root, especially in Germany,that Austria was a German state. This was nonsense and the result had graveconsequences, but it was still a brilliant tribute to the ten million Germans inthe Ostmark (The East-Mark or Eastern border lands), Austria because their smallpresence was perceived as a total ownership by distant Germans. Very few in theGerman Reich realized there was a constant struggle to preserve the Germanlanguage, German schools, and German character in Austria.Today, this sad state of affairs has been forced upon millions of our people whodream of a common Fatherland while they sit under a foreign thumb and long topreserve the sacred mother tongue. Finally, people are beginning to realize whatit means to fight for one's nationality. And now, perhaps, a few here and therecan appreciate the greatness of the German population in Ostmark, which throughits own resources, shielded the Reich on the east for centuries, then waged anexhausting guerrilla war to maintain the German language frontier in an age whenthe Reich cared for colonies, but not for its own flesh and blood.As in any battle, there are three groups in the struggle for our language in oldAustria: the fighters, the lukewarm, and the traitors. The sorting processbegins in school. The most remarkable thing about a language battle is that itswaves beat hardest upon the schools. The war is waged over the next generation,and the first war-cry is to the children: \"German boy, do not forget that youare a German\", and \"German girl, remember that you are to be a German mother\".Anyone who understands the soul of youth will realize that young people willreceive this battle-cry with joy. In a hundred ways they carry on the strugglein their own fashion and with their own weapons. They refuse to sing non-Germansongs; they are more enthusiastic over German heroes; the more they aresuppressed, the more they go hungry in order to save pennies for the war-chestof their elders. They have an incredibly sensitive ear for a non-German teacher.They wear the forbidden badges of their own nation and are happy to be punishedfor it. In other words, they are a faithful image in miniature of their elders,except that their devotion is often stronger and more direct.When I was small, I too shared in the struggle for German nationality in oldAustria. Money was collected for the South Mark German League by schoolassociations. We wore cornflowers and black-red-gold badges proclaiming ourbeliefs. (Cornflowers were the symbol of Germans loyal to the HohenzollernMonarchy and of Austrians who supported the PanGerman movement.) \"Heil\" was ourgreeting, and instead of the Imperial anthem, we would sing the German anthem,\"Germany Above All\", (The Song of Germany, Deutschland über alles), despitethreats of punishment. Young people were politically trained at a time whencitizens of a socalled national state still knew very little about their ownnational character other than their language. I was not among the lukewarm evenin those days. I was soon a fanatical German Nationalist. Of course, I do notrefer to the present political party using that name.My nationalistic development was very rapid. By the time I was fifteen, I couldeasily see the difference between the patriotism shown by those who followedrulers in the Imperial dynasty and the true \"nationalism\" for the nation and forthe people. For me, only nationalism existed.Anyone who has not bothered to study the Hapsburg Monarchy ( Austrian RoyalFamily) may find this strong nationalism puzzling. In Austrian schools, there isvery little actual Austrian history worth mentioning. The fate of Austria is socompletely intertwined in the Germanic life that it is unthinkable to separatehistory into German and Austrian. When Germany finally split into two spheres ofauthority, this very separation was German history. The insignia of formerGerman Imperial splendor, displayed for all to see in Vienna, continued itsspell as a reminder of our common and unending life together.The cry of the German people in Austria for a reunion with their German mothercountry when the Hapsburg state collapsed resulted from a deep ache that sleptin the people's hearts. They had never forgotten this longing to return to thehome of their fathers. This can only be explained through the history taught toGermanAustrians, which made those nationalistic feelings grow. Their history isa fountain that never runs dry---a silent reminder in times when it is easier toforget. Though we may be distracted by momentary prosperity, we hear thewhispers of a new future by remembering the past.It is true that the quality of World-History education in intermediate schoolsis in a sad state. Few teachers realize that to memorize and rattle offhistorical dates and events is not true history. It is not important for a boyto know exactly when some battle was fought, some general born, or when someinsignificant monarch was crowned. No, God knows, that is certainly not what isimportant.To truly \"learn\" history means to open your eyes and discover the forces thatcause historical events to happen. The art of reading and of learning meansremembering the important parts and forgetting the unimportant.It is likely that my later life was influenced by the fact that I had a goodhistory teacher. He had a unique ability to teach and test us on principles, notdates. My professor, Dr. Leopold Pötsch of the Linz school, was the veryembodiment of this idea. He was an older gentleman. He was kind, but set in hismanner. His brilliant eloquence not only fascinated us, but absolutely carriedus away. I am still touched when I think of this gray-haired man, whose fierydescriptions often made us forget the present as he conjured us back into dayslong past, and how he could take dry, historical memories from the mists ofcenturies and transform them into living experiences. In his class we were oftenred-hot with enthusiasm, sometimes even moved to tears.I was luckier than most because this teacher not only illuminated the past bythe light of the present, but he taught me to draw conclusions for the presentfrom the past. More than anyone else, he gave us an understanding of the currentproblems.He used our national fanaticism to educate us. He would appeal to our sense ofnational honor, which brought us bad-mannered adolescents to order more quicklythan anything else ever could.This teacher made history my favorite subject. Even then, though he did notintend it, I became a young revolutionary. Indeed, who could possibly studyGerman history under such a teacher without becoming an enemy of a State whoseruling house had such a catastrophic influence on the nation? Who could preservehis allegiance to the emperors of a dynasty that had betrayed the interests ofthe German people again and again for its own petty advantage? Did we not know,even as boys, that this Austrian state had no love for us as Germans, and indeedit could have none? My historical insight into the work of the Austrian HapsburgMonarchy was strengthened by my daily experience. In the north and in the south,foreign people came in and poisoned the body of our nation. Even Vienna becameless and less a German city. The House of the Archdukes showed favoritism to theCzechs at every opportunity. It was the hand of the Goddess of Eternal Justiceand Retribution that overthrew the deadliest enemy of Austria's German naturewhen She struck Archduke Francis Ferdinand by the very bullets he had helped tocast. After all, he was the patron who was charged to protect Austria from thenorthern Slavs.The burdens laid upon the German people were enormous. They suffered unheard-ofsacrifices in taxes and blood. Anyone who was not blind could see theirsacrifice would be in vain. What hurt us most was the fact that these activitieswere shielded by the alliance with Germany. The gradual extermination of Germanqualities in the old Monarchy was to a certain extent sanctioned by Germanyitself. The hypocrisy was evident when the Hapsburg Monarchy worked hard to givethe outside world the impression that Austria was still a German state, and thisonly fanned hatred for that Monarchy into blazing anger and contempt withinAustria.In Germany, the elected members of the government failed to see any of thishappening. It was like they were struck with blindness. They could have walkedbeside a corpse showing signs of decay and proclaim they had discovered signs of\"new\" life. In the alliance between the young German Empire and the Austriansham state grew the seeds of the First World War and of the collapse.Throughout this book, I will more thoroughly detail the problem of thisalliance. It will be sufficient now to say that as a boy I arrived at aninsight, which never left me, but only grew deeper. This insight was that thesafety of German culture in Austria first required the destruction of Austria,and that feelings of nationalism have nothing to do with patriotism to anImperial dynasty. The house of Hapsburg was destined to bring misery on theGerman nation.Even then, this realization created a warm love for my German Austrian homelandand a profound hatred for the Austrian state. I never abandoned how I learned tothink about history either. World history became my inexhaustible source forunderstanding how the present events, that is to say the political situation,came to be. I did not intend to \"learn\" from history; instead, history was toteach me. If I became a political revolutionary so quickly, then I also became arevolutionary in the arts equally fast.The Upper Austrian capital had an excellent theater which put on nearlyeverything. When I was twelve, I saw the heroic William Tell play for the firsttime. A few months later, I saw my first opera, Lohengrin, ( a Wagner operaabout knights). I was totally captivated. My youthful enthusiasm for the masterof Bayreuth (meaning the composer, Wagner; Bayreuth is where he lived until hedied) knew no bounds. Again and again I was drawn to his works and it seemsfortunate to me now that I could attend the smaller performances where I couldget up close, and it actually intensified the experience.Once my painful adolescent years were over, my deep aversion to the calling myfather had chosen for me was even clearer. I knew that I could never be happy asa civil servant. My talent for drawing had been recognized at school, and mydetermination to be an artist was firmly fixed.Neither prayers nor threats dissuaded me. I was going to be a painter and Iwould not be an official for anything in the world. It was curious that, as Igrew older, I took an increasing interest in architecture too. At the time, Ithought it complemented my painting ability and was pleased that my artisticinterests had expanded. I never dreamed that it would all turn out quitedifferently. My calling was to be decided sooner than I could have expected.When I was thirteen, I lost my father suddenly. A stroke took the vigorous oldgentleman, painlessly terminating his earthly career, and plunging us all intothe deepest grief. His deep desire to give his child a livelihood and spare hisoffspring from his own bitter struggle must have seemed unfulfilled. But he hadsown the seeds for a future which neither he nor I could have understood then.There was no outward change yet. My mother continued my education according tomy father's wishes, intending that I prepare for a civil service positioneventually, while I myself was more determined than ever to avoid becoming anofficial. I became less and less interested in school and grew more indifferent.Suddenly, an illness came to my assistance. Within a few weeks, my future andthe subject which caused constant dispute at home was decided for us. I hadserious lung trouble, and the doctor urgently advised my mother against puttingme into a closed-office environment. My attendance at the secondaryschool wasalso interrupted for at least a year. What I had secretly desired for so long,what I had always fought for had now, through this illness, become realityalmost of its own choosing.Pressured by my illness, my mother finally agreed to let me go to the Academy ofFine Arts in Vienna instead of the vocational secondaryschool. The happy days Iexpected to follow seemed to me almost like a beautiful dream and a dream theywere to remain. Two years later, my mother's death put a sudden end to all myfine plans.She died at the end of a long, painful illness which had little room for hope ofrecovery. Even so, the blow to me was terrible. I had honored my father, but Ihad loved my mother.I was forced by need and hard reality to make a quick decision. My father was aman of small means, and what he had saved was largely used up by my mother'sgrave illness. My orphan's pension was not nearly enough to live on. I wascompelled to earn my own bread somehow. With a bag of clothes in my hand and aninextinguishable will in my heart, I set off for Vienna. What my father hadaccomplished fifty years before I hoped to also wrestle from fate. I, too, wouldbe \"something important\", but never an official.2. YEARS OF LEARNING AND SUFFERING IN VIENNAWhen my mother died, Fate had already made its decision.During the last months of her life, I went to Vienna to take the entranceexamination for the Academy. Armed with a thick bundle of drawings, I wasconvinced I would find the examination mere child's play. In thesecondaryschool, I was by far the best draftsman in my class. Since that time,my ability had only improved. My own satisfaction in my ability led me to hopefor the best.There was one single fly in the ointment---my talent for painting was frequentlyexceeded by my ability as a draftsman, especially in architecture. My interestin architecture kept growing. My interest accelerated when I visited Vienna fora couple of weeks before I turned sixteen. I went to the art gallery of theCourt Museum and found I had eyes almost solely for the museum itself. Fromearly morning until late at night, I trotted from one sight to another, but onlythe buildings really held my attention. I could stand for hours looking at theOpera House and for hours admire the Parliament buildings. The Ringstrasse(circular street in the old town section of Vienna) section seemed like anenchantment from the stories out of a Thousand and One Nights.I was now in the beautiful city for the second time. I waited for the results ofmy entrance exam as I was filled with excitement, impatience, and proudconfidence. I was so certain of success that when I received a rejection, itstruck me like a bolt from the blue. And yet, that was it, period. When I calledon the head of the Academy and asked the reasons why I had not been admitted tothe School of Painting, he assured me that my drawings showed I had no aptitudefor painting and that my true ability was in the field of architecture. TheSchool of Painting was out of the question, but the School of Architecture wasfor me, even though at first they found it difficult to believe that I had neverattended an architectural school or had any instruction in architecture.As I left Hansen's magnificent building on the square, I was at odds with myselffor the first time in my young life. What I had just been told about myabilities was like a lightning flash illuminating an unexplainable confusion inme that had been growing for a long time. Within a few days, I knew I would bean architect someday.I could see the path before me would be enormously difficult. Everything I hadbeen too stubborn to learn in secondaryschool was now taking its bitter revenge.Admission to the Vienna Academy School of Architecture required attendance ofthe Building School of Technology, and admission here was based on graduationand the final exams from an intermediate school. I did not have either. Itseemed my dream of art was now impossible. After the death of my mother, Ireturned to Vienna, this time to stay for some years. I once again regained mycalm and determination. My earlier spirit of defiance had also returned and Iwas determined to reach my goal. I would be an architect. Obstacles exist to beovercome, and I would overcome those obstacles with the image of my fatherbefore my eyes. He fought his way from farm boy and shoemaker to state official,and my soil was richer than his, so my battle should be that much easier. Whathad then seemed to me to be the unkindness of Fate I accept as the wisdom ofProvidence. When the Goddess of Trouble embraced me and often threatened tocrush me, the will to resist grew, and at last that will was victorious.That period made me strong. I thank her for snatching me from the emptiness of acomfortable life and for pulling this mama's boy out of the comfortable, cozybed. I was reluctantly thrown into the world of misery and poverty, whichintroduced me to those I would later fight for.That is the point when I saw two dangers approaching. Previously, I did nottruly understand their names or their importance to the German people'sexistence. Their names were Marxism and Jewry.Vienna is widely considered the very essence of innocence and bliss as thefestive home of happy crowds. It has turned into a constant reminder of thesaddest period in my life. Even today, the city stirs only gloomy thoughts inme. Five years of misery and wretchedness are encapsulated in the name of thisPhaeacian city (Phaeacia is the final city visited by Homer in the Odyssey;however, it is also a common knowledge reference in Germany and something anyGerman would recognize. The belief is that the people liked to enjoy life andthe reference means a city of loafers or donothings, or parasites.). For fiveyears I had to earn my bread, and as a small painter, my bread was meager atbest. It was never enough to satisfy my hunger. In those days, hunger was myfaithful sidekick who never left me. When I bought a book, he shared it with me.A trip to the opera would give me his company for days. It was a never-endingbattle with my unsympathetic friend. In those lean days, I learned faster than Ihad ever learned before. Besides my architecture and a rare ticket to the opera,books were my only remaining pleasure.I read voraciously. I used any free time I found to study. After a few years, Iwas able to lay the foundations of a knowledge which I still live on today. Atthat time, I formed an image and a concept of the world which had become therock solid foundation of my present political activity. Since that time, Ineeded only to learn a little beyond what I had already assembled because Ifound there was nothing in my image that required changing.On the contrary, today I firmly believe that all creative ideas usually appearin youth if they exist at all. I must distinguish this from the wisdom of age,which is a thoroughness and caution forced by the experiences of a long life.This is different from the genius of youth who pours out unending thoughts andideas while their great number prevents them from being developed. This youthfulgenius furnishes the foundation from which an older and wiser man can buildstones into a structure. At least that is the case if the socalled wisdom of agedoes not choke the genius of youth.My early home life differed little from the home life of others. I could watchfor the next day without a care and without any problems to worry over. My youthwas spent in lower middle class circles. That is to say, I was in a world thatwas not in contact with those who worked at pure physical labor. Strange as itmay seem at first glance, economic differences between this level and that ofditch diggers is often deeper than one thinks. This antagonism comes from asocial group which has just recently lifted itself from the ranks of physicallabor and is afraid it could fall back, or at least be counted as one of them.There is often a repulsive memory of cultural poverty among this lower middleclass, so any social contact with physical laborers, which they feel they haveoutgrown, becomes unbearable.Aman from the higher social levels can mix with worker classes in a way thatwould be thinkable to the relative newcomers of this lower middle class.A newcomer to a social class is anyone who fights his way by his own energy fromone position in life to a higher one. But eventually, this bitter battle killsoff human sympathy for the class he escaped. One's own painful struggle forexistence destroys his feeling for the misery of those left behind.In this respect, Fate took pity on me. By forcing me back into the world ofpoverty and insecurity, which my father had once abandoned, the blinders of alimited lower middle class education were removed from my eyes. Only then did Ilearn how to distinguish between a hollow or brutal man's exterior and his innernature.In the early years of this century, Vienna was among the most socially unhealthyof cities. It was a combination of glittering wealth and revolting poverty.In the center of the inner districts, one felt the heartbeat of an empire offifty-two million people along with the dangerous magic of this State of mixednationalities. The blinding magnificence of this cultural and government centerwas like a magnet to the wealth and intelligence of the State. On top of thatcame the extreme centralization of the Hapsburg Monarchy. It offered the onlypossibility of holding this stew of peoples together. The result was anextraordinary concentration of high government offices in the capital and aroundImperial residence.Vienna was not only the political and intellectual center, but also the economiccapital of the old Danube Monarchy. In contrast with the army of high officers,officials, artists, and scholars were a larger army of workers who were againstthe wealth of the aristocracy and their practice of bleeding poverty for allthey could.The palaces of the Ringstrasse (a circular street in Vienna), became a waitingroom for thousands of the unemployed, and below the arch of triumph of oldAustria, the homeless lived in the twilight and slime of the sewers.There was not one German city where the social situation could have been betterstudied than in Vienna. Do not be misled. This \"studying\" cannot be done fromabove. Someone who has not been in the clutches of this viper cannot truly knowits venom. Studying from above results in superficial chatter or the formationof false opinions based on emotion. Both are harmful: one because it can neverreach the heart of the problem; the other because it passes by the problementirely. I do not know which is more devastating---to ignore those who lack thebasic necessities such as we see in those who are favored by fortune or livewell as a result of their own effort, or is it those who stand tall in theirfashionable skirts or trousers and \"feel for the people\" because it is thelatest fad. In any case, these people commit a sin greater than their limitedintelligence will ever allow them to understand.Then, they are astonished when their fashionable \"social conscience\", which theyproudly display, never produces any results. When their fruitless goodintentions are resented, they blame the ingratitude of the people. People withminds like this fail to understand that there is no place for merely socialactivities. When the masses want results, social displays are not enough andthere can be no expectation of gratitude for such a show. It is not a matter ofdistributing favors, but of retribution and justice.I did not learn about the social problem by observing from the outside. It drewme into its magic circle of suffering and instead of teaching me, it sought totest its strength on me, and it receives no credit if I survived its tests safeand sound. I could never completely relate my sensations from that time; I canonly describe the essential and most staggering impressions here along with thelessons I learned.I rarely had difficulty finding work. I was not a skilled worker but had to earnmy bread as best I could, so I did so as a helper or day laborer. I had theattitude of the laborers of Europe who shake the dust from their feet with theirdetermination to build a new life and a new home in the New World. (The NewWorld means the United States, which was receiving a large number of immigrantsat the time.) They are free from preconceived notions of occupation and socialbackground, of status and tradition, and they grasp any means of support that isoffered to them. They go to any job and gradually arrive at the realization thathonest labor is no disgrace, no matter what kind of labor it may be. I, too, wasdetermined to leap with both feet into a world that was new to me and to find myway through it.I soon learned that someone always needs some kind of work, but I learned justas quickly how easy it is to lose that support again. The insecurity of one'sdaily bread soon became one of the darkest aspects of my new life. The skilledworker is turned out on the street less often than the unskilled, but even hecan be pushed out the door. Instead of losing his job because he is not needed,he is locked out or he strikes.This dependence reveals a weakness in the whole economic system. The peasant boywho is drawn to the big city by the promise of easier work and shorter hours isaccustomed to a certain amount of security. He has never left one job withouthaving another or at least the prospect of another lined up.As more boys are drawn to the city, the shortage of farm labor takes its tolland the chance of being unemployed increases. Now, it would be a mistake tothink that the young fellow who goes to the big city is made of sterner stuffthan the one who stays home and makes an honest living from the soil. No, quitethe contrary. Experience shows that emigrant groups are more likely to be madeup of the healthiest and most energetic individuals. And these emigrants includenot only the man who goes to America, but also the young farm-hand who leaveshis native village to move to the distant big city. He is just as prepared foran uncertain fate as the farm boy going to another country. Usually, he comes totown with a little change in his pocket to last him at least a day if he doesnot immediately find work. However, his situation will quickly worsen if hefinds a job then loses that job at the wrong time. Finding a new job as a workercan be almost impossible in winter months. For the first few weeks, he receivesunemployment benefits from his union and does his best to survive. But when hislast penny is gone and the union benefits expire, he then finds himself in adifficult position.He walks the street as his stomach growls, perhaps pawns or sells his lastpossessions. His clothes become fewer in number and worse in condition, whichdrags down his appearance. Soon he finds himself in surroundings that corrupthim not only physically, but spiritually. If he then becomes homeless in winter,his suffering becomes even more intense. Eventually, he is able to find somesort of work under a union, but then the game begins all over again. He is hit asecond time with unemployment in the form of a strike, then the third time maybe even worse. Gradually he learns to become indifferent to the constantinsecurity of his finances. The cycle changes into a habit that he continueswithout further consideration.We now have an otherwise hardworking man whose attitude toward life grows slackand gradually matures him into a tool of those unions who will merely use him togain their own advantage. He has so frequently switched between working andnon-working through no fault of his own that he no longer notices whether thestrike in which he takes part will secure him any economic rights or whether itis an attempt to destroy the State, the whole social order, and evencivilization itself. He may not like the idea of going on strike, but he iscompletely indifferent when he is handed strike papers.I have watched this process a thousand times with my own eyes. The longer I sawthe game continue, the more I disliked this city of millions. It greedily sucksmen in, then cruelly wears them to pieces. When men came to the city, they stillbelonged to their nation. When they stayed, they were lost to it.Life threw me around in the great city, too. I felt the full force of such afate, body and soul. I discovered something else as well---quickly switchingbetween periods of work and unemployment along with the seesawing of income andexpenses eventually destroyed many people's sense of thrift and intelligentplanning. The body becomes accustomed to living high in good times and starvingin bad. They no longer make any effort to plan sensibly in good times, for thebad times they know will come. Indifference surrounds its victim with a miragewhich makes them see only well-fed prosperity, regardless of their truecircumstances. This mirage grows to such morbid intensity that they give up allself-control the moment wages begin to flow into their pocket. That is why a manwho has difficulty finding any work stupidly forgets to plan for bad times whenhe does find work. He, instead, lives greedily and indulges in the moment. Histiny weekly income is instantly spent because he does not even plan for theremainder of the week. At first, his wages last five days instead of seven, thenonly three, then scarcely a day, to be at last squandered the first evening.These men are not all living life by themselves. They likely have a wife andchildren at home. Their family is also poisoned by this way of life, especiallyif the man is naturally kind to them and even loves them in his way. Before theweek's pay has evaporated in two or three days, they eat and drink as long asthe money holds out. They then go through the remaining days together on emptystomachs. Then, the wife slinks about the neighborhood, borrowing a bit here andthere, opening charge accounts with the shopkeepers, and trying thus to survivethe terrible later days of the week. At noon, they all sit at a table which doesnot contain enough for everyone, if it contains anything at all. They sit,waiting for the next payday, talking of it, making plans. While they starve,they are already lost in the mirage of the good fortune which comes on payday.The children, even in their youngest days, will come to see this wretched lifeof empty fantasy as normal. The situation can become worse if the man lives likethis and the wife objects for the sake of their children. Then, there arequarrels and bad blood, and the more the husband drifts apart from his wife, thenearer he drifts to alcohol. Every Saturday, he becomes drunk. Now, his wifemust fight for the few pennies she can snatch from him in an effort ofselfpreservation for herself and the children. What she can get is only what isleft over from his journey between the factory and the bar. When he finallycomes home on Sunday or Monday night--- drunk, brutal, and penniless---there arelikely to be scenes that would wring tears from a stone.I saw all this going on in hundreds of cases. At first, I was disgusted oroutraged. I later came to realize the tragedy of this suffering and tounderstand its deeper causes. They were the unhappy victims of evilcircumstances. The housing conditions of those days were worse. The housingsituation of the Viennese laborer was absolutely frightful. I shudder now when Ithink of those wretched caverns some lived in, of the houses where journeymen ofa common trade lived together, and mass dormitories which were sinister picturesof refuse, filled with disgusting filth and worse.It was bound to happen. The flood of slaves set loose from these squalid cavespours down upon the rest of the world, upon its thoughtless fellow men! It isbound to happen again. This other world lets things drift without thinking aboutthe consequences. It has lost its instinct to tell it that sooner or later, Fatewill move toward retribution unless mankind placates destiny before time runsout.I am indeed thankful to a Providence for sending me to that school of hardknocks in the city. There, I could not sabotage what I did not like. I had toquickly grow up. If I wanted to avoid falling into despair because of the peoplewho surrounded me, I had to learn the distinctions between their outer characterand inner life and the circumstances that created their lives.Only through this understanding could I bear it all without giving up todespair. It was no longer human beings who rose before me out of unhappiness andmisery, out of squalor and physical degradation, but the sad products of sadlaws. At the same time, my own fight for life, which was no easier than theirs,preserved me from becoming emotionally involved with the products of this illsociety and allowed me to remain objective. No, emotional sentimentality willnot help understanding here. Even then I saw that only a two-fold path couldlead to the improvement of such conditions.I experienced a deep feeling of social responsibility to establish a bettersystem for our development. I knew it would require brutal determination todestroy this human outgrowth which had no chance of being preserved andcorrected. Nature does not focus on preserving what exists; nature concentrateson breeding a new generation to perpetuate the species. It is almost impossiblefor man to improve those bad things that exist in society, but it is much easierto create healthier paths from the start.Even during my struggle for existence in Vienna, I realized the task ofimproving social elements could never be a frivolous welfare scheme. They areridiculous and useless. Instead, we must overcome the fundamental weaknesses inthe organization of our economic and cultural life. The holes in the system arebound to lead to the perversion of individuals, or at least they are capable ofdoing so.Wavering judgment is the enemy that will halt our advance when we need to usethe most brutal weapons against a criminal group that is hostile to the state.This uncertainty results from a feeling of personal guilt and responsibility forthe tragic decline of society. Uncertainty cripples any serious and firm resolveand results in opinions swaying from one side to the other, leaving any decisionthat is made weak and half done, even when it comes to the most essentialmeasures of selfpreservation. Only when there comes an age not haunted by theshadow of its own guilt will there be both the inward calm and the outerstrength, which can brutally and ruthlessly prune the dead limbs and uproot theweeds in our society's garden.The Austrian state had no real social legislation or system for administrationof justice at all. Its weakness in suppressing even the worst abuses was obviousto everyone. I do not know what horrified me more---the economic misery of myneighbors, their moral weakness, or the low state of their intellectualdevelopment.How often does our social class rise up in righteous indignation when it hearssome wretched tramp say he does not care whether he is a German or not? He saysthat he is equally happy anywhere so long as he has what he needs to live on!This lack of \"national pride\" should be deeply condemned and such statementsshould be loudly admonished. How many have really asked themselves why their ownway of thinking is better? How many realize there are countless reminders of thegrandeur of the fatherland in every field of culture and art? When thesereminders are combined, those affected have a justified pride in belonging tosuch a fortunate people.Pride in the fatherland is built on knowing about its greatness in all thesefields. Have the members of our social class noticed that this knowledge, whichis needed to instill pride for the fatherland, is not available to the people?We cannot use the excuse that \"it is the same in other countries\" because theworker in other countries has no difficulty holding onto his nationality.Even if this were so, it would be no excuse for one's own shortcomings. TheFrench people teach France's greatness in every department of culture, or as theFrenchman says, of \"civilization\", and we foolishly dismiss it as a fanaticalglorification in their upbringing.The young Frenchman is simply not trained to be objective, but instead he isgiven a subjective attitude of greatness anywhere the political or culturalaspect of his fatherland is concerned. This type of education has to bewidespread and, if necessary, it must be pounded into the people's memories andfeelings by perpetual repetition.With us there is both the sin of omission and a destruction of what little wewere lucky enough to learn in school. The rats infecting our political systemgnaw even the tiny bit we have learned out of the hearts and memories of ourpeople. Poverty and wretchedness have also done their share to crush thesememories.Here is an example: in a basement consisting of two stuffy rooms lives alaborer's family of seven. Among the five children is a boy of three years. Thisis the age when a child first becomes conscious of things around him. Giftedpeople carry memories of that period far into old age.The small, overcrowded space produces an unfortunate situation. The conditionsoften generate quarrels and bickering. The people are not living with oneanother; they are merely living in the same place, squeezed together. Everysmall argument leads to a sickening quarrel. In a larger dwelling, the argumentwould be easily smoothed out simply by separation. The children may toleratethese conditions because children can quarrel constantly and forget the argumentquickly. However, a daily battle between parents slowly teaches the children alesson. The dispute may take the form of a father's brutality to a mother, ofdrunken maltreatment. Any person who does not know of this life can hardlyimagine it. By the time the boy goes from three to six, he has developed aworking idea of the world which must horrify even an adult. Now, he is morallyinfected and physically undernourished, and the young \"citizen\" is sent toprimary school with vermin living in his poor little scalp.Now, with great difficulty, he must learn reading and writing, and that is aboutall he can manage.Studying at home is out of the question. Father and mother argue and uselanguage that would not be socially appropriate right in front of their ownchildren, making studying impossible. But when the parents talk to teachers andschool officials, they are more inclined to talk roughly to them than to turntheir young child over their knee and introduce him to reason. Nothing thelittle fellow hears at home strengthens his respect for his fellow human beings.They never utter a good word about humanity. No institution is safe from theirprofane attacks, from the school teacher to the head of the state. No matterwhether it is religion or morals, state or society, everything is defamed anddragged in the muck. When the boy leaves school at the age of fourteen, it ishard to tell which is greater---his incredible stupidity where common knowledgeand basic skills are concerned, or his biting disrespect and bad manners.The immoral displays, even at that age, make one's hair stand on end.He holds almost nothing sacred. He has never met true greatness, but he hasexperienced the abyss of everyday life. What position can he possibly occupy inthe world which he is about to enter? The three-year-old child has become afifteen-year-old who despises all authority. Aside from filth and uncleanliness,he has yet to find anything which might stir him to any high enthusiasm.As he begins the more demanding parts of his life, he falls into the ruts he haslearned from his father. He wanders about, comes home Heaven knows when, beatsthe tattered creature who was once his mother, curses God and the world, andfinally he is sentenced to a prison for juvenile delinquents.Here, he gets his final polish.His fellow-citizens are astonished at his lack of national enthusiasm. They seetheater and movies, trashy literature, and yellow press day-by-day pouring outpoison. Then, they are surprised at the low morality and the nationalindifference of the people. They do not realize movie trash, cheap journalismand the like would never produce the skills needed to recognize the greatness ofthe Fatherland! I finally realized something I had never even dreamed of before.The ability to \"nationalize\" a people is primarily a question of creatinghealthy social conditions that can be used to educate the individual. Only whenupbringing and school training have taught a man the political greatness of hisown Fatherland will he achieve an inner pride that comes from belonging to sucha great people. You can fight only for something you love. You can love onlywhat you respect. You can respect only what you know.When my interest in social problems was aroused, I began to study it thoroughly.A world that had been so strange to me before suddenly began to open up.In 1909 and 1910, I no longer needed to earn my daily bread as a laborer. Istarted working independently as a draftsman and watercolor artist. This line ofwork was difficult financially; there was barely enough earnings to keep bodyand soul together. However, it was great in that it was closer to my chosenprofession. I was no longer dead tired when I came home from work in theevening, unable to even look at a book without dozing off. My new workparalleled my future profession. As master of my own time, I could now plan itbetter than before. I painted to earn a living and learned for pleasure.I was also able to round out my understanding of the social problem by buildinga necessary understanding of the theoretical background. I studied pretty muchevery book on the subject I could get my hands on and plunged myself in my ownthoughts. My acquaintances must have thought I was more than a little eccentric.I passionately pursued my love of architecture. Along with music, I thoughtarchitecture was the queen of the arts. It was not \"work\" to spend time on it,but the height of happiness. I could read or draw late into the night and itnever made me tired. My faith was strengthened by the dream of a future thatwould become a reality after all. Even though it took years, I was firmlyconvinced that I would make my name as an architect.The fact that I also took great interest in anything having to do with politicsdid not seem especially significant. On the contrary, I felt that was the dutyof all thinking people. Anyone who did not actively learn about politics lostall rights to criticize or complain. In this area, I continued to read andlearned a lot.My definition of \"reading\" may be different from the average person'sdefinition. I know people who \"read\" all the time--- book after book, word forword---but I would not call them well-read. They do have a mass of knowledge,but their brain does not know how to divide it up and catalog the material theyhave read. They cannot separate a book and identify what is valuable and what isworthless for them. They retain some in their mind forever, but cannot see orunderstand the other parts at all.Reading is not an end in itself, but a means to an end. In the first place, itshould help to fulfill an individual's personal framework and give each personthe tools and materials a man needs in his job or profession, whether it is fordaily necessity, simple physical fulfillment, or higher destiny. In the secondplace, reading should give a man a general picture of the world.In either case, what is read shouldn't simply be stored in the memory like alist of facts and figures. The facts, like bits of a mosaic tile, should cometogether as a general image of the world, helping to shape this world image inthe reader's head. Otherwise, there will be a confusion of information learned,and the worthless mix of facts gives the unhappy possessor an undeserved highopinion of himself. He seriously believes he is \"cultured and learned\" whilethinking he has some understanding of life and is knowledgeable simply becausehe has a stack of books by his bed. Actually, every piece of new informationtakes him further away from the real world, until often he ends up either in apsychiatric hospital or as a \"politician\" in government.No man with this kind of mind can ever retrieve from his jumbled \"knowledge\"what is appropriate when he needs it. His intellect is not filled with his ownlife experiences, but is filled with what he has read in books and in whateverorder the content happened to land in his head. If Fate reminded him tocorrectly use what he has learned in his daily life, it would also have to citevolume and page or the poor guy could never find what he needed. But since Fatedoes not do this, these \"knowledgeable\" men are embarrassed when it reallycounts. They search their minds frantically for appropriate comparisons andusually end up with the wrong idea. If this were not the case, then it would beimpossible to understand the political achievements of our learned governmentheroes in high places unless we decided they are mischievous and not mentallydisturbed.A person who has mastered the art of proper and true reading can read any book,magazine, or pamphlet and immediately spot everything he believes he needs toremember, either because it fits his purpose or because it is generally worthknowing. What he has learned then takes its proper place in his imaginationconcerning the matter at hand. It can then either correct or complete that imageto increase its correctness or clarity in his mind. If life suddenly presentssome question that requires examination or a solution, the memory stored throughthis reading method will instantly recall the already imagined picture as astandard and will bring out individual bits of information on the subject whichhave been retained through decades, and that will be the basis for theintelligence used to clarify or answer the question. Only then is there senseand purpose in reading.A speaker who does not study the materials to back up the issues he deals withwill never be able to fight effectively for his opinion when challenged, even ifit is absolutely true. In every discussion, his memory will fail him as hestammers to find someone else's words to repeat. He cannot connect to thereasoning he needs to enforce what he says or argue with his opponent. When theresult is just a matter of personal ridicule, as with a speaker, this may not befatal, but it becomes serious if Fate places one of these incompetentknow-it-alls in a high position such as a head of state. Then it is seriousindeed.Even at a very young age, I was careful to read \"properly\", and this skill hashelped me tremendously by improving my memory and understanding. In this light,my time in Vienna in particular was fruitful and valuable. The experiences ofdaily life stimulated me to constantly study. Being in a position to supportreality with theory and to test theory by reality, I was prevented from eithersuffocating in theories or growing superficial in how I judged reality.My experiences in daily life guided and encouraged me to make a thorough,theoretical study of two vital questions aside from the social problem.Who knows if I would have ever become absorbed in the doctrines and character ofMarxism if my life had not simply rubbed my nose in it! In my youth, I knewalmost nothing about Social Democracy and what I did know was wrong. I thoughtit was a good thing that the Social Democrats were fighting for the right of allmen to vote by secret ballot. Even then my mind told me this had to weaken thehated Hapsburg regime. I was also convinced the Austrian state could never bemaintained unless it sacrificed the German element living in Austria. Even atthe cost of slowly converting the German element to Slavs, there was noguarantee the empire would survive since their ability to preserve a Slavicsociety is highly doubtful.Therefore, I was excited about any development which I thought would lead to thecollapse of this unstable state that has condemned to death the Germanism of tenmillion people. The more the language uproar gnawed at the parliament, thecloser the hour of collapse approached for this Babylonian Empire, and thecloser the freedom of my GermanAustrian people came near. (Babylonian Empire isa reference to the Tower of Babel story where the people were cursed to speakdifferent languages and scattered around the world.) This was the only way thata return to the old mother country could someday happen.The activities of the Social Democrats did not seem unattractive to me at thetime. I thought it was also a good thing that they were trying to improve theliving conditions of the working man. At that time, I was still innocent andstupid enough to believe this could happen. What did repel me was their hostileattitude toward the fight for the preservation of Germanism and their pitifulwooing of the Slavic \"comrades\" who were willing to accept this courtship andmake concessions. Otherwise, they maintained an arrogance and conceit, whichgave these insistent beggars their just reward.At the age of seventeen, I had become somewhat acquainted with the word Marxismand I thought Socialism and Social Democracy were identical ideas. Again, thehand of Fate opened my eyes to this unprecedented fraud on the people.So far, I had encountered the Social Democratic Party only as a spectator at afew mass demonstrations without gaining any insight into the mindset of itssupporters or the nature of its doctrine. Now, at one moment, I met face-to-facewith the results of its training and who supported its \"WorldConcept \". In thecourse of a few months, I learned something that otherwise may have takenyears---an understanding of a disease masquerading as social virtue and the loveof one's neighbor---a disease which humanity must free the earth from or theearth would soon be freed of humanity. My first encounter with Social Democratswas on a construction job.It was not a good situation from the very beginning. My clothes were still ingood shape, my language was cultivated, and my manner reserved. I had so much todo in dealing with my own Fate that I couldn't trouble myself with the worldaround me. I was looking for work only to avoid starving and so that I couldeducate myself no matter how long it took. I might not have paid any attentionto my new surroundings if an event on the third or fourth day had not compelledme to immediately adopt a new attitude. I was asked to join the organized union.My knowledge of the tradeunion organization at that time was zero. I could nothave proved whether or not it was in any way useful. When I was told I mustjoin, I refused. My grounds for refusal were that I did not understand thesituation, and I would not be forced to do anything. Maybe this was the reasonthey did not throw me out immediately. They may have hoped they could convert meor wear me down within a few days. In either case, they were very mistaken.Within a couple of weeks, I had reached the end of my rope. During that time, Igained a better understanding of my surroundings and no power in the world couldhave forced me to join an organization whose members acted the way they did.The first few days I was further annoyed. At noon, some of the men went tonearby bars, while others stayed on the lot and ate their pitiful lunch. Thesewere the married men whose wives brought them their soup in heavily-worn bowls.As the week progressed, their numbers grew. I figured out the reason later. Whenthey finished their soup, they would talk politics.I drank my bottle of milk and ate my piece of bread somewhere out of the way asI cautiously studied my new surroundings or considered my misfortune. Still, Iheard more than enough and it seemed that people crept up beside medeliberately, hoping to force me to make my beliefs clear. In any case, what Iheard irritated me to the extreme. They were against everything---thenation---because they thought it was an invention of the \"capitalistic\" classes.I heard that constantly! They were against the Fatherland, as a tool of theprivilegedclass to exploit the workers; the authority of law, as a way tooppress the working class; the schools, as an institution to train slaves andslave-owners; religion, as a means of stupefying the people so they could beexploited; morals, as a symbol of stupid, sheep-like patience; etc. There wasnothing they didn't drag through the mud.At first, I tried to stay quiet, but finally I could no longer hold my tongue. Ibegan to express my beliefs and contradict them. Then, I realized this wasuseless until I knew more about the points under dispute, so I began to go tothe same sources where they drew their supposed wisdom. Book after book,pamphlet after pamphlet, I read them all in their turn.There were often heated arguments on the building lot. I went on struggling,growing more informed than my adversaries were every day, until one day theultimate method was used that vanquishes reason---terrorism and violence. Someof the opposition spokesmen forced me either to leave the job at once by choiceor to fly off the scaffolding on my head. As I was alone and resistance seemedhopeless, I preferred to follow the former advice, richer by one experience.I left filled with disgust, but at the same time so agitated that it would havebeen impossible for me to turn my back on the whole affair. No! After the sparkof the first indignation, my stiff neck once more got the upper hand. I wasabsolutely determined to find another construction job just the same. Mydecision was strengthened by the fact that I had eaten up what little earnings Ihad saved in just a few weeks. I had no choice but to find work. And so the gamebegan all over again, only to end the same way it had before.I struggled with all of this. I had to ask, were these human beings worthy ofbelonging to a great people? It was a painful question. If the answer were\"yes\", the struggle for a national body was really not worth the effort andsacrifice that the best individuals must make; but if the answer were \"no\", ourpeople were a poor lot as human beings. I was restless and uneasy during thosedays of brooding and wondering as I saw the mass of non-nationalistic peoplegrow into a menacing crowd.With new stronger feelings, I watched the endless rows of Vienna workmenmarching in a mass demonstration one day. For almost two hours, I stoodbreathless, observing the enormous human serpent twisting its way past me. Atlast, depressed and uneasy, I left the square and walked home. On the way, in atobacco shop, I saw the Workers' Times, the official socialist newspaper of theold Austrian Social Democratic Party. It was also available at a cheap caféwhere I often went to read the papers, but I had never succeeded in bringingmyself to read the trash for more than two minutes at a time. Its whole toneaffected me like intellectual poison. Now, under the depressing effect of theday's demonstration, an inner voice pushed me to buy a copy and read itthoroughly, and so I did that evening, fighting down frequent rage at thisconcentrated essence of lies.By reading the Social Democratic press daily, I could study the inner nature ofits train of thought better than from any theoretical literature. What adifference there was between the glittering phrases in the theoretical writingsabout freedom, beauty and dignity, and these words in the paper created anillusion of profound wisdom with some difficulty due to the disgusting moraltone, all written with a brazen claim of prophecy. The brutal daily press ofthis doctrine claimed to be the salvation of a new humanity, but was full ofvileness, using every kind of slander, and absolutely full of lies! The theoryis intended for stupid dupes of the middle and upper \"levels of intelligence\";the more vile and base sections were targeted at the masses.To me, dwelling on the literature and press of this doctrine and organizationmeant finding my way back to my own people. What once seemed an impassable gulfnow created in me a love greater than ever before. Only a fool, once he knowsabout this enormous work of corruption, could still condemn the victims. Themore independent I became in the next few years, the more my insight grew intothe inner causes of Social Democratic success. Now, I understood the meaning ofthe brutal demand that only Red newspapers be subscribed to, only Red meetingsbe attended, only Red books be studied, etc. With sparkling clarity, I saw rightin front of me the inevitable result of this doctrine of intolerance.The soul of the great masses of people is receptive to nothing weak or halfway.Like a woman---whose spiritual perceptions are attracted more by the strength ofa leader than the reason of a follower---the masses love the ruler more than thefollower and they find more inner satisfaction in a doctrine that toleratesnothing that it, itself, has not granted approval and freedom. The masses areseldom able to make much use of such freedom and are likely to feel neglected ifgiven too much. They are as unconscious of the shamelessness that intellectuallyterrorizes them as they are of the outrageous mistreatment of their humanliberty. After all, they have no clue about the doctrine's internal error. Theyonly see the ruthless strength and brutality of its expression, which theyalways yield to.If Social Democracy opposes a more truthful, but equally brutal theory, the newtheory will win, even if it requires a battle first. In less than two years, Ihad developed a clear understanding of both the doctrine and the technicalmethods the Social Democrats used to propagate it.I realized the infamous intellectual terrorism of this movement targets theprivilegedclass, which is neither morally nor spiritually a match for suchattacks. They tell a barrage of lies and slander against the individualadversary it considers most dangerous and keep it up until the nerves of thegroup being attacked give in and they sacrifice the hated figure just to havepeace and quiet again. But the fools still do not get peace and quiet. The gamebegins again and is repeated until fear of the villain becomes a hypnoticparalysis.Since the Social Democrats know very well the value of power from their ownexperience, their storming is directed mainly at those whose character has thissame quality. Conversely, they praise every weakling on the other side,cautiously, then loudly, according to the intellectual qualities they see orsuspect. They fear an impotent, weakwilled genius less than they fear a forcefulnature with only modest intellect. Their highest recommendation goes toweaklings in both mind and nature.They are successful in creating the impression that giving-in is the only way towin peace and quiet from them while they quietly, cautiously, but unerringly,conquer one position after another, either by quiet extortion or by actual theftwhen the public attention is on other things. The public is distracted andeither unwilling to be interrupted or they consider the situation too small toworry about and believe it is not worth provoking the angry foe again.These are tactics planned by exact calculation to exploit every human weakness,and it is almost mathematically sure to be successful unless the other side canlearn to fight poison gas with poison gas. To those who are weak in nature, itcan only be said that this is a simple question of survival or nonsurvival.To me, the significance of physical terrorism toward the individual and towardthe masses was plain to see. Terrorism on the job, in the factory, in themeeting hall, and at mass demonstrations, will always be successful unless equalterrorism opposes it.When the socialist party encounters opposition, it screams bloody murder andyells for help from the state, only to get what they want in the end. That is tosay, it finds some idiot of a high official who hopes to befriend the Marxistsand is willing to crush the current adversary of the socialist party to gain theparty's favor.The followers' and rebels' success can be understood only by a man who knows thesoul of a people, not from books, but from life. While its supporters regard itas a triumph of right for their cause, the beaten opponent usually feels futureresistance is pointless. The better I understood the methods of physicalterrorism in particular, the more I was able to forgive the hundreds ofthousands who had given in to it. This realization is something I am mostprofoundly grateful for during that period of suffering. It gave me back mypeople and I learned to distinguish the victims from the deceivers.The result of this seduction of mankind can only be described as victimization.If in some pictures of life I have drawn the character of these \"lowest\" humans,that picture would not be complete without my assurance that in these depths Ifound light in the form of extraordinary selfsacrifice, faithful comradeship,contentment in adversity, and complete modesty, especially among the olderworkmen. Even though these virtues were gradually disappearing in the youngergeneration through the influence of the big city, there were still many whosegood, healthy blood overpowered the vileness of life. If, in politics, thesekind, honest people failed to join together and fill the ranks instead of ourpeople's deadly enemies, it was because they couldn't and didn't understand thevileness of the new doctrine and because nobody else bothered to give them anyattention, and, finally, because social conditions were stronger than anyrebellion. Sooner or later, the impoverished were bound to be the victims andthey would be driven into the Social Democrats' camp.Many times, the privilegedclass in a clumsy and immoral manner, formed a unitedfront to oppose worker demands that were justifiable and based in fundamentalhumanity, and, they did this without offering any excuse, without any reason.Therefore, even the most decent of workmen was driven from the tradeunionorganizations into political activity.Millions of workers were inwardly hostile to the Social Democratic Party atfirst, but their resistance was overcome by the often pointless and insane wayin which the privilegedclass parties opposed any social demands. The inflexiblerefusal of reasonable demands such as to improve working conditions, simplesafety devices on machines, prevention of child labor, protection for women---atleast during the months of pregnancy---this all helped to drive the masses intothe nets of Social Democracy, which gratefully latched on to every case ofsimilar contemptible sentiments. Our politicians, our privilegedclass, can neverrectify these past sins. By resisting all attempts to cure social ills, it sowedhatred and apparently justified the claim that the Social Democratic Party alonerepresented the interests of the working people. Above all, the privilegedclassfurnished the moral excuse for the existence of the unions, which have alwaysbeen the greatest suppliers for the socialist political party.During my Vienna apprentice years, I was forced to adopt some beliefs, whether Iwanted to or not, regarding the union question. As I considered them aninseparable part of the Social Democratic Party, my decision was swift andwrong. I rejected them without hesitation. In this infinitely importantquestion, Fate itself instructed me and, eventually, I had to overturn my rashjudgment. At twenty, I had learned to distinguish between the union as a meansto defend the employee's general social rights and to win better livingconditions, and the union as a tool of the socialist party promoting thepolitical class struggle.The Social Democrats realized the enormous importance of the tradeunion movementand that assured them a position of power. Because the privilegedclass failed tounderstand this importance, it lost its political position. The privilegedclassthought they could sweep aside a logical argument by a bold denial, and throughpolitical force, push the issue down and make it look like an unreasonable path.It is nonsense and a lie to say any union movement is in itself hostile to theFatherland. The opposite is nearer the truth. If union activity envisions andattains the goal of improving the position of a class that belongs to thepillars of the nation, its effect is not hostile to state or Fatherland, but is\"national\" in the truest sense of the word. It is helping to lay the socialgroundwork necessary to maintain the nation. Without this groundwork, noeducation is thinkable. The tradeunion movement gains the highest credit fordestroying social cancers by attacking both intellectual and physical toxins,and thus contributing to the general health of the body of the nation. Toquestion whether or not a union is a necessity is really pointless. It isobvious they are necessary. As long as there are employers with little socialunderstanding or even with a faulty sense of justice and an inability to seewhat is appropriate, it is not merely the right, but the duty of their employeesto protect the public interest against the greed or unreasonable acts ofindividuals. The preservation of honor and faith in a nation is a nationalinterest just as much as the preservation of the people's health. The nation'sfaith and public health are seriously threatened by unworthy business operatorswho do not feel themselves to be members of the people's community. The evileffects of their greed or ruthlessness cause serious harm for the future of thenation and the people.To remove the causes of these problems is a service to the nation. No one cansay that every individual is free to walk away from any supposed injustice. No!Such claims must be regarded as an attempt to divert attention from the facts.Correcting bad or antisocial elements is either in the nation's interest or itis not. If correction is in the interest of the nation, we must make war uponthe problems with weapons which offer some promise of success.The individual worker is never in a position to defend himself against thestrength of a large enterprise. Therefore, this can never be a question ofvictory for the cause of right versus wrong because the justice of the cause canbe determined by the one in the position of power. If the decision were based onhow just the claim was, people's sense of justice alone would end the disputehonorably and amicably, and then things would never even reach the point of adispute.If poor treatment drives people to resist, then the struggle can only be decidedby superior strength if legal and judicial machinery are not created to resolvethese issues. An unjust enterprise can only be opposed by a group of employeesunited into a single person if there is to be any hope of victory.The organizing of a union may lead to stronger social ties in daily life, andthen to the removal of problems which continue to produce dissatisfaction andcomplaints. The existing state of dissatisfaction can be blamed on those whohave managed to obstruct all attempts at legal regulation by using theirpolitical influence.The Social Democrats dug their fingers so deeply into the labor movement thatthe political privilegedclass failed to understand, or did not want tounderstand, the importance of union organization and actively opposed it. In theprocess of their opposition, they lost sight of their real purpose and beganfighting for different objectives.The Social Democrats had no intention of allowing the union movement to continueits original goal. No, that was not what they had in mind. Within a few decades,their trained hands had turned a method of defending human social rights into aninstrument for destroying the national economy. The interests of the workers hadno place in their plans. Even in politics, the use of economic pressure is astrong extortion tool as long as one side has little or no conscience, and theother side is sufficiently stupid and has sheep-like patience. Presently, bothrequirements are fulfilled.Even by the turn of the century, the labor union movement no longer served itsoriginal purpose. From year to year it was drawn more and more into the sphereof Social Democratic politics, until finally it served only as a battering-ramin the class struggle. The Social Democrats assumed that continual blows wouldmake the whole economic structure tumble, then the state---deprived of itseconomic foundations---would suffer the same fate. The representation of theworking people's real interests played less and less a part in the SocialDemocratic agenda. Eventually, political concerns made relieving the social andcultural problems of the workers undesirable. If the workers were not distressedand were fully satisfied, and their will was no longer fueled by resentment,there would have been a danger that they could no longer be used as an army.Intuitively sensing this development, the leaders of the class struggle fellinto such a panic that eventually they simply refused to bring about anybeneficial social improvement and actually took a decided stand against anyimprovements for the workers. There was no need to be embarrassed by suchseemingly incomprehensible behavior. They could avoid it by constantlyincreasing their demands on businesses, which made the rejection of any proposedimprovement appear as if the business was engaged in a diabolical attempt tocripple the workers' most sacred rights. Considering the minimum thinking powerof the masses, the Social Democratic success is not surprising.The privilegedclass camp was outraged at these obviously deceptive SocialDemocratic tactics, but they still based their actions on the statements made bythe Social Democrats. The Social Democrats' fear of raising the working classfrom its abyss of cultural and social misery should have led their opponents tomake supreme efforts to improve the workers' lives. This would have graduallytwisted the weapons from the hands of the socialist leaders of the classstruggle. But this did not happen.Instead of attacking and capturing the enemy position of the high moral groundthemselves, they preferred to be squeezed and shoved. Finally in theirnegotiation battles with the unions, they relented and gave in to changes that,no matter how far reaching, were insufficient for the socialists. The SocialDemocrats easily rejected the changes because it was too little too late.Everything remained the same except now there was more dissatisfaction than everamong both the workers and the business owners.Even then, the \"free tradeunion\" already hung like a menacing storm cloud on thepolitical horizon and loomed over the existence of everyone. It was one of theworst terrorist instruments against the security and independence of thenational economy, against the unity of the state, and against the freedom ofindividuals. This turned the idea of democracy into a ridiculous and disgustingcliché. It was an outrage against freedom and forever mocked the idea ofbrotherhood as demonstrated in the saying, \"If you will not be a comrade too, itmeans a broken skull for you\".This is how I came to understand mankind. Through the years, my views broadenedand deepened but there was no need to change my way of thinking. The more Iunderstood the outer nature of Social Democracy, the more I longed to understandthe inner core of the doctrine. The official party literature was not veryuseful here. It is incorrect in both details and in the proof it offers foreconomic questions. It is also untruthful in its discussion of political aims.Besides, I was especially repelled by the dishonest and unethical manner inwhich it was presented. Sentences are written using a lot of vague words withunintelligible meanings that are as clever as they are senseless. Only thoseunconventional types rotting among us could possibly feel at home in thisintellectual maze. They scrape some \"spiritual experience\" from this artsyliterary manure, and the message is assisted by the humility of our people whothink something is deep and wise just because they don't understand it.I gradually built a clear picture of its inner intent by balancing thetheoretical untruth and nonsense of this doctrine with its actual outwardappearance.When I began to understand, fear and horror crept over me. I saw a teachingcompounded by ego and hatred, which according to mathematical law could verywell lead to victory, but would then lead to the end of humanity as well. Duringthis time, I learned about the connection between this doctrine of destructionand the nature of a people. Up until now, this was unknown to me.A knowledge of the Jews is the necessary key to grasping the real intentions ofSocial Democracy. If a person knows these people, the mask of delusion hidingtheir aims and the meaning of the party falls from his eyes, and the ape-likeface of Marxism grins at him. As it speaks, a fog of social talk flows from theugly smirk on his face.Today, I still find it difficult, if not impossible, to remember when the word\"Jew\" first developed a special meaning for me. I do not remember ever hearingthe word mentioned at home during my father's lifetime. I think the oldgentleman would have considered it uncultured or antiquated to emphasize thedesignation at all. In the course of his life, he developed a mixed bag ofviews, which had survived in me along with my extreme nationalist sentiments andcolored my feelings.At school, there was nothing to change the ideas I received at home. I did meeta Jewish boy in secondaryschool whom we all treated with caution, but onlybecause experience had taught us to mistrust him due to his quietness. None ofus thought much about this.I didn't encounter the word \"Jew\" very often, not until I was fourteen orfifteen, and then primarily in connection with political talks. I felt a slightaversion to it and could not help but have an unpleasant feeling when I becameinvolved in religious arguments. But at that time, I did not see any othersignificance.The city of Linz only had a few Jews. In the course of centuries, they hadbecome outwardly Europeanized and looked human. In fact, I even thought theywere Germans. I did not realize the nonsense behind this notion because Ibelieved their only distinguishing mark was a strange religion. Persecution fortheir religion and hostile comments against them often brought my objection inreturn. I had no idea that organized hostility against the Jews even existed.Then I came to Vienna. I was fascinated by the architecture and preoccupied withmy own fate. At first I was not concerned with the classes of people in thelarge city. Although there were already nearly two hundred thousand Jews amongthe two million people of Vienna, I did not see them. My eyes and mind could notgrasp all the values and ideas in the first few weeks. Only when I began tosettle in did I begin to look more closely at my new world and see the busyscene more clearly. That's when I encountered the Jewish question.I cannot say that the way I encountered it was particularly agreeable. At first,I only saw the religious aspect of the Jew and for reasons of human tolerance, Imaintained my opposition to religious attacks. The tone of the antiSemitic pressin Vienna seemed unworthy of the cultural tradition of a great people. I wasbothered by the memory of certain happenings in the Middle Ages which I did notwant to see repeated. (All through the Middle Ages, Jews were blamed for any badoccurrence and killed by the thousands at a time. Some cities blamed them forthe Black Death plague. Some areas exiled them or forced them into ghettos,others required them to wear yellow cloth armbands or buttons, and they wererestricted from certain fields of work, all throughout the Middle Ages.) Sincethe newspapers in question were not generally considered among the mostoutstanding quality, I thought they were the product of angry envy rather thanthe result of a principle, even if it was wrong.My belief was strengthened by what I considered the infinitely more dignifiedand commendable way in which the truly great newspapers answered those attacks.They did not even mention them, but responded with silence. Eagerly I read theworld press, the \"New Free Press\" (a Vienna newspaper); the Vienna DailyNewspaper (Wiener Tagblatt), etc., and I was astonished at how much they offeredthe reader and at their objectivity. I also admired their dignified tone.Occasionally, I did not like their pretentious style, but I thought it might bemore acceptable in the bustle of the cosmopolitan city.Since I considered Vienna such a city, I thought this amateur explanation mightbe a sufficient excuse. But the way these newspapers played up stories in theRoyal Court's favor did repel me more than once. There was rarely an event atthe Hofburg Imperial Palace (the palace of the Hapsburg Dynasty in Vienna,Austria), which was not told to the reader in tones of enraptured ecstasy orgrief-stricken sorrow. When an event dealt with the \"wisest Monarch\" of alltimes, it read almost like a mating dance between lovers.The whole thing seemed so fake. I thought that such a policy was a stain on theideal of liberal democracy. The way they would crawl for the Court's approvaland betray the dignity of the nation. This was the first bad feeling I developedabout the press.As always, I followed every event in Germany with burning concentration, whetherpolitical or cultural. With proud admiration I compared the rise of the Reichwith the sickness and decline of the Austrian state. Happenings outside Austriawere mostly a source of pure pleasure; the less agreeable events at home oftenbrought worry and gloom. I did not approve of the fight then being carried onagainst William II (the German Emperor and King of Prussia until theRevolution). I saw him not only as the German Emperor, but primarily as thecreator of a German Navy. I was extraordinarily annoyed when the Germanparliament forbade the Emperor to speak in Parliament. The prohibition came froma people who had no reason to object considering the fact that theseparliamentary geese chattered more nonsense in a single session than a wholedynasty of emperors could produce in centuries.I was outraged that the heir of the Imperial crown could receive \"reprimands\"from the shallowest chattering-institution in a state where every half-witclaimed the right to criticize and might even be turned loose on the nation as a\"lawgiver\". But, I was even more angered when the Vienna press, which bowed tothe lowest member of the Royal Court hoping for some attention, now expresseddoubts about the German Emperor. Their apparent concern seemed more like malicein my opinion. They quickly claimed they had no intention of meddling in theaffairs of the German Emperor, heaven forbid, but they pretended that bytouching a delicate spot in such a friendly way they were fulfilling a dutyresulting from the mutual alliance between the two countries, and at the sametime, discharging their obligations of journalistic truthfulness. Then thefinger pushed into the sore spot and dug ruthlessly into the wound.Cases like this made the blood rush to my head. This was what gradually made meregard the great press with more caution. I did have to admit that one of theantiSemitic papers, The German People's Paper (Das deutsche Volksblatt), washonorable on occasion.Another thing that bothered my nerves was the revolting cult of France which thebig papers were then propagating. It was enough to make a person ashamed ofbeing a German. We were constantly bombarded with praises to the \"greatcivilized nation\". More than once, this wretched spell of Frenchcaptivation mademe lay down one of the \"world papers\". In fact, I began to turn to The GermanPeople's Paper more often, which was much smaller, but cleaner in such matters.I disliked the sharp antiSemitic tone, but I did occasionally read argumentswhich gave me something to think about.Such stories eventually educated me about the man and the movement which thengoverned Vienna's destiny---Dr. Karl Lueger and the Christian Socialist Party.(Karl Lueger was a member of the Christian Socialist Party which was anantiSemitic party. He was also the mayor of Vienna in 1897-1910, which made himmayor until Hitler was almost 21 years old.) When I came to Vienna, I washostile to both. In my eyes, the man and the movement were opposed to politicaland social change. However, a sense of common justice forced me to change myopinion gradually as I learned about the man and his work. Eventually, myopinion grew into admiration.Today, more than ever, I consider the man the greatest German mayor of alltimes. But, how many of my preconceived views were upset by this change inattitude toward the Christian Socialist movement?! My opinions on antiSemitismalso slowly changed with the passing of time, and this was the most difficultchange I ever went through. It was the most difficult of all my spiritualstruggles. Only after battling for months between understanding and feelings didthe voice of reason finally win. Two years later, feelings followedunderstanding, and from then on, understanding was the most faithful watchmanand guardian I could have had with me.During my bitter struggle between emotional ties to what I learned as a childand cold reason, the streets of Vienna offered me priceless firsthand lessons.The time had come when I no longer walked blindly through the vast city as I didat first. I kept my eyes open and looked at people as well as buildings.Once, as I was strolling through the inner city, I suddenly met a figure in along caftan with black curls. \"Is that a Jew?\" was my first thought. Jews didnot look like that in Linz. I covertly observed the man, but the longer I staredat that alien face, scrutinizing feature after feature, my question changedfrom, \"Is that a Jew?\" to \"Is that a German?\" As always, I tried to resolve mydoubts through books. For a few coins, I bought the first antiSemitic pamphletsI had ever purchased in my life.Unfortunately, they were all based on the theory that the reader grasped or atleast was familiar in principle with the Jewish question. Their tone made mefeel new doubts because of the often shallow and unscientific proofs theyoffered.I would relapse to my former way of thinking for weeks, sometimes months. Thematter seemed so monstrous and the accusations so unrestrained that I feared itmight be unjust for me to decide one way rather than another, and again I becametimid and uncertain.Even I could no longer doubt that this was a question about a people in itselfand not about Germans of a particular religious persuasion. Since I had begun tooccupy myself with the question and to pay attention to the Jew, Vienna hadappeared to me in a new light. Wherever I went now, I saw Jews and the more Isaw, the more clearly my eye distinguished them from other people. The innerCity and the Districts north of the Danube Canal were especially filled withpeople who didn't look anything like Germans. If I continued to have doubts, myindecision was ended by the attitude of the Jews themselves. A great movementamong many of them, especially in Vienna, sharply emphasized the specialcharacter of Jewry as a separate people: Zionism.Only some of the Jews approved of this movement, and while the great majoritycondemned and even rejected the very idea, the appearance of the movement meltedaway in an evil fog of excuses, I could even say lies. Socalled liberal Jewryrejected the Zionists as Jews who were impractical and, perhaps dangerous intheir public adherence to Judaism. It made no difference; they were all stillJews. There was no real separation and they maintained their internalsolidarity.This fictitious conflict between the Zionists and the Liberal Jews soondisgusted me. It was false through and through and contradicted to the moraldignity and pure character their race had always prided itself upon.Morality and purity of character were terms that had their own meaning amongthese people anyway. It was obvious from their unclean appearance that they werenot waterlovers. I am sorry to say that this was very clear, even with my eyesclosed. I was frequently nauseated by the smell of these caftan-wearers. Inaddition, their clothes were dirty and they generally looked poor.All this was unattractive enough by itself, but one was positively repelled whenthey realized uncleanliness went beyond personal filth and into the moralmud-stains of these people. My greatest concern was the activities of the Jewsin certain fields of life. I slowly penetrated this mystery. Was there any shadyundertaking, any form of foulness, especially in cultural life, in which atleast one Jew did not participate? If you carefully punctured this abscess witha knife, like a maggot in a rotten body who was blinded by the sudden influx oflight, you would discover a Kike (ein Jüdlein).I saw a great burden of guilt fall upon Jewry when I came to understand how itcontrolled the press, the influence in art, in literature, and in the theater.All their slimy declarations now meant little or nothing. It was enough to lookat one of the billboard pillars and study the names credited for the awful movieor theatrical presentations in order to be firmly convinced of the Jewishproblem.Here they were, infecting the people with a pestilence---an intellectualpestilence worse than the Black Death of ancient days. This poison was producedand distributed in massive quantities too! Naturally, the more immoral theseartists and producers are, the more they grow. Such a fellow flings his garbagein the face of humanity like a windmill. Do not forget their unlimited number.For every one German writer like Goethe, nature plants at least ten thousand ofthese slimy creatures in the pelt of humanity where they poison the people withtheir disease. It was a dreadful but inescapable fact that the Jew seemedspecially chosen by nature in tremendous numbers for this horrible destiny. Arewe supposed to assume that this is the way he is \"chosen\"? At that time, I beganto carefully examine the names of all the producers of these unclean products inthe world of art, and this scrutiny only damaged my attitude toward the Jewsmore. Though my feelings were outrage times a thousand, I must surrender to myreason and let it draw the conclusions. It was true that nine-tenths of all theliterary filth, artistic trash, and theatrical nonsense must be attributed to apeople constituting scarcely one onehundredth of the country's population. Itwas a plain fact.I now began to scrutinize even my beloved newspapers from the world press. Thedeeper I probed, the more my previous admiration shrank. The style grew moreintolerable. I objected to the content as flat and shallow. The objectivity wastransformed into more of a lie than honest truth---of course the authors wereJews. A thousand things which I had once barely noticed now struck me asremarkably obvious, while others, which had merely given me something to thinkabout, I began to grasp and understand.I now could see the liberal sentiments of this press in a new light. Thedignified tone in replying to attacks, as well as the silent responses, nowrevealed a trick as shrewd as it was low. Their enraptured theatrical criticismsalways favored a Jewish author, while their disapproval never fell on anyoneexcept a German. The constant and quiet sneering at William II revealed they hada deliberate plan. Their advocacy of French culture and civilization also playedinto their schemes. The trashy content of the short stories now became anindecency and I heard sounds of an alien people in the language. The generalsense was so clearly harmful to everything German that it could only beintentional. But who had an interest in this? Was it all mere chance? GraduallyI became unsure.My development was accelerated by the insights I gained into a series of othermatters. This was the general display of manners and morals openly shown by mostof Jewry.The street again offered some truly ugly object lessons. The relationship ofJewry to prostitution and, even more, to white slavery itself could be studiedin Vienna more so than in probably any other Western European city, with thepossible exception of southern French seaport towns. If a person walked thestreets and alleys of Leopoldstadt (Leopold Town) in the evening, all along theway you could see things which remained hidden from the great majority of theGerman people. (Leopoldstadt is a district in Vienna separated from the maincity by the Danube waterways. The area was heavily Jewish and considered aghetto.) These things remained secret until the First World War gave thesoldiers on the Eastern front an opportunity, or rather forced them to seesimilar happenings.It sent a chill down my spine when I first realized the Jew was the manager ofthis immoral trade among the scum of the city. He was icy calm and shamelesslybusinesslike which made me fuming angry. Now, I no longer evaded discussing theJewish question. Now I wanted to discuss it. I had seen the Jew in every area ofcultural and artistic life, then I suddenly encountered him in another spotwhere I would have least expected to see him, and I recognized the Jew as theleader of Social Democracy, the Marxists, and that is when the blinders fellfrom my eyes. Suddenly, a long, spiritual struggle came to an end. I wasastonished how easily my fellow workmen changed their minds over a question.Often their opinion changed within a few days, sometimes even within a few hoursthey turned around. I could hardly understand how people who individually heldreasonable views could suddenly lose them the moment they came under the spellof the masses. It was enough to drive a person crazy. I would argue for hoursand finally believe I had broken the ice or cleared up some piece of nonsensethey had in their heads. I would feel pride in my success and then the next day,I would be stressed to find out I had to begin all over again. It had all beenfor nothing. Their crazy opinions seemed to always swing like a pendulum.I could understand how they felt. They were dissatisfied with their place inlife. They cursed Fate, which often dealt them such hard knocks; they hated thebusinessmen, who seemed to be the heartless tools of Fate, and criticizedgovernment offices, which in their eyes had no sympathy for the workers'situation. They demonstrated against food prices and marched through the streetsin support of their demands. All this I could understand, but what I could notunderstand was the boundless hatred they felt for their own nation---the waythey despised its grandeur, the way they defiled its history, and the way theydragged great men in the gutter.This struggle against their own kind, their own nest, their own homeland, was assenseless as it was incomprehensible. It was unnatural. They could temporarilybe cured of this vice, but only for days or for weeks at the most. Later, if onemet a supposed convert, he may have fallen back into his old self against hisfellow men. His unnatural tendencies would again have him in their grip.I gradually came to realize that the Social Democratic press consisted mostly ofJews, but I attached no particular importance to this situation.Circumstances were the same at the other newspapers. One thing was remarkable tome; there was not one paper where Jews worked that I would have considered aproud national voice that was in line with my concept of national pride.I forced myself to at least make an attempt at reading this Marxist journalism,but the more I did, the more I disliked it. I now tried to get closer to themanufacturers of these mischievous words. From the editor on down, they were allJews. I picked up every Social Democratic pamphlet I could and looked up theauthor's name. Jews. I noticed the names of almost all the leaders. Most of themwere also members of the \"chosen people\", the Jews, whether they wererepresentatives in the government or secretaries of the unions, chairmen oforganizations, or street agitators. The same uncanny picture was continuallyrepeated. I will never forget the names of Austerlitz, David, Adler, Ellenbogen,and others.One thing was plain to me now. The leadership of the party whose pettyrepresentatives I had to fight my most violent battles with for months consistedalmost exclusively of an alien people. I then had the happy satisfaction ofknowing for certain that the Jew was no German. Now, for the first time, Ibecame thoroughly familiar with the corrupter of our people.Living one year in Vienna had been enough to convince me that no worker is tooinflexible to yield to greater knowledge and superior enlightenment. I hadgradually become an authority on their own doctrine, which I used as a weapon inthe battle for my convictions. Success was almost always on my side.The great mass of people could be saved, even if it was only by the greatestsacrifice of time and patience. But no Jew could ever be freed from his opinion.In those days, I was still childish enough that I would try to explain themadness of their doctrines to them. In my own little circle, I talked until mytongue was sore and my throat was hoarse and thought I must succeed inconvincing them how destructive their Marxist madness was, but the very oppositewas the result. Growing insight into the destructive effect of Social Democratictheories only increased these people's determination.The more disputes I had with them, the better acquainted I became with theirarguing techniques. First, they would count on the stupidity of theiradversaries, and then, if there was no way out, they pretended to be stupidthemselves. If all else failed, they claimed they did not understand, or, beingchallenged, they would instantly jump to another subject and talk about obvioustruths. If these were agreed on, they immediately applied them to entirelydifferent matters. When they were caught off guard, they would avoid theconversation and claim they had no knowledge or understanding of the issue. Nomatter where you seized one of these apostles, your hand grasped slimy ooze,which spurted through your fingers, only to unite again the next moment. If yourargument really gave a man a shattering defeat in front of others, he could donothing but agree. You might suppose that this was one step forward, but howsurprised you would be the following day! The next morning you will find thatJew has not even the slightest memory of yesterday and continues to repeat hisold mischievous nonsense as if nothing at all had happened. When pressed aboutthe previous conversation, he would pretend astonishment and could remembernothing at all except the truth of his statements, which he felt had been proventhe day before.Frequently I was simply paralyzed. It was hard to know what to admire the most:their fluency or their artistry in lying. Gradually, I began to hate them.There was one good result in all of this. My love for my own people was bound togrow just as fast as the expansion of Social Democracy. After all, consideringthe diabolical skillfulness of these seducers, who could possibly condemn theirpoor victims? It was unbelievably difficult for me to master and overcome thecontradictory lies of this race! Any success with people who twisted the truthwas immediately turned around. They would make a statement one moment to counteryour argument, then the next moment use the same reasons they just tried todiscredit in order to prove their own point! No. The better I became acquaintedwith the Jew, the more I could forgive the worker.In my opinion, those to blame were not the workers. The blame fell squarely onthose who did not think it worthwhile to sympathize with their own kinsfolk.With those who would not give to the hardworking son of the national family whatwas his by the iron logic of justice. The blame fell on the same seducer andcorrupter who should be placed against the wall.Stimulated by the experience of daily life, I now began to search for thesources of the Marxist doctrine itself now that I had come to understand itseffect in detail. Every day, its success caught someone's attention, and with alittle imagination I could see where the results were leading us. The onlyquestion remaining was whether the founders had foreseen the results of theircreation in its final form or whether they were victims of error. I felt thatboth answers were possible.On one hand, it was the duty of every thinking person to force his way into thefront ranks of the cursed movement and try to prevent it from going to extremes.On the other hand, the actual creators of this national disease must have beentrue devils. Only in the brain of a monster---not a human being--- could anorganization's plan take shape that would eventually result in the collapse ofhuman civilization and the desolation of the world.If this were the case, the last hope was battle. A battle by every weapon whichthe human mind, understanding, and will could grasp, no matter who Fate blessed.I began to familiarize myself with the founders of this doctrine in order tostudy the foundations of the movement. I was able to obtain results sooner thanI had even dared to hope because of my new, if not yet profound, knowledge ofthe Jewish question. That alone allowed me to compare its realities with thetheoretical shuffling by the founding apostles of this Social Democracymovement. It had taught me to understand the language of the Jewish people, whospeak to conceal, or at least veil, their thoughts. Their real purpose is oftennot in the writing itself, but sleeping snugly between the lines.This was a time when my spirit experienced the greatest upheaval it has everendured. I turned away from a weak set of political notions and into a fanaticalanti-Semite. Once more and for the last time, restless, uneasy, and oppressive thoughts cameto me in my extreme anxiety.I had researched the work of the Jewish people during long periods of humanhistory, and suddenly I was struck by the alarming question of whether themysteries of Fate had irrevocably determined that the final victory was not thedestiny of our little people for reasons unknown to we puny humans. The Jews area people which live for this earth alone. Could they have been promised theearth as their reward? Do we have an objective right to fight forselfpreservation or is this just an illusion? I buried myself in the teachingsof Marxism and gave calm, clear consideration to the work of the Jewish people.Fate itself gave me my answer.The Jewish doctrine of Marxism denies the noble goal of Nature and sets mass anddead weight of numbers in place of the eternal privilege of strength and power.It denies the value of personality in man, disputes the significance of nationand race, and deprives mankind of the essentials of its survival andcivilization. As a foundation of the universe, Marxism would be the end of anyorder conceivable to man. The result of applying such a law could only be chaos.Destruction would be the only result for the inhabitants of this planet. If,through his Marxist faith, the Jew conquers the peoples of this world, his crownwill be the death and destruction of all mankind. Earth would again moveuninhabited through space as it did millions of years ago. (Hitler originallysaid thousands of years ago in the very first edition, but it was changed in thesecond printing. Although, it could be considered correct either way because hewas talking about humanity.) Eternal Nature takes revenge for violation of hercommandments. I believe I am acting today in the spirit of the Almighty Creator.By standing guard against the Jew, I am defending the work of the Lord.3. GENERAL POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS OF MY VIENNA PERIODGenerally, a man should not be active in public politics under the age of thirtyunless he is of extraordinary talent. The reason is obviously that before thatage, he has been building a general platform from which he can examine thevarious political problems and build his own beliefs. Only after he hasestablished a fundamental WorldConcept and has stabilized his own way of lookingat the individual questions of the day, should the man who is at least achievedan inner maturity be allowed to guide the community politically.Otherwise, he is in danger of either changing his previous positions onfundamental questions once he realizes he was wrong or clinging to a view whichhe no longer supports or may even be against. This will make it politicallydifficult for his followers to maintain their faith in him. Their old unshakablesolid belief will be upset because he now appears to be undecided himself. Tofollowers, such an about-face of their leader, means complete confusion inaddition to their feeling of shame in front of those they have previouslyattacked over the issue. The second alternative brings about a result which isparticularly common today. The leader continues to publicly claim he believes inwhat he had previously said. He then becomes more hollow and superficial andeventually becomes more corrupt. He no longer dreams of working seriously forhis political ideals; no one dies for something he does not himself believe in,and his demands upon his followers grow greater and more shameless to compensatefor his own insincerity until at last he sacrifices his remaining fragment ofleadership and begins to play the political game for the sake of politics alone.He has joined that class of people whose only real conviction is absence ofconviction coupled with a bold and shamelessly well-developed skill at lying.Unfortunately for decent people, if such a fellow moves into big government, theessence of his politics is limited to a heroic battle for permanent possessionof his position to maintain his political life for himself and his family. Themore his wife and children cling to him, the more stubbornly he will fight forhis seat. If only for this reason, he is the personal enemy of every other manwith political instincts. In every new political movement he senses the possiblebeginning of his end. In every greater man he senses a danger which may threatenhim. I will have more to say about this sort of Parliament (bed)bug later.Even a man who is thirty years old will have much to learn in his life, but whathe learns will merely fill out and complete the picture which his fundamentalWorldConcept presents to him. His learning will be more than a mere re-learningof principles. It will mean learning more, understanding better. His followerswill not have to choke down the uneasy feeling that up to this time he hasmisled them on some matter. On the contrary, the visible organic growth of theleader will give them satisfaction since his learning seems to be the deepeningof their own doctrine. In their eyes, this is an argument that proves the truthof their views. A leader who has to abandon the platform of his WorldConceptbecause he realizes it is mistaken is honorable if he admits his view was faultyand is ready to correct his conclusions. He must then give up any further publicpolitical activity as well. Since he has already fallen victim to error once inbuilding his fundamentals, the possibility of a second lapse is always present.He has no right to ask for, let alone demand, the confidence of his fellowcitizens.We can judge from the general moral corruption of the group who feel called uponto be politicians that such ideas of honor are not practiced today. Many feel called, but rarely is one truly chosen.I believe I was more concerned about politics than many others, but I avoidedmaking any public appearances. Only in very small groups did I talk about whatinwardly moved or attracted me. This kind of intimate talking helped me a lot. Idid not learn much about \"speaking\", but I came to know people through theirprimitive views and objections. In doing so, I trained myself and wasted noopportunity to further my education. There was nowhere in Germany that couldhave provided such a favorable opportunity as I found in Vienna, Austria at thattime.Judging by its extent, general political thinking in the old Danube Monarchy (the Hapsburg Monarchy of Austria) was larger and more inclusive than in the oldGermany of that period, except in parts of Prussia, Hamburg, and the coast ofthe North Sea. The Austrian part of the great Hapsburg Empire was settled byGermans and was in every respect the cause of that state's creation. Thepopulation alone had the strength to support cultural life for centuries, yetwas still politically artificial. The more time passed, the more the existenceand future of that state came to depend on the preservation of this German seedof the Empire.If the old Monarchs were the heart of the Empire---forever sending fresh bloodinto the circulation of state and cultural life---then Vienna was the brain andstrength of the nation. On the outside, this city looked like it had thestrength to rule as the queen over a huge group of people. Her splendid beautycaused the deadly signs of mental deterioration to be forgotten.No matter how the interior of the Empire was shaken by the bloody turmoilbetween individual nationalities, the world outside, and Germany in particular,saw only the charming image of this city. The illusion was easier to acceptbecause the Vienna of this time seemed to be taking its last and greatestvisible rise. Under the rule of a mayor who was a true genius, the inspiringResidence of the Kaisers of the old Empire rose up to a wonderful new life. Thelast great German born to the colonist people of the Ostmark was not officiallyincluded as a \"statesmen\", but as Mayor of the \"Capital City and ImperialResidence\" of Vienna; Dr. Lueger, made magic with his achievements in everyfield, whether it was community, economic, or cultural policy.He strengthened the heart of the entire Empire and as Mayor, he became a greaterstatesman than all the socalled \"diplomats\" of the time put together.The fact that the collection of races called \"Austria\" went to its doom in noway discredits the political ability of Germans in the old Eastern territories.That was the impossible and inevitable result of trying to maintain a State withfifty million people of various nationalities for any length of time withoutdefinite principles being established.The GermanAustrian had always been accustomed to living within the framework ofa great Empire and had never lost his feeling for the work this involved. He wasthe only one who could see beyond his own front yard all the way to the frontierof the Empire. When Fate moved him from the Fatherland, he still tried topreserve for Germany what his fathers had once squeezed out from the Eastthrough battle. We must not forget that this is what happens even when a man isseparated from his country. The best men's hearts and memories never ceased tofeel for the common mother country and always reserved a fragment for thehomeland.Even the general outlook of the GermanAustrian was broader than others.Frequently, his economic connections embraced almost the entire Empire.Almost all the really great enterprises were in his hands. He was the source formost of the personnel used for management, technicians, and officials. Heconducted the foreign trade because Jewry had not yet laid their hands on thisspecial domain. Politically, he alone held the State together. Even his militaryservice took him far beyond the narrow limits of his homeland. TheGermanAustrian recruit might join a German regiment, but the regiment was justas likely to be stationed in Herzegovina as in Vienna or Galicia. The officerswere still Germans and so were the higher ranking civil servants.Finally, art and science were also German. Aside from the trash that has comeout recently, which could have been made by any negro tribe, the Germans alonepossessed the true inspiration for art. In music, architecture, sculpture, andpainting Vienna was the primary source of this artistic wealth which suppliedthe whole Dual Monarchy and never seemed to run out. (The Dual Monarchy was theAustrio-Hungarian Monarchy which was the union forming the Hapsburg Monarchy.)Germans were the pillar of all foreign policy with the exception of a small bodyof Hungarians. Nevertheless, every attempt to preserve the Empire was uselesssince the most essential requirement for its preservation was missing. ForAustria there was only one possible way of overcoming the scattering of theindividual states. The states had to be centrally governed---an organizedinternal government---or it would fail.When the Highest officials were temporarily thinking clearly, they realized thistruth, but it was quickly forgotten or set aside because they believed it wouldbe too difficult to accomplish. Thoughts of a more united version of the Empirewere bound to go wrong because there was no strong state instigator, no one withdominant authority. The internal status of the Austrian state was very differentfrom that of the German Empire as Bismarck shaped it. In Germany, it was only aquestion of overcoming political traditions since a common cultural basis wasalways there. Germany was primarily made up of only one group of people asidefrom small alien fragments. In Austria, the situation was reversed.Except for Hungary, the individual countries had no political memory of theirown grandeur, and among the people, that memory had been eliminated.Now, nationality and racial forces began to develop again, which wasincreasingly difficult to overcome as national states began to form along theedge of the Monarchy. The people of these states, racially related or similar tothe individual fragments within Austria, now began to exert a strongerattraction than the GermanAustrian could. Even Vienna could not hold out forlong in this conflict.When Budapest had grown large enough to rival Vienna, their mission was not tohold together the distant parts of the Empire, but rather to strengthen onepart. Within a short time Prague followed the example of Budapest, and later oncame Lemberg, Laibach and others. These places were raised from small provincialtowns to national cities which created rallying centers for an independentculture. Through this, the local national instincts acquired a spiritualfoundation and gained a more profound hold on the people. The time was sure tocome when the interests of each country would become stronger than their commonimperial interests. Once that stage had been reached, Austria's doom was sealedand the Empire would fall apart.These developments after the death of Joseph II were plain to see. ( Joseph IIwas co-regent or co-ruler with his mother, Maria Theresa, for much of his reign.He is known for his efforts to unify the Kingdom, but his diplomatic skills werepoor. When his brother, Leopold II, succeeded him, he tried to restore relationsby giving concessions to those Joseph II had alienated.) The rapid growth ofthese areas depended on a series of factors that included the Monarchy itselfand the Empire's position in foreign politics. If the battle to preserve thestate was to be fought to the finish, only a central government as ruthless asit was persistent could possibly succeed. In that case, it was necessary toestablish a uniform state language that would emphasize the unity of the peopleand furnish the government with a technical tool necessary to maintain a unifiedstate. Only then could a consistent state awareness be created through theschools. This could not happen in ten or twenty years, it was something thatwould take centuries; however, in all questions of developing a country, a largegoal is more important than momentary efforts.Both administration and political leadership must be conducted with rigid unity.I learned a lot when I discovered why this was not done and why this did nothappen. The person guilty of this omission was the one who was completelyresponsible for the collapse of the Empire. More than any other state, OldAustria depended on the greatness of its leadership. The cornerstone of anational state was missing. The basis of a national state is the people and theystill have the power to sustain it no matter how bad the leadership is. Thanksto the natural activity of its inhabitants and the power of resistance thatresults from that independence, a unified national state can often survive theworst administration or leadership without being destroyed. A body like thisoften seems to have no life at all, as if it were dead and gone, then suddenlywhat appeared to be a corpse rises up and gives mankind astonishing signs of itsindestructible life force.However, this is not true of an empire composed of different people who areliving under a common strong arm of leadership and not connected by commonblood. In this situation, governing weakness does not lead to the hibernation ofthe state, but to an awakening of all the individual instincts which are presentin the blood of the various groups. Even if they are unable to grow under theinfluence of a single dominant will, the individual elements will still rise.Only centuries of common education, common tradition, and common interest canreduce that danger. This is why the younger a state structure is, the more theydepend on the greatness of their leadership. In fact, the work of strong,outstanding figures and intellectual heroes often collapses immediately afterthe death of the great, lonely founder.Even after centuries, however, these dangers cannot be considered defeated. Theyare sleeping and often will suddenly awake the moment weakness in a commonleadership is felt. The force of education and the grandeur of tradition are nolonger strong enough to overcome the native life force in the various races.It is the House of Hapsburg's fault that this was not understood. Fate gave oneof them the opportunity to change the future of his country, but that flame ofhope was extinguished forever. In a state of panic, Joseph II, Roman Emperor ofthe German Nation, saw how his leadership was being driven to the outside edgeof the Empire. It was eventually going to disappear in the whirlwind of acorrupt people unless everything that his fathers had failed to do was fixed atthe last minute. The \"Friend of Mankind\", Joseph II, decided he would usesuperhuman strength and try to correct in a decade the centuries of neglect byhis forefathers. If he had been given just forty years for his task, and if onlytwo generations had continued the work he had begun, the miracle would probablyhave succeeded. But, he died after ruling barely ten years. He was worn out inbody and soul and his work followed him to the grave, to sleep forever, withoutreawakening. His successors had neither the intelligence nor the will to get thejob done.When the first sparks of a new age began to flash through Europe, the revolutionset Austria on fire. When things started really rolling, those flames werefanned more by the people than economic, social, or even general politicalcauses.The Revolution of 1848 ( The European Revolutions of 1848 were known in somecountries as the Spring of Nations, Springtime of the Peoples or the Year ofRevolution. This wave of revolution caused political upheaval throughout theEuropean continent.) was a class struggle everywhere else, but in Austria, itwas the beginning of a new war between nationalities. At that time, the Germanman forgot or didn't realize his origin and sealed his own fate by entering theservice of the revolutionary uprising. He helped to stir up the spirit ofWestern Democracy that soon deprived him of the foundation for his ownexistence. Without first deciding on a common state language, the formation of aparliamentary representative body had laid the foundation for the end of Germansupremacy in the Monarchy. From that day on the state was lost. Everything thathappened after that was the historical liquidation of an Empire.Watching the Empire dissolve was as moving as it was instructive. The executionof a historical sentence took place in a thousand different ways. The fact thatmost people walked blindly through the resulting decay only proved that it wasGod's will to destroy Austria. I do not want to get lost in details; that is notmy purpose. I only want to provide information about those processes which stillhave importance for us today and which helped to establish my political way ofthinking, like the unchanging causes of the decay in the people and the state.The institutions that most clearly demonstrated the decay inside the AustrianMonarchy was the Parliament or Reichsrat as it was called in Austria, whichshould have been the strongest institution. This was obvious even to thehalf-blind, privilegedclass Philistine.The model for this group was obviously in England, the land of classical\"Democracy\". That excellent parliamentary structure was transferred almostdirectly to Austria with as little alteration as possible. In the House ofDeputies and the House of Lords, the English twochambers of government wereresurrected. Only the \"Houses\" themselves were somewhat different. When Barrybuilt his palaces, or, as we say the Houses of Parliament, on the shore of theThames, he could take the inspiration for his work from the history of theBritish Empire. (Barry was Sir Charles Barry, an English architect who, after afire, rebuilt the Palace of Westminster which is the English Parliament buildingin London.) In that history he found sufficient material to fill and decoratethe magnificent corridors. His statues and paintings made the House of Lords andthe House of Commons temples dedicated to the glory of the nation.Here was Vienna's first problem. When Hansen, the Danish architect, ( TheophilusHansen was a master of the Historicism of the period, which interpreted inClassicist, Byzantine and Renaissance style in Vienna, where his buildingsinclude the Musikverein concert hall , 1869, the Stock Exchange, 1877, and theParliament building, 1884.) finished the new marble house of the peoples'representatives, there was nothing he could do but borrow from Antiquity fordecoration. Now, Roman and Greek statesmen and philosophers beautify thistheater of \"Western Democracy\". With symbolic irony, the four-horse chariotsabove the two houses pull away from each other and toward the north, south,east, and west. This was a perfect expression of what was going on inside at thetime.As an insult and irritant, these \"nationalities\" objected to any glorificationof Austrian history in this building. It was the same in Germany where no onedared to dedicate the Wallot Reichstag Parliament building with an inscriptionto the German people until the First World War battles were underway.( Paul Wallot was the architect of the German Reichstag Parliament Buildingcompleted in 1894.) Before I was twenty, I had mixed feelings the first time Iwent into the splendid building on the famous Ring Street to see and hear asitting of the House of Deputies. I had always hated the Parliament. It wasn'tthe institution I hated because as a lover of freedom, I could not imagine anyother kind of government. As a result of my attitude toward the Austrian Houseof Hapsburg and their ruler, the thought of any sort of similar dictatorshipwould have seemed a crime against liberty and reason.One of the main reasons for this was the fact that my constant newspaper-readingas a young man had given me protection without me even realizing it. There was acertain admiration for the English Parliament, an admiration I could not get ridof very quickly. According to the great reports in our newspapers, the dignitywith which even the lower House fulfilled its duties impressed me greatly. Howcould there possibly be any nobler form of self government for a people? Forthat very reason, I was an enemy of the Austrian Parliament. The way that thewhole thing was carried on seemed to me unworthy of its great model. Thefollowing considerations also influenced my attitude: the fate of the Germanrace in the Austrian state depended upon its position in the AustrianParliament. Until the introduction of secret ballot voting for all men, therewas still at least a small German majority in Parliament, even if it was aninsignificant one. Even this was dangerous. The national attitude of the SocialDemocrats was unreliable, and in crucial questions concerning German character,they always fought against German interests to avoid losing their followersamong the various alien peoples. Even in those days, Social Democracy could notbe considered a German party. The introduction of universal voting, however,destroyed the German numerical superiority. There was no longer any obstacle tothe further deGermanization of the state.The instinct of national selfpreservation made it impossible for me to welcome arepresentative system where the German element was not represented properly, butwas instead betrayed by the Social Democratic fraction. These defects could notbe attributed to the parliamentary system as such, but rather to the AustrianState. I still believed that if the German majority could be restored in thisrepresentative body, there would be no need to oppose such a system as long asthe old Austrian State continued to exist.This was the opinion I held when I entered those sacred and coveted halls. Forme, they were sacred only because of the radiant beauty of that majesticbuilding. A Greek wonder on German soil. Soon, though, I was outraged at thewretched spectacle that happened right before my eyes! There were severalhundred representatives present who were expressing their opinions on a questionof economic importance.The events of the first day alone gave me enough to keep me thinking for weeks.The intellectual content of what they said was at an extremely depressing level,that is, if you could understand their chatter at all. Some of the gentlemendidn't speak German. They only sputtered in their Slavic mother tongues ordialects. Now I had a chance to hear with my own ears what I had previouslyknown only from reading the papers. It was a wild commotion with gesturing,yelling, and interruptions in every tone of voice. In the middle of it all was aharmless old man who was trying his best to restore the dignity of the House byviolently ringing a bell and shouting in a soothing way, then in warning tones.I could not help laughing.A few weeks later, I visited the chamber again. The scene was transformed beyondrecognition. The hall was almost empty. Down below, people were asleep. A fewdeputies were in their seats, yawning at one another while one of them \"spoke\".A Vice President of the House was present and he looked over the chamber withvisible boredom.I had my first misgivings, but I kept looking in on meetings whenever I couldpossibly find time. I watched what was going on quietly and attentively,listened to as much of the speeches as was understandable, studied the more orless intelligent faces of the chosen representatives of the nations in this sadstate, and then gradually formed my own ideas.A year of calm observation was enough to absolutely change or rather destroy myformer opinions on the nature of the institution. I no longer objected to thedistorted form Parliament had assumed in Austria. No, now I could no longeracknowledge Parliament as a government body at all. Up until now, I had onlyseen the ruin of the Austrian Parliament in the lack of a German majority, butnow I saw destruction in the whole nature and character of the institution. Isaw a whole new series of questions that needed to be answered.I began to familiarize myself with the democratic principles of majority rule asthe foundation of the whole institution, but I was equally attentive to theintellectual and moral values of the gentlemen who were the chosen members ofthe nations and who were supposed to pursue this goal. I became familiar withboth the institution and the men who made it up.Within a few years, my perception and understanding allowed me to form a clearand wellrounded image of the most dignified figure of modern times, theParliamentarian. He made an impression on me in a way which had neversignificantly changed. The object-lessons of this firsthand experience had againpreserved me from smothering in a theory which many people find so seductive atfirst glance, but which is actually a sign of decay in mankind.The Democracy of the West today is a forerunner of Marxism, and without it,Marxism would be unthinkable. It alone gives this plague the surface on which togrow. Its outer form---the parliament style of government---is a \"monstrosity offilth, and fire\", but the creative fire seems to me burnt out at the moment.(Hitler's humorous use of this quote is from J. W. von Goethe's Faust whereFaust calls Mephistopheles, \"You are the birth/monstrosity of filth/crap, andfire\".) I am grateful to Fate for approaching me with this question in Vienna. Iam afraid that if I had been in the Germany of that time, it would have made theanswer too easy. If my first encounter with the ridiculous institution calledParliament had been in Berlin, I might have made the error of believing theopposite. With good reason, I may have joined those who saw the salvation of thepeople and Empire solely in strengthening the power of the Imperial structureand remained a blind stranger to the current times and to human nature.In Austria, it was impossible to make this mistake. If Parliament was worthless,the Hapsburgs were worth even less. To oppose the idea of a parliament was notenough because the question of \"what now?\" would still be there. The abolitionof the Parliament would have only left the House of Hapsburg as a governingpower. This idea was especially unbearable to me."},{"pageContent":"This particular case was so difficult it made me as a youth take a closer lookthan I would have otherwise. What struck me first and gave me the most food forthought was the obvious lack of any individual responsibility. No matter howdisastrous the result, no one is responsible or accountable for the passage of aParliamentary resolution. Is all responsibility nullified when Parliamentretires for the evening after making a catastrophic decision? Or perhapsresponsibility is dissolved with the election of a new Parliament or formationof a new coalition? Can any majority which is unable to make a decision ever beheld responsible? Isn't the very idea of responsibility not firmly connectedwith people? Can anyone make the head of a government accountable if he actsbased on the decision made by a crowd of people? Instead of developingconstructive ideas and plans, is the business of a statesman actually the art ofmaking a flock of sheep understand his plan? Is it his job to explain and coachthem on common sense so that they will grant him their generous approval, or ishis job instead to improve the nation? Should a statesman possess a gift ofpersuasion greater than the statesman's ability to conceive great politicalmeasures and make them happen? Is a statesman incompetent if he fails to winover a majority of votes to support his policy in an assembly, which has beencalled together as the chance result of an electoral system that is not alwayshonestly administered? Has this parliamentary crowd ever understood any ideabefore it was a success? Isn't every accomplishment of genius in this world theresult of the one genius going against the inertia of the masses? What is thestatesman supposed to do if flattery fails to win the crowd's approval for hisplans? Is he supposed to accept it? Is he supposed to abandon the tasks which heknows are vital to the people and go home or retire? Does he quit even if heknows failure resulted from the stupidity of his fellow citizens? Or is he tostay regardless? In a case like this, doesn't a man of real character fall intohopeless conflict between his insight and his honorable intentions? Where is thedividing line between duty to the community and duty to one's personal honor?Shouldn't every true leader refuse to be degraded by acting as a politicaljuggler? On the other hand, shouldn't every juggler feel a call to go intopolitics since the ultimate responsibility falls on some undefined mob and nothim? Must our parliamentary majority lead to the total destruction of the leaderconcept? Can anyone believe that this world comes from the brain of majoritiesand not from the heads of individuals? Or does anyone believe that we cansomeday do without this essential aspect of human civilization, the individual?Can we not say that today more than ever before, the creative brain of theindividual is indispensable? By rejecting personal authority and substitutingthe mass of the crowd, the parliamentary principle of majority-rule sins againstthe basic aristocratic idea of Nature. However, we must represented in thepresent community leaders.admit that Nature's idea of nobility is not necessarily decadence of our upperten-thousand government andIf he has learned to think independently, the reader of Jewish newspapers canhardly imagine the havoc brought on by the institution of modern democraticparliamentary rule. This rule is the main reason why our whole political life isso overrun with the inferior figures of today. A true leader is bound towithdraw from political activity that consists largely of trading favors andhaggling for the approval of a majority rather than creative work andachievement. This kind of activity only attracts small minds, not greatthinkers.The smaller the mind of this petty man who sees politics as a trade, the moreclearly he recognizes his own misery and the more loudly he will praise a systemwhich does not demand great strength or genius. He is contented with the slynesswhich makes an efficient town clerk and probably even prefers this hollow wisdomto the true wisdom of that great democratic creator in Athens known as Pericles.(Pericles was a great speaker and statesmen in ancient Greece known for a periodcalled the \"Age of Pericles\".) That sort of simpleton shouldn't be plagued withresponsibility for his actions. He is far beyond the reach of such worriesbecause he knows that no matter what the results are of his \"statesmanlike\"confusions, his end has been written in the stars for a long time. Someday, hewill have to give in to another and equally \"great\" mind. It is a sign of decaywhen the number of \"great\" statesmen increases as the quality of the individualstatesmen declines.The quality of the individual statesman is bound to become less important as hisdependence on parliamentary majority grows. After all, great minds will refuseto be the servant of silly incompetents and windbags. On the other hand, therepresentatives of the majority or the stupid, hate nothing more than a superiorbrain.It is always a consoling feeling for one of these select men from someinsignificant town to know that they have a leader whose wisdom is equal totheir own. This way each man occasionally has the pleasure of letting hisintellect sparkle. Besides that, each citizen feels that he has a chance to oneday rise to the top. If this other man of limited ability can do it, why not me.If John can be boss, why not Paul? This new invention of democracy has a qualitywhich recently has grown to a real scandal. The cowardice of our socalled\"leadership\" is obvious. How lucky for them that when it comes to any decisionsof importance, they can hide behind the skirts of the majority! Just take aclose look at one of these political doormats. He begs for the approval of themajority for every action in order to guarantee he has an adequate number ofaccomplices so he can unload all responsibility! That is the main reason whythis sort of political activity is disgusting and hateful to any decent andcourageous man. It attracts the most contemptible characters. Anyone who willnot take the personal responsibility for his actions and runs for cover to avoidresponsibility is a cowardly villain.Once a nation has put despicable leaders like these in place, the people'spunishment will be swift. Representatives will no longer have the courage tomake any decisions and would rather accept abuse, defamation, even dishonor aslong as they do not have to pull themselves together and make a real decision.After all, there is no one left who is ready to take responsibility for himselfand carry a difficult decision through.Never forget that a majority cannot replace a man. A majority always representsstupidity and cowardice. A hundred cowards do not make a hero any more than ahundred fools make a wise man. The less responsibility the individual leaderhas, the more would-be politicians will feel they are called upon to devotetheir pitiful \"gifts\" to the nation. They are not even able to wait for theirturn. They stand in a long line, sadly counting the people ahead of them andmarking off the minutes until it will be their turn to board this politicaltrain. They wait a long time for any change in the office they have fixed theireye on, and are grateful for any scandal which thins the ranks ahead of them.Occasionally, someone refuses to move from his office, which makes the ones inline feel like there has almost been a violation of a sacred promise. Then, theygrow spiteful and do not rest until the bold politician holding onto theiroffice is ousted. After that, he won't hold office again anytime soon. If one ofthese creatures is forced to give up his post, he will immediately try to crowdinto the waiting lines again, that is, unless he is prevented by the yelling andabuse from the others.The result is an alarmingly rapid change in the important posts and offices, andthe result is always bad and sometimes catastrophic. Fools and incompetents willnot be the only victims of this custom, but the real leader will be affected ifFate can still manage to put a true leader in this position. The moment peoplerecognize him, they form a united front of resistance, especially if someone ofany intelligence intrudes on this group without rising from their own ranks.They want to keep every position of power among themselves, and they all hateevery mind which might be a \"one\" among all the \"zeros\".They may be dimwitted and slow in other areas, but in this one, they are sharpand focused. The result is an ever-spreading intellectual wasteland in thegovernment. For state and nation, the effect can easily be judged by anyone whois not one of these socalled \"leaders\".Old Austria had parliamentary government in its purest form. The prime ministerwas appointed by the Emperor and King, but even this appointment was simply thewill of Parliament and the trading of favors, for individual posts was typicaljust as in Western Democracy.The intervals between the replacement of one person by another gradually becameshorter, finally ending up in a wild relay chase to see who could gain theoffice first. Each change reduced the quality of the \"statesman\" until finallyonly the petty-type of political juggler remained. The qualities ofstatesmanship in these people were valued according to their skill in piecingtogether one temporary alliance after another and in their ability to manipulatethe pettiest political deals. This is the only kind of political activity suitedto the abilities of these representatives.The city of Vienna became a school which offered the best insights in thisfield. I was very interested in comparing the knowledge and ability of thesepopular representatives with the jobs they were supposed to be doing. This wasnecessary in order to understand the intellectual horizon of these who werechosen by the people. One could not help but think seriously about the processesthat discovered these \"magnificent figures in our public life\". It wasworthwhile to thoroughly study how the real talents of these gentlemen were usedin the service of their country. In other words, to analyze thoroughly theirstep-by-step procedure.We must be objective in considering an institution whose members think it isnecessary to refer to \"objectivity\" in every other sentence as the only justbasis for any judgment or belief. Anyone who examines these gentlemen forthemselves can only be astonished at the result. The parliamentary life lookedmore and more desolate as one penetrated its structure and studied the peopleand principles of the system in a spirit of ruthless objectivity.If you do consider the matter with absolute objectivity, the parliamentaryprinciple is wrong. There is no other principle as wrong as the parliamentaryprinciple. We can say this without even referring to the way the election of thehonorable deputies takes place, the way they get into office, and the way titlesare given to them. Only in a tiny fraction of cases are the offices filled basedon widespread desire and certainly it does not stem from any need. It is obviousto anyone that the political understanding of the masses has not reached thepoint where they can arrive at political views on their own. They are incapableof picking out the most qualified person. What we always call \"public opinion\"is based only on individual experience or knowledge. Most public opinion resultsfrom the way public matters are presented to the people through anoverwhelmingly impressive system of controlled information. Just as religiousbeliefs are the result of education, the political opinion of the masses is theresult of an often incredibly thorough and determined assault on the mind andsoul.By far the greater part of political \"education\" or propaganda is the work ofthe press. It is the press which primarily takes care of the \"work ofenlightenment\" and acts as a sort of school for adults. This means the teachingmaterials are not in the hands of the state, but in the clutches of characterswho are motivated by their own interests. As a young man, Vienna gave me thebest opportunities to become intimately acquainted with the owners andmanufacturers of this mass-education machine. At first, I was astonished to seehow quickly this evil power succeeded in producing a particular opinion amongthe public, even though the meaning may be twisted or a flat-out falserepresentation of public desire. A few days were enough to turn some ridiculousaffair into a momentous act of state, while vital problems were generallyforgotten or simply erased from the memory of the masses.In the course of a few weeks, the press could conjure up names out of nothingand attach the incredible hopes of the public to them. Suddenly they wouldbecome more popular than a really important man may ever enjoy in a lifetime.These were names which no one had even heard of only a month before. At the sametime, old and stable figures of government or public life simply ceased to existas far as the world was concerned, or they were buried under such rudeness thattheir names soon risked becoming symbols of wickedness or dishonesty. If we areto understand this process, we have to study this infamous Jewish way ofmagically drenching the clean garments of honorable men with the slop buckets offilthy libel and slander from hundreds of directions at once. We must study itif we are to understand the real danger from these journalistic villains.There is nothing these powerful intellectual newspaper rogues would not do if itallowed him to accomplish his disrespectful ends. He sniffs his way into themost secret family affairs and he does not rest until his nosiness has rooted upsome awful situation which will serve to cook the unlucky victim's goose. If hedoes not uncover anything in public or private life, he resorts to slander. Hehas a deeply-rooted belief that some of it will stick. Even if there are athousand contradictions in his claims, after it is repeated a hundred times byall his accomplices, the victim usually can't put up a fight at all. This packof scoundrels will never admit their actions affect mankind, and they certainlywould never admit that they even understand what they are doing.Heaven forbid! These idle and dishonest people are like squids that hide in acloud of truth, proclaiming \"journalistic duty\" and other lies while attackingthe rest of the world in the sneakiest way possible. They congregate atcongressional meetings and conventions to confirm the tedious talk about theirjournalistic duty and the honor they do to society. Then this species bows topay their respects to one another and with it they end their meeting. Thisinsidious group manufactures more than two-thirds of all socalled \"publicopinion\", and this is where parliament obtains their strength.To describe all of this in detail and prove its lies and falsehoods would takevolumes. But putting all this aside, if we just look at the product and itseffect, I think this will be enough to show how this crazy business works insuch a way that even the most innocent and skeptical person will understand.The quickest and easiest way to understand this senseless and dangerous devianceis by comparing democratic parliament systems with a genuine Germanic democracy.A body of five hundred men, or even recently, women, is chosen, whose duty is tomake a final decision on all kinds of issues. They alone are effectively thegovernment. Even though they may choose a cabinet, which on the outside issupposed to manage the affairs of state, this is only for show.In reality, the government cannot take any step without first getting permissionfrom the general assembly. Consequently, it is not responsible for anythingsince the final decision does not rest with anyone in the government, but withthe majority of Parliament. In any case, the government simply carries out thewill of the majority. Its political capacity can really only be judged by itsskill in either conforming to the will of the majority or convincing themajority to switch to its side. This reduces it from being a real government tobeing a beggar at the feet of the majority. Its most urgent job is to gain thefavor of the existing majority or to try to set up a more agreeable newmajority. If it succeeds, it can continue the political game for a little whilelonger. If it does not succeed, it must quit. Whether its intentions are rightor wrong are not even considered. This eliminates all responsibility foranyone's actions or decisions.It does not take a lot of thinking to figure out what the results will be. Thefive hundred representatives of the people present a disjointed and usually apitiful picture if you look at their dissimilar occupations or their variedpolitical abilities. Surely no one would assume that those elected by the nationare chosen because of their ability to reason or their intellect. I hope no oneis foolish enough to think that hundreds of statesmen can emerge from ballotboxes which have been stuffed by those who themselves only posses an averageintelligence. We can never denounce sharply enough the silly idea that geniusesare discovered through general elections. The average nation only finds a realstatesman once in a blue moon, not a hundred at a time. The masses will opposeany outstanding genius because it is their instinct. A camel can pass throughthe eye of a needle sooner than a great man can be \"discovered\" by an election.(Matthew 19:24 is the Bible verse about a camel passing through the eye of aneedle which is referenced by Hitler; similar passages also appear in the booksof Mark and Luke.) History has always shown that those who rose above theaverage level did so through the driving force of an individual personality. Nowwe have five hundred people of mere modest ability voting on the most importantissues of the nation and installing a government which requires the approval ofthe exalted five hundred. This government in turn learns that to secure itsposition it must carry out the policy of the five hundred. Unfortunately, thepolicy is actually created by five hundred people and it carries the same shabbyappearance.Even if there were no question about the ability of these representatives, wemust remember how varied the problems are that are waiting to be solved and inhow many totally separate fields answers and decisions have to be given. We caneasily understand how worthless a government institution is that entrusts theright to make a final decision to a mass meeting of people among whom only a fewhave any knowledge and experience in the matter being discussed. The mostimportant economic measures are presented to a forum where only a tenth of themembers have any economic training. This is simply putting the final decision onan important matter in the hands of men who lack the skills to deal with itintelligently.That is how it ends with every question. Things are always settled by a majorityof ignoramuses and incompetents, since the membership of this institution nevertruly changes. The problems presented extend to almost every field of publiclife and would require a constant change of parliamentary leaders to judge andvote on them. After all, it is impossible to let the same people deal withmatters of transportation and with a question of important foreign policy.Otherwise, they would all have to be geniuses in every area and this does nothappen once in centuries. Even worse, they are not \"brains\" at all, but onlynarrow, conceited, and arrogant amateurs and intellectual pretenders of theworst sort. In fact, that is the reason for the incomprehensible carelessnessthese ruling classes display when they make decisions on matters that even thegreatest minds would find stressful. Measures of vital importance for the wholestate---actually the fate of the people and the entire race---are treated as ifthey are a game of Sheepshead or Tarot, which would be a more suitable pursuitfor such people. (Schafkopf or Sheepshead is a card game common in Bavaria;Tarot is fortune telling by cards.) Of course, it would be unfair to say everydeputy in parliament has no sense of responsibility. That is not the case atall. But by forcing the individual member to make up his mind on questions whichare not in the realm of his talents, this system gradually corrupts thecharacter of every member. Nobody is going to have the courage to say,\"Gentlemen, I do not think we know anything about this matter. I, personally, atany rate, certainly do not\". It would not make any difference if he did statehis objection because that kind of frankness would not be understood in thiscrowd and people would not let such an honest ass spoil everyone else's game.Anyone who knows human nature will understand that in such a situation, nobodylikes to be the dunce, and in certain circles, honesty is a synonym forstupidity.So, a representative who begins by being honorable is forced down the crowdedpath of lies and cheating. He believes that an individual withdrawing from adecision would not make any difference in the eventual outcome of the groupdecision and this kills every honest impulse that a person may feel.He will end up telling himself that he personally is far from the worst and thatby joining in, he might prevent worse things from happening.Some may object by saying even though the individual deputy may not have anyspecial understanding of a particular matter, his belief is based on thedirection given by his party, by his politics. The party has its separatecommittees, and he feels they are more than sufficiently informed by experts. Atfirst glance, this seems to be true. But then comes the question, why choosefive hundred when just a few of them possess the necessary wisdom needed toadopt a policy in important matters? Yes, there is the true difficulty in thewhole system. The basis of our present democratic parliament is not to form anassembly of wise men, but instead put together a herd of nobodies who aredependent on the intellect of everyone around them. They become easier to leadin a certain direction as their abilities decrease. This is the only way partypolitics can be carried on. This is the only way it is possible for thepuppeteer to remain hidden in the background without ever being personally heldaccountable for what he does. Then, every decision, no matter how harmful to thenation, is blamed on a whole party and not just one mischievous culprit pullingthe strings. All responsibility disappears because responsibility can only existif an individual makes a decision and not an association of parliamentarywindbags.Only an evil creature of the night, fearful of daylight, could approve of thisinstitution, while every honest man who accepts personal responsibility for hisown actions must find it disgusting. Consequently, this kind of democracy hasbecome the tool of that race whose real purpose forces it to hide its actionsfrom sunlight where others might see now and forever. Only the Jew can praise aninstitution as dirty and deceptive as himself.On the other side, we have the true Germanic democracy consisting of a freeelection. This leader is bound to assume full responsibility for everything hedoes. In this format, there is no roll call of a majority on individualquestions, but only the rule of an individual who has to support his decisionswith his property and his life. To anyone who objects by saying no one would bewilling to devote himself to such a risky responsibility under those conditions,there is but one answer: thank God. It is the very purpose of a Germanicdemocracy to keep every unworthy political climber who might by chance fall intothe office from gaining any power in the government of his fellow man throughthe back door. The very magnitude of this responsibility is meant to scare offweaklings and incompetents.If such a fellow should try to sneak in any way, it is easier to find andharshly punish him: \"Get away, you coward! Step away, you are stinking up thestairway. The front steps to the Pantheon of history are not for cowards, butfor heroes!\" I arrived at this opinion after watching the Vienna Parliament fortwo years. Then, I stopped going. Parliamentary government was largelyresponsible for the ever-increasing weakness of the old Hapsburg state duringthe previous few years.The more its work shattered German supremacy, the more a system of playing onenationality against another gained ground. In the Parliament Building itself,this was always at the expense of the Germans and eventually at the expense ofthe Empire. By the turn of the century, it had to have been obvious to any foolthat the central force of the Monarchy could no longer overcome the individualcountries' attempts to break loose. On the contrary, the more terrible themethods became that were used by the state for selfpreservation, the moreuniversally the state was hated. In Hungary and in the individual Slavicprovinces, the people did not identify themselves with the Monarchy so they didnot feel its weakness was shameful to them. Instead, they were rather pleased atthe signs of senility because they preferred the Monarchy's death to itsrecovery.The complete collapse of Parliament was only prevented by giving in tohumiliating concessions that consisted of inappropriate demands. Of course, theGermans had to foot the bill. In Austria, defense of the State depended onplaying off the various nationalities against one another. But the general lineof development still bore down on the Germans. When the Imperial succession gaveArchduke Francis Ferdinand more influence, the increase of Czech authorityreally began to accelerate with his support from above. This future ruler of theDual Monarchy used every means possible to promote and encourage the removal ofthe German element, or at least to cover it up. Through the civil servants,purely German towns were slowly but surely pushed into the danger-zone of mixedlanguage. In Lower Austria, this policy progressed even quicker and many Czechsalready considered Vienna \"their\" greatest city.The family of the new Hapsburg Monarchy spoke only Czech. The Archduke's lowerclass wife, a former Czech countess, belonged to a group who held their fear ofGermans as a tradition. His primary purpose was gradually to set up a Slavicstate in Central Europe built on a strong Catholic foundation as a defenseagainst Orthodox Russia. The Hapsburgs commonly made religion the servant oftheir political idea and this had a disastrous effect on Germans.The results were more than sad in several respects. Neither the House ofHapsburg nor the Catholic Church received the expected reward. The Hapsburgslost their throne and Rome lost a great state. By putting religious elements towork for political purposes, the Crown awakened a spirit that it had not dreamedwas possible. When they attempted to completely exterminate German culture inthe old Monarchy, the response was the PanGerman movement in Austria. Thismovement wanted to unify all German language speakers and German ethnic peopleinto a single German state.By the Eighteen-eighties, the Manchester Liberalism ( a political, economic, andsocial movement of the Nineteenth-century originating in Manchester, England,which challenged the existing economic system), which was fundamentally Jewish,had reached the peak of influence in the Dual Monarchy. Like everything in oldAustria, the reaction against it was primarily founded on nationalistic and notsocial considerations. Selfpreservation forced German elements to defendthemselves with the greatest force. Economic considerations slowly gained animportant influence, but only as an afterthought. Two parties emerged from thegeneral political turmoil---one had a nationalistic tendency and the other moresocial---and both were extremely interesting and instructive for the future.After the crushing conclusion of the War of 1866 ( also called the Seven WeeksWar between Austria and Prussia with Germans on both sides, it gave Prussiacontrol over most smaller German states), the House of Hapsburg consideredretaliation on the battlefield. The death of Emperor Maximilian of Mexicoprevented a closer alliance with a France. (Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico wasAustrian born and part of the Hapsburg-Lorraine Royal House. He was installedwith the help of the French in 1864 as a monarch of Mexico but was overthrownand executed in 1867.) His unfortunate expedition was blamed on Napoleon III,and his desertion by the French soldiers aroused universal anger. But even thenthe Hapsburgs were lying in wait.If the War of 1870-71 ( the Franco-Prussian war, the Prussian victory restoredthe German Empire) had not turned out to be such a triumphant march, the ViennaCourt would probably still have ventured the bloody game of revenge for Sadowa(the German name for Sadová, a village in the Czech Republic). When the firstremarkable and unbelievable but true tales of heroism came from the battlefield,the so called \"wisest\" of all Monarchs realized the timing for revenge wasinappropriate and tried to make the best of a bad situation by accepting it withgrace.The heroic struggle of those years produced an even greater miracle. TheHapsburgs showed new attitudes but it never meant there was a change of heart,just pressure from the current situation. The German people in the old EasternTerritories were carried away by Germany's joyful intoxication in victory andwere deeply touched by the resurrection of their fathers'dream which became areality. Make no mistake, even in the Czech city of Koniggratz, theGerman-spirited Austrian saw the tragic but inevitable need for the resurrectionof the Empire, an empire which could not be contaminated with the stench of theold German Confederation. (Koniggratz is a reference to the Battle of Koniggratzwhere Prussia defeated Austria and this became the first step in the formationof the German Empire.) Above all, he learned by bitter personal experience thatthe House of Hapsburg had at last completed its historical mission, and that thenew Empire must only choose the Kaiser as a man whose heroic spirit made himworthy of the title \"Crown of the Rhine\".The spirit of Fate, which bestowed this honor upon the descendant of a Housethat in the distant past had given the nation a shining symbol of nationalpraise in Frederick the Great---a symbol to last forever---that Fate deservesgreat praise.After this great war, the House of Hapsburg began to slowly and with desperatedetermination exterminate the dangerous German element in the Dual Monarchy.Without any doubt, this was the purpose of the policy which eliminated theGerman element in favor of Slavs. At that moment, the resistance of these peoplewho were marked for total destruction flamed up in a way new to German history.For the first time, patriotic and nationally-minded men became rebels. They wererebels against a way of government that would lead to the destruction of theirown nationality and not rebel against state or nation. For the first time inrecent German history, the customary patriotism for a dynasty was distinguishedfrom the patriotism of national love for the Fatherland and its people by openconflict.The PanGerman movement of GermanAustria in the Eighteen-nineties receives creditfor clearly and unmistakably realizing that a state has the right to demandrespect for its authority only when it is for the protection and in the interestof its people, or at least will not cause any harm. State authority cannot existas an end in itself or any kind of tyranny would become sacred and untouchable.If the government is driving a nationality to its destruction, the rebellion ofevery member of that people is not merely a right, but a duty. Whether or notthis condition exists is not shown by theoretical stories, but it is shown whenforce is used against the people and in the success of effort to suppress thenationality.Of course, every governing power claims their responsibility is to uphold theauthority of the state no matter how badly they have abused that authority, eventhough it has betrayed the interests of a nationality a thousand times over. Infighting such a power and in winning freedom or independence, the peoples'instinct for selfpreservation will have to use the same weapon used by itsadversary. That is to say the battle will be carried on by \"legal\" means as longas the power which is being overthrown also uses legal methods, but theinsurgents should not hesitate to use illegal means if the oppressor employsthem.Never forget that the highest purpose of man's existence is the preservation ofhis own kind and not the maintenance of a state or government. The question oflegality is secondary if the survival of the race is at stake and they may bepushed aside or destroyed. Even though the methods used by the ruling power area thousand times \"legal\", the selfpreservation of the oppressed is always themost noble justification for a struggle using any and every weapon. The truth ofthis statement can be seen by anyone, and this earth's history shows tremendousexamples in the wars of independence against inward or outward enslavement ofpeoples.The law of humanity is above the law of the state. However, if a people aredefeated in their struggle for human rights, this means those people are notfavored on the scale of Fate and they are not slated to remain on this world.The world will not be possessed by those who are weakwilled.Using Austria as a clear and striking example, it is easy to see how a tyrannycan wrap itself up in socalled \"legality\". The legal power of the state oncerested with the antiGerman foundation of the Parliament with its non-Germanmajority and on the equally antiGerman ruling House. These elements embodied theentire authority of the state. Any attempt to change the GermanAustrian peoplethrough these groups would have been nonsense.Consequently, our admirers of the \"legal\" way as the only \"permissible\" one, andthose admirers of the state's authority itself were bound to think that allresistance must be abandoned because it could not be carried on by legal means.This would have inevitably meant a quick end to the German people under theMonarchy. The German element was saved from that Fate only by the collapse ofthe state.The theorist with his thick glasses hanging off his nose would rather die forhis doctrines than for his people. He believes that since men made laws forthemselves, men should thereafter exist for the laws. To the credit of thePanGerman movement in Austria, and to the horror of all amateur theoreticiansand other state worshipers, the PanGerman movement swept away this nonsense.While the Hapsburgs were trying to close ranks on the German element by whatevermeans possible, this party struck back and ruthlessly attacked the \"exalted\"ruling House itself. The party was the first to dig into the rotten state andopen the eyes of hundreds of thousands. The PanGerman movement deserves thecredit for rescuing the love of the Fatherland from the embrace of this sorrydynasty.When it first began, the party had such an extraordinary following that itthreatened to become a regular landslide, but its success did not last. By thetime I arrived in Vienna, the movement had long since sunk into completeinsignificance and was overtaken by the Christian Socialist Party. The wholeprocess of the PanGerman movement's growth and decline and the ChristianSocialist Party's unheard-of rise was a classical example for study and of greatimportance to me.When I came to Vienna, my support was totally on the side of the PanGermanmovement. The fact that people had the courage to stand up in Parliament andshout \"Heil Hohenzollern!\" (Hail to the Hohenzollern Prussian Dynasty!)impressed and delighted me. I felt a happy confidence because they continued toregard themselves as only temporarily separated from the German Empire and not amoment passed without announcing the fact. It seemed to me that the onlyremaining road to salvation for our people was to speak out without hesitationon every question concerning the German element and never to compromise. But Icould not understand why, after its first magnificent rise, the PanGermanmovement could collapse. I understood even less how in the same period, theChristian Socialist Party (which focused on the privilegedclass and Catholicpriests) had built an enormous power base. It was just then reaching the peak ofits fame.While I was attempting to compare the two movements, Fate gave me the bestinstruction I could have hoped for and helped me to understand the reason behindthis puzzle. I began my deliberation with the men who must be considered the leaders andfounders of the two parties: Georg von Schonerer and Dr. Karl Lueger.( Georg Ritter von Schonerer was a well known nationalist politician in Austriawho was AntiSemitic, Anti-Slav, Anti-Catholic and Pro PanGerman. He formed thePanGerman Party.) In purely human terms, they both tower above any socalledparliamentary figures. In the swamp of general political corruption, theyremained pure and above reproach. My personal compassion was on the side of thePanGerman, Schonerer at first and gradually extended to the Christian Socialistleader, Dr. Karl Lueger. Schonerer's ability seemed to be much better and he wasa more solid thinker on problems of principle. He realized the inevitable end ofthe Austrian State more clearly and more correctly than anyone else. If theGerman Empire had listened to his warnings about the Hapsburg Monarchy, thecatastrophe of Germany's First World War against all of Europe would never havehappened.Schonerer could grasp the inner nature of a problem but was completelyunsuccessful as a judge of men. This was Dr. Lueger's strong point. He was arare judge of human nature and was careful to never view men as better than theyare. Consequently, he primarily dealt with the practical possibilities of lifeof which Schonerer had little understanding. Everything the PanGerman Schonererthought was theoretically true, but he did not have the strength or ability toexplain this theory to the masses. He could not express it in a way that thecommon people, with limited understanding of the issue, could comprehend.Therefore, all his insight was just the wisdom of a seer and could never becomea reality.This lack of understanding when it came to human nature eventually led to errorsin judging the strength of the movements as a whole and the old traditions.Lastly, Schonerer recognized that these were questions worthy of a WorldConcept, but he did not realize that only the broad masses of people can be thefoundation of such, almost religious, convictions. He did not see how thefighting spirit in the privilegedclass circles was so badly limited. They had nofighting will because of their economic position. The individual who is afraidmay lose too much will and hold himself back and avoid risk. In general, aWorldConcept can only hope for victory if the broad masses---the foundation ofthe new doctrine---are prepared to fight the necessary battle.His inability to understand the importance of the lower classes gave him aninadequate understanding of the social problem. In this way, Dr. Lueger wasSchonerer's opposite. Lueger's thorough knowledge of human nature allowed him tojudge the possible forces of men, and, at the same time, prevented him fromjudging the power of existing institutions. This may have been what led him touse the masses as a means to accomplish his goals.He very well understood that the political fighting strength of the upper levelof the privilegedclass in modern times was small and not sufficient to assurevictory for a great new movement. In his political activity, he put the mostemphasis on winning over the population whose daily life was threatened. Thisstimulated rather than paralyzed their fighting spirit. He was also willing touse every instrument of power available to win the favor of powerful existinginstitutions and derive the greatest possible advantage for his own movementfrom the old sources of power. He aimed his new party chiefly at themiddleclass, which was threatened with destruction, and thus assured himself ofan almost unshakable following---a following that was ready for greatselfsacrifice and full of stubborn, dogged-fighting determination. His relationto the Catholic Church was built up with infinite shrewdness, and soon attractedso many of the younger clergy that the old clerical side of the party was forcedto either abandon the field of battle or, a wiser choice, to unite with the newparty.We would be doing the man a serious injustice if this was the onlycharacteristic we saw in him. Besides being a shrewd tactician, he had thequalities and the genius of a truly great reformer, but all these were limitedby the resources he believed were available and also by his own capabilities.This truly outstanding man set himself a completely practical goal. He wanted tocapture Vienna. Vienna was the heart of the Monarchy. The last remnants of lifewent out from this city into the sickly and aging body of the rotten Empire. Thehealthier the heart became, the more quickly the body could heal. The idea wasright in principle but could only be put in practice for a limited time. Thatwas the weakness of the man. What he achieved as Mayor of the city of Vienna isimmortal in the best sense of the word, but that did not enable him to save theMonarchy. It was too late.His opponent, Schonerer, had seen this more clearly. Dr. Lueger was extremelysuccessful in putting his plans into practice, but this did not give him theresult he hoped for. Schonerer did not have the ability to accomplish what hewanted. What he dreaded most finally happened and to a frightening degree. (ThePrime Minister proclaimed civil servants were to be required to speak Czech asthe official language in Bohemia which excluded German speakers from applyingfor government jobs. Soon thereafter Schonerer lost support due to his strongviews and active opposition.) So neither man reached his ultimate goal. Luegerwas too late to save Austria, and Schonerer was too late to preserve the Germanpeople from destruction. It is extremely enlightening for us today to study thecauses of both parties' failure. It is particularly useful for my friends,because today conditions are not very different from conditions then. By lookingback, we can avoid the same mistakes that brought about the end of one movementand made the other sterile.In my opinion, there were three reasons for the collapse of the PanGermanmovement in Austria. First, there was only a vague idea of the importance of thesocial problem, which is particularly bad for a new and revolutionary party.Schonerer and his followers primarily focused on the privilegedclasses so theresult was bound to be tame and weak. Although its individual members wouldnever suspect it, the German privilegedclass, especially the upperprivilegedclass, is opposed to war to the point of self-surrender in matters ofnation or state. In times when the government is functioning well, thisinclination is the reason why this class of people is extraordinarily valuableto the state. However, in times when the government is functioning badly, theybecome absolutely catastrophic. In order to fight a serious battle, thePanGerman movement would have to devote itself to winning over the masses. Itdid not do this. From the beginning, it was deprived of the basic drive neededto support a wave of momentum and allow it to build. Without this support, itsubsided quickly. If you do not realize this principle and carry it out from thebeginning, the new party can never recover from this omission later. When alarge, moderate, privilegedclass element is captured, the movement's beliefswill always be directed along their preexisting ideas, and then any chance ofwinning strength from the common people is lost. After that, the movement cannever progress beyond weak arguing, pale wrangling, and criticism. We can nolonger find a religious-like faith and a willingness for selfsacrifice. They arereplaced by a process that gradually wears away the rough edges of the questionsin dispute resulting in \"constructive\" collaboration, which in this case meansacknowledging the existing state of affairs. Ultimately they wind up in asatisfyingly-corrupt peace.That was what happened to the PanGerman movement. It did not start by recruitingits followers from the great mass of common people. It became \"privilegedclass,respectable, and restrained\". This mistake gave birth to the second cause ofswift decline. By the time the PanGerman movement arose, the German element'ssituation in Austria was already desperate. From year to year, the Parliamenthad strengthened its intent to slowly destroy the German people. Any hope ofrescue lay in the removal of this institution.This raised a question of fundamental importance for the movement. In order todestroy the Parliament, should it be done from the inside or the outside? Theywent in and came out beaten. They had no choice but to go in because fightingsuch a power from the outside means being armed with unshakable courage andready for infinite sacrifice. In this situation the bull must be seized by thehorns. We will take a lot of sharp blows and are often knocked down in this kindof fight. We may even have shattered limbs, but we must stand up again. Victoryrests with the bold attacker only after an extreme struggle. The magnitude ofthe sacrifice is the only way to attract new fighters for the cause. This mustcontinue until determination is rewarded with success. For that purpose, thechildren of the great masses of the people are needed. Only they would bedetermined and persistent enough to fight the battle to the bloody end. ThePanGerman movement did not control these great crowds. There was no choice butto go into Parliament.It would be a mistake to think that their decision was the result of a longspiritual consideration. No, they never considered any other option. Being apart of this nonsense was just the concrete result of vague ideas concerning theimportance and meaning of taking part in an institution which they recognized aswrong in principle. In general, they probably hoped it would be easier toenlighten the broad masses of the people by grabbing the opportunity to speak infront of a \"forum of the whole nation\". Also, it seemed obvious that an attackfrom inside the root-ofthe-evil would be more successful than an outside. Theybelieved the screen of parliamentary immunity would add to the safety of theindividual fighter and the force of the attack would only be increased.What actually happened was quite different. The forum the PanGerman deputiesspoke to had become smaller, not larger. No one can speak and reach a largeraudience by using reports and summaries. The only audience they will reach isthe circle which can either hear or already accepts them.The greatest direct forum of listeners is not found in the chamber of aParliament, but in great, public mass meetings.Public meetings provide thousands of people who have come simply to hear whatthe speaker has to tell them. In the Chamber of Deputies, there are just a fewhundred listeners and most are there just to receive extra pay and not to beenlightened by the wisdom of some \"honorable representative of the people\". Itis always the same audience and they will never learn anything new because theylack the intelligence and the desire to open their minds.Not one of these representatives will bow by choice to superior truth and thenadopt it as his cause. No, nobody ever does this unless he hopes that bychanging, he can save his seat for another session. These \"models of manhood\"make it their business to move over to the other party only if they suspect theycould be more successful and then only when there are noises that the previousparty is not going to do well in the upcoming election. The shift usually takesplace in the middle of an explosion of loudly-voiced moral concerns to explainthe reason for their change. Consequently, a great migration always begins whenan existing party seems to be disliked so much that a crushing defeat isthreatened. The parliamentary rats abandon the party ship.This has nothing to do with superior knowledge or intentions. It is just aclairvoyant gift that warns the parliamentary rodents in time to fall into anew, warm, party bed. Speaking in front of such a \"forum\" is really just castingpearls before swine (Matthew 7:6, meaning, it is a wasted effort to revealpearls of wisdom to people who plan to reject us or do not appreciate thevalue). It is really not worthwhile and the result is nothing. The PanGermandeputies could talk until their throats were sore without effect.The press either responded with dead silence or they distorted the speeches fromthe parliament floor so much that any meaning was twisted or lost.Public opinion consequently formed a very bad impression of the new movement'spurposes. What the individual gentlemen said made no difference because themeaning depended on how it was written up in the newspaper. Only a small portionof their speeches were covered, and this was so disjointed, it seemed likenonsense. That is exactly the impression that was intended by the press. Theonly forum they really spoke to consisted of barely five hundredparliamentarians and that explains why they never reached the public. The worstpart was that the PanGerman movement could only count on success if itunderstood from the beginning that the problem was about a new WorldConcept andnot about a new party. Nothing less could stir up the necessary inner strengthto fight this gigantic battle to the end. Only the best and bravest minds wereof any use as leaders. Unless they are heroes, ready to sacrifice themselves andlead the fight for a new concept, there will be no soldiers ready to follow themand die for the cause either. A man who is fighting for his own existence hasnothing left over for a common cause.While the new movement may offer fame and honor among generations to come, todayit can offer nothing because it is nothing. The more a movement has open postsand positions which are easy to obtain, the more people who are zeros will stepforward to fill them. Finally, these political daylaborers overrun a successfulparty so much that the honest fighter of the early days no longer recognizes theold movement, and the new arrivals strongly object to him as an intruder. Andthus ends any such movement's \"mission\".The moment the PanGerman movement sold its soul to Parliament, it naturallygained \"parliamentarians\" instead of leaders and fighters. It sank to the levelof one of the ordinary political parties of the day and lost the strength tocourageously fight to the death. Instead of fighting, it learned to \"speak\" and\"negotiate\". The new parliamentarian soon preferred and believed it was lessrisky to fight for the new WorldConcept with the \"intellectual\" weapons ofparliamentary eloquence rather than to throw himself into a battle whose resultwas uncertain, possibly risking his own life. With this mindset, nothing couldbe gained.Now that the party had people in Parliament, the followers outside began to hopefor and expect miracles, but that of course, never happened and never couldhappen. They quickly became impatient. Even what they heard from their owndeputies didn't satisfy the voters. This was easy to explain since the hostilepress was careful not to give the people a truthful picture of the PanGermandeputies' work.The more the new representatives acquired a taste for the gentler style of\"revolution\" in Parliament, the less they were willing to return to the moredangerous work of enlightening the large masses of the common people. For thisreason, the mass meetings that were truly effective, directly personal, and away of exerting influence and possibly winning over a large number of thepeople, were abandoned.When the beer table of the meeting hall was finally exchanged for the auditoriumof Parliament, and the speeches were poured into the heads of the socalled\"chosen\" and not to the people, the PanGerman movement ceased to be a people'smovement and quickly sank into a club for academic discussions. The badimpression given in the newspapers was no longer corrected by personaltestimonies at meetings and finally the word \"PanGerman\" left a very bad tastein the mouths of the common people.One thing all the champions with ink-stained fingers and fools of today shouldtake to heart is that the great upheavals in this world have never been guidedby a pen. The only job of the pen has been to explain them in theory. Since thebeginning of time, the force that started the great religious and politicallandslides of history has been the magic power of the spoken word alone.The great masses of a people yield only to the force of speech. All greatmovements are people's movements. They are volcanic eruptions of human passionsset off either by the cruel Goddess of Desperation or by the torch of the wordas it is thrown to the masses. They are not the sweet words of smooth-talk,literature, and heroes. Only a storm of hot passion can change the \"Fate of aPeople\". Passion can only be aroused by a man who feels it inside himself. Onlythe possessor of passion can give the words that will open the gates to apeople's heart like a hammer.A man who has no passion and whose mouth is closed has not been chosen by Heavenas a Messenger of its Will. Let writers stick to their ink-pens and do\"theoretical\" work if their intelligence and ability will let them. He has notbeen born or chosen to be a Leader.Amovement that hopes to achieve great things must be alert and keep itsconnection with the common people. Every question must be considered from thatstandpoint and decided with that view. A movement must avoid anything that mightreduce or even slightly weaken its ability to influence the masses. Without themighty force of a great people, no great ideas, however noble and exalted, canpossibly be achieved. Harsh reality alone must determine the path to the goal.An unwillingness to take difficult roads in this world too often meansabandoning the goal. When the PanGerman movement emphasized its activity inParliament and not among the people, it lost the battle for the future andreceived a cheap, momentary success in its place. It chose the easier battlewhich made it no longer worthy of the final victory.I thought through these particular questions very thoroughly in Vienna. In myeffort to understand them, I saw one of the chief causes of the movement'scollapse, which I previously believed was destined to assume the leadership ofGerman elements in Austria at that time.The first two mistakes which wrecked the PanGerman movement were closelyrelated. The PanGermans did not understand the inner, driving forces of greatupheavals and they failed to understand the importance of the great masses ofpeople. Their interest in defining the social problem was small, their attemptsto capture the soul of the lower levels of the nation inadequate, and theirpositive attitude towards Parliament only increased their inadequacy.If they had realized the enormous power inherent in the masses as their greatestsupporter, they would have approached propaganda issues differently. Theiremphasis for the movement would have been put on the factory floor and thestreet and not in Parliament.Even their third mistake had its origin in the fact that they did not recognizethe value of the masses. The masses are set in motion like a toy car that ispointed along a path by superior intellects, and, as it travels, it thenmaintains its momentum after it is in motion. From that point on, the foundersprovide encouragement and determination right up to the attack. The hardstruggle the PanGerman movement fought against the Catholic Church can beexplained by its insufficient understanding of the people's spiritual nature.The new party's violent attack upon the center of Catholicism, Rome, also had anumber of causes. When the House of Hapsburg finally decided to transformAustria into a Slavic state, it resorted to whatever means were necessary toaccomplish that goal. With very little conscience, this ruling houseunscrupulously put religious institutions to work for the new \"State Idea\".Employment of Czech priests and their spiritual shepherds was just one of themany ways used to obtain what they wanted---the conversion of Austria to aSlavic state.The process took place something like this. In purely German church parishes,Czech pastors were installed. They in turn gradually began to place theinterests of the Czech people above the interests of the churches, and this madethem focal points in the process of removing German elements from society.The German clergy failed to counter these tactics. Not only were similar tacticscompletely useless in any struggle on the Germans' part, but they could notresist the attacks of the other side. By misusing religion on one hand andproviding an inadequate defense on the other, German elements were slowly andconsistently pushed under the rug. This is how it happened on a small scale, andthings were not very different on a large scale. The antiGerman efforts of theHapsburgs were not resisted as they should have been by the higher clergy andthe upholding of German interests was pushed entirely into the background.The general impression was that the Catholic clergy had committed a seriousinfringement on German rights. In other words, the Church did not seem to feelany loyalty to the German people, but unjustly took the side of its enemies. InSchonerer's opinion, the root of the whole trouble was that the Catholic Churchdid not have control in Germany and because of this, it was hostile to theinterests of our nationality wherever they were found.In this, as in almost everything in Austria, cultural problems were moved almostentirely into the background. What determined the PanGerman Party's positiontoward the Catholic Church was more about its insufficient efforts on behalf ofGerman rights and its constant support of Slavic interests and greed and not somuch about the Church's attitude toward science.Georg Schonerer was not the kind of man who would do things halfway. He took upthe struggle against the Church with the conviction that this struggle alonecould save the German people. The \"Freedom-from-Rome\" movement (also called theAway-From-Rome movement) he founded seemed the most violent, but also thestrongest way of attacking the problem and one that surely would destroy theenemy strongholds. He believed that if it succeeded, the unhappy split betweenthe two Churches in Germany would end and they would come together resulting inthe creation of inner strength for the Empire and this would give the Germannation a huge victory.But neither the premise nor the conclusion of this struggle was correct. Withouta doubt, the power of nationalist resistance from German Catholic clergy membersconcerning German society was less than that of their non-German counterparts,especially their Czech colleagues. Only an ignoramus would fail to see that theGerman clergy never took the offensive on behalf of German interests. Anyoneexcept a blind man was forced to admit this was due to Germans who were indistress over the thought that the objectivity of our attitude toward our ownnationality might not be objective.The Czech priest's attitude toward his people was subjective and his attitudetoward the Church was objective. On the other hand, the German pastor wassubjectively devoted to the Church and remained objective toward his nation.This is a phenomenon that can be observed in a thousand other cases.It is by no means exclusive to Catholicism either. This obsession withobjectivity has quickly contaminated almost every one of our institutions,especially state or intellectual institutions.We only have to compare our civil servants' attitude toward a national revivalwith the attitude of civil servants from another nation. Would any army officersanywhere in the world put aside the interests of the government of their nationas ours have done for the past five years? They are even praised for doing so.Do not both Churches today take a stand in the Jewish question that is againstthe interests of the nation or the real needs of religion? Consider the attitudeof a Jewish Rabbi towards any question, even one of quite insignificantimportance concerning the Jews as a race, and compare his attitude with that ofthe majority of our clergy, whether Catholic or Protestant.We see the same thing whenever there is a question about maintaining an abstractidea. \"Governmental authority\", \"democracy\", \"pacifism\", and \"internationalsolidarity\", are ideas that we almost always turn into rigid, totallytheoretical concepts and we use them to judge vital national matters from thepoint of view they give us.This disastrous way of looking at issues from a preconceived opinion kills theability to think subjectively about anything which objectively contradicts one'sown doctrines. It eventually leads to a complete reversal of the means and the-- ends; people cannot tell the difference between the procedure used to reach agoal and the goal they want to achieve. People resist a national revival when itdepends on the removal of a bad and destructive regime because they would saythis is an offense against \"governmental authority\". \"Governmental authority\" inthe eyes of one of these fanatics clinging to objectivity is not a means to anend but the end itself, and that end is sufficient to fill his whole, sorrylife.Such people would loudly object if anyone attempted to set up a dictatorship,even if the leader was to be Frederick the Great, who we know would be anoutstanding leader. They would still object to this replacement even if theParliament was filled by a majority of politicians who were small minded andincompetent or maybe even worse. They do this because these sticklers forabstract principles hold the law of democracy more sacred than the welfare ofthe nation. Some of them will defend the worst tyranny, destroying their ownpeople in the process, because the tyranny embodies \"governmental authority\".They will oppose even the most beneficial government if it does not fit in withtheir idea of \"democracy\".In the same way, our German pacifists will ignore this bloody rape of thenation, and no matter how bloodily it is carried out by the most evil militaryforces, they will still ignore it if the only way to avert this fate is byresistance and force. (This is a reference to the Treaty ofVersailles'reparations and the Ruhr-Area occupation by France.) Resistance wouldviolate the spirit of their peaceful society. The German International Socialistcan be robbed by his comrades in each country of the world and the Socialistreturns the favor with brotherly love. He would never dream of using force oreven make any effort toward defense simply because he is a German who couldnever consider using force.This may be a sad fact, but before we can change anything we must recognize theproblem first. The same holds true for the weakness in the clergy who fail touphold German interests. It is not malicious ill will in itself nor compelled byorders \"from above\". What we see is the result of inadequate training in thelove of German culture from childhood along with complete subjection to the ideathat we should not control our national destiny.Training that is dished out for democracy, for International Socialism, forpacifism, is so rigid, exclusive, and completely subjective that it influenceshow we see the rest of the world. From childhood on, the attitude toward Germanculture has always been very objective. The pacifist, subjectively surrenderinghimself altogether to his idea, will, if he is a German, look for the objectivejustice in every serious threat to his people and will never join and fight inthe ranks of his people not even from a pure instinct of selfpreservation.We can see in the Catholic and Protestant churches how this principal has takenhold. By nature, Protestantism upholds the interests of German culture better.This has to do with its origin and later tradition, but it fails the moment itis called upon to defend national interests which are not in the sphere of itsideals and traditions or which, for some reason or other, may be rejected by theChurch.Protestantism will always take some role in promoting German ideals as long asit concerns moral integrity or national education, or when the German spiritualbeing or language or spiritual freedom need to be defended. This is only becausethese represent the principles on which Protestantism itself is founded. Thissame Protestant attitude will violently oppose every attempt to rescue thenation from the grasp of a mortal enemy. This same Protestant attitude towardsthe Jews is rigid and fixed in their dogma. This is also the first problem whichhas to be solved. Without a solution, all attempts to bring about a Germanresurgence or to raise the nation's standing are destined to end in rubbish andwill become impossible.While I was in Vienna, I had the opportunity to look into this question withouthaving a previously formed opinion on the matter. My daily contacts with peopleconfirmed my view a thousand times over. In this mixture of nationalities, itwas quickly proven that only a German pacifist will always try to lookobjectively at the interests of his own nation, while the Jew never does thiswith the interests of the Jewish people. Only the German Socialist is\"international\" in a sense where he considers outside interests to be equal withhis own nation's interests, and this prevents him from winning justice for hisown people except by whimpering and bawling to his international comrades. It isnever true of the Czech or the Pole. I saw even then that the spreading harm wasonly partly in the doctrines themselves, and our weak devotion to the nation wasthe result of our inadequate training in our own nationality.This disproves the first purely theoretical argument for the PanGermanmovement's struggle against Catholicism. We should train the German people fromchildhood to exclusively recognize the rights of their own nationality and notinfect the children's hearts with our curse of \"objectivity\", especially inmatters of selfpreservation. The result of this would be that the Catholicelement in Germany, just as in Ireland, Poland, or France, will be a Germanfirst and foremost. Of course, all this assumes a radical change in the nationalgovernment. Our strongest proof of this argument is in the period when ourpeople last appeared before the judgment-seat of history for a battle of lifeand death. As long as leadership representing the Heavens was present, thepeople did their duty overwhelmingly. Protestant pastor and Catholic priest bothcontributed enormously to continuing our resistance, not only at the front, butat home. During those first years there was really only one Holy German Empirefor both camps and everyone turned to his own Heaven to sustain that future.There was one question that the PanGerman movement in Austria should have askeditself: Is the preservation of GermanAustrian culture possible with a Catholicfaith or not? If so, the political party had no business bothering withreligious and confessional matters. If not, then a religious reformation wasnecessary and not a political party. Anyone who thinks he can arrive at areligious reformation by way of a political organization shows that he doesn'thave the faintest idea how the growth of religious ideas or teachings build aChurch.Here, one truly cannot serve two masters. Make no mistake, I believe thefounding or destruction of a religion is a far greater matter than the foundingor destruction of a State, let alone of a political party. It is not an argumentto the contrary for someone to say that the attacks were only defensive measuresagainst attacks from the other side.Down through the ages, men lacking conscience have not hesitated to makereligion a tool in their political business. When they turn it into a tool, itis almost always the sole aim of such characters to use it as nothing more thana tool and they have no true beliefs. It would be wrong to hold a religion or aChurch responsible for the scoundrels who abuse it. That type of person woulduse anything that served his purpose.Nothing could be better suited to one of these worthless parliamentarytricksters than finding a scapegoat for his political juggling. The momentreligion or any sect is made responsible for his personal bad behavior, thelying scoundrel shouts to the whole world so they can witness how justified hisbehavior has been, and how he alone has been the salvation of religion andChurch through his eloquence. The rest of the world, as stupid as it isforgetful, usually does not recognize or remember him amid the shouting as theoriginal source of the problem. By this time, the scoundrel has achieved hisobjective.These crafty foxes know perfectly well that their misdeeds have nothing to dowith religion. He will hide his face and laugh so none may see his sick joy whenhis honest but unskilled adversary loses the game and, some day afterward, heloses all faith in humanity and retires from the activities of public life.In other respects, it would also be unfair to make religion or even the Churchresponsible for the misdeeds of individuals. If we compare the greatness of itsvisible organization with the imperfection of men in general, we will have toadmit that the balance of good to bad is better in religious institutions thanalmost anywhere else. Without a doubt, there are some priests who see their holyoffice as just a stepping stone for their political ambitions. Amid thepolitical battle, they forget that they are the guardians and not defenders of ahigher truth. But for every unworthy figure, there are a thousand honorableshepherds of souls faithfully devoted to their mission who stand out like littleislands from the swamp of the present corrupt and deceitful age.I do not and must not condemn the Church if some corrupt creature wearing apriest's collar happens to commit a moral offense. I also must not condemn thewhole group if one among the many soils and betrays his nationality, especiallyin an age when this is a daily occurrence. We should not forget that for everypublic traitor like the famous Greek betrayer Ephialtes, there are thousands whofeel the misfortunes and have deep sympathy for their people. These great menlong for the moment when Heaven will once more smile on us. (Ephialtes was asoldier who betrayed the Spartan army.He is said to have told the Persians about the pass of Thermopylae around themountains which they used to attack in the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C., sothis reference means a traitor.) If anyone feels these are not petty, everydayproblems but questions of fundamental truth and beliefs in general, we can onlyanswer him with another question. Do you think you are chosen by Fate toproclaim this truth? Then do it. But have the courage not to do it through apolitical party. This is a deception and a betrayal of your vocation. Instead,replace the bad parts with something better, something that will last andimprove the conditions for future generations.If you do not have the courage or if you are not sure about the alternative youare supporting, then let things alone. In any case, do not try to sneak into apolitical movement that you would not dare to reach for openly. As long asreligious problems do not undermine the morals and ethics of one's own race likean enemy of the people does, political parties have no business meddling withthem. Just as religion should not identify itself with political party mischief,political parties should not meddle in religion.If dignitaries of the church use religious institutions or even doctrines toinjure their own nationality, we must never follow them or try to fight themwith their own weapons. To the political leader, the religious beliefs andinstitutions of his people must be sacred; otherwise, he has no right to be apolitician.He is in danger of becoming a reformer if he has the right stuff for it. Anyother attitude, particularly in Germany, would lead to catastrophe.After studying the PanGerman movement and its struggle against Rome, I came tothe following belief and that belief only became stronger through the years. Themovement's failure to see the importance of the social problem cost it thecapable fighting masses of the people. Its entrance into Parliament deprived itof this mighty force and infected it with all the weaknesses found inparliament. Its struggle against the Catholic Church made the fight impossiblein many lower and middleclass groups and robbed it of many of the nation's bestelements. The practical result of the Austrian Culture Struggle (Kulturkampf)was effectively zero.They did succeed in taking almost a hundred thousand members from the Church,but failed to inflict any real damage. The Church did not shed any tears overthe lost sheep. The only losses were those who had not really belonged to theChurch for a long time in their hearts. There was an important differencebetween this new Reformation and the old Reformation. During the oldReformation, many of the Church's best members left because of religiousconvictions. In the new Reformation, only the lukewarm left and that was forpolitical reasons. From the political standpoint, the result of this attemptedreform was as sorry as it was ridiculous.Once again, a movement that showed promise for the political salvation of theGerman nation had gone to pieces because it was not conducted with the necessaryruthless clearsightedness and it lost itself in squabbles. One thing is true:the PanGerman movement would never have made this mistake if it had sufficientlyunderstood the character of the broad masses. If its leaders had known that tosucceed at all, for purely psychological reasons, they must never show two ormore adversaries to the masses. If they do, then the fighting force iscompletely divided. If they had realized this, the PanGerman movement would havedirected their full fighting force at one single adversary. Nothing is moredangerous for a political party than to let itself be led back and forth hitherand yon between decisions because this means it can never accomplish anythingvisible.No matter how many things may actually be wrong with a particular religiouspersuasion, a political party must never, not even for an instant, lose sight ofthe fact that no purely political party in a similar situation has eversucceeded in a religious reformation. This is well established in history. We donot study history to forget its teachings; we study it to put those teachings topractical use. We should not think that things are different now and that itseternal truths no longer apply. On the contrary, from history, we learn what weshould do today. No one who cannot learn from history should imagine himself asa political leader. He is actually a shallow and usually very conceitedsimpleton, and all the goodwill in the world does not excuse his deficiencies.In any age of history, the qualities of a truly great and popular leaderconsisted of focusing on a single adversary and not distracting the people'sattention. The more unified the people's will to fight a single object, thegreater the magnetic attraction a political movement will have and the moretremendous its impact. It is part of the genius of a great leader to make evenwidely separated adversaries appear as if they belonged to just one category.Weak characters who have difficulty making decisions will begin to doubt whethertheir own side is right when they see a variety of enemies.When the wavering masses see themselves fighting against too many enemies,objectivity immediately appears with the question of whether all the others arereally wrong and just one side is right. That is the first sign of one's ownstrength weakening. Therefore, a number of opponents must always be lumpedtogether so that in the eyes of one's own followers, the battle is foughtagainst one single enemy.This strengthens their faith in their own cause, and increases their bitternessagainst anyone who attacks it. This cost the PanGerman movement their successwhen they failed to realize the importance of a single front. The PanGerman goalwas correct and its will was pure, but the road it took was wrong. It was like amountain climber who keeps his eye fixed on the peak to be scaled and takes theobvious trail while he is filled with great determination and energy. As hewalks, he pays no attention to the path and he doesn't see where it truly leadsbecause his eye is always on the goal. He finally wanders astray.The position of its great competitor, the Christian Socialist Party, seemed tobe reversed. The road it took was clever and correctly chosen, but a clearunderstanding of the goal was missing. In almost every matter where thePanGerman movement was lacking, the attitude of the Christian Socialist Partywas right and was deliberately planned to achieve results.It realized the importance of the masses and secured at least part of them byclearly emphasizing its social aspect from the very start. By adjusting itselfto win the middle and lower-middle classes, it obtained a following as faithfulas it was stubborn and selfsacrificing. It avoided fighting any religiousinstitution and secured the support of a mighty organization in the Church.Consequently, it only had one truly great adversary. It recognized the value oflarge-scale propaganda and was skilled in working on the human instincts of thebroad mass of its followers. However, it also failed to reach its dream ofsaving Austria.There were two shortcomings in its method: the means they employed, and the lackof a clear goal. The antiSemitism of the new movement was founded on a religiousconcept instead of a racial insight. The reason this mistake occurred was thesame reason that caused the second error. If the Christian Socialist Party wasto save Austria, the founders felt it must not take its stand on the raceprinciple because they feared the State would collapse from the pressure. In theparty leaders' view, the multi-ethnic situation in Vienna made it necessary toput aside anything that divided people, and in their place, emphasize anythingthat united the public.By that time, Vienna was already so thoroughly impregnated with foreigners,especially Czech elements, that they had to be extremely tolerant when it cameto race questions otherwise they could not keep these elements in a party thatwas not antiGerman from the beginning. If Austria was to be saved, the people inAustria could not be tossed aside. An attempt was made to win the great numberof Czech lower classes in Vienna by a drive against Manchester Liberalism (apolitical, economic, and social movement originating in Manchester, England). Itwas presumed that this attack would be seen as struggle against Jewry on areligious basis, which would bridge all the national differences of old Austria.Such an attack would only create a small amount of worry among to the Jews. Atworst, a dash of baptismal water would always save his business and Judaismboth.With a superficial argument like this, they never achieved serious scientifictreatment of the whole problem and so they repelled anyone who did notunderstand this sort of antiSemitism already. The attractive power of the ideawas limited almost exclusively to intellectual circles. The leaders failed to gofrom that point to developing a real insight by using a pure emotionalexperience. The political elite remained hostile. The whole affair looked moreand more like a mere attempt at a new conversion of the Jews or even envy ofcompetitors. The struggle lost the appearance of a movement born from devoutconviction and seemed to many average people immoral and reprehensible. Therewas no reason to believe that this was a vital question for all of humanity orthat the Fate of all nonJewish people depended on it.This halfhearted attempt destroyed the value of the Christian Socialist Party'santiSemitic attitude. It was a movement that made no pretenses to antiSemitism,and that was worse than having no leaning towards antiSemitism at all. Thepeople were being lulled into a sense of security and thought they had the enemyby the ears, while in reality, they were being led around by the nose.The Jew, however, soon became so accustomed to this sort of antiSemitism that heprobably would have missed it more if it wasn't there than he was bothered byits presence. Submitting to upholding of a State of mixed nationalities demandedone great sacrifice, and theGerman culture demanded a greater sacrifice. The party could not be\"nationalistic\", and if they were, they would lose the ground under their feetin Vienna. By gently evading any question of nationalism, they hoped to save theHapsburg State and that is what ruined the movement. At the same time, themovement lost a great source of inner strength---a strength that can fill apolitical party with an inner driving force for the long run. The ChristianSocialist movement became a party no different from any other.I followed both movements closely. One was from the urging of my own heart andthe other was because I had so much admiration for the rare man who even thenseemed to be a bitter symbol of all Austrian-German culture.When the tremendous funeral procession carried the dead mayor ( Lueger) from theCity Hall out toward the Ring Street of Austria (Ringstrasse), I was among themany hundreds of thousands who watched the tragic scene. Feelings were stirred,and I knew this man's work was in vain because Fate was inevitably leading theState towards its doom. If Dr. Karl Lueger had lived in Germany, he would havebeen ranked among the great minds of our people.Having lived in this impossible State was unfortunate for him and for his work.When he died, the flames in the Balkans were already greedily flickering higherevery month, and Fate had mercifully spared him from seeing what he stillbelieved he could prevent. I tried to understand the reasons for the failure ofone movement and the misdirection of the other. Aside from the impossibility offortifying the State in old Austria, I came to the definite conclusion that themistakes of the two parties were the following: The PanGerman movement was onthe right track in principle as it desired the goal of a German revival, but itschoice of weapons was unfortunate. It was nationalistic but did not have thesocial appeal needed to conquer the masses. Its antiSemitism; however, rested ona correct realization of the importance of the race problem and not on religiousconcepts. On the other hand, the attack on a particular religious persuasion waswrong.The Christian Socialist movement had vague ideas about the goal of a Germanrenaissance, but it made an intelligent choice in its weapons to carry out theparty policy. It realized the importance of the social aspect but was mistakenin the principles it used to fight Jewry, and did not understand the strength ofthe nationalistic idea.If the Christian Socialist Party had taken their shrewd knowledge of the broadmasses and adequately understood the importance of the race problem as thePanGerman movement did and been nationalistic, or if the PanGerman movement hadadopted the practical insight and attitude toward Socialism of the ChristianSocialist Party along with its true insight into the goal of the Jewish questionand the meaning of the nationalist idea, the result would have been that one ofthese movements might have successfully changed the fate of Germans. The natureof the Austrian State was the reason this did not happen.Since my convictions were not represented clearly in any political party aroundme, I could not make up my mind to join or fight for one of the existingorganizations. Even then, I thought all the political movements were failuresand incapable of carrying out a national renaissance for the German people onany large scale.My distaste for the Hapsburg State continued to grow. The more attention I beganto pay to questions of foreign politics, the more my conviction strengthenedthat this State structure could only lead to serious misfortune for Germanculture. More and more clearly, I saw that the fate of the German nation wasbeing decided here in Austria as well as within the German Empire itself. Thiswas true in cultural life and in questions of politics.Even in the field of purely cultural or artistic affairs, the Austrian Stateshowed every sign of weakening and it was losing its importance to the Germannation as a cultural resource. This was especially true in the field ofarchitecture. Modern architecture in Austria could not be successful becauseafter the Ring Street (Ringstrasse) was built in Vienna, the rest of the jobswere insignificant when compared to the plans being developed in Germany. Ibegan to lead a double life more and more. Reason and reality made me go througha bitter though useful apprenticeship in Austria, but my heart was elsewhere.An uneasiness came over me as I realized the emptiness of this State and that itwas impossible to save it. At the same time I felt perfectly certain that itwould bring misfortune to the German people if Austria collapsed. I wasconvinced that the Hapsburg State would balk and hinder every German who mightshow signs of real greatness, while at the same time it would aid and assistevery non-German activity.This conspicuous mix of races in the capital of the Dual Monarchy, this motleycollection of Czechs, Poles, Hungarians, Ruthenians (Ukranians), Serbs andCroats, and always that infection which dissolves human society, the Jew, wereall here and there and everywhere. The whole scene was repugnant to me. Thegigantic city seemed to be the embodiment of mongrel depravity.The German I learned to speak in my youth was a dialect which is also spoken inLower Bavaria. I never forgot that particular style of speech, and I could neverlearn the Viennese dialect. The longer I stayed in the city, the hotter myhatred burned for the promiscuous alien people who began to gnaw away at thisancient seat of German culture. The idea that this State could be preserved muchlonger seemed absolutely ridiculous.Austria was like an old mosaic where the cement holding the separate bits ofstone together had become old and started to crumble. As long as it is nottouched, the work of art still appears solid, but the moment it is shaken, itfalls into a thousand fragments. The only question was when the jolt would come.Since I had never loved an Austrian Monarchy, only a German Reich, the moment ofthe State's collapse seemed to be the beginning of the salvation of the Germannation. For all these reasons, my desire grew stronger to go where my secretwishes and secret love had been pulling me since early youth. I hoped some dayto make a name as an architect and to work hard for the German nation on eitherthe large or small scale as chosen by Fate.Lastly, I wanted to enjoy the happiness of living and working in the place wherethe greatest desire of my heart must someday be fulfilled: the union of mybeloved homeland with its common Fatherland, the German Empire.Even today, many people will not be able to understand my deep desire, but Iappeal especially to two groups of people. The first are all those who have beendenied the happiness I have spoken of, and the second are those who once enjoyedthat happiness but had it torn from them by a harsh Fate. I speak to all thosewho are separated from the mother country and must fight for even the sacredpossession of their native language, those who are pursued and tormented fortheir faithfulness to the Fatherland and who long in anguish for the moment thatwill bring them back to the heart of the beloved mother. I speak to all of theseand I know they will understand me! Only those who know by bitter experiencewhat it means to be a German without the privilege of belonging to the dearFatherland can measure the deep longing, which always burns in the heart of thechildren who are away from the mother country. It torments its victims anddenies them happiness and contentment until the doors of the paternal house openand common blood will find rest and peace in a common realm.Vienna was and has remained the hardest and most thorough school of my life. Ihad entered the city as a young boy and I left it as a quiet and serious man.There I laid the foundation for a general WorldConcept and a particular way ofpolitical thinking which I later completed in detail. Only now can I fullyappreciate the real value of those years of apprenticeship.I have addressed this period of my life at some length because it gave me myfirst object lessons in issues that form the basis of the Party, which had tinybeginnings and in just five years has started to develop into a greatmass-movement. I do not know what my attitude would be today toward Jewry,toward Social Democracy, or toward Marxism as a whole, and toward the socialquestion if a cornerstone of personal views had not been laid early by thepressure of Fate and by my own self-education.Even though the misfortunes of the Fatherland may stimulate thousands uponthousands to think about the inner causes of the collapse, such could not leadto a thorough knowledge and deep insight that a man develops on his own, who hasfought a difficult battle for many years so that he might be master of his ownFate.4. MUNICHIn the spring of 1912, I moved to Munich for good. ( This was written by Hitlerin 1924.) The city was as familiar to me as if I had lived within its walls foryears. My studies were the reason for this because they repeatedly turned myattention towards German art. If you haven't seen Munich, you haven't seenGermany or German art. This time before the war was the happiest and by far themost contented of my life. My living was still meager because I only paintedenough to meet my living expenses and so I could continue my studies. I believedthat someday I would still reach the goal I had set for myself. This in itselfmade it easy for me to tolerate the small worries of daily life. I had a deeplove that possessed me for this city ever since I first arrived, more than anyother town I knew. It was a true German city! What a difference after Vienna!Thinking back to that corrupt Babylonlike city of races turned my stomach. Thedialect in Munich was also much more natural to me. When I talked to the LowerBavarians, it reminded me of the days from my youth. There must have been athousand things which were or became dear and precious to me in this city. I wasmost attracted by the wonderful mix of natural vigor and a fine artistic temper,the unique line from the architecture of the Hofbräuhaus (Court Brewery), to themusic house (named the Odeon and built by Ludwig I), and the September-OctoberFestival (Oktoberfest) to the beautiful Art Museum (Pinakothek was also built byLudwig I). Today, I am more attached to that city than to any other spot in theworld, no doubt partly because it is so firmly intertwined with the developmentof my own life. The happiness of true inner contentment that I enjoyed thencould only be attributed to the magic spell that the wonderful capitol of theWittelsbachs casts on every person. (Wittelsbach is the name of theGerman-Bavarian Royal Dynasty.) Visitors who are drawn here are clearly blessedwith a sharp intelligence and with a sensitive spirit.Aside from my professional work, what attracted me the most was the study of theday's political events, especially matters of foreign policy. I was attracted tomatters of foreign policy through the German Alliance Policy, which even in myAustrian days I had considered absolutely wrong. But in Vienna, I had not fullyrealized the extent of the German Empire's selfdeception. I had been inclined toassume that people in Berlin knew how weak and unreliable their ally wouldactually be, but were withholding this knowledge for more or less mysteriousreasons. At least, this is what I told myself. They might be trying to supportan alliance policy, which Bismarck himself had originally introduced and thoughtit was not a good idea to break it off suddenly.They may want to avoid arousing other foreign countries, which were lying inwait for their chance to strike or perhaps it might alarm the citizenry at home.I was soon horrified to discover from my contacts that my belief was wrong. Tomy surprise, everywhere I looked, even the most well-informed circles wereclueless about the nature of the Hapsburg Monarchy. The common people wereespecially victims of the idea that their ally could be considered a seriouspower that would support them in their hour of need. The masses still consideredthe Monarchy a \"German\" state and thought they could depend on it. They believedthat strength could be measured by the millions of people in Germany itself.They completely forgot that Austria had long since ceased to be a German stateand the inner structure of this Empire was moving closer to dissolving by thehour.I understood this state structure better than the socalled \"official diplomacy\"did. As usual, they were spinning blindly toward disaster. The opinions of thepeople resulted from what had been poured into their heads by the leaders. Butthe leadership was nurturing a cult like following of our \"ally\" similar to thehistorical golden calf. They probably hoped to make up for the lack of honestyon the other side by being exceptionally friendly, so everything the other sidetold them was always taken at face value.In Vienna, I was furious when I saw the occasional difference between thespeeches of the official statesmen and what was printed in the Viennanewspapers. Even then Vienna at least appeared to still be a German city.The situation was totally different if one traveled from Vienna, orGermanAustria, into the Empire's Slavic provinces! A person only needed to lookat the newspapers to see how the deception of the Triple Alliance was judgedthere. They had nothing but bloody sarcasm and contempt for this \"masterpiece ofstatesmanship\". During this period of peace, while the two Emperors kissed eachother on the brow as a token of friendship, the people made no bones about thefact that they knew the Alliance would collapse as soon as this glimmering gloryof a Nibelungen ideal was tested in reality.( The reference to Nibelungen is from Wagner's opera and Germanic mythology.Here it is a reference to a mythical royal family which was the supposed originof the some royal bloodlines or to the royals of that area.) The people werevery unhappy a few years later when the moment came for the Alliance to proveitself, and Italy broke away from the Triple Alliance leaving her two allies ontheir own. Italy then became an enemy herself! How the people ever believed fora moment such a miracle was possible---that Italy would fight on the same sidewith Austria---was absolutely incomprehensible to anyone not blinded bydiplomacy. But the situation in Austria was identical.The sole support for the alliance in Austria came from the Hapsburgs and theGermanAustrians. The Hapsburgs supported it because it was in their owninterests and they had no choice. The Germans supported in good faith and out ofpolitical stupidity. The good faith of the Triple Alliance came from the factthat they thought they were doing the German Empire a great service by helpingto strengthen and defend it. The political stupidity was because their beliefwas mistaken and they were actually helping to chain the Reich to a dead state.This was bound to drag both into a bottomless pit and most of all, this veryAlliance sacrificed them to the very efforts aimed at destroying German culture.The alliance gave the Hapsburgs reason to believe that the German Empire wouldnot interfere in their domestic affairs, which left them free to carry out theirdomestic policy of gradually eliminating the German element without risk.Not only were they shielded from any protest of the German government by thewell-known \"objectivity\", but by referring to the Alliance, they could alwayssilence the dirty mouth of Germans in Austria if it became too objectionable inits threats to stop some method being used to convert the area to a Slav region.After all, what could a German in Austria do when the German Reich itselfexpressed admiration and confidence for the Hapsburg regime? Was he to resistand be branded as a traitor to his own nationality throughout the Germanspeakingworld? He, who for decades had made the greatest sacrifices for his nationality?What value did the Alliance have once the German elements in the HapsburgMonarchy were exterminated? Was the value of the Triple Alliance for Germany notabsolutely dependent upon the preservation of German elements in Austria? Or didthey really think they could live in alliance with a Hapsburg Empire of Slavs?The official attitude of German diplomacy, as well as that of the general publictowards internal problems affecting the Austrian nationalities, was not merelystupid, it was insane. The Alliance destroyed any level of security and erasedthe possibility that a nation of seventy million could continue to exist, whileat the same time, they allowed their partner to continue his policy ofundermining the sole foundation of that Alliance.Eventually, all that will remain is a formal contract with Vienna diplomats. TheAlliance itself would be useless and Germany could never depend on the Alliesfor any form of support.Italy knew this from the beginning. If the people in Germany understood historyand national psychology a bit more clearly, they never would have believed thatthe Princes of Rome and the Vienna Hofburgs (the Hofburg is the Imperial Palaceof the Austrian Hapsburg Royal Family) would ever fight together. Italy herselfwould explode before the government would have dared send a single Italian tothe battlefield for the hated Hapsburg State, not unless the soldier was sent tofight against the Hapsburgs. More than once in Vienna, I saw absolute contemptand unending hatred flare up between the Italians and the Austrian State. Thesins of the House of Hapsburg against Italian freedom and independencestretching over centuries was too great to be forgotten. This kind of hatred rantoo deep, neither the people nor the Italian government wanted to forget.For Austria, there were only two options available when it came to facing Italy,either alliance or war. By choosing alliance, she was able to take her time inpreparing for the second. The German alliance was both senseless and dangerous,especially since Austria's relations with Russia came closer and closer to armedconflict. Here was a classic example of the total lack of deep or profoundthinking in foreign policy. Why did they decide on an alliance at all? Was itonly to assure a better future for Germany than she could manage with her ownresources? But the future of Germany depended on the preservation of the Germanpeople's existence. So, the question becomes, what position should the Germannation take in the face of this predictable future, and how can we guaranteesecurity for this development while living in the European balance of power?After carefully looking at the requirements for German statesmanship to besuccessful in foreign politics, we must come to the following conclusion: Theyearly increase in Germany's population is almost 100,000 people. The difficultyof feeding this army of new citizens is bound to grow from year to year and willeventually end in catastrophe unless we find a means in time to avoidstarvation.There were four ways to avoid this frightening development. 1. Using the French model---pregnancies could be aborted and thereforeoverpopulation avoided.It is totally true that in times of great trouble, bad climate conditions, or apoor crop yield, Nature herself takes steps to limit a population's increase incertain countries or races. She does it both wisely and with no mercy. She doesnothing to destroy actual reproduction, but prevents the survival of what isreproduced by exposing the new generation to such difficulties and deprivationsthat all the weaker and those that are less healthy are forced to die.Everything that Nature allows to survive faces the trials of existence athousand times over, which makes life difficult and only the well-equippedcontinue to reproduce. This allows the process of separating the good from thebad to start all over. By brutally and immediately eliminating the individualthat can't handle the storms of life, she keeps the race and species strong andeven pushes them to supreme achievement.Reducing the numbers creates stronger individuals and, in the end, improves thespecies. The result is different when man begins to limit his own number. He isnot carved from the granite of Nature but wants to be \"humane\". He believes heknows better than the cruel Queen of all wisdom. He limits reproduction itself,not the survival of the individual. He always sees himself as an individual andnever as the race. He believes this road is more humane and better justified.Unfortunately, the results are also reversed. Nature puts a severe test uponsurvival while allowing free reproduction, then chooses the best among a lot ofindividual creatures to remain alive and propagate their species. Man, on theother hand, restricts breeding, but takes frantic care that every creature thatis born will survive at any cost. This correction of divine purpose seems wiseand humane to him, and he is delighted to have outwitted Nature and proven herinadequacy. The Heavenly Father's pet ape hates to acknowledge the fact that theindividual's value is reduced when their numbers are restricted.The moment reproduction is restricted and the number of births reduced, we havea craving at any cost to \"save\" even the weakest and most sickly instead ofallowing the strongest and healthiest to survive naturally. These seeds of a newgeneration are bound to become more and more pitiful the longer this mockery ofNature and her will continues. If this policy continues, the nation willeventually terminate its own existence on this earth. Man may defy the eternallaws of Nature's procreation for a short time but vengeance will follow sooneror later. A stronger race will push aside the one which has grown weak. Thedivine will shatters all the absurd chains of this socalled humane considerationfor the individual and replaces it with the humanity of Nature. She has nohesitation and wipes out what is weak in order to give a rightful place to thestrong. Anyone who attempts to assure a people's existence by limiting birthrates is simply robbing the nation of its future.2. A second way to avoid a frightening future might be the one we constantlyhear recommended today: internal colonization. Those who suggest this idea meanwell, but they don't have a clue what they are talking about and this wouldultimately cause the greatest harm that could be imagined.Without a doubt, the yield of certain areas of soil can be increased. However,this is only possible within certain limits and cannot continue indefinitely.For a time the increase in the number of German people can be balanced byincreased crop production without the danger of starvation. But, ultimately, thedemands made on life will increase faster than the population. People'srequirements for food and clothing grow from year to year, and that cannot evenbe compared to the meager needs of our forefathers say a hundred years ago. Inother words, it is a mistake to believe that increases in productivity make anincrease in population possible. No, this is only true to a certain extent,since at least part of the increased crop production must go to satisfy theincreased needs of men. Even with great sacrifice on one hand and constantlyrunning industry on the other, the earth itself is bound to set a limit. All thediligence in the world can't squeeze any more out of it. Disaster still comes,even if it is somewhat delayed. For a while, starvation will only happenoccasionally, when crops fail or something of that sort occurs, but as thenumber of people increase, it will come more and more often until the only timeit doesn't happen is when bumper crops fill the grain storehouses. Finally, thetime comes when the pain can no longer be alleviated and starvation is constant.Now, Nature must come to the rescue again and decide who will live or else manresorts to artificial restriction to slow the population increase.Some may still believe that sooner or later this future must come over the worldand, as part of Nature, no one can escape it. At first glance, this isabsolutely true. Nevertheless, we must consider the following: Someday,balancing the crop production with the population growth will be impossible andwill force all mankind to stop expanding the human race.Either they will have to leave the decision to Nature or strike the necessarybalance by solving the problem themselves, but by a method better than thoseavailable today. This will be true for all people, while now, only those racesthat no longer have the strength and energy to assure themselves of the landthey need in this world are in trouble. At present, large areas of land stillexist in the world that are being unused and just waiting to be broken by thecultivator. It is also true, however, that Nature is not holding this land inreserve for the future of a particular nation or race. The land is for thepeople who have the strength to take it and the diligence to till it.Nature knows no political boundaries. She simply deposits life on this globe andwatches what happens. The boldest and most industrious of her children becomesher favorite and is made the Lord over Creation.If a group of people confines itself to internal colonization while other racesare grabbing greater areas, their options will be limited when the other racescan constantly increase in number. Someday this will happen and the smaller thepeople's living space, the sooner it will be. The best nations, which are theonly truly civilized races, decide in their pacifist blindness to make no effortto expand their land and are content with internal colonization while inferiornations succeed in taking large livable areas of the world. A smaller anddensely populated territory may be better from the cultural standpoint of theseless ruthless races, which are limited by land and restricted in theirpopulation's growth, but people of lower civilizations, which are simplemindedand cruel, would still be able to increase without limit because of all theirterritory. In other words, the world will someday be dominated by the culturallyinferior but more energetic part of humanity.Some day in the future, there will be two possible outcomes. Either the worldwill be governed according to the ideas of our modern democracy and the equalityof every decision will lie with the more numerous races, or the world will beruled by the natural laws of relative strength, and the people possessing brutalwill power will triumph over the nations that have denied themselves what theyneed to survive.There is no doubt that the world will someday be the scene of huge battles forthe existence of mankind. In the end, the craving for selfpreservation alonewill triumph. That stupid and cowardly group of humanity that thinks they knowmore than everyone else will find their humanitarianism melts like snow in theMarch sun when they face destruction. In eternal battle, mankind can findgreatness; in eternal peace, it will find destruction.For Germans, the slogan of \"internal colonization\" is damnation, if for no otherreason, it immediately confirms the belief that we have found a peacefulexistence that allows us to lead a gentle dreamlike life, by working for ourliving. If we ever took this idea seriously, it would mean the end of any effortto maintain our rightful place in the world. Let the average German becomeconvinced that his life and future can be guaranteed and it will extinguish anyeffort to protect German vital necessities. If the whole nation took thisattitude, we could regard any useful foreign policy as dead and buried alongwith the German people.It is not an accident that the Jew is the one who first plants such deadly ideasamong our people. He knows his wimps too well not to realize that they will bewilling victims of any swindler who tells them he can snap his fingers causingNature to jump to attention, and that he can alleviate the hard struggle forexistence while still allowing them to ascend to lordship over the planet byworking only when a pleasing chance presents itself, but mostly by it justhappening.I cannot emphasize enough that all German internal colonization must serveprimarily to correct social abuses by those who do not make good use of land,especially by withdrawing the land from public control which prevents its use,or to release it from the grasp of speculators who only buy it without using it;but, internal colonization can never adequately assure the future of the nationwithout acquiring new land. If we follow any other path, we will soon be at theend of our territory, as well as at the end of our strength.If we pursue internal colonization alone, we will soon reach a point beyondwhich the resources of our soil can no longer sustain us, and at the same time,we will reach a point beyond which our manpower cannot expand.The size of a people's home territory is an important factor in its outersecurity. The greater the space at a people's disposal, the greater theirnatural protection. The decision to use military force can be made more quickly,more easily, more effectively, and more completely against people who live insmall, restricted territories, but such force cannot be used so easily againstthe same people occupying a larger territory. The large size of a state'sterritory does offer a certain protection against off-handed attacks because anybattle would require a long and intense struggle. The risk involved in amalicious assault will seem too great unless there are extraordinary reasons forit. That is to say, the very size of a state allows its people to more easilypreserve its freedom and independence, but on the other hand, a small countryinvites an invader.The first two options for striking a balance between the rising population andthe fixed amount of land were opposed by socalled nationalist circles inGermany. The reasons for this attitude were different from those just given.When the idea was proposed, people were hostile to the idea of limiting birthsmostly because of their morals. They indignantly condemned internal colonizationbecause they felt it was an attack against the great land owners and saw this asthe beginning of a general attack against ownership of private property.Considering the way this second doctrine of salvation was supported, they wereprobably exactly right in their assumption. As far as the great masses wereconcerned, the defense was not very skillful and in no way reached the heart ofthe problem. Now there were only two ways remaining that could assure the risingpopulation would receive their fill of work and bread.1. Either new land could be acquired, purchased or taken, that would support theextra millions year by year and keep the nation self-sustaining, or 2. Industryand commerce could focus on producing goods for export and extract a living fromthe profits. In other words, use either a territorial or a colonial andcommercial expansion policy.These options were reviewed from various angles, discussed, argued, and opposeduntil finally, the option of internal colonization was definitely followed. Themore solid decision would have been one that was not properly considered, thethird, expansion. Additional new land for the overflowing population hascountless advantages, particularly if we look to the future and not just at thepresent.Preserving a healthy farming class as the cornerstone of the whole nation andcan never be over-valued. Many of our current troubles result from the unsoundrelationship between country and city people. Asolid nucleus of small andmedium-scale peasant-farmers has always been the best protection against thekinds of social issues we have today. This is the only solution which allows anation to obtain its daily bread through its own domestic economy. Industry andcommerce would withdraw from their unhealthy position of leadership and taketheir places in the general scheme of a nationally balanced consumption economy.They are no longer the basis of the nation's livelihood, but only an aid to it.By confining themselves to this balanced role between home production andconsumption in every field, they make everyone's livelihood more or lessindependent of foreign countries and help to assure the freedom of the state andthe independence of the nation, especially in time of stress.It has to be said that this territorial policy cannot be carried out in a placelike the African Cameroons, but almost without exception will have to take placein Europe. We coolly and calmly realize there is no way it can be the intentionof Heaven to give one group of people fifty times as much of the world's soil asanother group controls. We must not let political frontiers distract us from thefrontiers of Eternal-Justice. If this Earth really has room for everyone, weshould have under our feet the land we need to exist.No one will give up land willingly. But here, the law of selfpreservation comesinto play, and what is denied in peaceful friendship must be taken by force. Ifour forefathers had made their decisions using the same pacifist nonsense we seetoday, we would only possess a third of our existing territory.There would barely be any German people left to suffer in Europe. No, we owe ourexistence to the natural determination to fight for our own survival whichgained us the two Eastern boundaries of the Empire (the Ostmark areas borderingPoland). This inner strength has gained us a large state and territory for ourrace, which alone has allowed us to survive to the present day.There is another reason this is the correct solution. Many European states todayare like inverted pyramids. The territory of some European countries isridiculously small compared to their load of colonies and their level of foreigntrade, etc. We can correctly say that the apex is in Europe and the base is allover the world. In contrast, the American Union's base is still on its owncontinent and only the apex touches the rest of the earth. The enormous strengthof the American State comes from their size and the reverse is true for mostEuropean colonial powers which contributes to their weakness.England does not disprove this because in front of the British Empire, we have avast community linked by a common language and culture throughout the world.Because of its linguistic and cultural ties with the American Union, England'sposition cannot be compared with that of any other state in Europe.For Germany, the only territorial policy was acquiring new land in Europeitself. Colonies are useless for this purpose unless they are suitable forlarge-scale settlement by Europeans. In the nineteenth century, that sort ofcolonial territory could no longer be obtained by peaceful means. Any attempt ata colonial expansion outside of Europe would have required a large militaryeffort. It would have been more practical to undertake that military struggle inEurope and gather land there instead of spreading abroad.A decision of this magnitude requires absolute, single-minded devotion once itis made. There must be no halfhearted efforts or hesitation in attacking a taskwhich can only be achieved by using every last ounce of strength. The politicalleadership of the Empire must be devoted exclusively to this purpose. Everythingdone must be done to accomplish this task without distractions. The goal couldonly be achieved by force, and that knowledge should be taken to the battle withdetermination, peace, and calm.Any alliance with another country should have been considered and assessed basedon its usefulness from this standpoint alone. If European soil was theobjective, it could be acquired primarily at the expense of Russia. The newEmpire must once again march the road of the ancient Knights of the German Orderand use the sword to provide land for the German plow which can then provide ourdaily bread.For this kind of policy, there was only one ally in Europe---England. Only withEngland covering our rear could we have begun a new Germanic migration. Ourjustification would have been as strong as our forefathers. None of ourpacifists refuse to eat food from the East, and they ignore the fact that thefirst plowshare there was actually a sword! No sacrifice should have been toogreat to win England's friendship. We should have given up all thought ofcolonies and sea power and avoided competition with British industry if that iswhat was needed. Only absolute clearsightedness could bring success along withabandoning world trade, colonies, and a German navy.The State's power must be totally concentrated on the army. The result wouldhave been a temporary setback, but a great and mighty future.There was a time when we could have discussed this plan with England. Englandunderstood very well that Germany had a growing population with growing needs.Those needs would be filled either with England as an ally in Europe or byanother ally in the world. At the turn of the century, London itself tried toestablish a relationship with Germany. For the first time, people were upsetthinking we might have to pull England's chestnuts out of the fire. Thisattitude was unfortunate and caused them to act as if an alliance did notrequire mutual give-and-take! Such a deal could easily have been made withEngland. British diplomacy was at least smart enough to know that nothing can beexpected without something in return.If a wise German foreign policy had taken over Japan's role in 1904 ( in theRusso-Japan War, also called the Manchurian Campaign, where Japan was victoriousover Russia and gained large territories), we can hardly grasp the impact itwould have had for Germany.Things would never have reached the point of \"The First World War\". Thebloodshed in 1904 would have saved bloodshed in 1914 to 1918 by ten times. Andwhat a position Germany would hold in the world today! The alliance with Austriawould then have been nonsense. This dead state was only allied with Germany topreserve a continued peace, which could be cleverly used for the slow but sureextermination of German culture in the Monarchy.The alliance could never have been used to fight a war. If for no other reason,this alliance was impossible because there were no German national interests tobe upheld. How could we expect a state that did not have the strength anddetermination to put an end to the destruction of German culture on its ownfrontier to be a true ally in time of war? If Germany didn't have enoughnational common sense or ruthlessness to maintain control over the fate of tenmillion of its own race and protect them from the Hapsburg State, it could notbe expected to take on such a daring and future-focused plan. The attitude ofthe old German Empire toward the Austrian problem might have been seen as a testof its stamina where the destinies of the whole nation were at stake.In any case, they had no business watching idly while German culture waswhittled away year after year. The value of Austria's alliance depended totallyon the preservation of the German element in Austria, but they made no effort topreserve or protect our people. They feared falling into a struggle more thananything and were finally forced into the battle at the worst time. They hopedto flee Fate and were overtaken by it. They dreamed of preserving world peaceand ended up in a World War.Here is the main reason the expansion necessary for a German future was not evenconsidered. They knew that the acquisition of new territory could only beaccomplished by going East through Russia. They understood the battle that wouldbe necessary and they wanted peace at any price. The song of German foreignpolicy had long since changed from \"Preservation of the German nation by everymeans\" to \"Preservation of world peace by any means\". How \"well\" they succeeded,everyone knows. I will have more to say on that subject later.Then there was the fourth possibility: industry and world trade, sea power andcolonies. At the beginning, this development was easier and quicker to achieve.True colonization of territory, however, is a slow process and often takescenturies. Indeed the strength of colonies results from the fact that they takea long time to build and are not the result of a sudden burst of energy likeindustrial growth. Industrial growth bursts can be built within a few years.Unfortunately, the industrial result is not of great quality but is frail, morelike a soapbubble. It is much easier to build quickly than to follow throughwith the difficult task of settling a territory with farmers and establishingfarms. It is also true that the easy path is more quickly destroyed than theslow one.When Germany chose to maintain peace at any cost, she had to realize that thischoice would lead to battle someday. Only children could expect pleasant andmannerly behavior, and a constant emphasis on peaceful intentions would givethem their \"bananas\" in the \"peaceful competition of nations\".These people talked as if they were groveling diplomats hoping war would nevercome.No. If we took this road, someday England was bound to be our enemy. Ourinnocent assumptions fit nicely with pacifism, but it was silly to resent theday England would violently oppose what they saw as an attempted expansion.Obviously they would enforce their self interests. Of course, we would neverhave done such a thing; how could we protect our self-interests with pacifistsat the helm? A European territorial expansion policy could be carried onstrictly against Russia and in-league with England as our ally. On the otherhand, if we allied with Russia against England, then a colonial and world-tradepolicy would be possible against England and her colonies only with the supportof Russia. In that case, the most important conclusion must be drawn here: thatAustria must be sent packing at once.Considered from any angle, the alliance with Austria was sheer madness, even bythe turn of the century.Germany never dreamed of allying with Russia against England any more thansiding with England against Russia, because in either case, the result wouldhave been war. It was only to avoid war that the commercial and industrialpolicy was chosen in the first place. By using the \"peaceful economic conquestof the world\" policy, they thought they would break the neck of the old policyof force once and for all. There may have been some doubts about Germany'sconviction to this policy, particularly when England began to utterincomprehensible threats. We then responded by building a navy. However, thisnavy was not meant to attack and annihilate England, but to defend the \"worldpeace\" and the \"peaceful\" conquest of the world. The fleet was kept withinmodest limits, not just in the number and size of vessels, but in armament.These limits were set as proof that our intentions were merely to maintainpeace.The fine talk about \"peaceful economic conquest\" of the world was probably thegreatest nonsense ever included in a guiding principle of state policy.The nonsense was made even worse by the fact that people pointed to England asan example of how this type of conquest was possible. Our part in the teachingand concept of history was the reason for this error and is the most strikingproof of how many people \"learn\" history without even understanding it. Peopleshould have recognized England as the most crushing disproof of the theory. Nopeople have ever used the sword more brutally in the service of its economicconquests or more ruthlessly defended them afterward than the English. Is it notthe most characteristic feature of British diplomacy to obtain economic gainfrom political power and then to turn around and immediately transform everyeconomic advance into political strength? What a mistake to think that Englandwas too cowardly to back up its economic policy with its own blood! The factthat the English people lacked a \"national army\" was no proof. This is not aquestion of the form of their military, but of the will and determination toexert whatever force is needed. England always had the armament she needed. Shealways fought with the weapons that were necessary for success. She fought withmercenaries as long as mercenaries were enough. She dipped deep into the bestblood of the whole nation when such a sacrifice was essential to bring victory,but the determination for the struggle and the stubbornness and brutality withwhich it was conducted, always remained the same.The German schools, press, and comic books gradually created an image of theEnglishman and his Empire, which was bound to lead to fatal selfdeception.Everyone was gradually affected by this nonsense and the result was tounderestimate our enemy; for that we paid dearly. The misrepresentation was sooverwhelming that people firmly believed the Englishman was a business man whosesharp negotiation skill was equaled only by his incredible personal weakness.Unfortunately, it did not occur to our dignified teachers and dispensers ofwisdom that a world empire the size of England's could not be built by stealingand swindling. The few men who sounded a warning were ignored or met with aconspiracy of silence. I can still remember the astonishment on my comrades'faces when we clashed in person with the Tommies ( English soldiers) inFlanders. After the first few days of battle, it began to dawn on everyone thatthese Scotsmen were not the men they had been led to believe and were not likethe ones depicted in comic books and newspaper articles. That was when I firstbegan to understand some of the most useful forms of propaganda.These false representations had one advantage for its perpetrators. The examplecould be used to show that the economic conquest of the world was a sound idea.If the Englishman could do it, so could we. Our greater honesty and the lacktreachery, which was so English in itself, was considered a great advantage forus. People hoped to win sympathy from the smaller nations as well as theconfidence of the great ones.Because we took it all seriously, we never dreamed that our honesty was anoutrage to the rest of the world. They considered our behavior an extremelycunning form of dishonesty. It was not until our Revolution that they realizedour \"honest\" intentions were sincere to a point beyond stupidity which they nodoubt found astonishing.Only this rubbish of \"peaceful economic conquest\" of the world could make thefoolishness of the Triple Alliance clear and understandable. What other statecould Germany possibly become allies with? They could not obtain territory fromany state in Europe when allied with Austria. This was the inside weakness ofthe Alliance from the beginning. Bismarck could allow this as a temporarysolution, but that did not mean every inexperienced successor should do thesame, especially in an age when the basis of Bismarck's alliance had long agoceased to exist. Bismarck still believed in his time that Austria was a Germanstate. But, with the gradual introduction of the general right to vote, thecountry had sunk to a parliament controlled, un-German state of confusion.As a matter of race policy, the alliance with Austria was also disastrous. Thegrowth of a new strong Slavic power was tolerated right on the borders of theEmpire. They should have seen that the attitude of this power toward Germanywould sooner or later be very different from that of Russia. At the same time,the Alliance itself was bound to grow empty and weak from year to year becausethe sole supporters of the idea lost influence in the Monarchy and were crowdedout of the most influential positions.By the turn of the century, 1900, Germany's alliance with Austria had reachedthe same stage as Austria's alliance with Italy. We had to make a choice: Eitherside with the Austrian Hapsburg Monarchy or openly protest the oppression ofGerman culture in Austria. Once a decision of this sort is made, it usually endsin open battle.Even psychologically, the Triple Alliance had only a modest value since thestrength of an alliance declines as soon as it begins to limit itself topreserving an existing situation. On the contrary, an alliance increases instrength when it offers both parties the hope of territorial expansion. It istrue everywhere that strength is not in the defense, but in the attack.This was recognized in many places, but, unfortunately, not in the socalled\"competent\" circles of the elected officials. Colonel Ludendorff, Officer on theGreat General Staff at that time, pointed to these weaknesses in a paper writtenin 1912. Of course the other \"statesmen\" attached no value or importance to thesituation. Clear common sense is apparently only needed for ordinary mortals andit can always be dispensed with in the case of \"diplomats\".Germany was lucky that Austria was the cause of the war in 1914. This requiredthe Hapsburgs to participate. If war had come from the other direction, Germanywould have been alone. The Hapsburg State could never have taken part, or evenwanted to take part, in a struggle started by Germany. If Germany was the causeof war, Austria would have done what Italy was later so loudly condemned fordoing. It would have remained \"neutral\" in order to at least protect the Statefrom a revolution at the very start. The Austrian Slavs would rather have brokenup the Monarchy in 1914 than offer to help Germany.Very few people at that time realized how great the dangers were or the addedproblems that the alliance with the Monarchy brought with it. In the firstplace, Austria had too many enemies who hoped to inherit the decaying State.During that time, Germany was bound to be exposed to some hatred because Germanywas the obstruction to the dismemberment of the Monarchy which was almostuniversally desired. In the end, nations came to the conclusion that Viennacould only be reached by way of Berlin.In the second place, Germany lost its best and most promising chance of formingan alliance with another country. Instead, tensions increased with Russia andwith Italy. The general feelings in Rome toward Germany were favorable andequally hostile toward Austria, but tensions still built against Germanypolitically.Since the commercial and industrial expansion policy had been established, therewas no longer any reason for Germany to struggle with Russia. Only the enemiesof both Germany and Russia could have any real interest in a conflict betweenthem. In fact, it was chiefly Jews and Marxists who used every way they couldthink of to stir up war between the two states.Third and lastly, the Alliance concealed one huge threat to Germany. Any greatpower that was hostile to Bismarck's Empire could easily mobilize a whole stringof states against Germany by promising spoils at the expense of the Austrianally.All of Eastern Europe, especially Russia and Italy, could have been raised upagainst Austria and the Monarchy. The world coalition started by King Edwardwould never have happened if Germany's ally, Austria, had not been anirresistibly tempting prize. This promise was the only way to unite these statesthat otherwise had such varied desires and goals. In a general advance againstGermany, everyone could hope to benefit at the expense of Austria. The dangerwas actually even greater because Turkey also seemed to belong to this unluckyalliance as a silent partner.The forces behind International Jewish World Finance needed this bait in orderto carry out its long-cherished plan of destroying Germany. At this time Germanyhad not yet given in to general international control because of its finance andeconomic structure. It was the only way to forge a coalition which would bestrong and bold enough and would have the numbers of marching millions, whichcould battle with the armored skin of Siegfried at last. (A Wagner operareference where Siegfried bathes in the blood of a dragon, which forms scales onhim as protection, similar to Achilles. Here Siegfried is another name for theGermanic race. ) Even in Austria, I was completely unhappy with the HapsburgMonarchy alliance, and it was now the subject of a long, inward analysis whichended by confirming my earlier opinion even more strongly.In the humble circles in which I moved, I didn't hide my conviction that thisunhappy treaty was with a state marked for destruction, and it must lead to acatastrophic collapse of Germany too if we did not get out in time. My solidconviction never wavered, even when the storm of the First World War seemed tohave cut off all sensible thinking and the flood of enthusiasm had swept awaythose who could coldly look at reality with total objectivity.Whenever I heard these problems discussed, even while I was at the front, Imaintained my opinion that the alliance must be broken off, and the sooner thebetter for the German nation. It would be no sacrifice at all to deliver up theHapsburg Monarchy if Germany could limit the number of her adversaries.Millions strapped on the steel helmet to save the German nation, not to preservea wicked dynasty.Once or twice before the war, at least one camp would have some doubts about thesoundness of the alliance policy. From time to time, German-Conservative circlesbegan to warn about being too trusting. Their warnings were ignored along withall other common sense. People were convinced they were on the high road to aworld \"conquest\". All they could see was the enormous chance of success withoutany cost whatsoever. Once again, there was nothing for the average man to do butwatch in silence while the \"elected officials\" marched the country straight todamnation, with the good folk following after them like rats, following the PiedPiper of Hamelin. (The Pied Piper of Hamelin is the subject of a Middle Ageslegend where he led a great many children from the town of Hamelin, Germany totheir death after he was not paid for his services leading rats away from thetown.) The general state of our entire political thinking was the main reason itwas possible to make a group of people accept the nonsense of \"economicconquest\" as a political goal, and this same weak thinking caused them to acceptthe preservation of \"world peace\" as a political goal.With the victorious march of German industry and invention and the growingsuccesses of German trade, people could no longer see that the whole thing wasbased on the assumption that the state was strong. In many circles, people wentso far as to argue that the state itself owed its existence solely to theindustry, and that the state was primarily an economic institution which shouldbe governed based on economic interests. They thought its existence depended onthe economic life---a condition which was praised as the healthiest and mostnatural form of being.This is wrong. The state has nothing whatsoever to do with any particulareconomic concept or development. The state is not a union of economiccontracting parties within a definite limited area to perform economic tasks. Itis the organization of a community. A collection of physically and spirituallysimilar people who, together, make the preservation of their species possible,as well as the accomplishment of the goal which Providence has set for theirexistence. That and that alone is the purpose and meaning of a state.The economic system is one of the many methods needed to reach this goal. It cannever be the purpose of a state unless it is set up on an incorrect andunnatural basis from the beginning. That explains why a state should not assumeany territorial limitations as a requirement of its founding. Expansion isnecessary for people who want to assure their species continues with their ownresources and who are ready to fight in order to live from their own efforts.People who succeed in sneaking in among the rest of mankind likeloafers---letting the others work for them while making all kinds of excuses---can form states without any definite living boundaries of their own. This isespecially true of those people that the rest of honest humanity is sufferingfrom today, the bloodsucking Jews.The Jewish State has never been limited by space. Their one race has universallyunlimited territory. Therefore, these people have always formed a state withinthe state. It is one of the most brilliant tricks ever invented to have thisState sail under the colors of a \"religion\". The tolerance by the Aryan isassured because he is always ready to make allowances for a religious group. TheMosaic Law religion (commonly known as Halakha, which is the collective body ofJewish law) is nothing but a doctrine for the preservation of the Jewish race.This is why it includes almost every field of sociological, political, andeconomic knowledge that could possibly serve that purpose.The instinct for preservation of the species is the original reason for theformation of human communities. The state is a race oriented organization andnot an economic organization. As great as the difference is between them, it isstill totally incomprehensible to the \"statesmen\" of today. They think they canbuild up the state by purely economic means, but in reality, the state comesfrom the will of a species and race to survive. These qualities are alwaysheroic traits and never the ego of a businessman. After all, the survival of aspecies depends on its willingness to sacrifice the individual. The words of thepoet, \"And if you do not stake your lives, life shall never be your prize\"(quoted from the song Curassiers in Schiller's Wallenstein), signify that givingup personal existence is necessary to assure the survival of the species. Themost essential requirement for the formation and maintenance of a state is acommunity of similar character and a species who believe in that community, andare willing to back it up by whatever means are necessary.People protecting their own soil become heroes. With parasites, it is different.It leads to lying hypocrisy and malicious cruelty.The initial formation of a state can only take place by applying these heroicqualities. In the resulting struggle for selfpreservation, some people who lackthese qualities will fall victim to the parasites and become economic slaves whowill be defeated and eventually die. These are not heroes; they can't resist themethods of the hostile parasites. But even here, it is almost never a lack ofwisdom, but more a lack of courage and determination which tries to hide underthe cloak of humane principles.There is only the slightest connection between economics and statebuilding andstatepreserving. This is best demonstrated by the inner strength of a statewhich only rarely coincides with its economic success. We can also findcountless examples that show prosperity is a sign of approaching decline. If theformation of human communities were primarily for economic forces, strongeconomic development would mean the greatest strength of the state and not theother way around.Faith in the statebuilding or statepreserving power of economics is particularlyhard to understand when it holds influence in a country that clearlydemonstrates the opposite from its history. Prussia wonderfully proved thatideals and virtues alone make the creation of a state possible and not materialqualities. Only under their protection can economic life flourish. When theelements that were responsible for statebuilding collapse, the economicstructure also topples. This is a process we are now seeing in a sad way. Thematerial interests of mankind always flourish best when they are shadowed byheroic virtues, but when economics attempts to take center stage, they destroythe essential part of their own existence.Whenever a strong political power has existed in Germany, economic life hasalways progressed. Whenever the economic system has become the only substance ofour people's life, it smothered the virtues of idealism, and the state collapsedand carried the economic benefits with it into the ground.If we ask ourselves what forces preserve a state, we can lump them all in onecategory: the ability and willingness of an individual to sacrifice himself forthe whole. These virtues have nothing at all to do with economics. We can seethis from the simple fact that man never sacrifices himself for economics.People don't die for business, but for ideals. Nothing showed more clearly theEnglishman's superior ability to look into the psychology and into the soul ofhis people than the motivation he demonstrated in his struggle. While we werebattling for bread, England was fighting for \"freedom\" and it was freedom forthe little nations, not even for herself. We laughed and were annoyed by thisaudacity. We showed the same thoughtless stupidity the German statesmandemonstrated so well before the war. Men lost the slightest desire to die oftheir own free will. As long as the German people in 1914 still believed theywere fighting for ideals, the battle continued; when they were told to fight foreconomic survival, they gave up. When something finds itself fighting simply forthe production of daily bread, it prefers to give up.Our intelligent \"statesmen\" were astonished at this change in public sentiment.They never understood that from the moment a man begins to fight for an economicinterest, he avoids the death that would prevent him from ever enjoying therewards of his struggle. The most delicate mother becomes a heroine to save herown child.The battle for the preservation of the species and of the home or state thatshelters it is what always made men willing to go to war.We offer the following as an eternal truth: No state has ever been created byestablishing a peaceful economy. Only through the instincts that preserve thespecies, whether they are heroic virtue or shrewdness, have states been created.Heroic virtue produces true Aryan, working, civilized states while shrewdnessproduces Jewish parasite colonies. When instincts in a race or a state areoverrun by economics, the economic structure itself releases the causes thatlead to defeat and oppression.The belief before the First World War that Germany could open up or even conquerthe world through peaceful colonial means and commercial policy was a sign thatthe statebuilding and statepreserving virtues had been lost. Also lost was theinsight, strength of will, and determination needed to take decisive action. Thelaw of Nature brought the First World War and its results as revenge upon ourheads. Anyone who failed to look below the surface would only see an unsolvablepuzzle when considering this universal attitude of the German nation. After all,Germany herself was the most wonderful example of an empire created by power andmilitary valor. Prussia, the nucleus of the Empire, was created by brilliantcourage, not by financial operations or business deals. The Empire was missingthe magnificent reward of a leadership based on power politics and based on thecourage to risk death. How could the political instincts of the Germans becomeso diseased? This was not a one-time occurrence, but a matter of destructiveforces in frightening numbers that spread among the people and attacked thenation like a cancerous ulcer. It seemed as if a constant stream of poison wasbeing injected by some mysterious unseen power into the very blood vessels ofwhat had once been a hero's body. As this poison spread, it crippled commonsense and the simple instinct of selfpreservation.My attitude toward the German economic policy and Triple Alliance policy from1912 to 1914 forced me to review these questions over and over.Through the process of elimination I found the solution to the puzzle; it was apower which I had already come to know in Vienna from a different standpoint.The source of the problem was the Marxist doctrine and their resulting actionsthroughout the nation.For the second time in my life, I dug into this doctrine of destruction. Thistime I was guided by my observations of what was happening in the nation'spolitical life and not by the impressions and effect of my daily surroundings. Ibecame absorbed again in the theoretical literature of this new world and triedto understand its possible consequences. I compared these with the actual eventsand their effects in political, cultural, and economic life. For the first time,I also devoted my attention to those efforts made to stop this plague. I studiedthe purpose, struggle for, and effect of Bismarck's emergency legislation.(Bismarck passed laws in 1878 to curb Social Democrat and Marxist activities.)Gradually, I laid a rocksolid foundation for my own belief and I have never hadto revise my views on this issue. I also examined the connection between Marxismand Jewry more closely. While in Vienna, I had believed Germany was anunshakable Colossus, but now, uneasy doubts began to build in me. In my own mindand in the small circle of my acquaintances, I argued German foreign policy anddiscussed what I believed to be the incredibly negligent treatment of the mostimportant problem that then existed in Germany at that time, Marxism. I reallycould not understand how they could stagger so blindly towards a horrible dangerwhose aims were clearly and openly discussed by the leaders of Marxism. Among myacquaintances, then and now, I warned against the smooth talking, soothingslogan of all cowardly wretches who said, \"Nothing can happen to us!\" A similartroublesome attitude had destroyed one giant empire already. Did everyonebelieve Germany alone was going to be exempt from the laws that governed allother societies? In 1913 and 1914, I announced my conviction that the future ofall Germans depended on destroying Marxism. Some of the circles where I spokeare now faithfully part of the National Socialist movement today. In thedestructive German Triple Alliance policy, I saw the result of the Marxistdoctrine's destructive hand. The fearful teachings of this poison almostinvisibly destroyed every foundation of a healthy economic policy and everyhealthy state concept. This occurred in such a way that the victims' who werecontaminated did not even realize the acts and desires that resulted wereactually part of a WorldConcept which they were otherwise strongly against.The inner decline of the German people started long before they recognized thedestroyer of their existence was growing among them. Now and then, there wassome treatment of the disease, but the symptoms were too often confused with thecause. As people did not or would not look at the cause, the struggle againstMarxism was as effective as a long-winded quack's miracle cure.5. THE FIRST WORLD WARWhat depressed me more than anything when I was a wild youth was that I had beenborn into an age that honored only tradesmen or civil servants.The surge of large waves seen in history seemed to have calmed down so much thatthe future belonged only to the \"peaceful competition of people\" or to quiet,mutual swindling where any aggressive method of selfdefense had been abandoned.More and more, the individual nations began to resemble businesses that mutuallyundercut one another, stole customers and orders, and tried to outwit each otherin every way, while making protests as loud as they were harmless. Thisdevelopment not only seemed to progress, but it was generally hoped it wouldsomeday transform the world into one huge department store where the receptionarea would for all time display statues of the most skillful manipulators andmost harmless executives. The English could then furnish the businessmen, theGermans would furnish the administrative officials, and the Jews would have tosacrifice themselves as managers since they speak the most languages, and, bytheir own admission, they never make a profit, but \"keep paying\" forever.Why couldn't I have been born a hundred years sooner? Say at the time of theWars of Liberation (The Napoleonic War of the Sixth Coalition 1812-14 againstFrance) when a man had some value apart from the \"business\" which he operated.It often annoyed me when I thought that my life started too late. I believed theage of \"peace and good order\" in front of me was an undeserved cruel strike ofFate. Even as a boy, I was no \"pacifist\" and every attempt to push me in thatdirection was a failure.Then, the Boer War ( fought between Britain and two African Boer republics18891902) appeared like a bright light on my horizon. Every day, I anxiouslywaited the newspapers. I devoured news reports and letters. I was happy towitness this heroic struggle, even if it was from a distance. During theRusso-Japanese War (commonly called the Manchurian Campaign in 1904-1905 betweenRussia and Japan over Manchuria and Korean territories), I was more mature andmore observant. Here I took sides for more rational reasons and supported theJapanese in every discussion we had.I saw the defeat of the Russians as a defeat of the Austrian Slavs.Years had passed since then, and what I had thought was slow-moving weakness asa boy, I now believed to be the calm before the storm. Even in my Vienna days,the Balkans (the peninsula territories east of Italy) were burning under thefeeble heat that usually predicts the approach of a hurricane.Flashes of light were already beginning to flicker, only to be lost again in thestrange darkness. Then came the Balkan War (1912-13) and with it, the first puffof wind whipped across a nervous Europe. The approaching events weighed on menlike a nightmare---like feverish, brooding tropical heat---and it continueduntil the constant worry finally turned the feeling of approaching catastropheinto desire. Let Heaven give in to the destiny that could not be avoided. Then,the first mighty flash of lightning struck the earth. The storm broke and thethunder of the sky was mixed with the roar of the artillery in the First WorldWar.When news of the murder of Archduke Francis Ferdinand arrived in Munich, I wassitting at home and caught only bits and pieces of what happened.( The assassination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand sparked the First World Warwhen AustriaHungary declared war against Serbia.) At first I was afraid andworried that the bullets had come from the pistol of a German student. They wereangry at the Crown Prince over his constant work to convert the nation to a Slavregion, and they wanted to free the German people from this enemy within. It waseasy to imagine what the result would have been; a new wave of persecutionagainst German elements in Austria which would have been \"thoroughly justified\"by the whole world. But immediately afterward, I found myself dumbfounded at theway Fate played her game of mysterious revenge when I heard the names of thesuspected assassins. They were Serbians.The greatest friend to Slavs was brought down by fanatical Slav patriot'sbullet. Anyone who had watched the relationship between Austria and Serbia inprevious years could have no doubt that this act started boulders rolling thatcould never be stopped.It isn't fair to criticize the Vienna government today for the method and themeof the ultimatum it presented then. No other power in the world could have acteddifferently in a similar situation. On her Southeast border, Austria had anunyielding, deadly enemy that kept provoking the Monarchy more and more oftenand would have never stopped until their time came to shatter the Empire.There was good reason to fear this would happen with the death of the oldKaiser. By then, perhaps the Monarchy would not be in any position to offerserious resistance. In its last years, the whole State rested completely onFrancis Joseph and the broad masses felt that the death of this aged incarnationof the Empire meant the death of the Empire itself. More than that, it was oneof the sly tricks of Slavic policy that they were able to create the impressionthat the Austrian State owed its continued existence exclusively to theMonarch's marvelous and unique skill. This piece of flattery pleased theAustrian Hofburg Imperial Palace even more because the Emperor didn't deserveit. The sting hidden in this eulogy was not noticed. People either did not seeor did not want to see that the more the Monarchy depended on the \"outstandinggoverning skill\" as they called it, of this \"wisest Monarch\" of all times, themore catastrophic the situation was destined to be when Fate finally knocked atthe door to demand its due.Could old Austria even think without the old Kaiser? Would not the tragedy ofMaria Theresa be repeated? (Maria Theresa was an Archduchess of Austria and theonly ruler until 1765 when she recognized her son, Joseph II, as co-regent. Sheunified the Hapsburg Monarchy, but after the death of her husband withdrew andwas no longer active as a Monarch even though she had made many civil reformsearlier.) No, it is really unfair to Vienna government circles to blame them forstarting a war that otherwise might have been avoided. It could no longer havebeen avoided--- possibly postponed for one or two years--- but not avoided. Thecurse of German and Austrian diplomacy was that it had always tried to postponethe inevitable reckoning until it was finally forced to strike at the mostinopportune moment. We can be sure that another attempt at peace would only havebrought on the war at an even more unfavorable time.Anyone who did not want this war must have the courage to accept theconsequences of their past refusal. This consequence could have only been thesacrifice of Austria. The war would still have come, but probably not witheveryone against us. Instead, it would have meant the separation of the HapsburgMonarchy. It was necessary to decide whether to take part or simply to gawkemptyhanded while Destiny took its course. The very people who today curse theloudest and pass judgment about the starting of the war were the ones who tookthe most fatal part in leading us into it.For decades, the Social Democrats had been sneaky in their efforts to spark waragainst Russia. The German Centrist Party (a Catholic political party), on theother hand, had made the Austrian State the pivotal point of German policy forreligious reasons. Now, the results of this craziness were upon us. What camenext was inevitable and could no longer be avoided under any circumstances. TheGerman government's share of the guilt was that in its effort to preserve peace,it missed all the best moments to fight. It became wrapped up in the alliance topreserve world peace and finally became the victim of a world coalition, whichwas absolutely determined to oppose a World War and to preserve world peace atany cost. Even if the Vienna government had given an ultimatum in more palatableterms, it would not have changed the situation but, instead, it might havegenerated public outrage if the masses saw the ultimatum as too moderate andcertainly not extreme or excessive. Anyone who denies this today is either aforgetful blockhead or an intentional liar.The First World War of 1914 was not forced on the masses, but was demanded bythe people. They wanted to finally put an end to the lingering uncertainty. Onlyon that ground can we understand how more than two million German men followedthe flag into this supreme struggle, ready to protect it with their last drop ofblood.To me, those days seemed like deliverance from the anger of my youth. Even now,I am not ashamed to say that I fell on my knees overcome by a wave ofenthusiasm, and thanked Heaven from an overflowing heart that it had granted methe good fortune to live in this time.A battle for freedom had begun whose unparalleled greatness the earth had neverseen. Destiny had barely begun to take its course before the great massesstarted to realize that this time it was not just Serbia's or Austria's fate atstake, but the existence of the German people itself.After many years, the people could finally see the future. At the very outset ofthe monstrous struggle, the intoxicating, extravagant enthusiasm was quicklyreplaced by the necessary serious undertones. Only this realization made thenation's exaltation more than just a passing fad. This was necessary because themajority of the people did not have the slightest idea how long the battle wouldbe. They dreamed of soldiers being home again by winter so they could return totheir peaceful jobs."},{"pageContent":"What man wants, he also hopes for and believes in. The overwhelming majority ofthe nation was sick of the eternal uncertainty, so it was understandable that noone believed in a peaceful solution of the Austrian-Serbian conflict and insteadhoped for a final settlement. I was one of these millions.The news of the assassination had barely reached Munich when two ideas flashedthrough my mind. First, war was now unavoidable, but beyond this, the HapsburgState would now be compelled to stick to its alliance. What I had always fearedmost was the possibility that some day Germany itself might be involved in aconflict that was not caused by Austria. Then, for domestic, political reasons,the Austrian State would not have the resolution to back up its ally. Eventhough the alliance had already been made, the Slavic majority of the Empirewould have sabotaged it at once and would have preferred to shatter the wholeState rather than given help to their ally. This danger was now removed. The oldAustrian State had to fight whether it wanted to or not.My own attitude toward the conflict was perfectly clear and simple. What I sawwas not Austria fighting for some satisfaction against Serbia, but Germanyfighting for her all. The real battle was the German nation fighting for itsexistence or nonexistence, for its freedom and future. Bismarck's creation mustnow go out and fight. What its fathers had once conquered in battle with theirheroic blood---from Weissenburg to Sedan and Paris---young Germany had to nowearn back. If the battle was victorious, then our people would rejoin the circleof great nations once more. The German Empire could prove itself again as amighty stronghold of peace without having to put its children on short rationsfor the sake of maintaining peace.As a boy and young man, I had often wished I could demonstrate that mynationalistic enthusiasm was no empty obsession. It often seemed to me almost asin to cry out in joy with the crowd without having any real right to do so. Whocould rightfully shout hurray without having tried it, when all pettiness isover and the Goddess of Fate's cruel hand begins to test the strength ofeveryone's convictions? Like millions of others, my heart overflowed withhappiness now that I could be free of this paralyzing feeling. I had sung\"Deutschland über alles\" (\"Germany ahead of all\", the actual song title is \"TheSong of Germany\") and shouted, \"Heil\" so often at the top of my lungs. Now itseemed to me almost like Heavenly grace granted retroactive justice by allowingme to testify to the truth of my convictions and prove they were real. I knewfrom the first moment that in the face of an inevitable war, I would abandon mybooks immediately. I also knew that my place must be where the inner voice ofconscience sent me.I left Austria primarily for political reasons. Now that the struggle wasbeginning, it seemed natural that I should review my convictions. I would notfight for the Austrian Hapsburg State, but I was ready at any time to die for mypeople and for the German Empire they belonged to.On the third of August 1914, I presented a petition to His Majesty King LudwigIII, requesting permission to join a Bavarian regiment. During those days, theCabinet Chancellery had a lot to deal with, but I was overjoyed when I receivedan answer to my request the very next day. I opened the letter with tremblinghands and read that my petition was granted and I was instructed to enroll in aBavarian regiment. My gratitude and joy was unbelievable. In a few days, I waswearing the uniform that I would wear for the next six years.For me, and probably for every German, the greatest and most unforgettableperiod of my earthly life now began. Compared to the events of this incrediblestruggle, everything in my past paled as if it was nothing. Now, as the tenthanniversary of the great event approaches, I think back with melancholy prideabout those weeks at the beginning of the heroic struggle of our people, whereFate graciously allowed me to take part.It seems like just yesterday. Image after image goes through my mind. I seemyself uniformed and with my beloved comrades we are marching out for the firsttime, drilling until the day our departure finally came. I and many others wereworried whether or not we would arrive too late at the front. This often kept meawake at night. In the victorious delight we took when we heard about each newheroic deed, there was also some irritation since each new victory seemed toincrease the danger that we would arrive too late to play our part.At last, the day came when we left Munich to fall in and do our duty. I saw theRhine River for the first time as we were traveling beside its gentle waves onour way west to protect it. The Rhine---the German river of rivers---we were nowgoing to protect it from the greed of our old enemy. When the gentle rays of thedawn sun first beamed down on us through the delicate veil of morning mist fromthe Niederwald Monument (a statue that commemorates the founding of the GermanEmpire after the Franco-Prussian War), the old song \"Wacht Am Rhein\" (\"Guard onthe Rhine\") roared from the long transport train into the morning sky, and myheart was ready to burst in patriotic pride. Then came a cold, wet night inFlanders and we marched through it in silence. When day began to break throughthe mist, we were suddenly met with an iron greeting as it hissed over ourheads. With a sharp crack, it hurled the little pellets of shrapnel through ourranks, splashing up the wet soil. Before the little cloud was gone, the first\"hurray\" came from two hundred voices in response to this greeting by the Angelof Death. Then the crackling and thunder began; singing and howling, and withfeverish eyes, everyone marched forward, faster and faster. At last, acrossbeetfields and hedges, the battle began---the battle of man against man. From adistance, the sound of song reached our ears, coming closer and closer, andjumping from company to company. Just as Death began to busy himself in ourranks, the song reached us too, and we in turn passed it on: \"Deutschland,Deutschland über alles, über alles in der Welt!\" (\"Germany before all, Germanyahead of everything in the world\".) Four days later, we went back to camp. Weeven walked differently. Seventeenyear-old boys now looked like men. Maybe thevolunteers of the List Regiment (The Second Infantry Bavarian Regiment) had notreally learned to fight, but they did know how to die like old soldiers.That was the beginning. That's how it went on year after year, but horror hadreplaced the romance of battle. Enthusiasm gradually cooled down and the wildexcitement was smothered in deadly fear. For each man, the time came when he hadto struggle between the instinct of selfpreservation and the obligations ofduty. I was not exempt from this struggle. Whenever Death was close, a vaguesomething in me tried to revolt and tried to disguise itself as reason to theweak body, but it was still just that sly cowardice laying sneaky traps. A greattugging and warning would begin, and only the last remnant of conscience wouldget me through the day.But the harder this voice worked to caution me and the louder and morepiercingly it spoke to me, the stiffer my resistance became, until finally,after a long inner struggle, duty won. This struggle was decided for me by thewinter of 1915-1916. My will had finally become the absolute master. The firstfew days I ran to the fight laughing and gloating, but now, I was calm anddetermined. That was the frame of mind that would endure. Now, I could proceedto the final trial of Fate without nerves cracking or the mind failing. Theyoung volunteer had become an old soldier.This transformation had taken place throughout the army. They had come out ofthe perpetual battle older and stronger, and whatever could not stand up to thestorm was simply broken.Only now was it fair to judge this army. After two or three years of fightingone battle after another---always fighting a force greater in numbers andweaponry, starving and suffering hardships---then was the time to judge thevalue of that unique army.Thousands of years from now, no one will speak of heroism without mentioning theGerman Army in the First World War. Through the veil of history, the iron frontof gray steel helmets will appear, unswerving and unyielding, a monument ofimmortality. As long as there are Germans, they will remember that these weresons of their forefathers.When I was a soldier I did not want to talk politics. That was not the time forit. To this day, I am convinced that the last stable-boy was more valuable tothe Fatherland than the first \"parliamentarian\". I had never hated thesewindbags more than now as every quiet, truthful lad said what he had to saypoint blank in the face of the enemy, or else left the small talk at home andfocused on doing his duty in silence. Yes, at that time I hated all these\"politicians\", and if I had my say about it, a parliamentary pick-and-shovelbrigade would have been formed at once. There, they could have chattered betweenthemselves to their hearts' content without annoying or harming decent, honesthumanity.I wanted nothing to do with politics, but could not help adopting attitudestoward things that affected the whole nation, and especially to things thataffected us soldiers.There were two things which annoyed me at that time that I thought were harmfulto our interests. After the very first report of victory, a certain section ofthe press began slowly, and possibly unnoticed to some, to sprinkle a few dropsof bitterness into the general enthusiasm. This was done behind a false front ofbenevolence, good intentions, and concern. They did not believe in celebratingvictories \"too much\". They claimed they were afraid that such celebrations wereunworthy of a great nation and out of place. The bravery and heroism of theGerman soldier were to be taken for granted because they were accepted factswhich did not justify such jubilation. They said outbursts of joy should not beencouraged because foreign countries may view quiet and dignified rejoicing asmore attractive than unrestrained excitement. Finally, we Germans, should notforget that the war was not our creation and that we shouldn't be ashamed toadmit openly as men that we were ready at any time to do our share in thereconciliation of mankind. It was, therefore, not wise to tarnish the purity ofthe army's deeds by too much shouting. The rest of the world might notunderstand such behavior. They said nothing was more admired than the modestyand restraint with which a true hero calmly and silently forgot his deeds. Thatwas basically their warning to the people.Instead of bringing these fellows to the forefront and pulling them high on apole with a rope, so that the victorious enthusiasm of the nation should nolonger offend the sensibilities of these knights of the pen, people actuallybegan to follow their lead and issue warnings against the \"unsuitable\" characterof the victory celebrations.The politicians never realized that once the enthusiasm was stopped, it couldnot be revived when it was needed. It is a state of intoxication and must bemaintained as such. Without this sort of enthusiasm, how could the nation endurea struggle which would make enormous demands on their spiritual stamina? I knewthe nature of the broad masses well enough to realize that a \"showy\" display ofmoral superiority was no way to fan the flames needed to keep the iron hot. Ithought officials were crazy when they did not act to raise the boiling point,increase the heat of passion, but I surely didn't understand why the governmentwould push policy to restrain the little excitement that existed. The secondthing that annoyed me was the attitude that Marxism was acceptable. In my eyes,this just proved that people had no idea how dangerous this disease truly was.They seemed to sincerely believe that by no longer recognizing any politicalparty distinctions during the war, they had brought Marxism to reason andrestrained it.Marxism is not a matter of a political party, but of a doctrine which is boundto lead to the utter destruction of humanity. This was not widely understoodbecause that side of Marxist theory was not taught at our Jew-riddenuniversities. Too many people have been trained to think that if something isnot taught in their university then it is not important enough to pick up a bookand learn about it, which is silly, especially among the higher level governmentofficials and civil servants. This revolutionary trend passed over these\"intellectual-official-heads\" without them paying any attention to it, which isthe reason why state institutions usually drag behind private ones.Heaven knows the German proverb is truer of those intellectual-officials than ofanyone else: \"What the peasant doesn't know, will not bother him\".( The English idiom is \"What you don't know can't hurt you\", a variation of\"Ignorance is bliss\", \"If you do not know about a problem then you cannot makeyourself unhappy by worrying about it.\") The few exceptions just prove the rule.It was an unparalleled mistake to identify the German workman with Marxism inAugust of 1914. When the time came, the German workman chose to free himselffrom the grasp of this poisonous epidemic or he could never have taken part inthe struggle of the war. But people were stupid enough to think that, now,perhaps, Marxism had become \"nationalistic\". This was a stroke of \"genius\",which proves that for many long years, none of these official heads of the Statehad ever bothered to study the nature of the Marxist doctrine. If they had donetheir homework, such a crazy idea would have never survived.Marxism's ultimate goal is and always will be the destruction of all nonJewishnational states. It was horrified to see that in July of 1914, the Germanworking class, which it had previously trapped, was waking up and quicklyentering the service of the Fatherland. Within a few days, the whole smokescreen of this deceit, of this infamous fraud on the people, was blown away andsuddenly the Jewish leaders were alone and deserted. It was as if there wasn't atrace left of the nonsense and insanity which they had been pouring into themasses for sixty years. It was a bad moment for the deceivers of the Germanworking class people. But, the instant the leaders recognized the danger thatthreatened them, they dawned their tarn-caps and boldly pretended to take partin the national revival. (A tarn cap, or Tarnkappe, means a magical cap thatallows the wearer to take any form they wish. Siegfried uses one in Wagner'soperas and the reference is common in Germanic stories. Other stories give itthe power of invisibility and strength;, however, it is likely Hitler wasreferring to Wagner's version meaning the people put on the trappings and tookthe form of a nationalist as if by magic.) This would have been the time to takea stand against the whole fraudulent brotherhood of Jewish pests hiding amongthe people. Now was the time to give them a severe penance without the slightestconsideration for any protest or consequence that might have arisen as a result.In August of 1914, the Jewish chant of international solidarity was gone with asingle blow to the heads of the German working class. A few weeks later, thisnonsense was replaced by American shrapnel as it poured the blessings ofworker-solidarity over the helmets of the marching soldier's columns.Now that the German workman had returned to his own nationality, it should havebeen the duty of any responsible national government to unmercifully annihilatethe agitators who stood against it. If the best men were falling at the front,the pests assaulting national spirit could at least have been exterminated athome.But instead, His Majesty the Kaiser himself held out his hand to these oldcriminals offering these disloyal assassins of the nation mercy, protection, andan opportunity to collect themselves for their next strike. (The old criminalsrefers to Dr. Edouard Bernstein, a Socialist Democrat, and Albert Ballin,managing director of the Hamburg-America cruise ships and friends with WilhelmII.) The serpent could then go on working, more cautiously than before, but thismade him more dangerous. While honest people dreamed of peace and security, thelying criminals were organizing a revolution. I was more than dissatisfied withthe fact that officials had settled on a set of terrible half-measures to dealwith the problem, but I didn't even realize how horrible the result wouldeventually be.Then what should have been done next? The leaders of the whole movement shouldhave been put under lock and key immediately. They should have been put on trialand the nation freed from them. Every resource of military power should havebeen used to brutally exterminate this epidemic. The Marxist parties should havebeen dissolved and the Reichstag brought to reason at the point of a bayonet ifnecessary. Or better still, it should have been immediately abolished. Just asthe Republic dissolves parties today, they had even more reason to resort tothis means then. After all, the existence or destruction of an entire people wasat stake! This would certainly have raised another question: Can intellectualideas be destroyed by the sword at all? Can violence be used to combat a\"WorldConcept\"? I asked myself these questions more than once at that time.If we think through similar cases found in history, especially cases ofreligious matters, we arrive at this principle: After a certain point in theirdevelopment, concepts and ideas as well as movements of a spiritual nature,whether true or not, can never be broken by force. The only exception is whenforce is used to replace these ideas with a fresh, new idea, thought, orWorldConcept that burns even brighter and stronger than the one it replaces.The use of force alone without the driving power of a strong spiritual orintellectual concept can never destroy an idea or even slow how fast it spreads,not unless force is used for the complete extermination of every last supporterand the absolute destruction of all related traditions that may linger. Thisusually means the disappearance of this state from the realm of political powerfor a long time and sometimes, forever. The state can never stand beside othernations, nor will they allow it after such an exercise of power. Experienceshows that a blood sacrifice of this sort hits the nation in the best part ofthe people. Any persecution carried on without an intellectual or spiritualbasis appears morally unjustified and the people will react. This incites themost valuable part of a population to become champions of the ideas by adoptingthe beliefs of the unjustly persecuted movement. Many people do this simply outof a feeling of opposition toward the state's attempt to kill an idea by brutalviolence.The number of movement followers grows at the same rate that the persecutionincreases. A complete destruction of the new teaching can only be carried out bya tremendous and ever-increasing extermination until finally, the people orstate in question loses all the valuable blood it has. All the people of valueare gone. Retribution is then at hand. Such an internal purge may indeed takeplace, but the price is the loss of the nation's strength. This process willalways be useless from the beginning if the doctrines to be fought have gonebeyond a certain small circle.As with all growing movements, destruction is only possible when the movement isyoung. While resistance increases with the passing years, the movement will growand then yield to fresh and younger members who will sprout new groups in adifferent form and with slightly different motives.Almost all attempts to uproot a doctrine and its related organizations byviolence with no intellectual or spiritual basis are failures. Frequently infact, such efforts produce the opposite result from the one intended.When sheer force is used to combat the spread of a doctrine, then that forcemust be used systematically and persistently. Only regular and steadysuppression of a doctrine can possibly be successful. The moment there is anyhesitation and violence alternates with mercy, the doctrine being overcome willnot only recover, but it will gain new value from each following persecution.This happens because when pressure is eased, resentment at what has beensuffered brings new followers to the old doctrine, and existing supporters clingto it with greater defiance and deeper hatred than ever. In fact, after thedanger is gone, even those who renounced and betray their movement will try toreturn to their old beliefs. The only way to achieve success is through aconstant and regular use of violence. This persistence can only happen with adefinite intellectual and spiritual conviction backing it up. All violence notfounded on a solid spiritual or intellectual basis is indecisive and uncertain.It lacks the stability that can only live in a fanatically intense worldconcept. It flows from the energy and brutal determination of an individual.This dependence on the individual also makes it subject to changes of itsnature, personality, and strength as it changes hands.There is still another consideration. Any WorldConcept , whether religious orpolitical in nature---though it can be difficult to tell when one ends and theother begins---strives less for the negative destruction of hostile ideas thanto positively affirm its own ideas. Its battle must be more offense thandefense.This is an advantage because the movement knows its own goal. The aim is victoryfor its own idea. On the other hand, it is hard to decide when the negative aimof destroying a hostile doctrine can be considered accomplished and certain. Iffor no other reason, the WorldConcept 's attack should be better planned andalso more forceful than its defense. As in everything else, victory is decidedin the attack, not with the defense. A struggle by violence against anintellectual power is mere defense unless the battle is also upholding,proclaiming, and spreading a new intellectual teaching.To summarize, remember this: Every attempt to fight a WorldConcept by violencewill eventually fail unless the struggle is fighting for a new way of thinking.Only in a struggle between two WorldConcept s can the weapon of brute force beused persistently and ruthlessly to bring victory to the side it supports. Sofar, the attempts to combat Marxism had always failed for that reason.This was why even Bismarck's anti-Socialist legislation fell short and wasdestined to fail. There was no new platform, no new WorldConcept that the battlecould have been fought for. Only the proverbial wisdom of high ministerialofficers could have managed to believe that socalled \"governmental authority\" or\"peace and good order\" or the intellectual driving force was a suitable basisbehind a lifeand-death battle.Because there was no real intellectual concept backing up the legislation,Bismarck handed over the development of his anti-Socialist plan to the judgmentand \"good will\" of the very institution that was born of the Marxist way ofthinking. When the Iron Chancellor left his war on Marxism to the \"good will\" ofSocial Democrats (Marxists), he was asking the goat to watch the garden. Thiswas the inevitable result since there was no new authoritative, fundamentalWorldConcept , that could drive a strong conquering will into champions whowould rebuild this new cause where Marxism was and drive it out. The only resultof Bismarck's struggle was a severe disappointment.Were conditions at the beginning of the First World War in any way different?Unfortunately, no, they were not. The more I thought about the necessary changein the attitude of the government toward Social Democracy as the temporarypersonification of Marxism, the more I recognized there was no workablesubstitute for this doctrine. What could they have offered the masses if SocialDemocracy had failed? Not one movement existed that could successfully draw thegreat crowds of workers under its influence once their leaders were gone. It issilly and more than stupid to presume that the international fanatic, havingleft his working-class political party, will suddenly join a privilegedclassparty or any new class organization at all. As disagreeable as it may be tovarious organizations, there is no denying the fact that privilegedclasspoliticians believe separation of classes is important as long as it does notresult in a political disadvantage. Denying this fact proves the audacity andstupidity of these liars.In general, we must avoid thinking that the masses are more stupid than theyactually are. In political matters, decisions are based more on feeling thanunderstanding. The belief that this feeling on the part of the masses somehowproves stupidity towards international matters can be immediately disproved bysimply pointing out that a pacifist democracy is equally insane because itssupporters are almost exclusively from the intellectual privilegedclasses.When millions of citizens continue to reverently worship their Jewish democraticpress every morning, it looks bad for the upper class to make fun of thestupidity of the common \"comrade\" who, in the end, is swallowing the same dirt,just presented differently. The manufacturer is one and the same in both cases,the Jew.We must be careful not to deny things whose existence is obviously a fact. It isan undeniable fact that class questions have nothing to do with ideals, thoughthat tripe is commonly served up at election time. The class arrogance of manyupper class people and the low regard of the manual laborer is not in theimagination of a lunatic, but a well-known fact. Apart from this, it shows thesmall thinking-power of our socalled intellectual elite when they assume thatcircumstances that failed to prevent the rise of Marxism can now somehow find away to recover what has been lost to it.The privilegedclass parties can never bring the lower class masses into theircamp. These are two worlds that are divided in nature and artificially. When they stand together, there will be battle, but no matter what, the youngerone, Marxism, will be victorious.A war on Marxist Social Democracy in 1914 would have been conceivable. It is,however, questionable how long that fight could have been maintained consideringthe lack of any practical substitute. I believed this long before the war andthat is why I could never make up my mind to join one of the existing parties.During the First World War, my opinion was strengthened more by the obviousimpossibility of declaring a brutal war on Social Democracy. There was nomovement available that was anything more than a \"parliamentary\" party.I openly expressed my beliefs to my close army friends quite often. That is whenit first occurred to me that I might someday enter politics. This was why Ioften assured my circle of friends that after the War, I would become a speakerin addition to my profession. I believe I was very sincere about it.6. WAR PROPAGANDAPursuing all political events with interest like I did made me very interestedin propaganda. In it, I saw a tool that the Socialist-Marxist organizationunderstood well and used with masterful skill. I realized early that the properuse of propaganda is a true art and one that remained practically unknown to theprivilegedclass parties.Only the Christian-Socialist movement achieved a certain skill with this tooland its success was owed to Lueger's contributions in his day. Not until the warwas there a chance to see the enormous results that focused propaganda canproduce. Here again, unfortunately, the other side was the sole subject of studybecause our side's understanding and use of propaganda was insignificant. Thisnegligence was obvious to every German soldier. It was an absolute failure ofthe entire German information system. This now led me to investigate morethoroughly the use of propaganda.Often there was more than enough time for consideration and reflection, but,unfortunately, it was the enemy who gave us this great practical lessons.What we failed to do, our adversaries did with extraordinary skill andcalculation amounting to genius. Even I learned an infinite amount from theenemy's war propaganda. But of course, time passed without a trace ofunderstanding raining on the politicians' heads. Some of them thought they weretoo clever to take lessons from the enemy, and the rest were unwilling to learn.Did we have any propaganda at all? Unfortunately, no. Everything that was triedin this area was so inadequate or wrong from the start that, at best, it did nogood and was often actually harmful. After a careful review of German warpropaganda, it was inadequate in form, and it was psychologically wrong infundamentals. Anyone could see this was true, even with a cursory inspection.Officials were not even clear in their own minds about whether propaganda is ameans or an end.It is without question a means and has to be judged based on how it accomplishesthe ends. Its form has to be adapted to accomplish the desired result. It isalso obvious that the importance of the end may vary. The ends may even strayfrom the general needs of the public. The propaganda must also adjust to matchthe value of the ends desired. The end that we struggled for during the war wasthe most glorious and tremendous that a man could imagine: the freedom andindependence of our people, security of income for the future, and the nation'shonor which is something that does exist despite those with contrary opinions.It must exist because people without honor lose their freedom and independencesooner or later. This, in turn, agrees with a higher justice because generationsof scoundrels without honor deserve no freedom. No one who is willing to be acowardly slave can or should possess any honor because that kind of honor wouldquickly become an object of universal hatred.The German people were fighting for their very existence, and the purpose ofpropaganda in the war should have been its goal to back up the fight andvictory.When people are fighting for their existence on this planet and are faced withthe fatal question, \"to be or not to be\", all considerations of humaneness orappearances crumble into nothing. These concepts are not floating in the air,but are born in man's imagination where they will cease to exist when he ceasesto exist. Man's departure from this world dissolves those concepts into nothingbecause Nature does not know them. They are limited to the men in a handful ofcountries or rather a few races, and their value is only to the degree theyunfold from these men's feelings. Humaneness and showyidealism for the sake ofappearances would disappear from the inhabited world if the races that createdand upheld these concepts were lost.In a peoples' struggle for its existence in the world, these concepts are ofonly minor importance. They are not important in determining the form of thestruggle. If the time comes when they might cripple the drive forselfpreservation in a struggling people, they must be discarded.As far as the question of humaneness is concerned, even Moltke ( known as Moltkethe Elder, Helmuth Karl Bernhard von Moltke was a Prussian soldier, Chief ofGeneral Staff in 1858 and responsible for the French defeat in 1870) pointed outthat in war it is essential to make a decision as quickly as possible, and thatthe most ruthless methods of fighting are at the same time the most humane.If anyone should try to improve us with nonsense about putting on airs of moralsuperiority for appearance's sake or showyidealism because it is what they thinkother people believe we should do, there can only be one answer: Any question ofdestiny that is as important as a people's struggle to survive immediatelydisposes of any duty to demonstrate \"proper\" appearances or to be concerned inany way with how we appear to outsiders. The least beautiful thing that canexist in human life is the yoke of slavery. Or do these touchy-feely people findthe present lot of the German nation only an appearance to be viewed by others?We have no need to discuss the matter with the Jews. They are the inventors ofthis perfume of civilization which makes people more concerned with appearancesthan with survival. Their whole existence is a denial of the beauty of God'screation.Since these ideas of what is humane and showy-morality for the benefit of othershave no place in warfare, they are not to be used as standards for warpropaganda.Propaganda in the war was a means to an end. The end was the German people'ssuccessful struggle for existence. Therefore, the propaganda should have onlybeen considered based on how it achieved that goal. The cruelest weapons werehumane if they brought quicker victory, and the only showy-morality to be usedwas that which helped assure the dignity of freedom for the nation. This was theonly attitude possible when facing the question of war propaganda in such alifeand-death struggle.If the socalled competent authorities had understood this, the form and use ofpropaganda as a weapon would never have been a matter of confusion. Propagandais merely another weapon, a very frightening one, in the hands of an expert.The second question of absolutely central importance was this: Where shouldpropaganda be directed? At the educated intellectuals or at the lesseducatedmasses? It must be aimed continuously at the masses alone! For the intellects,or those today who think they are intellectuals, we do not offer propaganda, butscientific teaching. Judging by its substance, propaganda is no more sciencethan an advertising poster drawing is art. The art of the poster is in thedesigner's ability to attract the attention of the crowd with form and color. Aposter advertising an art exhibition only has to draw attention to the art inthe exhibition. The better it succeeds, the greater is the art of the posteritself. In addition, the poster should show the masses the importance of theexhibition, but it should never be a substitute for the art there on display.Anyone who wants to involve himself with actual art must study more than justthe poster. In fact, for him, a simple walk through the exhibition is notenough. Only after a detailed study of the exhibits can he be expected to give athoughtful examination to the individual works, and then slowly form a soundopinion.The situation is the same today with what we call propaganda. Propaganda'spurpose is not scientific training of the individual, not to give details or toact as a course of instruction, but directing the masses' attention toparticular facts, occurrences, and necessities. The importance of these factscan only be brought in their view by the means of propaganda.The art of propaganda consists in putting a matter so clearly and forciblybefore the minds of the people that it creates a strong conviction in everyone.It is essential to success that propaganda reinforces the reality of the factsthat are promoted, the necessity of what is being promoted, and the just orrightness of its character.This art is not an end in itself. Its purpose must be identical to theadvertisement poster---to attract the attention of the masses and not todistribute instructions to those who already have an educated opinion on thingsor who prefer to form their opinions based on objective study. That is not thepurpose of propaganda. It must appeal to the feelings of the public rather thanto their reasoning ability.All propaganda must appeal to the common people in tone and in form and mustkeep its intellectual level to the capacity of the least intelligent person atwhom it is directed. In other words, the intellectual level must be lowered asthe mass of people it is intended to reach grows. If it is necessary to reach alot of people, as in the case of national propaganda for the continuation of awar, you can never be too careful about controlling the intellectual level ofthe propaganda.The less science is involved and the more emotions are involved, the morecomplete the success will be. Success is the best proof of the effectiveness ofpropaganda, and not the fact that it satisfies a few scholars or\"image-conscious, sickly apes\" who are concerned more with appearances andfeelings.Understanding the emotional patterns of the great masses and using properpsychology to get their attention and touch their hearts is the true art ofpropaganda. The fact that those who supposedly have their intellect and witsenhanced by education fail to understand this proves their mental laziness ortheir conceit.Once we understand the importance of targeting the art of propaganda advertisingto the broad masses, we have the following consequence: It is a mistake to tryto create propaganda in the same way you would create a document for scientificinstruction. The great masses'capacity to absorb information is very limited;they have little understanding and they are very forgetful. For these reasons,any effective propaganda must be confined to a very few points, and these mustbe expressed in simple stereotyped formulas. They must be used repeatedly untilthe very last man cannot help but know the meaning instantly. The moment weforget this principle, and try to vary the approach, try to be general orabstract, we minimize the effect. The crowd cannot understand what is beingoffered. Therefore, the greater the scope of the message, the more necessary itis for the propaganda to follow a simple plan of action, which is also the mosteffective and targeted psychologically.For instance, it was a fundamental error to make the enemy look ridiculous aswas done in Austrian and German comic book propaganda. It was a fundamentalerror because when soldiers came face to face with the enemy, he saw somethingdifferent. The result was terrible because now under the direct pressure of hisenemy's resistance, the German soldier felt like he had been deceived by theones who were supposed to have enlightened him.Instead of his war spirit or his commitment being strengthened, the oppositehappened. The soldier lost his will to fight.The war propaganda of the British and Americans, on the other hand, waspsychologically on target. By portraying the Germans to their people as brutaland destructive barbarians, they prepared the individual soldier for the horrorsof war and helped protect him from illusions. Even the most terrible weaponsused against him only confirmed what he had already learned. This strengthenedhis belief in the truthfulness of his own government and stirred up his angerand hatred against the evil enemy. The effect of the enemy weapons, which he nowdiscovered through firsthand experience, gradually proved the barbaric andalready familiar brutality of the \"Huns\" was real. He was never led to believethat his own weapons might be more dreaded.Consequently, the English soldier never felt he was being lied to at home.This was not the case with the German soldier. Eventually, German soldiersrefused any information from home because they saw it as deceitful and a fraud.This happened because officials thought they could assign any convenient jackassto propaganda duty. They failed to understand that propaganda demands the mostskilled minds that can be found. German war propaganda was a unique researchproject whose desired effects were reversed because of a complete lack of anyunderstanding of psychology.The enemy, however, had a tremendous lesson to teach anyone who was willing toopen their eyes and learn. There was plenty of opportunity when we sat through afour-and-a-half year tidal wave of enemy propaganda.What the people never understood was the first requirement for any propagandaactivity: an intentionally biased and one-sided attitude toward every questiondiscussed. The failure in this area, from the very beginning of the war, andfrom the top down, was so bad that it made me question whether this much failurecould all be credited to pure stupidity. For instance, what would people sayabout a poster which advertised a new brand of soap, but which at lengthdescribed the good qualities of other soap brands? The viewer would simply shaketheir heads in disbelief.The same is true of political advertising. It is the responsibility ofpropaganda to emphasize exclusively the one cause it represents and not toevaluate other causes. It must not objectively explore any truth that favors theother side or fairly weigh the options, and then present the masses with astrict doctrine. It must not argue matters based on theoretical rules ofjustice. Propaganda must constantly endeavor to present only the aspect of thetruth that is favorable to its own side.It was a fundamental error to discuss who was responsible for starting the FirstWorld War and then declare that Germany was not totally responsible. The right way would have been to pile the guilt totally on the enemy, even ifthis wasn't true, but in this case, it was.What was the result of this half-and-half propaganda? The great masses of peopleare not made up of diplomats, professors of law, or even people capable ofmaking a judgment based on reason and logic. They are human beings---indecisiveand subject to doubt and uncertainty. The moment our own propaganda admits eventhe faintest glimmer of justice is due to the other side, the seeds of doubthave been planted and they will begin to question whether our own side is just.The masses cannot tell where the enemy's wrongs end and their own begin. Inthese cases, they become uncertain and suspicious. This is especially true whenthe enemy does not commit the same foolishness, but puts the guilt, lock, stockand barrel, on his adversary.It was natural for our own people to believe the more intense and focusedhostile propaganda of our enemy instead of their own people's words. This iseasily seen in those who have a mania that craves objectivity, like the Germans!Everyone preferred to be fair to the enemy rather than to risk injustice.Even willing to destroy his own people and State in the process.The masses never realized that this outcome was not the leaders' intention butit was their failure to understand which was the cause. The overwhelmingmajority of the people tend to be so feminine in their leanings and beliefs thatemotion and feelings rather than serious logical reasoning determine thought andaction. This feeling is not complicated. It is simple and firm. There is no grayarea. There are not many different shadings, but a positive or a negative, loveor hate, right or wrong, truth or lie, but never half-and-half, never part ofone and part of the other.These are all things English propaganda did in an excellent manner. They neverallowed two sided arguments which might have raised doubts. They realized thebroad masses' emotional state was primitive. They proved this by publishinghorror story propaganda that met the masses on their level.They ruthlessly and brilliantly reinforced their moral position, whichstrengthened endurance at the front despite great defeats. They were equallyvivid in their \"festival\" nailing-down of the German foe, portraying him as thesole guilty party for the outbreak of the War. This was a lie, which because ofthe complete and one-sided colossal boldness of its presentation, appealed tothe emotional and extreme attitude of the common people, and therefore it wastotally believed.The effectiveness of this sort of propaganda was most noticeably shown by thefact that after four years, it was still holding the enemy to his guns and hadstarted to eat away at our own people.It was really no surprise that our propaganda was unsuccessful. It carried theseed of ineffectiveness in its deep ambiguity. Its content alone made it highlyunlikely that it would create the impression on the masses that was necessaryfor success. Only our irresponsible \"statesmen\" could have hoped to generateenthusiasm in men to the point of dying for their country with this stale,watered down pacifist tea.This sorry product was not just useless, but harmful. All the brilliantpresentations in the world will not lead to the success of propaganda unless onefundamental principle is always kept clearly in view. Propaganda must limititself to saying a very little, but saying it a lot. First and foremost, that isthe absolute important prerequisite for success. In the field of propaganda, wemust never be guided by the beauty of propaganda itself because the expressionand form of what was said would soon only attract literary teaparties ofintellectuals instead of being suited to the masses. Neither must it be guidedin a carefree manner because the lack of emotional freshness makes it weak andpeople are constantly seeking new stimulants. Intellectuals quickly become boredwith everything. They cannot imagine themselves in the same place as theirfellow man or even understand his needs. These intellectuals are always thefirst to criticize propaganda's content, which they think is too old-fashioned,too stale, and too worn out. They are always looking for something new, seekingvariety and are the death of any effective political mass recruiting. As soon asparty propaganda is organized and its substance focuses on the intellectuals'needs, they lose their unity and become scattered.The purpose of propaganda is not to be a constant source of interestingdiversion for unconcerned, smart gentlemen, but to convince the masses. Themasses are slow-moving, and it may take a long time before they are ready toeven notice something. Only constant repetitions of the simplest ideas willfinally stick in their minds.Any variations in the propaganda message must never change the purpose of thepropaganda, but should always reinforce the same conclusion. The main sloganmust be highlighted from various angles, stated in different ways, but everydiscussion must end with the conclusion itself. Only then can and willpropaganda produce a unified and concentrated effect.Only this broad approach, through steady and consistent use, will ever pave theway to final success, and this steadfast course must never be abandoned. It isastonishing to discover the enormous results which such perseverance canaccomplish.The success of any advertising, whether in business or politics, depends onperseverance and consistency. The enemy war propaganda was a perfect modelbecause it was restricted to a few points, targeted exclusively at the masses,and continued with tireless perseverance. When those basic ideas and methods ofpresentation were seen to be solid, they were used throughout propaganda seemedidiotic the war without even the slightest change. At first, the in its use ofdisrespectful statements. Later, it becameunpleasant, then it was finally believed.After four and a half years, a revolution whose slogan originated in enemy warpropaganda broke out in Germany. The English understood that the success of thisweapon lies in extensive usage, and once it is successful, it more than pays forthe cost.The English saw propaganda as a primary weapon, while with us, it was the lastresort of employment for jobless politicians and a comfy job for those whoavoided the role of herosoldier. All in all, its success was zero.7. THE REVOLUTIONEnemy propaganda first came to us in 1915. From 1916 on, it became more and moreintensive and swelled until the beginning of 1918 when it grew into an absoluteflood. The effects of \"dangling the bait\" were seen at every step. The armygradually learned to think the way the enemy wanted it to.The German counter-efforts were a complete failure. The socalled \"leader\" whoguided the army had those around him who possessed the drive and desire to takeup the struggle of counter-propaganda, but the necessary tools were not thereand they had no means to distribute anything even if they had produced it. Itwould have been a mistake psychologically for the army to give thisenlightenment to the troops. If it was to be effective, it had to come fromhome. Otherwise, it was impossible to count on it being successful among men whohad suffered starvation and whose immortal deeds of heroism and endurance hadbeen performed for that very homeland for nearly four years.But what did come from home? Was the failure a result of stupidity or evil? Inmidsummer of 1918, after the retreat from the southern bank of the Marne (ariver in northern France), the German press started to demonstrate not onlyincompetence, but criminal stupidity. I asked myself with daily and increasingdisappointment if no one at home was going to put an end to this intellectualsabotage of the army's heroism.What happened in France when we swept into the country in 1914 in anunparalleled whirlwind of victory after victory? What did Italy do while herIsonzo front (along the Isonzo river in eastern Italy) was collapsing? What didFrance do in the spring of 1918 when the assaults of the German divisions seemedto be unhinging the French positions, and the longreaching arm of the Germanheavy artillery was pounding on the gates of Paris? They raised the boilingpoint of national passion, and stoked the fire of weakening courage and hurledit in the faces of the retreating regiments! How wonderfully their propagandaskills inspired and influenced the masses as they labored to pound into thehearts of the broken front soldiers a belief in the final victory, now more thanever! And what was happening on our side? Nothing! I was often overcome withoutrage and fury when I received the latest newspapers and saw the psychologicalmass murder they were committing. More than once, I was tortured by the thoughtthat if Providence had put me in place of these criminal incompetents anddonothings in our propaganda service, the War would have ended in a differentfashion.During those months, for the first time, I felt the full force of cruel Fate,who was holding me at the front in a spot where any negro could by chance pointhis rifle in the wrong direction and shoot me down; while if I had been inanother place, I could have performed a very different service for theFatherland.Even then, I was presumptuous enough to believe I would have succeeded. But Iwas a nameless one among eight-million, so it was better to stay quiet and do myduty as well as possible where I was.In the summer of 1916, the first enemy leaflets fell into our hands. With onlyminor variations, their substance was almost invariably the same: \"Distress InGermany Was Growing Ever Greater\"; \"The War Would Last Forever, While The ChanceOf Winning It Was Vanishing\"; \"People At Home Were Longing For Peace, But'Militarism' And The 'Kaiser' Would Not Consider Peaceful Solutions\"; \"The WholeWorld Was Making War On The One Guilty Foe Called The Kaiser And Not On TheGerman People\"; \"The Struggle Would Not Come To An End Until This Enemy OfPeaceable Mankind Was Eliminated\"; \"After The War Ended, The Peaceful AndDemocratic Nations Would Receive The German People Into The League OfEternal-World- Peace, A Peace That Was Guaranteed To Spring Forth The Moment'Prussian-Militarism' was destroyed\".To illustrate these claims, they included \"Letters From Home\" which appeared toconfirm these statements. At that time, everybody just laughed at theseattempts. The leaflets were read and then sent to the rear for the commanders toinspect, then they were forgotten until the wind blew another load down into thetrenches. They even sent special airplanes just to drop the leaflets.There was one striking element in this kind of propaganda. In every sector wherethere were Bavarians, an attack on Prussia was pushed with extraordinarypersistence. It said that Prussia was solely responsible for the whole War, andthere was not the slightest hostility against Bavaria, but they could not cometo the assistance of Bavaria as long as it served Prussian interests and keptpulling Prussia's chestnuts out of the fire.This technique actually began to have a certain effect as early as 1915. Badfeelings against Prussia noticeably increased among the troops without producingthe slightest countermeasures from our leadership. This was more than a mere sinof omission. Sooner or later there were bound to be serious repercussions, andnot for the \"Prussians\", but for the German people of which Bavaria is aconsiderable part.Enemy propaganda began to have definite success in this area by 1916. The realletters from home were filled with complaints which had also started to takeeffect. It was no longer necessary for the enemy to drop leaflets into ourtrenches; the letters were delivered by post. The \"government-in-charge\" didnothing except issue a few foolish warnings while the front was constantlyflooded with this poison sent from home by thoughtless women. They never dreamedthat this would strengthen the enemy's confidence and increase the sufferings oftheir loved ones at the front lines. The silly letters from German womeneventually cost hundreds of thousands of men their lives.Even by 1916, several alarming signs became apparent. The men at the front werecursing and complaining---they were discontented and justifiably resentful inmany respects. While they were starving and suffering and their families at homewere in misery, they could still see places where there was abundance andfestive living. Even at the front itself, everything wasn't as it should havebeen in this respect. There were faint warnings of crisis, but these were allstill internal matters. The same man who growled and cursed would silently dohis duty a few minutes later as if it were habit. The same company that wasfeeling discontented would dig into the section of trenches it had to defend, asif Germany's Fate depended upon this hundred yards of mud and shell-holes. Thisfront line was still formed by the old, magnificent \"Army of Heroes!\" I wouldsoon experience the difference between it and home in glaring contrast. At theend of September, 1916, my division entered the battle of the Somme (one of thelargest battles in the First World War with over 1.5 million casualties at theriver Somme in northern France). For us, it was the first of the huge battlesthat now followed, and the impression it created is hard to describe. It seemedmore like Hell than a war. The German front held out against the whirlwinddrumming of the guns for weeks at a time. Sometimes, they were pushed back; thenthey would advance again, but they never gave up.On October 7, 1916, I was wounded.I arrived safely at the rear and was ordered to Germany by transport vehicle.Two years had passed since I had seen home, which was an almost endless stretchof time to be away. I couldn't even imagine how Germans who were not in uniformwould look. When I was in the base hospital at Hermies (a farming village inFrance at the time), I was startled when the voice of a German woman, a nurse,addressed a man lying next to me. It was wonderful hearing a sound like that forthe first time in two years! The nearer to the border the trainapproached---which was bringing us home---the more restless each man became. Allthe towns moved past that we had ridden through two years before as youngsoldiers: Brussels, Louvain, Liege. Finally, we thought we recognized the firstGerman house by its high gables and its striking shutters. It was theFatherland! In October, 1914, we had been on fire with wild enthusiasm when wecrossed the border. Now, stillness and reverence ruled. We were all happy thatFate allowed us to once again see what we were defending so fiercely with ourlives.Almost on the anniversary of my departure, I arrived in the hospital in theBrandenberg town of Beelitz near Berlin. What a change! From the mud of theBattle of the Somme into the white beds of this amazing structure! At first, onehardly dared lie on them. Unfortunately, this world was new in other ways too.The spirit of the front-line army wasn't here. For the first time, I heardsomething we didn't know about at the front: someone boasting of his owncowardice. One did indeed hear cursing and grumbling at the front, but never toencourage the neglect of or the dereliction of duty, let alone to glorify thecoward. No, the coward was still a coward and nothing more. On the front, he wastreated with a contempt as strong as the admiration that was felt for a truehero. But here in the hospital, conditions were almost the reverse. The mostdishonest troublemakers and unprincipled trouble-seekers took the floor andtried in every way with every resource of their sorry eloquence to make thedecent soldier appear ridiculous and the coward's lack of character a model tobe emulated.A few disgraceful fellows were the ringleaders. One said that he had stuck hisown hand into the barbed-wire entanglement so he would be sent to the hospital.Despite the minor nature of his injury, he appeared to have been here a verylong time and was planning to stay. It appeared that an arrangement was struckas the result of a swindle or bribe, which allowed him to stay here, and anothersuch act was the only reason he made it on a transit train for Germany at all.This filthy pest of a fellow actually had the nerve to display his own cowardiceshamelessly and claim it was the result of a bravery higher than the heroicdeath of the honest soldier. Many listened in silence; others walked away; a fewactually agreed.I was disgusted within an inch of my life, but the troublemaker was calmlytolerated in the hospital. What could anyone do? Surely the hospital office knewwho and what he was, yet nothing happened.When I could walk again, I was allowed to go to Berlin. Hardship was obviouslyvery severe everywhere. Millions were suffering from hunger.Discontent was all around. In different shelters where the soldiers visited andin pubs the tone was the same as at the hospital. It seemed like these fellowsdeliberately sought out such spots in order to spread their views.But things were even worse, much worse, in Munich itself. When I was dischargedfrom the hospital after my recovery and was assigned to the reserve battalion, Ihardly recognized the city again. Anger, disgust, and abusive talk wereeverywhere. In the reserve battalion itself, the spirit was absolutely beneathcontempt. One factor was the total incompetent treatment of the active soldiersby non-commissioned training officers who had never spent a single hour on thebattlefield. For this reason, they were only able to establish a workingrelationship with the battle-experienced soldiers. The old front-line soldiersdid have certain peculiarities, which were the result of their own experience atthe front lines, but these were incomprehensible to the inexperienced officersof the reserve troops. An officer who had himself come from the front was notpuzzled by them. Such an officer received a very different sort of respect fromthat given to the officers who served at the rear away from the action or atheadquarters. Besides this, the general temper was awful. Avoidance of militaryservice began to be considered a sign of higher wisdom while the faithfulendurance of service became the earmark of inner weakness and partial blindness.The government offices were full of Jews. Almost every clerk was a Jew and everyJew a clerk. I was astonished at this multitude of \"chosen people\" and could nothelp comparing it with their sparse presence at the front lines.The situation in business was even worse. Here the Jewish people had actuallybecome \"indispensable\". This spider was slowly beginning to suck the blood fromthe people. In the business of \"War Companies\", an instrument had been found togradually sweep away the national, free economy. The necessity of creatingcentralized suppliers without restrictions was emphasized. In fact, by1916-1917, almost all production was under the control of financial Jewry.But at whom did the people now direct its hatred? I was horrified to see a doomapproaching which was bound to lead to a collapse if it wasn't avoided in time.While the Jew was plundering the whole nation and forcing it under hisdomination, people were being turned against the \"Prussians\". At the front linesand at home, nothing was done by the leadership to curb this poisonouspropaganda. Nobody seemed to understand that the collapse of Prussia would notmean the rise of Bavaria. On the contrary, the fall of one would inevitably dragthe other with it into the abyss.This behavior caused me infinite pain. I could see no purpose in it except thatit was the Jew's most inspired trick to distract general attention fromthemselves to others. While Bavarians and Prussians were quarreling, the Jew wassneaking the income from under their noses. While the Bavarians were damning thePrussians, the Jew organized the Revolution and with one blow shattered bothPrussia and Bavaria.I could not stand to watch this doomed feud among the German clans and preferredto return to the front lines. I asked to be transferred there immediately aftermy arrival in Munich. By the beginning of March, 1917, I was back with myregiment again.Toward the end of 1917, the deepest point of the army's depression seemed to bepast. After the Russian collapse, the whole army had new hope and courage. Thebelief that the struggle would end with a German victory began to grow in thetroops more and more. Singing was heard again and there were fewer grumblers.People believed in the future of the Fatherland again.The Italian collapse in the Autumn of 1917 had a wonderful effect. In thisvictory, the troops saw proof that it was possible to break through other frontsbeside the Russian campaign. A magnificent faith flooded back into the hearts ofthe millions and made it possible for them to hold out for the spring of 1918with relieved assurance of victory. The enemy, on the other hand, was visiblymiserable. That winter, things were somewhat calmer than usual. It was just thecalm before the storm. As the front was making the final preparation to concludethe endless struggle, and as endless lines of transport-trains filled with menand supplies were rolling toward the Western Front and the troops were beinggroomed for the great attack, the greatest treachery, the most foul trick of theWar broke out in Germany.Germany must not win the War. At the last moment when the German victory flagthreatened to wave, a calculated blow was made to stifle the German springattack at birth, making victory impossible. The weapons manufacturing strike wasorganized among the labor unions.If it was successful, the German front would break and the wish of the SocialDemocratic newspaper, Vorwärts (\"Forward\"), that Germany would not be the victorthis time would be fulfilled. Without weapons, the front would collapse in a fewweeks. The offensive would be prevented, the political agreement saved, and theinternational capital made ruler of Germany. Cheating the people was the innergoal of the Marxist and they succeeded. It was the destruction of the nationaleconomy in order to establish the rule of international capital and it happenedthanks to the stupidity and gullibility of one side and the enormous cowardiceof the other.The munitions strike was not as successful as was hoped and did not deprive thefront line of weaponry and armaments. It collapsed too early for the weaponsshortage alone to condemn the army to destruction according to plan. However,the moral damage that was done was so much worse! First, what was the armyfighting for if people at home did not even want victory? Who were the enormoussacrifices and hardships for? The soldier is sent out and told to fight forvictory, and at home they strike against it! Second, what was the effect uponthe enemy? In the winter of 1917-18, dark clouds rose for the first time on theAllied sky. For almost four years, the Allies leaned against the German giantand had been unable to topple him. He had only one arm holding a shield fordefense in the West which left his sword arm free to swing to the East and theSouth.Now, the giant was finally free from his battles behind. Rivers of blood hadflowed before he succeeded in smashing one of his adversaries. Now, this giantcould turn and let the sword join the shield in the West. The enemy had notsucceeded so far in breaking down the defense; the attack would now fallcompletely on him. The enemy dreaded him and feared the imminent victory.In London and Paris, there was one meeting after another, but on the front line,a drowsy silence reigned. The insolence of the allied leaders suddenly sank.Even the enemy propaganda was struggling. It was not as easy to prove theimpossibility of a German victory. The same thing was also true on the frontlines. They too began to see a strange light. Their inner attitude toward theGerman soldier had changed. Up until now, they might have thought he was a foolmarked for defeat, but now, they were facing the destroyer of their Russianally. The necessary confinement of German offensives to the East now seemed tobe part of an inspired strategy.For three years, the Germans had charged against Russia and appeared to have noeffect. People almost laughed at these pointless attempts. After all, theRussian giant with his superior numbers must be the ultimate winner whileGermany would surely collapse from loss of blood. The evidence seemed to justifythis hope.Starting in September, 1914, when the endless masses of Russian prisoners fromthe battle of Tannenberg ( a decisive battle between Russia and Germany in theearly days of the First World War), began to march into Germany along highwaysand railroads in long caravans; the stream appeared to continue forever, but forevery Russian army that was beaten and annihilated, a new one arose to take itsplace. The vast Empire kept giving the Czar new soldiers and fed the war its newvictims. How long could Germany last in this race? Wouldn't the day come, aftera great German victory, when the Russian army reserves would prepare themselvesfor the final battle? And then what? In all human probability, Russia's victorymight be postponed, but it would eventually come.Now, all these hopes pinned on Russia were lost. The ally who had laid thegreatest bloodsacrifices on the altar for the Allies was at the end of hisstrength and lay at the feet of the merciless attacker. Fear and horror creptinto the hearts of the soldiers who, up until now, had filled their minds withblind faith. They now feared the coming spring. If they had not succeeded inbreaking the German line when he could give only part of his energy to theWestern Front, how could they expect victory against the entire strength of themighty land of heroes which was gathering itself for an attack? The shadows ofdefeat from the South Tyrolean Mountains (the Alto Adige mountain range in Italy) sank uneasily on the imagination. As far away as the fog of Flanders (inFrance), the beaten armies of General Cadorna created gloomy spirits and theirbelief in victory crumbled as they saw a future filled with fear and defeat.(General Luigi Cadorna led 250,000 Italian soldiers to their death in the earlydays of the First World War along the Isonzo River and he achieved little or nomilitary gains.) Just as people thought they could hear the steady rumble fromadvancing shock troops of the German army in the cool of the night and when theywere anxiously expecting the coming judgment day, suddenly a glaring red lightblazed from Germany, throwing its flare into the last shell-hole of the enemyfront. At the moment the German divisions were making their final preparationsfor the great assault, the general labor-strike broke out in Germany.For a moment, the world was speechless. But then, with a sigh of relief, theenemy propaganda grabbed this opportunity for a reprieve in the twelfth hour. Inone strike they found ways to restore the diminishing confidence of the Alliedsoldiers, to call the chance of victory a certainty again, and to change theuneasy dread of what was coming into confident determination. Now, the regimentswaiting for the inevitable German attack could go into the greatest battle ofall time with the conviction that the end of the War would be decided not by thebravery of the German assault, but by the persistence of its own defenses. Letthe Germans win as many victories as they pleased. At home, the MarxistRevolution was welcomed as it marched in, not the victorious army.The English, French, and American newspapers began to plant this belief in thehearts of their readers, while a substantial and skillful propaganda movementfed the morale of their troops at the front.\"Germany on the eve of Revolution! Victory of the Allies inevitable!\" This wasthe best medicine to set the wavering French and English on their feet.Now, German rifles and machine-guns could be fired again, but instead of fleeingin panic and terror, they met determined resistance and confidence.This was the result of the strike at weapons factories. It strengthened theenemy's faith in victory and swept away the paralyzing hopelessness of theAllied front. Afterward, thousands of German soldiers paid with their liveswhile the originators of this dishonorable wickedness were slated to move intothe highest State offices of Germany as a result of the Revolution.The visible effects of this act on the German troops could be overcome for now,but on the enemy's side, the results had a long lasting effect. The resistancewas no longer an aimless army that has given everything up for lost, but insteadthe bitter intensity of a struggle for victory appeared. In all humanprobability, victory would come if the Western Front could just hold out for afew months against the German attack. The parliaments of the Allies recognizedthis future chance for victory and approved the use of astonishing, stupendousamounts of money to continue the propaganda which would eventually undermineGermany.It was my good fortune to have a part in the first two and the last offensives.They are the most tremendous impressions of my life. They were tremendousbecause this was the last time the struggle lost the character of defense andtook on that of attack, as it felt in 1914. The men in the trenches and dugoutsof the German army drew a deep sigh of relief now that the day of revenge washere at last after more than three years of stubbornly resisting the enemyinferno. Once more, the victorious battalions shouted, and they hung the lastimmortal laurel wreaths on the battle flags amid the lightning flashes ofvictory. Once more the songs of the Fatherland roared toward heaven along theendless marching columns and for the last time, and, the Lord's mercy smiled.In Midsummer of 1918, stifling heat covered the front. At home people werequarreling. Over what? Many stories circulated through the various divisions ofthe army in the field. The War was now hopeless, they said, and only fools couldstill believe in victory. The people had no more interest in continuing inresistance; only the capitalists and the Monarchy wanted to continue. That wasthe story from home and it was discussed on the front as well.At first, there was scarcely any reaction. What did we care about general votingrights? Was that what we had fought four years to gain? It was a piece of evilrobbery to steal the war's goal from the graves of dead heroes. The youngregiments that died in Flanders did not cry, \"Long live general voting rights\",but they shouted, \"Germany ahead of all\". The difference was \"small\", but notinsignificant. Those who were shouting for general voting rights were neverthere when the fighting was going on. The whole political party rabble werestrangers to the front. One only saw a fraction of the \"HonorableParliamentarians\" in places where decent Germans were found.The old soldiers who were the backbone of the front had no interest in this newwar aim of Ebert, Scheidemann, Barth, and Liebknecht (Social Democrats who werekey figures in the German Revolution of 1918). We could not see why theseslackers should suddenly have the right to inappropriately claim State authorityfor themselves over the army's leadership.My personal attitude was settled from the start. I hated the whole pack ofwretched, nationswindling party scoundrels intensely. I had realized for a longtime that with this gang it was a question of filling their empty pockets andnot of the nation's welfare. For this purpose, they were now willing tosacrifice all the people, and if necessary, let Germany go to her doom. In myeyes, it was time to string them up. Giving in to their wishes meant sacrificingthe interests of the working people in favor of a set of pickpockets. Thosewishes could only be fulfilled if one were ready to give up Germany, and this iswhat the great majority of the fighting army still thought. The reinforcementsfrom home quickly grew worse and worse. Their arrival weakened instead ofstrengthened the fighting power. The young reinforcements in particular weremostly worthless. Often, it was hard to believe that these were sons of the samepeople who had once sent out their youth to the battle of Ypres (the Firstbattle of Ypres, also called the Battle of Flanders in 1914).In August and September, the symptoms of disintegration quickly increased. Theenemy attacked with terrible effect, but it was mild when compared to the pastdefensive battles of Somme and Flanders (battlefields in France), which wereblood curdling.At the end of September, my division re-took for the third time places which wehad once stormed as young volunteer regiments. Those were some great memories!For there, in October and November of 1914, we had received our baptism of fire.With love of the Fatherland in its heart and a song on its lips, our youngregiment had gone to battle as if to a dance. The most precious blood wasjoyfully given in the belief that this would preserve independence and freedomfor the Fatherland.In July of 1917, we walked on this ground, sacred for us all, for the secondtime. Here slept the best of our comrades, children almost, who had given theirlives for the Fatherland, their eyes glowing with enthusiastic love. Weveterans, who had marched out with the regiment long ago, stood with deepreverence at this altar of \"faithfulness and obedience unto death\". The regimenthad stormed this ground three years before. Now, it was to defend it in a bitterbattle of resistance.With three weeks of continuous artillery, the English prepared for the greatFlanders offensive. Now, the spirits of the dead seemed to come alive. Theregiment braced itself in the filthy mud and dug into the shell-holes andcraters, unyielding, unwavering, and grew smaller and thinner, just as they hadonce before at this spot. Finally, the English attack came on July 31, 1917.Early in August we were relieved by fresh troops. What once had been theregiment was now a few companies. They staggered back, covered with mud, morelike ghosts than men. Except for a few hundred yards of shell-holes, theEnglishman had only won death.Now, in the fall of 1918, we stood for the third time on the ground we hadstormed in 1914. The small town of Comines (in Belgium), where we once had beenstationed on a base, was now our battlefield. The battleground was the same,only the men had changed. The troops now talked politics, too.The poison from home began to take effect here, as it was everywhere else. Theyounger reinforcements were absolutely useless because they came from home wherethey had succumbed to its effects.On the night of October 13th to 14th the English attacked with gas on thesouthern front south of Ypres (a Belgian municipality in West Flanders). Theyused yellow-cross gas (yellow crosses were painted on gas shells to show theycontained mustard gas producing liquid), whose effect was unknown to us as faras personal experience was concerned. I found out about it firsthand that verynight. The evening of October 13th, on a hill south of Wervick (a Belgiummunicipality in West Flanders), we were subjected to a pounding of gas bombslasting several hours, and it continued more or less violently all night. Bymidnight, half of us were knocked out of action, some of our comrades forever.Toward morning, I was gripped by more and more violent pains as the minutespassed.By seven o'clock in the morning, my eyes felt like they were on fire. I fumbledand staggered to the rear, taking with me my last messenger report I wasdestined to deliver in the War. Within a few hours, my eyes had turned tored-hot coals and everything around me was dark. I was sent to the hospital inthe German city of Pasewalk (on the Uecker river) in Pomerania (an area nowsplit between Germany and Poland) and there I had to experience the greatestdisgrace of this century. The Revolution.There had been something vague and repulsive in the air for some time. Thegossip was that \"things\" were going to pop in the next few weeks. I could Therehad been something vague and repulsive in the air for some time. The gossip wasthat \"things\" were going to pop in the next few weeks. I could not imagine whatthey meant by \"things\". My first thought was of a strike, like the one in thespring. Unpleasant rumors were constantly coming from the Navy, which wassupposed to be in a state of confusion. To me, this seemed more the creature ofa few scattered rascals' brains than any concern of a large mass of people. Inthe hospital, everyone talked about the ending of the War, which they hopedwould be soon, but no one counted on it being immediately. I could not readnewspapers because of my eyes. In November, the general tension increased. Thenone day, suddenly and unexpectedly, the disaster was upon us. Sailors came intrucks inspiring and rousing us to join the Revolution. A few Jew-boys were the\"leaders\" in this struggle for the \"freedom, beauty, and dignity\" of ournational people. None of them had been at the front lines or seen any action.Three Orientals who were sent home from behind the lines by way of the socalled\"clap hospital\", that is to say venereal disease, left Marxist flags behind, andthese red rags were now hoisted up in the hospital.By that time, my condition had begun to improve somewhat. The pain in thehollows of my eyes lessened and I could distinguish rough outlines of mysurroundings again. I had hopes of getting my eyesight back at least enough sothat I would be able to find some useful occupation. I did not, however, hope tobe able to draw again. Still, I was on the road to recovery when anothermonstrous thing happened.My first hope was that this high treason was only a local affair. I tried tocheer up some of my comrades with that reassurance. My Bavarian hospitalmates inparticular were willing to accept this outlook. Their temper was anything but\"revolutionary\". I could not imagine that the craziness would break out inMunich because I thought the respect for the House of Wittelsbach (the RoyalHouse of the German State of Bavaria) was sure to be stronger there than thewill of a few Jews. I could not help but tell myself it was just a matter of arevolt in the Navy which would be put down in the next few days.The next few days came, and with them the most horrible information I havereceived in my life. The rumors grew even more alarming. What I thought was alocal matter was a general Revolution. On top of it all, the shameful news camefrom the front: They were going to surrender. How could this be possible? On the10th of November, the pastor came to the hospital for a short speech and wefound out the whole story. Those around me were extremely excited as we listenedto his brief speech. The dignified old gentleman seemed to be trembling like aleaf as he informed us that the House of Hohenzollern (the noble families ofPrussia, Germany, and Romania) could no longer wear the crown of the GermanEmperors. The Fatherland had become a \"Republic\", and our Fatherland wouldcertainly be under the control of other people in the future. He said we mustbeg the Almighty not to withhold His blessing of the transformation and not toforsake our people in the times to come. He could not refrain from saying a fewwords about the Royal House. He tried to speak in appreciation of what it haddone for Pomerania, for Prussia, for the German Fatherland, and here, he beganto weep softly. Profound unhappiness came upon every heart in the little hall,and I do not believe there was a dry eye at this point. The old gentleman triedto continue and began to tell us that we would now have to end the long War andthat the future of our Fatherland would face heavy burdens. The War was lost andwe were throwing ourselves upon the mercy of the victors. He also said theArmistice was to be accepted and our trust was put in the generosity of ourenemy. By that time, I could stand it no longer. It was impossible for me tostay in the room. Everything went black before my eyes again and I staggered andstumbled my way back to the dormitory, flung myself upon my cot, and buried myburning head in the blanket and pillow.I had not cried since the day I stood beside my mother's grave. In my youth,whenever I was gripped by the hard and cruel hand of Fate, my stubbornnessincreased. When Death took dear comrades and friends from our ranks in the longyears of the war, I would have thought it almost a sin to complain. Were theydying for Germany or not? When I fell victim to the creeping gas that began toeat into my eyes during the very last days of that frightening struggle, and Isuffered the horror of going blind forever, there was a moment when I was readyto lose courage, but then the voice of conscience thundered at me: \"Youmiserable wretch! Who are you to whimper while thousands of souls are a hundredtimes worse off than you?\" So, I bore my fate in silence. I had realized for thefirst time how personal suffering disappears in the face of the misfortune ofthe Fatherland.It had all been in vain. All the sacrifices and starvation were in vain; thehunger and thirst that stretched for months without end were in vain; the hoursgripped by deathly terror in which we still did our duty were in vain; and thedeath of the two million who gave their lives, it was all in vain. Surely thegraves would open up returning all the hundreds of thousands who had marched outbelieving in the Fatherland? Surely they must open and send forth the silentheroes, covered with mud and blood, as avenging spirits to the homeland whichhad so outrageously cheated them of the highest sacrifice that a man can offerto his people in this world? Was this what the soldiers of August and September,1914 ( referring to the Battle of Tannenberg where the Germans decimated theRussians) had died for? Was this why the volunteer regiments followed their oldcomrades in the fall of the same year? Was this why these boys of seventeen haddied on the soil of Flanders? Was this the meaning of the sacrifice that theGerman mother made for the Fatherland when, with an aching heart, she sent herdearest boys out, never to see them again? Was all of this so a mob of miserablecriminals could dare to lay hands on the Fatherland? Was this why the Germansoldier, exhausted by sleepless nights and endless marches, hungry, thirsty, andfrozen, had stood fast through burning sun and driving snow? Was it for this hehad gone through the inferno of continuous artillery fire and the fever of gasattacks, never yielding, always remembering the single duty to guard theFatherland from enemy invasion? Truly, these heroes deserved a monument thatsays: \"Stranger, when you travel to Germany, tell them that we lay here,faithful to the Fatherland and obedient to duty\". (These words are paraphrasedfrom the monument erected at Thermopylae in Greece to the memory of Leonidas andhis Spartan soldiers.) But was the supreme sacrifice all we must consider? Wasthe Germany of the past worthless? Do we have any obligation to our own history?Were we still worthy enough to take on ourselves the glory of the past? And howcould this deed be justified to the future? These are immoral and miserablecriminals! The more I tried to understand this outrageous event, the more mycheeks burned with indignation and shame. The pain of my eyes was nothingcompared to this wretchedness. Awful days and worse nights followed. I knew thatall was lost. Only fools or these liars and criminals could hope for the enemy'smercy. During those nights, hatred grew---hatred for the perpetrators of thisdeed.In the next few days, I became aware of my own Fate. I had to laugh when Ithought of my personal future, which had caused me so much worry only a short atime ago. It was funny to think of building houses on this ground. Finally, Irealized that the thing I had dreaded so often, the thing which was inevitablehad happened, but I did not have the heart to believe it.Emperor William II had been the first German Emperor to offer the hand ofreconciliation to the leaders of Marxism, not dreaming that those crooks have nohonor. While they grasped the Imperial hand with their left hand, the other handwas reaching for the sword. With the Jew there can be no understanding oragreement, but only the unyielding \"either-or\". I resolved to become apolitician.8. BEGINNING OF MY POLITICAL ACTIVITYBy the end of November, 1918, I was back in Munich. I went to the reservebattalion office of my regiment, which was in the hands of the new \"Soldiers'Councils\". The whole administration was so disgusting to me that I decided toleave as quickly as possible. With a faithful friend of the campaign at my side,Ernst Schmidt, I traveled to Traunstein (a town in the southeast part of BavariaGermany) and remained there until the camp was broken up.In March of 1919, we went back to Munich. The situation there was shaky whichthreatened to continue the Revolution. Eisner's death only hastened thedevelopment and it finally led to the dictatorship of the Councils. (KurtEisner, the Bavarian Socialist politician, journalist, and organizer of theSocialist Revolution, died in February of 1919. He was killed by a lone assassinnot associated with the Nazi movement. He previously led the Munich Revolutionand became Premier of Bavaria.) Or, more accurately put, to a temporary Jewishdomination which was the original goal of those who created the Revolution.At that time, plans bounced back and forth in my head. For days, I consideredoptions and thought about what could possibly be done, but the result of everytrain of thought was the sober realization that no one knew me and I did nothave the means to actually do anything. Later I will explain the reason why Icould not even make up my mind which of the existing political parties to join.During the new Revolution of the Councils, for the first time, I behaved in away that the Central Council found annoying. The later result was that I was tobe arrested early in the morning of April 27, 1919, but the three fellows whocame for me did not have enough courage when facing the muzzle of my rifle tocomplete their task and ran off as quickly as they came.A few days after the \"liberation\" of Munich, I was ordered to appear before theCommission of Investigation to discuss the revolutionary events in the SecondInfantry Regiment. This was my first, somewhat, purely political activity.Within a few weeks, I received orders to attend a \"course\" or a series oflectures which was being held for members of the military forces. Here, asoldier was supposed to receive a definite foundation for his thinking as acitizen. The only value in the performance to me was that it gave me a chance tomeet like-minded comrades with whom I could discuss the real situation at hand.We were all firmly convinced that Germany could no longer be saved from thecoming catastrophe, certainly not by the parties who committed the Novembercrime (the surrender and formation of the Weimar Republic), the Center Party andthe Social Democratic Party. Even if they had the best intentions in the world,the socalled \"privilegedclass Nationalist\" organizations could never correctwhat had already been done. They lacked the full set of necessary fundamentalsand without them, such a task could not succeed.Time has shown that our view was correct.In our little circle, we discussed the formation of a new Party. The basic ideaswe had in mind were the same that were later realized in the \"German Workers'Party\" (the DAP, precursor to the Nazi party ). The name of the movement to befounded must help us reach the broad masses from the very beginning. Without theability to reach the masses, the whole task would be senseless and unnecessary.We hit on the name \"Social Revolutionary Party\" because the social views of thenew organization actually constituted a revolution.But there was also a much deeper reason for the name. Attentive as I had alwaysbeen to economic problems, my focus had been confined to the social problems.Only later were the bounds of my attention extended as I examined the TripleAlliance (the Alliance was between Germany, AustriaHungary, and Italy whichHitler detested). This alliance was mostly the result of a poor assessment ofthe economic system, as well as a vagueness about the basis on which the Germanpeople could be sustained in the future. All these ideas rested on the opinionthat money was only the product of labor, and finances could be corrected byadjusting issues that helped or hurt human activity. In fact, this unexpectedlyrevealed the true role of money because it depended completely on the greatness,freedom, and power of the State and people. This dependency requires financialsectors to actively support the State and people. It is a matter of instinct andselfpreservation for the improvement of its own development. The necessarydependence of finances upon the independent free State would compel financialsectors to work for this freedom, power, and strength of the nation. This madethe duty of the State toward finances comparatively simple and clear. It onlyhad to be certain that capital remained a servant of the State and did notbecome the master of the people. The expression of this attitude could thenremain within two boundary lines: preservation of a healthy, independentnational economy on one side, and the safeguarding of the wageearner's socialrights on the other.Previously, I did not realize there was a difference between capital as theresult of work and a capital derived from speculation investments---not until Ireceived a push in the right direction. This push was by one of the variousgentlemen who lectured in the previously mentioned course, Gottfried Feder (aneconomic theoretician who was later a key member and guided the Nazi party).For the first time in my life, I heard a basic outline explaining the workingsof international finance and loan capital. When I heard Feder's first lecture,the idea instantly flashed through my mind that I had now found my way toaccomplish one of the key essentials needed in the foundation of a new party.In my mind, Feder's merit was demonstrated in his ruthless and vigorous methodof describing the double character of the finances used in stockexchanges andloan transactions. He laid bare the fact that this capital is always dependenton the payment of interest. His explanations of all the basic questions were sosound that from the start, his critics did not dispute the theoreticalcorrectness of the idea but they doubted the possibility that it could becarried out. What others considered a weakness in Feder's arguments, I thoughtwas the strong point.The task of the plan's creator is not to lay out the details needed to fulfillthe plan, but to explain the plan. He should be concerned less with the methodand more with the goal. The essential truth behind an idea is the decidingfactor, not the difficulty in carrying it out. The moment the plan's creatorattempts to consider socalled \"convenience\" and \"reality\" instead of absolutetruth, his work will no longer be a star seeking humanity and will becomenothing more than an everyday procedure. The program-maker of a movement mustdetermine its goal; the politician must attempt to reach it. Accordingly, thethinking of the plan's creator is determined by Eternal-Truth and the action ofthe politician is determined by the practical reality of the moment. Thegreatness of one man lies in the truth behind the theory of his idea and in hisproper approach to the given facts. The greatness of the other lies in hispractical use of them. The goal set up by the plan's creator must serve as aGuiding-Light to others. The test of a politician's importance is the success ofthe plans and actions as they become a reality, even though the final intentionof the plan's creator can never be realized. Human thought can indeed grasptruths and set up goals as clear as crystal, but their complete fulfillment willbe prevented by the universal imperfection and inadequacy of man. The truer thetheory and the more tremendous the idea, the more impossible it is to achieve aslong as it depends on human beings. For that reason, the importance of theplan's creator cannot be measured by the achievement of his goals, but by theirrightness and the influence they have on the development of humanity. If thiswere not true, the founders of religion could not be considered to be among thegreatest men on this Earth since the fulfillment of their moral goals are noteven close to being achieved. Even that, which is called the \"Religion of Love\",is only a shadow of the Will of its Righteous Creator, but its importance is inthe attempt to convey ethics and morals to the general development of HumanCulture.This fundamental difference between the tasks of the political philosopher orplan's creator and the politician is also the reason why the two are almostnever the same person. It is particularly true of the socalled \"successful\", ormore accurately the unimportant politician whose actions are limited to \"the artof the possible\", as Bismarck defined politics. The more such a \"politician\"avoids great ideas and sticks to that which he can easily accomplish, the easierhis job becomes, the more obvious his small victories, and always the quickerhis successes will be. These successes have an Earthly and brief life and oftendo not live longer than the author. The work of this sort of politician is of noimportance to future generations since its present success depends solely onavoiding crucial problems and ideas. The solutions to larger problems areactually valuable for later generations as well as the current one. Theaccomplishment of goals which will have value and meaning for distantgenerations is usually unrewarding for their champions today and are rarelyaccepted or understood by the great masses. The masses understand reductions inbeer and milk prices better than deep plans for a distant time where thebenefits will only be seen by their future generations.A close relative of stupidity is vanity, and vanity is the reason the greatmajority of politicians will distance themselves from any difficult plans forthe future. They want to avoid losing the momentary favor of the crowd. Thesuccess and importance of such a politician then lies entirely in the presentand their actions have no meaning for the future. This doesn't bother the smallminded; they are satisfied with immediate results.The political philosopher is a different matter. His importance almost alwayslies totally in the future since he is frequently what we call a dreamer. If theart of the politician is considered the art of doing the possible, then thepolitical philosopher is one whom it is said pleases the Gods only when hedemands the impossible. He will almost always have to give up fame in thepresent, but in its place, if his ideas are immortal, he receives glory fromfuture generations.Once in a very long time, a politician and political philosopher may be one andthe same, but the more intimate this fusion, the greater the resistance willgrow to the politician's efforts. He is no longer working for necessitiesobvious to the average person, but for goals only a few can understand. His lifeis torn between love and hate. The protests of those presently around him who donot understand the man will battle against his struggle to accomplish somethingimportant for posterity. The greater the future will be for a man's work, theless the present can grasp it, the harder the battle will be, and the rarersuccess will be found. If success does smile on one man in centuries, a glimmerof the coming glory may possibly surround him in his old age.Even so, these great men are just the marathon runners of history. The glory ofthe present only rests upon the brow of the dying hero. We must count these menas the great warriors of this World. Those are the men who are not understood bythe present, but who are nevertheless ready to fight to the end for their ideasand ideals. They are the ones who will someday be closest to the people'shearts. Each of these individuals felt it was his duty to repay the wrongs whichgreat men have suffered at the hands of their contemporaries. Their lives andtheir work are then studied with touching and grateful admiration. In dark daysof distress, such men have the power to heal broken hearts and elevate thepeople from their despair.To this group belong not only the genuinely great statesmen but all the greatreformers as well. Besides Frederick the Great (Friedrick II, from theHohenzollern dynasty, who united much of the Prussian dynasty) we have such menas Martin Luther (the monk and Protestant Church reformer) and Richard Wagner(the famous antiSemitic German composer).When I heard Gottfried Feder's first lecture on \"Breaking the Slavery ofInterest\", I immediately knew that this was a theoretical truth which was ofhuge importance for the future of the German people. The separation of financecapital from the national economy made it possible to oppose theinternationalization of the German economy without threatening nationalselfpreservation. I saw Germany's development much too clearly not to have knownthat the hardest struggle would have to be fought against international capitaland not against hostile people. In Feder's lecture, I heard a mighty rallyingcry for this coming struggle.Subsequent developments showed how right our feeling was. Today, we are nolonger laughed at by our deceptive, privilegedclass sly-boots politicians.Today, if they are not deliberate liars, even they see that internationalfinance capital not only took the lead in nurturing the War, but especiallyafter the struggle has ended it is doing everything possible to make the Peaceinto a Hell.The struggle against international finance and loan capital interest has becomethe most important point in the program of the German nation's economicindependence and freedom. For those practical people who may object, I offerthese answers: All apprehensions about the economic consequences that wouldfollow the abolition of the slavery that results from interest-based financingcapital are not valid because in the first place, the economic principles thatwe have previously followed already proved to be quite disastrous to theinterests of the German people.The comments by the authors of those plans on questions of selfpreservationstrongly remind us of the past verdicts passed out by similar \"experts\" such asthe Bavarian Medical Faculty regarding the question of introducing the railroad.We now know that none of this exalted body's fears have happened since riders ofthe new \"steam-horse\" did not become dizzy, spectators watching the train passwere not made ill, and the board fences intended to hide the new invention aregone. All that is left are invisible blinders on the socalled \"experts\" andthose will always be there.In the second place, we should remember that any idea becomes dangerous if itpresumes to be an end in itself, but in reality, it is just a means to anend.For me and all true NationalSocialists, there is only one doctrine: Folk andFatherland. We must fight to assure the existence and the growth of our race andour nation. We must feed our children and keep our blood pure. We must fight forthe freedom and independence of the Fatherland so that our nation may grow andfulfill the mission given to it by the Creator of the Universe.Every ideal and every idea, every teaching and all knowledge must serve thispurpose. It is from this perspective that we must judge everything and use it ordiscard it according to its suitability for our purpose. In this way, a theorycan never harden into a deadly doctrine since it must all serve the common good.The insight of Gottfried Feder led me to deep study in a field where Ipreviously had little knowledge. I resumed the process of learning and came torealize for the first time the purpose behind the life work of the Jew, KarlMarx. Now, I really began to understand his currency, the capital he used, aswell as the struggle of Social Democracy against the national economy---astruggle that was meant only to lay the groundwork for the rule of trueinternational finance by interest-based money.In another respect, these courses had a great effect upon my later life. One dayduring the course, I asked for the floor in a discussion after one of the menattending the course felt compelled to break a lance for the Jews and defendedthem at great length. This aggravated me so much I had to reply. Theoverwhelming majority of those present were on my side. The result was that afew days later I was assigned to a Munich regiment as an \"education officer\".The discipline of the troops at that time was still fairly weak. They sufferedfrom the aftereffects of the Soldiers' Council. The introduction of militarydiscipline and subordination in place of \"voluntary obedience\", a term for thefilth under Kurt Eisner (who led the Marxist revolution in Bavaria and wasPremier until 1919), had to be implemented very slowly and cautiously. Thetroops themselves had to learn to feel and think as Nationalists and bepatriotic. My new focus was pointed in those two directions.I happily began my task. Suddenly, I had an opportunity to speak before largeaudiences. What I had always felt and assumed to be true was now beingproven---I could \"speak\". My voice had improved enough so that people couldalways understand me, at least in the small squad room.No task could have made me any happier. Now, before being discharged, I could doa useful service for the institution which had been so close to my heart, thearmy. I can say my talks were a success. During the course of my lectures, I ledhundreds, probably thousands, of my comrades back to their Folk and Fatherland.I \"nationalized\" the troops and was able to help strengthen the generaldiscipline.In the process, I became acquainted with a number of comrades, who believed as Idid and later formed the center of the new Movement. 9. THE \"GERMAN WORKERS' PARTY\"One day, I received orders to find out about a political organization goingunder the name of \"The German Workers' Party\", which had scheduled a meeting ina day or two where Gottfried Feder was to speak. I was to attend, check out thegroup, and then make my report.The army's curiosity in regard to political parties was more thanunderstandable. The Revolution gave the soldiers the right to take part inpolitics, and it was the most inexperienced men who were now making full use ofit. Until the Center Party (a Catholicbased party) and Social Democratic Parties(the Marxists) realized to their distress that these men were beginning to turnaway from the Revolutionary party aims and turn toward the national movement;did they think it was appropriate to deprive the troops of their right to voteand forbid their involvement in political activity? It was obvious that theCenter Party and Marxism would resort to this measure because if they had notcut off \"civil rights\", which is what they called the political equality of thesoldier after the Revolution, then within a few years, there would have been noNovember State left and no more national shame and humiliation that came withit. The troops at that time were well on the way to freeing the nation from itsblood-suckers as well as the politicians inside the government who were tools ofthat political agreement. The fact that even the socalled \"nationalist\" partiesvoted enthusiastically for this doctrine of the November criminals (to reversesoldiers' right to vote), without regard to its true meaning, and thus helped tosquelch the tools of a national revival, which should have been thenationalists' goal, showed once more that the inflexible attachment to an ideathat is purely abstract can lead the gullible away from their own goals.Suffering from total intellectual deterioration, this privilegedclass partyseriously believed the army would again become a stronghold of German bravery.The real goal of the Center Party and Marxism was to cut out the dangerousnationalist fangs of the military. But without the ability to bite, an armybecomes the police, not a body of troops that can do battle with the enemy. Thisis something which later events proved fully.Did our \"national politicians\" think the army could have developed in any wayother than becoming nationalistic? That would be just the style of thesegentlemen. That is what happens when someone spends the war as a windbagparliamentarian and not as a soldier. They lose any sense of what is going on inthe hearts of men. The hearts in the army are filled with a stupendous pastreminding them that they were once the best soldiers in the world.So, I resolved to attend the previously mentioned party meeting since I was notfamiliar with them and had not heard of them before. When I arrived that eveningand went to the back room of the former Sternecker Brewery beer-hall, which isnow a place of historical significance, there were about twenty or twenty-fivepeople, mostly from the lower class. I was already familiar with Feder's lecturethrough the courses I had taken, so I focused primarily on observing the societyitself. It did not make a good or bad impression on me. It was just another neworganization. Those were the days when anyone who was dissatisfied with previousdevelopments and had lost confidence in the existing parties thought he shouldstart a new party. Such societies sprang up like mushrooms everywhere, butdisappeared without a squeak after a short time. Most of the founders did nothave the slightest idea what it meant to turn a social gathering into apolitical party, let alone a movement. So, the groups they founded almost alwaysdrowned in their own ridiculous pettiness.After listening for about two hours, I decided that the \"German Workers' Party\"could be lumped in with the rest. I was glad when Feder finally finishedspeaking. I had seen enough and was getting ready to go when they announcedthere would be an open discussion. With that, I was persuaded to stay awhilelonger. Nothing of any consequence happened here until suddenly a \"professor\"took the floor. He first questioned the soundness of Feder's reasoning and then,after an excellent reply from Feder, suddenly took his stand and argued aboutthe \"facts\" of the issue. But, before they continued he strongly urged the youngparty to adopt the \"separation\" of Bavaria from \"Prussia\" as an important pointin the party program. The man brazenly continued to insist that GermanAustriawould immediately unite with Bavaria, that the peace would then be much better,and he continued with similar nonsense. At this point I could not resist askingfor my turn on the floor and telling the learned gentlemen my opinion on thesubject. I spoke with such success that before I had even finished, mypredecessor on the floor left the hall with his tail between his legs. Peoplelooked astonished as they listened to me talk.When I was saying goodnight to the group and starting to leave, a man camerunning after me to introduce himself and handed me a booklet that was evidentlya political pamphlet. He begged me to read it. I did not catch the man's name.I thought this was very convenient because now I could become acquainted withthe tiresome society without having to attend any more of their tiresomemeetings. The man, obviously a workman, did leave a favorable impression on methough. Then, I left.At that time, I was still living in the barracks of the Second Infantry Regimentin a little room which plainly showed the traces of the Revolution. I was awayall day, usually with the 41st Light Infantry or at meetings or giving lecturesto some other part of the troops. I was only in my quarters to sleep at night.Being in the habit of waking up at 5 o'clock every morning, I was accustomed toamusing myself by putting a few hard bread crusts on the floor for the tiny micethat played in the room. I would watch the comical little animals scramble forthese morsels. I had endured enough starvation in my life that I could wellimagine the hunger and also the delight of the little creatures.The morning after the meeting, I was laying awake in bed at five o'clockwatching the mice scurrying about. I couldn't go back to sleep and I suddenlyremembered the night before, and then the booklet that the man had asked me toread. So, I began to read it. It was a small pamphlet in which the author---this very workman who gave it to me---described how he had escaped theMarxist and tradeunion slogans and returned to thinking on nationalistic lines.The title was \"My Political Awakening\". Once I started reading, I consumed thepamphlet with interest all the way through. It described a process whichreminded me of the one I had gone through twelve years before. I recalled my owndevelopment again. I thought about the matter several times throughout the dayand was ready to put it aside again, when, less than a week later, I received apost-card stating that I been made a member of the German Workers' Party. Thecard asked what I thought about this and would I please come and share thesethoughts at a committee meeting of the party the following Wednesday.I must say, I was more than astonished at this method of \"recruiting\" members,and did not know whether to be annoyed or amused. I would not have dreamed ofjoining an existing party; I intended to found my own. This request was reallyout of the question for me. I was about to send my answer to the gentlemen inwriting when I was overcome with curiosity and I decided to go on the scheduledday to explain my reasons in person.Wednesday came. The pub where the meeting was to take place was the AltesRosenbad (the Old Rose) in the Herrnstrasse (Road of Gentlemen) area, a veryshabby place where somebody might wander by mistake once in a blue moon. Thatwas not surprising in 1919, at a time when the menus of even the largerrestaurants had only the most humble and sparse offerings. But this particularpub, I had never even heard of before.I went through the dim front room, discovered the door to the back room, andfound myself in the presence of the \"meeting\". In the faint glow of ahalffunctioning gas light, four young men were sitting around a table. Amongthem was the author of the little pamphlet, who immediately and excitedlygreeted and welcomed me as a new member of the German Workers' Party. I wasrather surprised at this. I was told that the real \"national chairman\" had notyet arrived and I decided to save my explanation for everyone at once. Finally,he showed up. He was the chairman from the meeting at the Sternecker Brewerywhen Feder had lectured.While waiting, I had become curious again and waited to see what would happen.Now, at least, I found out the names of the various gentlemen. The chairman ofthe \"national organization\" was Karl Harrer and, the Munich chairman, AntonDrexler (a machine and railway worker and a member of the völkisch movementoffshoot which was antiSemitic. He, together with journalist Karl Harrer,founded the German Workers' Party (DAP) in Munich with Gottfried Feder andDietrich Eckart in 1919).The minutes of the last meeting were now read, and a role call of confidence inthe secretary was passed. Then it was the treasurer's turn to read his report.The finances of the organization totaled all of seven marks and fifty pfennigsand for this, general confidence was expressed for the treasurer. This was alsorecorded in the minutes. Then, the chairman read aloud letters they had preparedin reply to past correspondence. One was a letter to Kiel, one to Dusseldorf,and one to Berlin. These were unanimously approved. Then the incoming mail wasrecorded and consisted of a letter from Berlin, one from Dusseldorf, and onefrom Kiel, whose arrival seemed to be received with great satisfaction. Thisincreasing correspondence was declared to be an excellent and visible sign ofthe spreading importance of the \"German Workers' Party\". Then, there was a longdiscussion regarding the reply letters to be written in answer to the newlyreceived correspondence.Awful, just awful! This was a small-town club of the worst kind and this waswhat I was supposed to join? The new members were offered the floor forconsideration of their membership. In other words, my capture in their trap wascomplete.I began to ask questions, but I found that other than a few guiding principles,there was nothing---no program, no printed material at all, no membership card,not even a humble rubber stamp of the party seal. All I saw was good faith andgood intentions.I had lost my desire to laugh at these happenings. This was all a sign of totalconfusion and complete discouragement, which was common to these parties withtheir programs, purposes, and their activities. The deep feeling that drew thesefew young men together into this ridiculous meeting was a result of their innervoice which, more instinctively than consciously, made all past party activitiesseem useless for the nationalist revival of Germany or for the cure to its innerailments, which were caused by those controlling the internal affairs of theState. I quickly read over the basic principles, which were in typewritten form,and I thought they revealed that these souls were searching and longing foranswers rather than showing any knowledge of the battle that needed to befought. Much of it was vague or uncertain and a lot was missing, but it wasobvious they were looking for truth. What inspired these men was something thathad been deep inside me too. It was the longing for a new movement which shouldbe more than a party in the old sense of the word.When I went back to the barracks that evening, my opinion of the organizationwas clear. I was faced with probably the most difficult question of my life:Should I join or should I decline? My reason advised me to refuse, but I had arestless feeling and the more I tried to convince myself the whole club wasnonsense, the more I felt inclined to favor it. I could not rest for the nextfew days.I began to argue back and forth with myself. I had decided to become politicallyactive a long time ago. I was also convinced that a new movement was necessary,but my impulse to act had been lacking. I am not one of those who startsomething today, then forgets about it the next day or switches over tosomething new. My very conviction was the main reason it was so hard for me todecide to join a new organization. This organization either had to grow to beeverything I saw it should be or else was better left alone. I knew I was makinga decision forever and there could be no turning back. For me, it was notemporary plaything, but a deadly serious undertaking. I have always had aninstinctive dislike for people who start everything and finish nothing.To me, such a jack-of-all-trades was to be loathed. I thought what they did wasworse than doing nothing.This was one of the main reasons why I could not decide as easily as others whenit came to start something because it must either become everything or otherwisebe conveniently left undone. Fate itself now seemed to give me a sign and pointme down the right road. I would never have joined one of the existing largeparties, and will explain my reasons in a moment. I felt this ridiculous littlecreation with its handful of members had one advantage in that it had not yethardened into an \"organization\". Instead, it still gave the individual a chancefor real personal input and activity. Here, a man could still accomplish someeffective work, and the smaller the movement was, the greater the chance offorming it into the right shape. Here, in this group, its character could stillbe formed, which was out of the question from the start with the existing bigparties.The longer I considered, the more convinced I became that a small movement likethis would serve as an instrument of national resurgence. This could neverhappen with one of the parliamentary political parties which clung far tootightly to old ideas, because they profited in the structure of the new regime.What must be declared here was a new WorldConcept , and not a new electionslogan.Still, it was a frightening and difficult decision to try to turn a purpose intoreality. What tools could I bring to the task? Being poor and without resourceswas the least of my troubles. A greater problem was that I was unknown. I wasone of the millions whom Chance could let live or die without even his nearestneighbors noticing. In addition, there was the problem that I had nevercompleted my schooling.The socalled \"intelligent people\" look down with unlimited condescension onanyone who has not been dragged through the required schools so that he has thenecessary knowledge pumped into him. After all, nobody ever asks, \"What can theman do?\" but, \"What has he learned?\" The \"educated\" people will like thegreatest idiot if he is covered in enough diplomas while they will care nothingfor the brightest boy who does not have those precious wrappings. So I couldeasily imagine how the \"educated\" world would receive me. My only mistake was inthinking men are a little better than they actually are. True, the exceptionsshine even brighter because of who they are. For my part, I learned todistinguish between those who are endlessly preparing for the real world throughschooling and the men of real ability who can take action.After two days of painful pondering and consideration, I was finally convinced Imust take this step. It was the hardest decision of my life. There could andmust be no retreat if I went forward. I applied for membership in the GermanWorkers'Party and received a provisional membership certificate bearing thenumber seven!10. CAUSES OF THE COLLAPSEThe fall of any group is always measured by the distance between its presentposition and its original position. The same thing holds true for the downfallof races and states. This makes the original position highly important. Onlywhat rises above the ordinary limits can be noticed in its fall. The collapse ofthe Second Reich was so hard and so horrible to every thinking and feelingperson because the fall came from a height which today, in the face of ourdisastrous present humiliation, is hard to even imagine.The very founding of the Reich seemed to be made golden by the magicalhappenings that elevated the whole nation. After a victorious and unequaledjourney, an Empire grew for their sons and grandsons as the ultimate reward forimmortal heroism. Whether consciously or unconsciously, the Germans felt thatthe noble way it was founded raised this Empire higher than any other state. Itsexistence was not due to parliamentary maneuvers to jockey above the standing ofother states. It was not in the small talk of a parliamentary argument, but inthe thunder and roar of the battlefront around Paris that the solemn act tookplace. This was a demonstration of the will of the Germans, princes and commonpeople, who sought to form one Empire for the future that would once more exaltthe Imperial Crown as a great symbol. It was not done by a knife in the back.Deserters and traitors were not the founders of Bismarck's State; it was builtby regiments at the front lines.This unique birth and fiery baptism alone were enough to surround the Empirewith a glow of historic glory that few of the oldest states could claim.What a rise began from that point! Freedom from the outside world gave usindependence and a means for creating our own daily bread on the inside. Thenation grew in number and in wealth. The honor of the State and the people wasguarded by an army, which was the most powerful demonstration of the differencebetween the new unified Empire and the old German Confederation.The downfall which has overtaken the Empire and the German people is so deepthat everyone seems dizzy and dumbfounded. People can barely see in their mind'seye the old heights of the Empire because today's disgrace is such a contrast tothe unreal dreams of yesterday's greatness and magnificence. It is naturalenough for people now to be so blinded by the past splendor that they forget tolook for the reason behind the great collapse.There must have been a symptom in some form that caused the collapse.This is true only for those to whom Germany was more than just a place to liveand make and spend money. Those who truly valued the Empire can feel the presentstate of collapse. To the others, it is the fulfillment of their long-hoped-forsilent wishes.The warning signs predicting the collapse were present and clearly visible inthe early days. Few people tried to learn anything from them. Today, this ismore necessary than ever. A disease can only be cured if it is diagnosed. Thesame is true when it comes to curing political ills. The visible symptoms of adisease, which is easy to see, is more easily identified than the inner cause.This is also the reason why so many people never move beyond the recognition ofsymptoms. They confuse the symptoms of the political disease with the cause.They may even try to deny the existence of the cause. Even now, most of us seethe German collapse as the cause of our general economic distress, but that isactually the result which came with the German collapse. To truly understandthis catastrophe, almost everyone has to personally suffer his share of theburden, and that is why every individual looks upon the current economictroubles as the cause of the State's problems. The great masses are far lesscapable of recognizing the collapse in its political, cultural, and moralaspects. This is why many people's instinct and understanding are both at acomplete loss.Some might say that this is only true of the great masses, but the fact thateven in intellectual circles, the German collapse is primarily seen as an\"economic catastrophe\" and can be fixed by economic means is one of the reasonswhy no recovery has yet been possible. Only when we realize the economic elementoccupies a second or third place in the line of responsibility---whilepolitical, moral, and racial factors occupy the top---can we begin to comprehendthe means required for a cure.The search for the causes of the German collapse is of primary importance,especially for a political movement whose goal is to overcome this disaster.While searching the past for the cause of this disaster, we must be careful notto confuse the obvious effects or symptoms, which are easily spotted, with theless obvious causes, which are easily overlooked.The easiest and most popular explanation of the present disaster is to say itresults from the loss of a war. Obviously, that must be the cause of the wholeproblem. No doubt there are many people who honestly believe this nonsense, butthere are more who know better and deliberately spread this lie.Those now feeding at the government trough are fed this slop. Wasn't it theheralds of the Revolution who kept telling the great masses how the results ofthe war would not effect them? Did they not solemnly vow that only the \"greatcapitalists\", the high financiers, had an interest in the victorious end of thewar, but the German people, the German worker had no interest whatsoever in theoutcome? Did these apostles of world reconciliation not declare quite openlythat a defeat would destroy only \"militarism\", while the German people wouldexperience a wonderful resurgence and prosperity. Weren't these the same men whoraised the flag of the Entente, the flag of surrender, and laid blame for thewhole bloody struggle upon Germany? Could they have done this without theirannouncement that a military defeat would have no special consequences for thenation? Wasn't the whole Revolution dressed with bright, pretty colors to blockthe march of German victory flags? Did they not say only in this way the Germanpeople would advance toward its inner and outward freedom? Wasn't this so, youdisgraceful, lying scoundrels? It requires a disrespect unique to the Jews toblame the German collapse on the military defeat now while the officialmouthpiece of this high treason, the Berlin Vorwärts (the Forward, which was thenewspaper of the Social Democrats), wrote that the German people must not bringits victory banner back this time! And now, the defeat is supposed to be thecause of our collapse? Of course it would be quite pointless to argue with sucha group of forgetful liars. I would not waste words on it if this nonsense werenot unfortunately repeated by so many thoughtless people who have no real hatredor intention to deceive. They merely parrot what they read. This discussion isintended to furnish our followers--- our warriors of enlightenment--- with theweapons which will be necessary when the spoken word is twisted in its meaning,often even before one can get it out of his mouth.Here is the reply that should be given to anyone who says that the loss of thewar was responsible for the German collapse: True, the loss of the War had direconsequences for the future of our Fatherland. Yet, the loss is not a cause butonly a result of other causes. It was always perfectly clear to everyintelligent and honest person that failure would be the outcome of thislifeand-death struggle. Unfortunately, there were also people who failed to seethis at the right time. There were also those who first questioned then deniedthe truth. These were the ones who suddenly understood too late the catastrophetheir collaboration had helped to cause. And there were those who denied thetruth after their secret wish was fulfilled even though they knew better. All ofthese people were guilty of causing the collapse, not the lost war, as theysuddenly chose to say or pretended to know. The loss of the war was the resultof their activity and not the result of \"bad\" leadership as they now try toclaim. The enemy was no coward; he, too, knew how to die. He had more soldiersthan the German army from the start, and the arsenals and armory factories ofthe whole world were available to him.Therefore, the German victories that were steadily gained through four longyears against the world were due solely to superior leadership as well as theheroism of our soldiers. The organization and direction of the German army werethe most tremendous things the world had yet seen. Their faults were no morethan the limits of human fallibility. The army's collapse was not the cause ofour present misfortune, but only the result of other crimes. This result usheredin another and more visible collapse.This collapse is shown from the following analysis: Does a military defeatautomatically mean a complete breakdown of a nation and a state will be theresult? Since when has this been the result of an unsuccessful war? Are nationsever destroyed by lost wars and that alone? The answer in short is \"yes\", iftheir military defeat reflects these people's inner rottenness, cowardice, lackof character, and unworthiness. If this is not the case, the military defeatwould instead be the drive that leads to a new and greater advancement ratherthan the gravestone of a people's existence. History offers endless examples toprove this statement.Unfortunately, the military defeat of the German people is not an undeservedcatastrophe, but a deserved punishment of Eternal revenge. We more than earnedthat defeat. It is simply the obvious outward symptom of decay resulting from aseries of inner problems. They may have been hidden from the eyes of the averagemen or those ostrich-like people who refused to see the obvious and stuck theirheads in the sand.Consider how the German people received this defeat. Didn't many groups welcomethe misfortunes of the Fatherland joyfully and in the most shameful ways? Whocould act like this without bringing down vengeance on his head for hisattitude? Didn't they go even further and boast that they finally made thewar-front collapse? It was not the enemy who disgraced us. Oh no, the German'sown countrymen put this shame on our heads! Was it unjust for disaster to followthem after their actions? When has it ever been customary to take full blame fora war oneself? What people would accept such guilt even though they have bettersense and know the truth to be different! No, and again no. How the Germanpeople received its defeat is the best sign that the true cause of our collapsehas to be found somewhere other than in the military loss of a few positions onhilltops or the failure of an offensive. If the front lines had really given wayand if a military misfortune had caused the Fatherland's catastrophe, the Germanpeople would have received the defeat in a completely different way. They wouldhave borne the disaster that followed with clenched teeth or have grieved aboutit, overpowered by agony. Their hearts would have been full of rage and angeragainst the enemy that was victorious merely through the double-cross of Chanceor the will of Fate. Like the Roman Senate, the nation would have gone to meetthe beaten divisions carrying the thanks of the Fatherland for their sacrificeand begging them not to lose hope for the Empire. Even the surrender would havebeen signed with the calm intellect of the brain, while the heart would havepounded as it already looked toward the revival to come.That was how a defeat would have been received that was due to Fate alone. Therewould have been no laughing and dancing, no boasting of cowardice and noglorifying defeat, no jeering at the fighting troops and dragging their flag andmedals in the mud. Above all, things would never have come to pass which causedan English officer, Colonel Repington (retired Colonel Charles Repington, aBritish war correspondent for the Times, who first coined the phrase World War),to say contemptuously, \"Every third German is a traitor\". No, this disease wouldhave never risen to the choking flood that for the past five years has drownedthe last remnants of the world's respect for us.This is what best proves the statement that the lost war is the cause of theGerman collapse and is totally false. No, the military collapse itself was theresult of a disease whose germs had attacked the German nation even before thewar broke out. This was the first universally visible catastrophic result ofmoral poisoning, of a loss of the selfpreservation instinct, and all that goeswith it which had started undermining the people and the Empire many yearsbefore. It took all the enormous lies of Jewry and its army of Marxists to putthe blame for the collapse on the very man who was trying single-handed withsuperhuman energy and willpower to prevent the catastrophe he had foreseen, andto spare the nation from its deepest degradation and shame.Ludendorff ( a well known German general who created the Dolchstoßlegende, theStab-inthe-back theory that Germany was betrayed and because of this lost WWI;he was also a proponent of propaganda, an anti-Marxist and antiSemitic who heldAdolf Hitler in high regard) was branded as guilty for the defeat and with thisact, the weapon of moral righteousness was snatched from the hand of the onlyaccuser who was dangerous enough to have risen up against the betrayers of theFatherland and brought them to justice. Here they were acting on the trueprinciple that within a big lie, a certain fraction of it is always accepted andbelieved. At the bottom of their hearts, the great masses of a people are morelikely to be misled by their emotions than to be consciously and deliberatelybad. In the primitive simplicity of their minds, they will more easily fallvictim to a large lie than a small lie, since they sometimes tell petty liesthemselves, but would be ashamed to tell a lie that was too big. They wouldnever consider telling a lie of such magnitude themselves, or knowing that itwould require such impudence, they would not consider it possible for it to betold by others. Even after being enlightened and shown that the lie is a lie,they will continue to doubt and waver for a long time and will still believethere must be some truth behind it somewhere, and there must be some otherexplanation. For this reason, some part of the most bold and brazen lie is sureto stick. This is a fact that all the great liars and liars' societies (meaningthe Jewish press) in this world know only too well and use regularly.Those who have known this truth about the possibilities of using lies andslander best have always been the Jews. Their whole existence is built up on onegreat lie: that they are a religious community when they are actually a race,and what a race! As such, one of the greatest minds of humanity(ArthurSchopenhauer, the German Philosopher) forever \"naileddown\" an eternally-correctand fundamental truth when he called the Jews \"The Great Masters of the Lie\".Anyone who refuses to see or declines to believe this can never help truthbecome victorious in the World.We may almost consider it a stroke of good fortune for the German people thatthe extent of its creeping disease was shortened by such an awful and suddencatastrophe. Otherwise, the nation would have been destroyed, perhaps moreslowly, but even more surely. The disease would have become chronic. In theseriousness of the collapse, it is now visible to the eyes of the crowd. It isnot by chance that man mastered the plague more easily than tuberculosis. Onedisease comes in dreadful waves of death which shake humanity; the other creepsslowly. Plague leads to fear; tuberculosis leads gradually to indifference. Theresult was that men faced the plague with ruthless energy, while they tried tokeep tuberculosis in check by weak methods.Man became master of the plague, while tuberculosis became master over him. Thesame thing is true of the diseases of nations. If they do not take the form of acatastrophe, men slowly adapt to their presence and the damage is much greaterbecause it is gradual. It is strangely a piece of good luck, though a bitterone, when Fate decides to interfere in this slow process of decay and suddenlyinflict the final stage of the disease on the sufferer. Such is the result ofsuch a catastrophe; it forces the development of a cure to be carried throughwith total determination. Even in this case, the recognition of the inner causeswhich produced the sickness must come first before we can look for a cure.Here too, the most important thing is to distinguish the germs from theconditions they produce. This becomes more difficult the longer the virus hasexisted in the political body and the more it is taken for granted to be part ofthe body. It may easily happen that after a length of time, someone will regardclearly harmful poisons as an integral part of one's own people, or at leastwill come to tolerate them as a necessary evil so that they no longer feel it isnecessary to search for the poisonous germ.In the long years of peace before the war ( the First World War), certain evilshad definitely shown themselves and been recognized as such. With only a fewexceptions, no one paid much attention to what caused them. Here again, theexceptions were primarily in aspects of economic life, which effected and caughtthe attention of the individual more than problems in other areas. There weremany signs of decay that should have been food for serious thought.From the economic angle, there is this to be said: The amazing growth of theGerman population before the war brought the problem of receiving an adequatesupply of daily bread more sharply to the forefront. Unfortunately, those\"responsible people\" could not make up their minds to adopt the one correctsolution. Instead, they preferred to accomplish their purpose in a cheaper waythrough industry. The decision to give up acquiring new land and its place tobecome entangled in the ghost of an industrial world economic conquest was boundto eventually lead to an industrialization that was as uncontrollable as it washarmful.The first consequence which had a major impact was the weakening of the farmingor peasant class. As fast as this class declined, the number of working classpeople in the large cities grew until the balance was entirely lost.Now, the intense contrast between poor and rich also became evident. Abundanceand filth lived so close together that the results were bound to cause conflict.Distress and frequent unemployment began to take their toll on men and leftdiscontent and bitterness behind. The result was a political division ofclasses. Despite spreading prosperity, dissatisfaction grew and became moreintense. Circumstances reached the point where many believed that \"this divisioncould not continue much longer\". However, people weren't able to see what wasgoing to happen.These were clear and visible signs of the far-reaching discontent. Worse yetwere other consequences which the commercialization and industrialization of thenation brought with them. Just as economics became the ruling mistress of thestate, money became the God all had to serve and before whom all had to bowdown. More and more, the Gods of Heaven were put on the shelf as antiquated andworn out. Incense was not burned to them, but to the false God, Mammon (thefalse God of greed). A very destructive collapse began--- destructive especiallybecause it came at a critical time for the nation, a time when it needed thenoblest of heroic spirit more desperately than ever. Germany should haverealized that some day it would need to back-up its acquisition of daily breadby \"peaceful economic work\" with the sword.The rule of money was authorized in the very place where it should have beenmost strongly resisted. His Majesty the Kaiser mistakenly allowed the newfinancial moguls to rise to the level of nobility. It must be admitted in hisdefense that even Bismarck unfortunately did not recognize the danger thiselevation would have.It meant that the virtues of idealism had moved to second place behind the valueof money. It was clear that once we set out on this path, the warrior nobilitymust soon take a secondary position to the financial nobility.It is easier to find success in financial operations than military operations.There was no longer any attraction for the real hero or statesman who did notcare to be thrown together with the first stray Jewish banker. The reallydeserving man no longer had any interest in being presented with cheapdecorations (civil medals and awards for economic accomplishment). Instead hedeclined them with a simple thanks. The purity of blood was an even more gloomymatter in this decline. More and more, the nobility lost the essential racialelement required for its existence. For many of them, the name \"ignobility\"would have been far more suitable(not being noble in quality or character).A serious sign of economic decay began with the slow disappearance of personalcontrol over property and the gradual transfer of the entire economic systeminto the hands of stock-controlled corporations. Labor had become an object ofexploitation and speculation for deceitful stockbrokers with no conscience. Thetransfer of property from the wageearner to the financiers grew out ofproportion. The stock exchange began to triumph, and slowly but surely, startedto take the life of the nation under its protection and control.The German economic system had already started down the road ofinternationalization when it began issuing shares of stock. Germanindustrialists made a determined effort to save the system, but it eventuallyfell before the united attack of money-grabbing financiers who fought thisbattle with the help of their most faithful friend, the Marxist movement.Marxism launched a constant and visible war on German heavy industry to turn itinto an international business. This could only be accomplished through thevictory of Marxism in the Revolution. As I write this, the attack has succeededagainst the German Government Railways, which are now being handed over toInternational financiers. This \"International Social Democracy\" has once moreaccomplished another of its great objectives.We can see how far this attempt to make \"economic animals\" of the German peoplesucceeded from the fact that after the war, one of the leading minds of Germanindustry, and especially of commerce, said that only economic improvement couldpossibly put Germany on her feet again. This nonsense was spouted at the sametime by France who was restoring the German education system, a \"humanitarian\"gesture, in order to promote the belief that the nation and the State owe theirsurvival to economics and not to eternal values. This remark of Stinnes (HugoStinnes, a German industrialist and politician of extensive wealth) regardingcommerce as the only savior for Germany caused incredible confusion. It waspicked up at once by all the babbling and idiotic bums Fate had unleashed onGermany as \"statesmen\" after the Revolution.One of the worst signs of decay in Germany before the war was the habit of doingeverything halfway. It comes from people being timid in their actions as well asfrom a cowardice growing out of this and other causes.The disease was made worse by the education system. German education before thewar had an extraordinary number of weaknesses. It was very one-sided and aimedto produce pure \"knowledge\" to the exclusion of teaching practical ability. Evenless value was attached to the development of individual character, at least asmuch as it is possible to teach character, and there was little encouragement tolearn responsibility and no cultivation at all of will and determination. Theresult was not to produce strong men but passive \"Polymaths\" (intellectuals whoknow a little about everything). This is how the world saw and treated Germansbefore the war (the First World War). The German man was popular because he wasvery useful as a result of his knowledge, but he was not respected because ofhis weak character. For this reason, he was the quickest of almost all peoplesto lose or forget his nationality of the Fatherland when he traveled outside thecountry. The common saying, \"He who travels with hat in hand can go the wholewidth of the land\" tells the entire story (meaning a man who is humble, humblyholds his hat in his hand, can go anywhere and be welcomed; the saying does notmean a beggar).This submissive nature became positively dangerous to the country when it wasused to determine how one could act in the presence of the Monarch. This social etiquette dictated that one never contradict the Monarch, butinstead must approve anything and everything His Majesty appeared to like.This was the very place where free expression of manly dignity was most neededand not subservience. The institution of the Monarchy would be destroyed by suchfalse flattery. Flattery is what it is and nothing more. It is suited for sorry,self-serving beings who are more interested in securing a place for themselvesin circles of royalty. This whole corrupt crew of flatterers always felt morecomfortable around the Royal thrones than among frank and honorable people. Withall their humility toward their Lord and meal ticket, these \"humble servants\" ofhis majesty have always displayed extreme arrogance towards other mortals. Thiswas especially true when they chose to display themselves to the other sinnersas the only true believers who supported the \"Monarchy\". This gross impertinencewas so extreme that it could only exist among the newly-nobled oryet-to-be-ennobled.These types of fellows have always been the gravediggers of a Monarchy andespecially patriarchal ideas. It could not have ended differently. A man who isready to stand up for his cause can never grovel in front of its representative.A man who is really serious about preserving and promoting his cause will clingto it with every fiber of his heart, and will never lose faith when hisrepresentative begins to show any faults or confusion. He will never run throughthe streets as the democratic \"friends\" of the Monarchy did, acting in anequally deceptive and backstabbing fashion. Instead, he will urgently andseriously warn the wearer of the Crown and try to convince him of the need toact. As a true believer in a cause, he will not and must not take the standpointthat His Majesty is free to act as he pleases, when he pleases, if he pleases,especially when his current course of action is clearly leading to disaster. Onthe contrary, the man of conviction will be forced in that case to protect theMonarchy against the Monarch itself at any personal risk. If the value of theMonarchy were limited to the person at the head---the Monarch at thatmoment---then one could not imagine a worse institution than a Monarchy. It istruly rare that monarchs are the flower of wisdom and reason or even ofcharacter, even though people may choose to pretend they are.Only the professional boot-lickers who win favor through flattery believe this,or at least pretend it is true. Upright men are the ones most valuable to theState and they cannot help but be repelled by the nonsense of such\"wise-monarchs\". For them, history is history and truth is truth, even wheremonarchs are concerned. The people are rarely fortunate enough to have a greatman as a great monarch and if they do, they must realize they are lucky that thecruelty of Fate has spared them from the absolute worst monarch.The value and meaning of the Monarchy concept cannot lie in the monarch himselfunless Heaven decides to put the crown on the brow of such an inspired hero asFrederick the Great or such a wise character as William I. Such leaders may findtheir way to the top once in centuries, but rarely more often. The idea of aMonarchy should be above the person, then the system exists totally in theinstitution. This means the monarch himself is one of those who must serve theMonarchy. He is but a wheel in the machine and must do his duty to it. He mustalso adjust to the office so he can follow the higher purpose. Therefore, thetrue \"monarchist\" is not the man who silently allows the wearer of the crown toviolate it, but prevents any violation. If the significance of the Monarchy werenot in the idea but in the \"sacred\" person who wears a crown, the establishmentof an obviously insane prince could never be questioned and he could never beremoved.It is necessary to establish this as a fact because lately, those figures whosesorry attitudes were in part to blame for the Monarchy's collapse have come outof hiding again. With a certain naive shamelessness, these people start talkingabout \"their King\". This is the same king they disgracefully deserted at acritical moment only a few years ago. Now they call anyone who refuses to joinin their chorus of lies a bad German. Yet these are the very same chicken-heartcowards who scattered and fled in 1918 to the red armband of Marxism. They lefttheir King to look out for himself as they hastily exchanged their sharp weaponfor a walking stick, put on neutral neckties, and vanished without a trace ortried to mix in among peaceable civilians. In an instant these royal championswere gone. It was only after the revolutionary hurricane had begun to die downthat they could shout \"Hail to the King, all Hail\". These \"servants andcounselors\" of the Crown begin to make a cautious appearance again but onlyafter others had suppressed the Revolution and taken a bloody nose for it. Now,they are all here again, gazing longingly at the luxurious life. They are oncemore filled with excitement, energy, and devotion for their King. At least untilthe day when the first red armband appears again and the whole crew of profitseekers from the old Monarchy once more scatters like mice from a cat! If themonarchs were not responsible themselves for these things, we could only pitythem heartily. But the monarchs themselves must realize that thrones can be lostwith knights such as these, but never won.Such slavish submission was a weakness of our whole system of education and theresults in this situation were especially disastrous. Thanks to it, these sorryfigures could maintain themselves at all the royal courts and graduallyundermine the foundation of the Monarchy. When the pillar started to shake, theentire structure collapsed and was gone with the wind. Naturally, belly crawlersand selfish flatterers are not going to wait to be killed for their master.Monarchs never see this and almost never bother to learn it; this has alwaysresulted in their ruin.One of the worst signs of this corruption was the growing cowardice. No onewanted to face responsibility for anything and the resulting weakness andindifference in dealing with the problems that resulted only accelerated thedownfall.The source of this epidemic is primarily in the parliamentary institution, whereirresponsibility is positively cultivated and nurtured. Unfortunately, thedisease slowly spreads to all life outside the Monarchy, especially togovernmental life. Everywhere, people started to dodge responsibility. To avoidany responsibility, they resorted to insufficient, ineffective, halfway measuresthat reduced their personal responsibility to a minimum.We only have to consider the attitude of the individual governments toward aseries of damaging occurrences in our public life, and we will easily recognizethe dreadful impact of this universal halfheartedness and fear ofresponsibility.I will cite only a few cases from the enormous number of examples known to me:Journalistic circles are particularly fond of describing the press as a \"greatpower\" in the State. Indeed, its importance is truly enormous. It simply cannotbe overestimated. It continues the education of adults which is important.Readers can be divided into three groups: Those who believe everything theyread; those who no longer believe anything they read; and those minds whichcritically examine what they read and then form their own judgments about theaccuracy of the information.The first group who believes everything they read is the largest and strongestbecause they are composed of the broad masses of the population.These great masses of the people represent the most simpleminded part of thenation. It cannot, however, be divided by occupation, only by general degrees ofintelligence. This group includes those who have not been born with the gift of,or trained for independent thinking and who believe anything which is printed inblack and white. This is partly because of inability and partly throughincompetence. This group also encompasses a class of lazy people who could thinkfor themselves, but who gratefully accept anything someone else has already putany thinking-effort into on the humble assumption that he worked hard for hisopinion so it must be right. All these groups represent the great mass of thepeople and the influence of the press on them will be enormous. Since they areunable or unwilling to weigh what is offered to them and evaluate it forthemselves, their approach to every daily problem is totally determined by howthey are influenced by others. This may be an advantage if their understandingis fed by serious and truth-loving persons, but it will be disastrous if theyare led by scoundrels and liars.In number, the second group who does not believe anything they read isconsiderably smaller. It is partially made up of those who once belonged to thefirst group of totalbelievers. Then, after continued disappointments, they haveswitched to the opposite extreme and now believe nothing in print. They hate allnewspapers and either do not read them at all, or fly into a rage over thecontents which they believe to be nothing but lies and deceptions. These peopleare very hard to deal with because they will always be suspicious, even of thetruth. They are useless when it comes to accomplishing any positive work.The third group who reads and evaluates for themselves is by far the smallest.It consists of those really fine minds, which have been educated and throughtraining or maybe are naturally capable of independent thinking. They try toform their own judgments on everything and they subject everything they read toa repeated, thorough scrutiny and further develop the implications and meaningfor themselves. They never look at a newspaper without mentally taking part inthe writing and then Mr. Writer's task is no easy one. Journalists have areserved, perhaps limited appreciation for such readers. To the members of thisthird group, the nonsense which a newspaper may choose to scribble is notdangerous or even significant. They have usually become accustomed in the courseof a lifetime to regard every journalist as a rogue who happens to sometimestell the truth. Unfortunately, the importance of these splendid figures is onlyin their intelligence and not in their number. There are too few of them to havea significant impact. It is unfortunate that during this age wisdom meansnothing and majority means everything! Today, when the voting ballots of themasses are final, the deciding factor is the highest number------that is thelargest group and this is the first group I discussed. This is the crowd of thesimpleminded or most gullible citizens.The State has a prime interest in preventing these people from falling into thehands of bad, ignorant, or evil-intentioned gurus. It is, therefore, the State'sduty to supervise their education and prevent any mischief from being performed.In doing so, the State must keep a particularly sharp eye on the press. Thepress' influence on such people is by far the strongest and most penetratingbecause it is exerted continuously and not just momentarily. It is thecontinuous, consistent repetition of this educational instruction that makes itenormously important. The State must also remember that all means must pointtowards the same end. It must not be misled by chatter about socalled \"freedomof the press\" into neglecting its duty. The State must never deprive or allowothers to deprive the nation of the nourishment it needs and can thrive on---thenourishment that is good and can accomplish good. The State must use ruthlessdetermination to keep control of this instrument of popular education and makecertain it is placed in the service of the State and the Nation.What was it that the German press fed people before the war? Wasn't it the mostvirulent poison imaginable? Wasn't the heart of our people injected with acutepacifism at a time when the rest of the world was preparing slowly but surely topounce on Germany? Even in peace time, didn't the German press fill the minds ofthe people with doubts about the just cause of its own State which reduced thechoice of weapons the State could select for defense from the very beginning?Wasn't it the German press which succeeded in offering the nonsense of \"WesternDemocracy\" in an appetizing way to our people, until at last, captured by allthe enthusiastic fluff, the people believed it could entrust its future to aLeague of Nations? (The League of Nations resulted from the Treaty of Versaillesafter the First World War and was meant to maintain peace.) Didn't it help bringa state of moral degradation upon our people? Didn't it portray morality anddecency as ridiculous, calling them old-fashioned and narrow-minded, until atlast our people renounced them to become \"modern?\" Didn't the continuous assaultby the press undermine the foundations of government authority until one pushwas enough to collapse the institution? Didn't the press oppose at every turnthe movement to give to the State that authority which is the State's, anddegrade the army by constant criticism, sabotage the universal military draft,and urge the refusal of military funding increases until eventually the campaignof the press was assured to be a success? The liberal press' activity dug thegrave of the German people and the German Empire. This does not even include thesmall Marxist lie-sheets which were handed out. They cannot live without lyingany more than a cat can live without catching mice. Their primary goal is tobreak the national backbone of the people in order to prepare it for the burdenof international financiers and their master, the Jew.What did the State do against this mass poisoning of the nation? Nothing,nothing at all. A few ridiculous rules, a few sentences about not being tooviolent, not being too evil, and that was all. They took no serious actionbecause they hoped to win the favor of this pest by flattery, by recognizing the\"value\" of the press, its \"importance\", its \"educational mission\", and othersuch nonsense. All of this the Jews accepted with a sly smile, giving deviousthanks in return.This shameful powerless display by the State was not so much due to its failureto recognize the danger as it was to a cowardice that cried to Heaven for reliefand the resulting halfhearted effort behind every decision. No one had thecourage to use a radical remedy that would completely solve the problem. Here,as everywhere, people fooled around with weak half-cures. Instead of stabbingthe heart of the problem, they merely provoked the viper.This resulted in the countermeasures staying the same, but the power of thegroups that should be combated grew from year to year.The resistance of the German government in those days against the mostly Jewishpress, which was slowly corrupting the nation, lacked any direct determination,and above all, it had no visible goal. The officials completely failed tounderstand the situation because they did not properly estimate the importanceof the struggle and failed to choose the means to combat the problem. They didnot create a definite plan. They tinkered aimlessly, and sometimes, if they werebitten too hard, they would lock up one of these journalistic vipers for a fewweeks or months, but the snakes' nest itself was left undisturbed.This was partly the result of the endless, crafty tactics of Jewry on one sideand a stupidity or naivety on the other. The Jew was far too shrewd to allow asimultaneous attack to occur against the entire press. Then when one part of thepress was attacked, the other members would give cover to protect theirstronghold. The Marxists were taking the field in the lowest way possible toattack and revile all that man holds sacred and wickedly attacking both Stateand government, and setting social classes of the people against each other. TheJewish propaganda newspapers, which were aimed at the privilegedclass, knewexactly how to make themselves appear to be the heralds of objectivity andcarefully avoided all strong language. They knew that the empty-headed can onlyjudge what is on the outside and are never able to look deeper; avoiding stronglanguage concealed their true message by hiding it in a pretty box. So, forthem, the value of something is measured by the exterior instead of by thesubstance, a human weakness that the press has carefully studied and understandswell.For such empty-headed people, the Frankfurter Zeitung (the Frankfurt Newspaper,a German newspaper in Frankfurt which openly supported the Treaty of Versailles) was and is the very essence of \"decency\". It never uses rude language, opposesall physical brutality, and urges war only with \"intellectual\" weapons, whichoddly enough is always the favorite idea of the most unintelligent people. Thisis a result of our halfway education system, which teaches students to separatethemselves from natural instincts and pumps them full of certain informationwithout leading them to the ultimate knowledge or true understanding. Diligenceand good intentions alone are useless if they fail to provide the necessaryunderstanding of what is being taught. This final combination of intelligenceand natural instinct is indispensable. Ultimate knowledge consists ofintellectually understanding the causes which are already instinctivelyperceived.Man must never be so misguided that he believes he has ascended to the positionof lord and master over Nature. The conceit of half-education has made men thinkthis illusion is possible. He must understand the fundamental law of necessityrules in Nature's domain, and realize how completely his existence is subject tothese laws of eternal battle and the struggle for dominance. Only with thisunderstanding will he see that in a universe where planets revolve aroundgreater suns, moons revolve about their greater planets, where the strong aremasters over the weak; there can be no separate law for mankind. Man must besubject to these laws or be crushed by them. This supreme wisdom must dominateman. He can try to understand these principles, but he can never free himselffrom them.It is for those who choose to be kept, like a seedy harem among the followers ofthis press, that the Jew writes his socalled newspapers he writes for that\"intelligent\" reader. The Frankfurter Zeitung (Frankfurter News) and theBerliner Tageblatt (The Berlin Daily, a major liberal newspaper in Berlin) aremade for this intellectual crowd because their tone is chosen so that it speaksto them and influences these people the most. Carefully avoiding any seemingharshness and never speaking in a crude manner, they nevertheless pour theirpoison into the hearts of their readers by other means. With a steady flow ofpretty words and phrases, they lull their readers into believing that theselovely words are a fountain of knowledge and moral principles which are pouringfrom their pages. In truth, theirs is the brilliant and crafty art of disarmingany enemy who might oppose the Jews and their press. As one group of newspapersdrips with decency, the half-wit followers are all the more ready to believethat the other newspapers speak the same truth only in a slightly more crudefashion. It is a question of degree. The offenses of one group does not seem asserious or extreme when compared to this journal of \"decency\". These abuses thenappear to be small, and being of such a perceived minor nature, would never leadto any restriction upon \"freedom of the press\". That is the loophole that allowssuch newspapers to escape legal punishment for this harmful poisoning and lyingto the people. Therefore, the government hesitates to take action against thesejournalistic bandits for fear they will immediately have the \"decent\" press lineup against them too. This fear is well founded. The moment anyone attempts totake action against one of these scandal sheets, all the others immediately rushto its defense. It is not because they approve of its method of fighting, Heavenforbid. It is said to be a matter of freedom-of-the-press and a matter of freeexpression of public opinion. That alone is what is being defended. Even thestrongest men will fall down, weakened under this uproar, because the outcrycomes entirely from the mouths of \"decent\" newspapers.This poison was allowed to enter and do its work in the blood stream of ourpeople without interference and without the State exercising the strength neededto control the disease. In the ridiculous half-measures it employed, one couldsee the pending downfall of the Empire. An institution, which is no longerdetermined to protect itself with every available weapon, has effectivelysurrendered its existence. Every halfhearted act is a visible sign of innerdecay which will eventually be followed by outward collapse.I believe that the present generation, with proper guidance, will more easilyconquer the danger. This generation has gone through various experiences whichhave strengthened the nerves of everyone who did not lose their nervealtogether. In the days to come, the Jew will raise a terrible protest in hisnewspapers when a hand is laid on his favorite den to stop his journalisticmischief, and the press is set to work as a means of forming public opinionthrough education for the State. This valuable messenger can no longer be leftin the hands of aliens and enemies of the people. This necessary action will notdisturb us younger men as much as it would have our fathers. A ten-inch shellhissing overhead is louder than a thousand Jewish newspaper snakes. Let thevipers hiss! Another example of weakness and halfhearted actions on the part ofthe government of pre-war Germany concerning the most important questions to thenation is this: For many years a horrible physical poisoning of the people hasrun its course along side the political and moral infection of the citizens.Syphilis began to spread in the large cities, while tuberculosis gathered itsharvest of death almost uniformly throughout the country."},{"pageContent":"In both cases, the effects on the nation were horrible yet the government couldnot make a decision to take action and stop them. Toward syphilis, the attitudeof the State and racefocused leaders can only be described as absolutesurrender. Any serious attempt at stamping it out needed to go farther thananything that was actually done. The invention of a questionable remedy and itscommercial exploitation did little good against this disease. Here, too, theonly possibility was a fight---a fight against the cause, not the removal of thesymptoms. The primary cause is our prostitution of love. The mixing of blood(mixing of races) through prostitution is the corruption. Even if it did notresult in this disease of nature, it would still damage the people morally.The devastation that follows this perversion is enough to lead our people slowlybut surely to ruin. This Judaism of our soul by commercializing our naturalinstinct will sooner or later corrupt our future generations. Instead ofvigorous, emotionally healthy children, we will have only the sorry products ofa quick financial deal for selfish pleasure. Financial considerations havebecome the foundation and sole requirement for marriage. The result is that lovelooks elsewhere to find itself.Man may defy Nature for a certain length of time, but eventually she will callher due, and payback will come. When man recognizes this truth, it is often toolate.We can see in our noble class the disastrous results of long and continuedneglect of the natural fundamentals for marriage. Nobility are paired accordingto their status and how the marriage can improve their standing. We observe theconsequences of a reproduction which is focused partly on social pressure andpartly on financial considerations. One leads to general weakening, the other toblood-poisoning because any Jewish daughter of a department store owner isthought good enough because they can increase the standing of His Grace'sdescendants financially. Even the privilegedclasses now follow this example. Inboth cases, complete degeneration is the result.With no concern for the consequences, people ignore this unpleasant truth as ifignoring it would make the problem go away. No, our metropolitan population isprostituting its love life more and more, and growing numbers are falling victimto the plague of syphilis. This fact will not disappear if we close our eyes toit. It is there. The clearest results of this mass sickness can be found in theinsane asylums, and, unfortunately, in our children. Children in particular arethe sad products of the poisoning of our sexual life. In the sickness of thechildren we see the immoral habits of the parents.There are various ways people deal with this unpleasant, horrible fact. Somepeople see nothing at all, or rather choose to see nothing. This is by far thesimplest and cheapest \"attitude\". Others wrap themselves in the saintly garmentsof a prude and pretend to have modesty, which is nothing but a deception. Theyspeak of the whole subject as if they were talking about a great sin, andexpress profound righteous anger toward every sinner who is caught. They closetheir eyes in self-righteous loathing to this godless plague, and pray to thegood Lord that He will pour fire and brimstone upon this Sodom and Gomorrah tomake an example, preferably not before their own natural death of course. Thiswould then provide an educational lesson to the rest of shameless humanity. Athird group sees the awful consequences which this plague can and will somedaybring with it, but they merely shrug their shoulders, convinced that they can donothing against the coming danger. They stand aside and allow events to runtheir course.All of these people choose the simple and easy path. The problem is that suchapathy will have fatal consequences for the nation. The excuse that othernations are no better off will make little difference when our nation is the oneto fall. The only benefit to that claim is the sympathy toward others makes ourown misfortune slightly more bearable. The most important question is whichnation will step forward and defeat the epidemic, and which nations will submitand be smothered by it. That is what it comes down to in the end. This is just ameasure of racial excellence, a test of racial values. The race that cannotstand the test will simply die and make room for healthier, stronger races whichcan endure hardships more easily. Since this question primarily concerns futuregenerations, it is about them that it is said with such frightening truth: \"Thesins of the fathers will be visited on the tenth generation\" (paraphrased fromDeuteronomy 23:2 and Exodus 20:5).This holds true only for crimes against blood and race. The sin against bloodand race is the original sin of this world and it will bring the end of anyhumanity which surrenders to it.The attitude of pre-war Germany concerning this one question was truly sad! Whatdid they do to stop the infection of our young people in the great cities? Whatwas done to attack the disease and selfish commercialization of our love life?What was done to combat the spread of syphilis that resulted? The easiest way tofind the answer is to point out what should have happened.The question should not have been taken so casually. Authorities should haveunderstood that a solution, or lack of a solution, would impact the happiness orunhappiness of generations to come. The existence of a solution might decide thefuture of our people. To admit this would have required action. Action wouldhave meant the enactment of ruthless measures and intervention efforts. Theconviction and attention of the whole nation should be concentrated on thisdreadful threat first, above any other consideration, so that every individualwould be aware of the importance of the struggle.Imposing obligations of character can be difficult to implement unless thepublic is thoroughly instructed on the importance. This commitment would requireobligations and burdens which are necessary and sometimes hard to manage. Theseobligations can only be universally effective if the individual is made to feelthe need as well as the motivation to carry them out. This requires a tremendousprocess of explanation, and any other problems that arise from day to day wouldhave to be put in the background.In every case where there appear to be impossible demands on the nation, thefull attention of a people must exclusively be concentrated on this one questionat hand without distraction. It should be approached as if the existence ornonexistence of everyone actually depended on its solution. Only then willpeople's emotions be stimulated to such a pitch that they become willing andable to voluntarily accomplish great achievements and efforts.This principle also holds true for the individual if he wishes to accomplishgreat things. He can accomplish great goals only by taking one step at a time.He must concentrate all his efforts on the accomplishment of a certain limitedtask, and he must not waiver to another task or weaken in his resolve until ithas been achieved, and only then can the next stage be attacked. The man whocannot divide up the road into individual stages and work towards achieving eachstep, one at a time, by focusing all his energy, can never reach his finaldestination. Instead he will fall somewhere along the road or veer off the trackentirely. This process of working toward an objective is an art and demandssupreme effort at every stage in order to cover the entire distance step bystep.The very first requirement in attacking such a difficult stretch of the humanroad is for the leadership to present the immediate, partial goal, which must beachieved as the one and only goal, which should be considered or given anyattention, and the outcome must be presented as if it will decide everythingabout their existence. The great mass of the people can never see the entirelong road in front of them without becoming tired or weary and falling intodespair before giving up. They may see their longterm goal in the far distanceahead, but they only recognize the immediate goal as they follow the path onesection at a time. It is like the traveler who knows his destination, but canonly make the long trip when he divides it up into sections and attacks each oneas if it were his only journey. This is the only way he can maintain hisdetermination to reach the ultimate objective without losing faith in hisability to achieve the final goal.Every type of propaganda should have been used to fight syphilis. It should havebeen presented as the main and most important responsibility of the nation, notjust as a task. For this purpose, its ill effects should have been hammered intopeople by every available method and shown as the most awful of all disastersuntil the whole nation became convinced that future depended a solution to thisproblem. They must be faced with the unavoidable choice between a healthy futureor absolute national decay. This kind of education and preparation should havecontinued for years if necessary. Only then will the attention and thedetermination of all of the people be aroused to such a level that even severemeasures involving great sacrifice can be used without danger of beingmisunderstood or suddenly neglected by the masses. Everyone must know thatenormous sacrifices and equally enormous efforts are necessary in attacking thisplague.A successful battle against syphilis requires a battle against prostitution,against prejudices, against old customs, against preexisting ideas, and againstpublic opinion, such as the false pretense of extreme modesty in certaincircles.Before the State can claim any moral right to attack these things, it must allowand encourage people to marry earlier. (At this time in Germany, women couldmarry at age 18 but men could not marry until age 21, Many also waited untillater in life to marry.) Allowing marriages to only take place for oldergenerations forces us to preserve a system that is dysfunctional and causesshame to humanity. The custom of late marriage, which causes so much trouble, isa creature that misrepresents itself as the \"image\" of God.Prostitution is a disgrace to humanity, but it cannot be abolished by morallectures or pious intentions. Its restriction and eventual disappearancepresumes the removal of a whole series of preexisting causes. The first of theseis to make early marriage possible, particularly for the man so he can fulfillthe dictates of his human nature. As for the woman, she is only a passive partyin the matter.We can see how misguided and totally confused some people have become when wehear mothers in socalled \"proper\" society say they would be thankful to findtheir daughter a husband who has \"already sown his wild oats\". There is noshortage of this type of man either. So the poor girl is sure to find such aSigfried, stripped of his protective skin, for a husband, and the children willbe the visible result of this \"wise\" marriage. (Siegfried refers to the Wagneropera character and his invulnerable skin. The reference means the husband hasbeen compromised, his protection weakened, his strength gone, and he is not atrue man any longer.) When we consider that procreation in itself is reduced bythese actions, we see that natural selection takes no part since every creaturethat is produced, no matter how sorry, must be preserved due to its scarcity.There is only one question left to ask: Why do we allow such a convolutedmarriage institution to exist at all, and what is its purpose supposed to be?How is this type of marriage different from prostitution? Does duty to futuregenerations no longer count at all? Or do people not know what curses they areinflicting on their children and their children's children by such criminalfailure to maintain the rights and duty of Nature? Following this path is howcivilized nations deteriorate and gradually perish.Not even marriage can be an end in itself. It must serve the greater purpose ofincreasing and preserving the species and race. That alone is its meaning andits purpose.Knowing this, we see the quality of marriage can only be measured by the waythat it fulfills that purpose. For this reason, early marriage is good. Theyoung couple will still have the vigor which alone can produce strong andhealthy children. To encourage earlier marriages, a whole series of socialchanges are necessary. Without these changes, we cannot imagine early marriagesbeing possible. The solution to even this small question cannot take placewithout radical and heroic social changes. This need is especially importanttoday when the incompetence of the socalled \"Social\" Republic in solving thehousing shortage and has prevented many marriages, which in turn assisted thespread of prostitution. The wage levels are nonsense.Paychecks fail to consider what is required to support a family. Low wages makesmany early marriages impossible. A real attack on prostitution can be made onlyby reforming social conditions to make earlier marriage possible. This is thevery first essential requirement for a solution to this prostitution problem.In the second place, education and training among the youth will have toeliminate a whole series of evils and false ideas that no one has worried aboutbefore. Above all, a balance must be struck in education between intellectualinstruction and physical development. What is called a Gymnasium or secondaryschool today is a mockery of the Greek school it was supposedly modeled after.We have completely forgotten in education that in the long run, a sound mind canonly live in a sound body. If one takes into consideration the great masses of apeople, this statement is clearly true with only a few exceptions. Before theFirst World War in Germany, absolutely no attention was paid to this truth.People simply continued sinning against the body while believing that trainingonly the \"mind\" guaranteed the greatness of the nation. This was a mistake andthe results were felt sooner than expected. It was not by accident that theBolshevist wave found a place to grow and develop where the population haddeteriorated through hunger and longterm conditions resulting frommalnourishment. This is common in Central Germany, Saxony, and the Ruhrdistrict. There has been no serious resistance, even from the socalled\"intellects\", to this Jewish disease in any of these districts. The simplereason for this is that the intellects are physically unhealthy as a result ofeducation and not hardship or starvation. The approach intellectuals take whenthey focus exclusively on education in the upper classes makes them incapable ofsurviving during times when the strong arm, and not the mind, makes the decisivestrike. Physical ailments are usually the precursor to personal cowardice.Excessive emphasis on purely mental training and the neglect of physicaldevelopment only promotes the risk of sexual thoughts much too early in youth.The boy who has been strengthened by sport and gymnastics is less subject to theneed for physical indulgence than is the bookworm fed exclusively on mentalnourishment. This is something a sensible education system has to consider. Itmust also not forget that the healthy young man's expectations of a woman aredifferent from those of a prematurely corrupted weakling. Education and classtime should be scheduled so that a boy's free time is used to strengthen hisbody. During these years, he has no right to loaf around or make a nuisance ofhimself in the streets and movies houses.After his day's other work, he must strengthen his young body like steel so thatwhen life puts him to the test, it will not find him too delicate. It is theresponsibility of those educating youth to prepare their bodies and not justpour knowledge or socalled wisdom in their heads. This system must also sweepaway the impression that the responsibility of training one's own body should beleft to the individual. There can be no such thing as allowing the freedom ofchoice to sin against posterity and therefore against the race.Along with physical training, the fight against poisoning the soul must begin.Today, our society is like a garden where sexual fantasies and stimulations arenourished and forced to grow. When we look at the selection of our movies,theaters, and vaudeville houses, it is obvious that these are not providing theproper examples for anyone and especially not for young people. In store windowsand on posters, the lowest, most vulgar methods are used to attract theattention of the crowd. Anyone who has not lost the ability to recall their ownadolescence can see that this trash will do serious damage to young people. Thisseductive, sensual, physical atmosphere generates fantasies and stirrings in theheads of boys which they should not even know about. We can study the results ofthis sort of filth-education in the youth of today and the result is notpleasant. Our youth have matured too quickly which has made them prematurelyold. The courts sometimes remind the public ear of this danger and give horribleinsights into the spiritual life of our fourteen and fifteen-year-olds. How cananyone be surprised that syphilis has begun to pick its victims at that age?Isn't it a crying shame to see a physically weak and spiritually undone youngman receive his introduction to the mysteries of marriage through some big-citywhore? No, he who seeks to strike at the root of prostitution must first removeits spiritual cause. He must sweep out the garbage of our moral infection ofcity \"culture\" and do so mercilessly without wavering when the protests andscreaming start from the outcry that will surely follow. If we do not lift youthfrom the disgusting mess of its present surroundings, it will sink deeper intothat filth. The man who refuses to see these things is supporting them, andthrough his inaction he assumes a share of the guilt for the slow prostitutionof our future which grows in the coming generation. This purification of ourculture must expand into almost every area. Theater, art, literature, cinema,press, advertisements, and store windows must have the pollution which isrotting our world removed, and they must be forced into the service of a moralidea of State and culture. Public life must be free from the overpoweringperfume of eroticism and also of all unmanly elements and false prudishness. Inall these things, the goal and road to that goal must be carefully consideredthen set in stone for the preservation of our people's health in body and soul.The right of personal freedom is secondary to the duty of preserving the race.Only when these educational measures are complete can the medical assault on thedisease itself begin and still have some chance of success.There can be no halfway measures. We have to make the most serious and mostradical decisions. It would be a half-measure to allow those who cannot be curedthe chance to infect others who are in good health. This sort of humanenessavoids causing suffering to one individual while it sends a hundred to thedamnation of death. It must be made impossible for diseased persons to produceequally defective children. This requirement is simply common sense. This wouldbe humanity's most humane deed if it were consistently carried out. It will savemillions of unfortunate souls from undeserved suffering and in the end, lead toan overall improvement in national health. The determination to proceed withthis plan will also halt the further spread of venereal diseases. We may have toresort to harsh segregation of those who cannot be cured. This is a savagemeasure, especially for the unhappy victim of the disease, but it is a blessingfor the rest of the country and for posterity. The temporary suffering of onecentury can and will free thousands of future generations from suffering.The battle against syphilis and its distributor, prostitution, is one ofhumanity's greatest tasks. It is enormous because it does not involve just onesingle solution, but the removing a series of evils which lead this disease intothe veins of our society. The disease of the body is simply the result ofdiseased moral, social, and racial instincts.If this battle is not fought because of laziness or cowardice, imagine what thenation will look like in five hundred years. There will only be a few men leftin God's image, the rest will be a blasphemy against the Almighty.How did people try, in the old Germany, to deal with this disease? Calmconsideration returns a truly sad answer. The havoc caused by the disease wasknown to the government, though they may not have fully comprehended itsconsequences. In fighting it, they were a complete failure, and instead ofmaking thorough reforms, they preferred to resort to miserable and ineffectivecontrols. They concentrated their efforts on fixing the results of the diseaseand left the causes alone. They subjected the individual prostitute to medicalexaminations and supervised her as well as they could. If disease wasdiscovered, they shoved her into some hospital and when she no longer showedsigns of disease, she was once more let loose on mankind.The government did introduce \"protective legislation\". According to this law,anyone who had venereal disease or who was not entirely cured was prohibitedfrom engaging in sexual intercourse under penalty of law. This in itself was aproper measure, but when it came to implementing the plan, it was almost acomplete failure. When the woman suffers such a misfortune, in most cases shewill probably refuse to be dragged into court as a witness against the miserablepoisoner who corrupted her health. This can be the result of her limitededucation or understanding of the system and often can result in the answeringof hurtful or embarrassing questions. The woman is the one who benefits theleast. In most cases, she will suffer the worst anyway.The hatred of her unkind neighbors will fall on her much more heavily than itwould with a man. Finally, imagine her position if the carrier of the disease isher own husband. Is she to bring a complaint against him or what else is she todo? In the case of the man, he may encounter this disease when he is drunk. Inthat condition, he is the least able to judge the quality of his \"beautifulone\".The diseased prostitute realizes this stupor only too well and they have learnedto fish for men in this ideal state. The result is that no matter how theunpleasantly surprised man may later rack his brains, he cannot remember hiskind-hearted benefactor's name or face. This is scarcely surprising in a bigcity like Berlin or even Munich. The prostitute's catch is often anunsophisticated visitor from the provinces who is confused and bewildered by themagic charms of a great city.Ultimately, who can tell whether he is infected or healthy? There are many caseswhere a person appears cured and then has a relapse and does the most dreadfuldamage without even realizing it. The result of this legal penalty for the actof infection is actually zero. The same is true of control overprostitutes---even the value of the cure is still uncertain and it may not evenwork. Only one thing is sure: all of these measures have failed to keep thedisease from spreading. This is the most conclusive proof of the ineffectivenessof these measures. Everything that was done was inadequate and ridiculous. Thespiritual prostitution of the people continued and nothing was done to stop it.If anyone is inclined to take this matter casually, let him study the statisticson the spread of this disease. Compare its growth in the last hundred years andimagine where it will go from here. He must be as simpleminded as a donkey if hedoes not have an unpleasant shiver running down his spine when faced with thesefacts. The weakness and halfhearted attitude adopted, even in old Germany,toward this terror is a visible sign of our people's decay.When the courage no longer exists to fight for one's own health, the right tostruggle in this life is at an end. True strength belongs to the vigorous\"whole\" man and not to the weak \"half\" man.One of the clearest signs of decay in the old Empire was the slow decline inculture and I do not mean civilization. Civilization seems to be more of anenemy who raises the standard of living and woos the mind. Even before the turnof the century, a previously unknown element began to intrude into our art. Evenin earlier days, there were sometimes offenses against good taste, but thesewere rather artistic eccentricities to which future generations could at leastattach a certain historical value. Then came products of degeneration to thepoint of senselessness, not in art, but in the spirit. These were cultural signsof the political collapse which became clearly visible later.The Bolshevism of art is the only possible cultural form of life andintellectual expression that Bolshevism is capable of.Anyone who thinks this is unclear or strange need only look around those\"fortunate\" Bolshevized States. This official and State-recognized art is lookedat with horror. I speak of morbid disfigurements produced by lunatics anddegenerates which we have become acquainted with since the turn of the centuryas Cubism and Dadaism (these were abstract types of art using distorted images;however, the content especially of Dadaist art was often an attack onNationalists; it promoted pacifism and was often political in nature). Evenduring the short life of the Council's Republic in Bavaria (Marxist control inBavaria), this phenomenon began to appear. One could see how all the officialposters and propaganda cartoons in the newspapers bore the stamp of politicaland cultural decay.Sixty years ago, a political collapse as extensive as we are now experiencingwould have been unthinkable. Equally unthinkable would have been a culturalcollapse like we see in Futurist and Cubist art creations. Sixty years ago, anexhibition of socalled Dada type \"experiences\" would have been absolutelyimpossible and its promoters would have been sent to the insane asylum. And yettoday, they are made presidents of art associations. This disease could not havemade its appearance at that time because public opinion would not have toleratedit, nor would the State have sat idly by. It is the responsibility of governmentto prevent its people from being driven into the arms of intellectual insanity.Today we would see complete intellectual madness if this type of art had beenaccepted. On the day that this sort of art was accepted and found its place inharmony with the public senses, that would be the most momentous and horribletransformations of mankind that would ever occur. The human brain would regressfrom normality, which would lead to an end that could hardly be imagined.If we review the last twenty-five years of our cultural life from thisstandpoint, we would be horrified to see how far we have already declined.Everywhere we look, we find seeds that sooner or later grow and destroy ourcivilization. Here is where we see the symptoms of the decay. We see a slowlyrotting world. Woe to the nations who can no longer master this disease and failto halt its spread! Such disturbed thought processes could be seen throughoutart and culture in Germany. Everything seemed to have passed its prime and to beaccelerating toward the abyss. The theater declined visibly and would probablyhave disappeared as a cultural factor even earlier if the Royal Court theatershad not stood their ground against the prostitution of art. Aside from them anda few other praiseworthy exceptions, the offerings of the theater stage was insuch a shambles that patrons would have benefited more if they quit attendingcompletely. It was a sorry sign of inner decay that one was no longer allowed tosend young people to most of these alleged \"shrines of art\". This decline wasopenly admitted with shameless candor in the warning signs seen outside cinemaswhich proclaimed \"for adults only\".Remember that such cautionary signs were hung outside the very places whichshould have existed primarily for the education of young people and should notexist for the amusement of sophisticated adults. What would the great dramatistsof past ages have said about the need for this kind of regulation and to thedeplorable conditions which made it necessary? How Schiller (meaning FriedrichSchiller: German poet, philosopher, historian, and dramatist) would have blazed!How Goethe (meaning Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, a German writer and scientist)would have turned away in disgust! How do Schiller, Goethe, or Shakespearecompare to the heroes of modern German literature? Old, thread-bare, and wornout, actually you can say they have been discarded. In this age you only see theproduction of filth, but it does not stop with its own creations. In addition,this generation slandered everything truly great from the past. This is, ofcourse, not an unusual historic occurrence. The more vile and contemptible theproducts of an age and its men are, the more they despise and disparage theachievements of past greats. These people would prefer to destroy mankind'smemory of these past works so they could eliminate any chance that their ownfilthy spatters might be compared to true greats. Only by removing this standardfor comparison can they make their own trash appear to be \"art\".The more despicable and wretched a new movement is, the more it will try toextinguish every last trace of the past. Any truly innovative movement that isfor the benefit of mankind will stand undisturbed beside the achievements ofpast generations. The existence of the monuments or great works of the past willenhance and encourage the acceptance of the modern productions if they areworthy. In fact, comparison with the greats may even show for the first time thefull value of these new products. True quality works have no reason to fear thatthey will fade when compared to works of the past.A new work contributes to the general fund of human culture by preserving thememory of earlier achievements, and only through that history can its own valuebe fully recognized. This history assures the full understanding of the newadvance by its audience. He who has nothing of value to give the world and triesto pass off Heaven knows what as art will hate all existing contributions, whichhave value and will seek to oppose or even destroy them.This is not just true of new cultural developments, but it applies in politicsas well. New revolutionary movements will despise and discredit older movements.The more worthless they are, the more they will attack the past movements. Herewe can see how the desire to make one's own trash seem great, and how it canlead to blind hatred of past superior movements. As long as Frederick theGreat's historical memory has not died out, Frederick Ebert (the first presidentof the Weimar period) will never achieve more than moderate admiration. When wecompare the former Bremen saloon-keeper (meaning Ebert, who was actually asaddle maker before coming into politics but kept bar at meetings; thisreference is also made later) to the hero of Sans Souci (location of the summerpalace built by and burial place of Fredrick the Great) it is like comparing thesun to the moon. Only after the rays of the sun are gone does the moon shine,and then they only shine as a result of the sun. All new moons of humanity havea deep hatred for the fixed stars which shine on their own. If Fate throws oneof these nobodies into temporary leadership, they immediately dishonor andslander the past with diligent enthusiasm. Blaming the past leaders for problemson their watch takes them out of the line of fire for public criticism. As anexample, we can look at the Legislation to Protect the Republic which was passedin the new German Reich.If some new idea, doctrine, new WorldConcept , or political or economic movementtries to deny the accomplishments of the past by calling it bad and worthless,we must be extremely careful and suspicious, and we must question their reasonfor such slander. This hatred sprouts from its own worthlessness or because itstrue intention is to cause harm. A truly productive movement will always beginto build on the spot where the last good foundation stopped. They will not beashamed of using those truths which already exist as their cornerstone. All ofhuman culture and man himself are only the product of one long continuousdevelopment in which each generation has added a new stone to the structure. Thepurpose of revolution is not to tear down the whole building, but to remove onlythose parts, which are poorly attached or unsuitable for their purpose and tobuild a better structure onward and upward from the spot that is left bare.Today we can talk about the progress of mankind because it is built on pastaccomplishments. Otherwise, the world would never be rescued from chaos and eachgeneration would reject the past and destroy its works to make way for thecreations of the new generation.The saddest thing about the condition of our German civilization before the warwas not only the absolute weakness of artistic and cultural creative power, buthow the memory of a greater past was polluted, befouled, and smothered byhatred. At the turn of the century (1900), in almost every area of art,particularly in theater and literature, people began to defame the best of theold, saying it was inferior and worn out. They were more interested in trashingthe old works than in creating new works. This was a disgraceful and inferiorera that was unable to produce anything new or significant and had no right tobelittle the great works! Their striving to put the past out of sight of thepresent revealed plainly and distinctly the evil intent of these apostles of thefuture. People should have been able to see this was not a matter of somethingnew, even if it was wrong. It was part of a process meant to destroy thefoundation of our civilization.The confusion that then surrounded what was previously a healthy art communitymade it possible to lay the intellectual groundwork for political Bolshevism. Ifthe Age of Pericles was embodied in the Parthenon, the Bolshevist era wasembodied in the travesty of the Cubist grimace.At this point we must focus our attention on the cowardice among those of ourpeople who, by virtue of their education and position, had the responsibility ofstanding firm against this cultural outrage. They chose to avoid a confrontationon the chance the Bolshevists might raise a commotion.The Bolshevist art-apostles violently attacked everyone who failed to recognizethem as the peak of creation, branding opponents as old-fashioned and aPhilistine. No one would stand up against these Bolshevist art-apostles out offear. They surrendered themselves to what seemed to be the inevitable.These people trembled, frightened that they might be accused of being simpleminded or worse, lacking artistic appreciation by these half-lunatics or fraudsas if it were a disgrace not to understand the products of these mentaldegenerates or sly imitators! These apostles of culture did have one very simpleway to stamp their nonsense with the illusion of high quality and greatness. Alltheir incomprehensible and obviously insane garbage was presented to anopen-mouthed public and labeled as what they called an \"inner experience\". Inthis cheap method, they kept the people's criticism silent.Of course, no one had the slightest doubt that these inner experiences could befrom their Bolshevist minds. However, one must seriously doubt that there couldbe any justification for exposing the hallucinations of crazy men or criminalsto the healthy minded public. The works of a Moritz von Schwind (an Austrianpainter born in Vienna who painted highly detailed, realistic works) or aBöcklin (Arnold Böcklin, a Swiss painter known for Mythology and Renaissancestyles who later influenced Surrealistic painters) were inner experiences too,but these were the experiences of artists favored by Heaven, not clowns. Thiswas a fine demonstration of the pitiful spinelessness of our socalledintellectuals who did not resist this poisoning of our people's sound instinctsand left it to the people to formulate their opinion about this disrespectfulnonsense. To avoid being considered artistically illiterate, people accepted anymockery of art and eventually became unsure in their own judgment. They could nolonger determine what was good or bad. Taken together, these were signs of anevil time to come.Another suspicious sign is the following: In the nineteenth century, our citiesbegan to lose their character as centers of culture and declined into mere humansettlements. The working class has a very small emotional connection to theplace where they live. This is because their living quarters is an accidentalabode, a collection of people in a place and nothing more. This is mostlybecause they must frequently move due to social conditions and a man has no timeto develop a close relation to his city. Another cause is the general culturalinsignificance and the poverty of modern cities themselves.At the time of the Wars of Liberation ( part of the Napoleonic Wars 1813-14),German cities numbered very few and those were small. Most of the really bigcities were royal residences which gave them a certain cultural value andusually a definite artistic impression. The few towns of more than fiftythousand inhabitants were rich in treasures of science and art compared tocities of the same population today. When Munich reached sixty thousand inpopulation, it was already on its way to being one of the leading German artcenters. By now, almost every factory town has reached that size or larger, butoften without having the slightest elements of true value to call its own. Theyare collections of tenement houses and dwellings that are like barracks andnothing more. It is no wonder why the people do not become emotionally attachedto the meaningless place where they live. No one is going to be particularlyattached to a city which offers nothing more than any other city and which lacksany individuality and where everything that might so much as resemble art hasbeen painstakingly avoided.If this were not enough, as the population increases, the number of artworksdwindle. They seem more and more to have been suppressed down to a level whereart appears to be dead. The larger cities have the same look as apoverty-stricken little factory town, just on a larger scale. Modern times haveadded almost nothing to the cultural substance of our great cities. All ourcities are living on the glory and the treasures of the past. Take everythingaway from present-day Munich, everything that was created under Ludwig I, andyou will be horrified to see how little remains. (Ludwig the First is well knownfor creating a cultural center in Munich of great classical architecture.)Almost nothing has been produced since that time. The same thing is true ofBerlin and most of the other great cities.Here is the essential point. Our modern great cities have no monuments toweringabove the skyline that represent symbols of the whole age. In the old cities ofantiquity, almost every town had some special monument to show its pride. Thecharacteristic feature of each city was not the private buildings, but themonuments of glory to the community. These were not created for the moment butfor eternity because they were intended to reflect the greatness and importanceof the community instead of the wealth of an individual owner. These monumentswere calculated to bind citizens to their own city in a way which sometimesseems incomprehensible to us today. Visitors did not see the shabby houses ofprivate owners but the splendid structures of the whole community. Bycomparison, individual homes were only of a secondary importance, actuallytrivial.It is necessary to compare the size of ancient public buildings with the privatehouses of their time to understand the overwhelming force and impact of thisemphasis on the public structures. These buildings were given first place aheadof all others. What we admire today among a few remaining giants rising from therubbish-heaps and ruins of the ancient world, are not former commercial palaces,but temples of the gods and government buildings.These buildings were owned by the community. Even in late Rome, it was not thevillas and palaces of individual citizens that were most important, but thetemples and baths, the stadiums, the circuses, bridges, and cathedrals of thestate, of the whole people.Even the Germanic Middle Ages maintained the same guiding principle, thoughtheir approach to art was entirely different from the Romans. What had beenexpressed in the Acropolis or the Pantheon now took on the form of the Gothiccathedral in Germany. Like giants, these monumental structures towered above thelittle hive of half-timbered, wooden or brick buildings in the medieval city.They became landmarks, which stamp the character and the skyline of these townseven today, while apartment houses are sprouting up all around them andobscuring their greatness. Cathedrals, town halls, granaries and defense towersare the visible signs of an old idea, and outward expression which had itscounterpart in the ancient world but which is missing today.The relation between public and private buildings today is truly sad! If Berlinshould suffer the fate of Rome, future generations would admire the departmentstores of a few Jews and the hotels of a few corporations as the mightiest worksof our age believing those to be the characteristic expression of thiscivilization. Compare the obvious imbalance between the buildings of the Reichand the finance and commerce buildings in a city like Berlin.The amount of money spent on government buildings is inadequate and ridiculous. These buildings are not made for eternity, but only to satisfy the need of themoment. No one thinks about greatness when they commission a building.When the Castle at Berlin was built, it was a great work possessing asignificance that is lacking in the new library of our time. That greatshow-place cost about sixty million marks while less than half that amount wasspent on the Reichstag. This is the most imposing structure, yet built for theReich, and it should have been built to last through the ages. Then, when thequestion of the interior came to a vote, the Exalted House voted against the useof stone and ordered the walls be covered with plaster. Fortunately, for once,the parliamentarians did the right thing. Plaster statues are certainly out ofplace among stone walls.Our present-day cities lack any towering landmarks to represent the people'scommunity and we cannot be surprised if the community does not see its cities asa representation of itself. Unhappiness is the result and we can see this in thecomplete disinterest toward the concerns of the citizen's city.This is also a sign of our declining civilization and our general collapse. Thisgeneration is smothered in the pettiest practices or in slavery to money. It ishardly surprising that there is no sense of heroism under this deity. Today wereap what the recent past has sown.All these symptoms of decay result from the lack of a definite, universallyrecognized WorldConcept . We have no plan and this results in generaluncertainty when it comes to handling the great questions of the time. This iswhy everything, beginning with education, is halfhearted and indecisive becauseit shies away from responsibility and winds up in cowardly tolerance of obviousabuses which are known to be destructive. The desire to be humane--- thiscraze---has become fashionable. By weakly submitting to this deviance andsparing the feelings of individuals from hurt, we have sacrificed the future ofmillions.The spread of disunity can be seen in the religious conditions before the war.Here, the various parts of the nation had long abandoned their unifiedconvictions which might have amounted to a WorldConcept . In this matter, it isimportant to note that the small number who officially left the church were notas important as the much larger number who were simply indifferent. BothChurches (Protestant and Catholic) maintained missions in Asia and Africa togain new converts for their Faith. In Europe, they were losing millions uponmillions of followers who had either given up on religious life or preferred tofollow their own interpretation. The consequences definitely impacted the morallife of the country. On a side note, the progress made by the missions spreadingthe Christian Faith abroad was only modest when compared to the spread of Islam.The results from a moral perspective are especially poor.There is something else that is important to note. Violent attacks upon thebasic principles of Church teachings have increased steadily. It would beunthinkable to live in a world without religious faith. The broad masses of apeople are not made up of philosophers, so the faith of the masses is often thesole foundation for any moral WorldConcept they may have. The various proposedsubstitutes have not shown any results that would indicate they could be usefulreplacements for religious denominations. But if any religious-type teachingsare actually to take hold of the broad groups, as they successfully have in thepast, the basic teachings of existing religion would be a necessary foundationin order for a new teaching to be effective. There may be a few hundreds ofthousands of superior men who can live wisely and morally without depending onthe general standards of religion, but the millions of others cannot do so andneed daily guidance. The way people live ordinary life, by following religiousprinciples, can be compared to the way governments follow principles of thestate and Churches follow their own dogma. The purely intellectual idea of howone should conduct oneself can change and may be reinterpreted endlessly. It isthe religious doctrine alone which binds the idea and puts it into a form thatmakes it a faith. Otherwise, the moral idea would never grow beyond the statusof an abstract concept or a philosophic opinion. Accordingly, the attack on areligious doctrine is very similar to an attack against the constitution thatfounded the State. Just as the State would fall into chaos from such an attack,so would religion become worthless and end in emptiness with the annihilation ofthe core church beliefs.A politician must not judge the value of a religion by its faults. Instead heshould ask if there is an available substitute which fits his needs moreclosely. As long as there is no substitute for religion, only a fool or criminal wouldconsider abolishing an existing religion.The Church must take its share of responsibility for those who overload religionwith purely earthly concerns and unnecessarily battle against exact science.They spend too much time arguing about physical matters when they should befocused on the spirit. After a difficult struggle, science will almost alwayswin. In the eyes of people unable to see through the superficial nature ofscience, religion will be severely damaged. The worst chaos is created whenreligion is used for political purposes. Such miserable deceivers who seereligion as a means for gaining themselves political, or rather business powerand should be harshly condemned. Of course, these bold liars shout their claimsof faith to all the world in a very loud tone so that the other sinners willhave no choice but to hear their proclamation clearly. Their smiles do notexpress a willingness to die for their beliefs, but instead their aim is toimprove their own lives. For enough money or political favors, they would sellthe meaning of an entire faith and they would do it for a single fraudulent gainif they felt the value was a fair exchange. For ten seats in Parliament, theywill join the deadly Marxists who are enemies of all religions. For a seat inthe Cabinet they would marry the Devil himself, that is, if he was not preventedby some trace of decency which is more than these charlatans possess.Religious life in pre-war Germany had left an unpleasant taste in many people'smouths because of the abuse of Christianity by \"Christian\" political parties andas a result of boldness from those who attempted to associate the Catholic faithwith a political party. This bold attempt to connect Catholicism with politicswas a fatal stroke that gave a number of good-for-nothings seats in Parliamentand the political games seriously damaged the Church.The whole nation suffered the consequences. The weakening of religious tiesspread at a time when morality and culture were beginning to waver and give waytoo. These faults and cracks in our political body might not have been dangerousif there was no strain placed on its back, but they were bound to be disastrouswhen the internal solidarity of the nation turned into a storm of violentevents.In the realm of politics, an observant eye saw evils that could be, and had tobe, considered signs indicating a coming collapse of the Empire if no changes orimprovements were made immediately. The aimlessness of German domestic andforeign policy was clear to anyone who was not deliberately blind to it. Thesystem of compromises at first seemed to follow Bismarck's concept of politicsas \"the art of the possible\". But Bismarck was not like later GermanChancellors. There was one small difference; Bismark knew how to make his goalsinto a reality while still working within the political limitations of the time.When the mouths of his new successors spoke of the art-of-the-possible, it hadan entirely different meaning. Bismarck meant to say that every possible effortmust be made and exercised to the fullest extent to attain a given politicalobjective. In the same words, his successors saw an excuse to avoid anypolitical aims or principles at all and limited themselves to doing what waseasily accomplished. Political aims in the government of the Empire at that timeno longer existed. They needed a definite WorldConcept and required a grasp ofthe inner laws of political evolution, which is necessary for any politicalleadership. There were many who foresaw what was coming and criticized the lackof a plan and complete absence of forethought in the Empire's policy. It wasclear they plainly recognized its inner weakness and hollowness. Unfortunately,these were only outsiders in political life and their words did not carry muchweight.Government officials were and still are indifferent to principles of those likeHouston Stewart Chamberlain (a British political philosopher whose work affectedNazi racial platforms and pan-German movements. He was a German supporter in theFirst World War, and he also married the daughter of composer Richard Wagner).These people are too stupid to think of anything themselves and too conceited tolearn what they need from others.Oxenstierna ( Axel Gustafsson Oxenstierna, a Swedish Chancellor who played animportant role in the Thirty Years War and was later Governor-General ofoccupied Prussia) expressed this well when he said, \"The world is ruled by onlya fraction of all Wisdom\", out of a tiny particle, almost any MinisterialCounselor represents only one atom. Since Germany has become a Republic, eventhis small amount of wisdom is left unexercised. That is why the Law to Protectthe Republic forbids anyone to talk about or even to believe their leaders areunwise. (The Republic passed the Law To Protect The Republic forbiddingmembership in any organization that sought to assassinate officials or overthrowthe government and prohibits insults to officials and the flag. The law waspassed after Walter Rathenau, the Weimar Foreign Minister, was assassinated.) Itwas lucky for Oxenstierna that he lived when he did, and not in our \"wise\"Republic.Even before the First World War, many people recognized the primary element ofweakness in the very institution which should have symbolized the strength ofthe Empire, the Parliament, the Reichstag. Here, cowardice and irresponsibilitywere perfectly matched.One of the most thoughtless statements heard today is that the parliament inGermany has been \"a failure since the Revolution\". This implies that before theRevolution, things were different. In reality, this institution never functionedexcept to cause damage to the country. Most people were still wearing blindersand either could or would see nothing that was happening. This institution is toblame for Germany's downfall. The fact that the catastrophe did not occur evenearlier cannot be credited to the Reichstag, but is due to the resistance ofthose who opposed this institution. During the years of peace, those in theReichstag took up the job of gravediggers for the German nation and the GermanEmpire.Out of the enormous list of devastating evils committed either directly orindirectly by this institution, I will pick out just one single calamity whichshows clearly the inner nature of this irresponsible institution. The terribleevils I refer to resulted from the halfhearted actions and weakness of thepolitical leadership of the Reich in the Reichstag, which became one of thechief causes of the political collapse.Everything connected to or influenced by this parliament was done with weaknessor in a half-measure. No matter how we look at it, this is true. The Empire'spolicy for forming foreign alliances was willy-nilly. By trying to preservepeace, they steered us straight into war.The Polish policy was a perfect example of these halfway measures. The policycaused irritation without ever taking any serious action or exerting anycontrol. The result was not a victory for Germany, not the appeasement of thePoles, but the arousal of Russia's hostility. Russia became an enemy.The question of AlsaceLorraine ( a territory created by German annexation in theFranco Prussian War and lost to France with the Treaty of Versailles) was onlyhalf solved. Instead of brutally crushing the head of this French monster onceand for all, and then giving the right of German statehood to the Alsatian, theydid neither. They were unable to do either because among them were the greatesttraitors of the Center parties, for instance, Mr. Wetterlé. (The Center party inthe Reichstag and the separatist Center Party of the AlsaceLorraine territorywere partly but never fully merged, then they completely split over theAlsaceLorraine constitution passed by the Reichstag.) (Mr. Wetterlé referrs toAbbé Wetterlé, the leader of the AlsaceLorraine Center party who was forced toflee to France in 1914.) All this would still have been bearable if the generalhalfheartedness had not also sacrificed the power of the army, on which theexistence and survival of the Empire depended.Those who were supposed to be the \"German Parliament\" were forever cursed by theGerman nation for their crimes. For the most disgraceful, contemptible reasons,the party henchmen stole from our people's hands the weapon they needed forselfpreservation, the sole protection of our people's freedom and independence,and by various means they destroyed the army. If the graves spread over theFlanders plains were to open today, the bloody accusers would rise from them topoint the finger of blame at the Reichstag. Hundreds of thousands of the bestyoung Germans, who were sent poorly trained and halfprepared into the arms ofdeath by these conscienceless parliamentary criminals, paid dearly. TheFatherland simply lost these poor souls. These and millions of others werecrippled and killed, lost to the Fatherland, lost solely to allow a few hundreddeceivers and swindlers of the people to carry out their political maneuvers,enforce their excessive demands, or even test their theories of politicaldoctrine. They are traitors.The Jewry, through its Marxist democratic press, shouted the lie of \"Germanmilitarism\" to the world, hoping to paint Germany as an aggressor. They tiedGermany's hands by every means available. The Marxist and Democratic partiesrefused to approve funding for comprehensive training of the German defenseforces. Yet this monstrous crime must have been immediately clear to anyone whosaw that in a war, the whole nation may have to take up arms. Consequently, themischief of these fine \"representatives of the people\" would drive millions ofGermans into the face of the enemy while they were only halftrained and poorlyequipped. Even if we set aside the result of the crude and brutal lack ofprinciples in these parliamentary fancy-men, anyone could see the absence ofproperly trained soldiers at the beginning of war might easily lead to defeat.This result was frighteningly confirmed in the course of the First World War.The German nation's loss of the struggle for freedom and independence was theresult of halfway measures and weakness. It began during peacetime by theemployment of crippling policies that stripped away the organization andtraining needed to defend the Fatherland.There were too few recruits being trained on land and the same halfheartedeffort was sabotaging the navy to make that weapon of national selfpreservationworthless. Unfortunately, the naval command itself was infected with the spiritof halfway measures. The tendency to always build the ships smaller than theEnglish ones being launched at the same time was short sighted and not exactly ademonstration of genius. A navy that does not have the same numbers as itslikely opponent must make up for that lack by the outstanding fightingeffectiveness of the individual ships. Superior fighting effectiveness is whatcounts and not a mythical superiority in \"merit\". Modern technology hasprogressed so far and is so nearly uniform in the civilized states that it isimpossible to give ships of one power a greater fighting value than the ships ofthe same size belonging to another state. It is even more unthinkable thatsuperiority can be achieved by a smaller size ship over a greater size vessel.The smaller tonnage of the German ships was bound to be at the expense ofweaponry and engine power. The excuse used to justify smaller ships showed avery serious logical failure by the naval office in charge during times ofpeace. (British ships were allowed by treaty a larger tonnage based on theargument that they needed to carry more fuel to reach colonies The German Navywas also kept small to avoid an appearance of threatening England.) Theavailable German naval artillery equipment was declared to be superior to theBritish guns. The performance of the German 30.5 centimeter (12 inch.) gun wasin no way inferior to that of the British 30.5 centimeter (12 inch.) gun! (TheBritish gun suffered from accuracy and weapon-longevity problems, and the Germanguns also had better penetration.) For this very reason it should have beentheir duty to change over to the 30.5 centimeter gun instead of using smallerweapons on the fleet. They absolutely should not have been seeking equalfighting strength but superior fighting strength.If superior strength were not of concern, then why were 42 centimeter fieldartillery pieces adopted in the army? Larger field pieces would have beenunnecessary if they were seeking equality, since the existing German 21centimeter field artillery was far superior to any French artillery existing atthat time. Any fortresses would probably have crumbled for the 30.5 centimeterfield artillery, but the Command of the army was logical and reasoned correctlywhen they chose their artillery, while the navy, unfortunately, was not sological.The navy's rejection of superior artillery and of superior speed was based onthe completely mistaken socalled \"concept of risk\". (A military term describingthe level of danger or risk in an engagement versus what is required to counterthat danger.) The Naval Command assessed their needs based on the idea ofdefense and completely abandoned offensive planning. From the beginning of thewar they were surrendering any chance of success, of victory, because those canonly come from attacking, from offense, not defense.A ship of slower speed and inferior weaponry will be quickly blown out of thewater by its faster and better-armed adversary who can fire effectively from agreater distance. A considerable number of our cruisers discovered this to theirbitter sorrow. The peacetime views of the Naval Command were completely mistakenas shown by the war. This forced the re-equipment of old ships and the use ofbetter weapons on new ships whenever they had the chance. If in the battle ofthe Skagerrak (The strait of Skagerrak between Norway and Sweden wasstrategically important to Germany) the German ships had had the same tonnage,the same armament, and the same speed as the English ships, the British navywould have gone to a watery grave under the hurricane of accurate and moreeffective German 38 centimeter shells.Japan chose a different naval policy. Their entire emphasis was put on buildinga fighting strength in each new ship that was superior to their eventualadversary. The offensive capabilities of the fleet in battle was their reward.While the Army Command still kept itself free from such fundamentally erroneousreasoning, the navy had more \"parliamentary\" representation and succumbed to thespirit of Parliament. The navy was organized and run using their method of doingeverything half way, and it was later used in the same way. The immortal glorythe navy did earn can only be credited to the good work of German weaponmanufacturers and the competent and incomparable heroism of individual officersand crews. If the former Supreme Command of the navy had been equally brilliant,all the sacrifices would not have been in vain.P erhaps the navy's very undoingresulted from the parliamentary skills which influenced its leading brains inpeacetime. Even in its building-up period, they relied on parliamentary insteadof purely military considerations when making decisions. The halfheartedweakness and illogical thinking which characterize the parliament, contaminatedthe Command of the Navy.As I have said, the army kept away from such fundamentally mistaken trains ofthought. Ludendorff, who was then a Colonel in the General Staff, foughtespecially hard in a desperate battle against the criminal halfhearted weaknessand opposed the Reichstag when they waffled and wavered over questions vital tothe nation. If the struggle that this officer fought was unsuccessful, one mustlay half of the blame on the Parliament and the other half with the, if possibleeven more pitifully weak, Imperial Chancellor, Bethmann Hollweg. This does notprevent those who are responsible for the German collapse from trying to put theentire blame on Ludendorff, the one man who stood his ground against the fatalneglect of national interests. At this point, one deception more or less meansnothing to these born liars.Anyone who thinks about all the sacrifices forced on the nation by the criminalneglect of these utterly irresponsible individuals, anyone who reviews in hismind's eye all those who were unnecessarily killed and crippled, the boundlessdisgrace and shame poured on our heads, the immeasurable misery which we sinkinto more and more every day, and anyone who knows that this all took place justto open a few seats in Parliament for a gang of political climbers andposition-hunters with no conscience, anyone will understand that these creaturescan be described only by words such as wretch, scoundrel, liar, and criminal. Ifit were not for these men, the meaning and reason for the existence of theseexpressions in the language would be incomprehensible.In comparison to these national traitors, any common swindler is a gentleman ofhonor.It was most peculiar that the dark faults of old Germany were only exposed whendoing so had the potential to harm the inner stability of the nation. In suchcases, the unpleasant truths were shouted at the great masses while many otherthings were bashfully kept quiet and hushed up or simply denied.Denial or silence were the clear choices when the open discussion a problemmight have brought improvement. The competent members of the governmentunderstood next to nothing about the value and nature of propaganda. Only theJew knew that the clever and persistent use of propaganda could make Heaven seemlike Hell and Hell appear as Heaven itself, or make the most miserable type oflife seem like a paradise. The Jew knew what to do and he acted on thatknowledge. The German, or rather his government, didn't have the faintest ideahow to use propaganda or what it truly was. As a result, we saw the most severeresults during the War as penance for such ignorance.In German life before the War, we experienced the problems I have discussed butthere were also many advantages. To evaluate things fairly, we must recognizethat most of the problems we experienced were also present in other countriesand peoples. Their problems were sometimes so great that it often put us in theshade of their gloom because we enjoyed advantages they lacked.The leader among these virtues was the fact that, when compared to almost allEuropean peoples, Germany tried the hardest to preserve our national economiccharacter. This gave Germany a clear superiority. It reduced our exposure to thecontrol of international finance, though there were symptoms to indicate itspresence. This virtue turned out to be dangerous because it became a major causeof the First World War. Putting this and other things aside, three institutionsmust be pointed out that were unequaled in their perfection. They helped usstand apart from the other great nations and made it possible to restore thenation when it was damaged.The first was the form the State took and the special way it developed in theGermany of modern times. We may reasonably overlook individual monarchs who, ashuman beings, were subject to all the weaknesses common to humans and sharedwith the children of this earth. If we were not understanding and indulgent tothese weaknesses, we would be in total despair at the present time because therewould be very few people left to run the country. The representatives of thepresent regime are considered as no more than celebrities, personalities, andare morally and intellectually probably the least developed that one canimagine. Anyone who measures the \"quality\" or merit of the German Revolution bythe merit and stature of the people it has given to the German nation as leaderssince November 1918 (the end of the First World War and start of the WeimarRepublic, a reference to the November Criminals) will hide his head in shamebefore the judgment of future generations. Future generations will not be boundby the Law for Protection of the Republic and cannot be silenced by suchprotective laws. They will say what we all realize even now; that the brains andvirtues of our new German leaders are a lot smaller than their big mouths andtheir big vices.Many people, especially the common people, lost touch with the Monarchy. Thiswas because the Monarchy was not always surrounded by the, shall we say, mostalert and especially not the most upright characters. The Monarchy preferredflatterers above straight-talking, honest men. The flatterers were the ones whokept the Monarchy \"informed\". This caused serious damage at a time when theworld was undergoing a transformation and many old opinions were cast off whilenew ideas replaced them to sit in judgment upon a variety of ancient Royal Courttraditions.By the turn of the century opinions had shifted. How could an ordinary man orwoman feel a surge of enthusiasm for a Princess who was riding on horseback andwearing a uniform as soldiers filed past on parade? Apparently, no one in theseupper circles had any idea as to how this sort of flamboyancy looked to thepeople. If they did, such awkward performances would have never happened. Thepretentious trend for showing insincere humanitarianism in these circles alsorepelled more than it attracted. For instance, at one time, if Princess Xdescended to sample the product of a soup kitchen, of course finding it to beexcellent as expected, so she could show how strongly she felt a familiaritywith the people, it might have made a perfectly good impression in the past, butthe current result was the opposite. It is safe to assume that Her Highnessnever dreamed that on the day she tasted the soup, it was just a littledifferent from what it usually was, but it was enough that everybody else knewthis to be the case. What may have been the best of intentions becameridiculous, if not absolutely offensive.Descriptions of the proverbial frugality of the Monarch generated many ominousconversations. We were told how he woke up much too early, how he absolutelyslaved till late at night, and of the ever-present danger of pendingundernourishment resulting from his devotion to duty. Nobody wants to know whatand how much the Monarch ate. Nobody begrudged him a \"square\" meal. No one wastrying to deny him a full night's sleep. People were satisfied if he honored thename of his House and his nation as a man and a public servant who fulfilled hisduties as a ruler. The telling of fairy tales about him did more harm than good.All the flamboyancy and fairy-tales as well as other events like them wereinsignificant compared to the spreading lethargy. Growing throughout a largepart of the nation was the terrible belief that governing was taken care of fromabove automatically, and that the individual didn't need to think about it. Aslong as the government was really a good one, or at least had the best ofintentions, they could continue without anyone objecting. But, beware! When thefundamentally well-meaning old government was replaced by a new gang of lowerquality leaders, then the existing meek, docile obedience and childlike faithbecame the most fatal evils that could possibly be imagined.To offset these and many other weaknesses, there were undeniable positiveeffects of the Monarchy. One was the stability of rule imposed by a Monarchyform of government. This removed the highest posts in the State from the reachof ambitious politicians. Further, there were the respect and authority of theinstitution in itself that elevated government civil servants by associationwith the Monarchy, especially the army, above the level of mere political partyobligations.There was the further advantage that the Monarch himself was a person who heldthe head of the State position, and the example set by the Monarch in bearingsole responsibility is more than that which is assumed by the chance mob of aparliamentary majority. The proverbial honesty and integrity of the Germanadministration was due primarily to this responsibility of the man-at-the-top.The cultural value of Monarchy to the German people was great and this aloneeasily offset other disadvantages. Residential cities of the German princes haveremained a stronghold of artistic senses, but now they are threatened more andmore to die out in our materialistic age. What the German princes did for artand science, particularly in the nineteenth century, was a model foradvancement. The present day cannot, in any way, show accomplishments of equalvalue.At the beginning and during the slowly spreading collapse of the political body,the greatest asset was reclaiming the army. It was the greatest school theGerman people had available to teach them lessons they were not receivingelsewhere. Those who wished to harm Germany despised the army and for justcause. The hatred of every enemy was directed squarely at this shieldrepresenting national selfpreservation and freedom. There can be no moresplendid monument to this unique institution of the Monarchy than the fact thatit was slandered, hated, and resisted, but also feared by every one of theinferior elements that wanted to attack Germany. The fury of the internationalprofiteers and exploiters of Versailles (Versailles Treaty ) was directedprimarily at the old German army, and this shows the army was the stronghold ofour people's freedom against the power of the international stock exchange.Without this force standing guard and sounding the alarm, the intentions ofVersailles profiteers toward our people would long since have been fulfilled.What the German people owe to the army can be summed up in a single word:Everything.The army taught a sense of duty at a time when this quality had already becomevery rare, and avoiding responsibility was the order of the day. This examplewas set by that model of irresponsibility, the Parliament. The army also taughtpersonal courage in an age when cowardice threatened to become a raging disease.Readiness to sacrifice oneself for the general good of the nation was consideredto be stupid and weak-minded while the only man who seemed sensible was the manwho could shield and advance his own self interests. The school of the armystill taught the individual German to seek salvation in the nation, not in thelying insincerity of international brotherhood among negroes, Germans, Chinese,Frenchmen, Englishmen, etc., but in the strength and unity of his ownnationality.The army bred decisiveness, while everywhere else in life, indecision andskepticism determined men's actions. In an age when the smartalecks everywhereset the tone, it meant something to maintain the principle that doing somethingis better than doing nothing. This one principle symbolized a vigorous healthyforce that would have been lost in our lives a long time ago if the army and itstraining had not constantly renewed this fundamental concept. One only has tolook at the horrible inability of our present leadership to make a decision.They cannot shake off their mental and moral lethargy to decide on a definiteaction except when they are forced to sign some new order for the exploitationof the German people. In that case, they decline all responsibility and signwith the speed of a court stenographer anything that is put in front of them. Inthis case, the decision is easily made because they do not have to reach adecision; the decision is dictated to them.The army bred idealism and devotion to the Fatherland and its greatness, whilein civil life, greed and materialism were out of control. The army trained aunited people and united the classes. Perhaps its only fault was the institutionof one-year military service for high-school graduates (Those who completedhigher education only had to serve one year instead of the full military term.)This was a fault because it broke through the principle of absolute equality andput the better-educated individuals outside the circles of their more commoncomrades. Actually, the very opposite policy would have been better. Our upperclasses are so isolated from the real world and they are becoming more and morealienated from their own people, that the army could have had a beneficialeffect if it had avoided any preferential treatment in the ranks of theintellectuals. The failure to treat everyone equally was a mistake, but wherecan you find any institution in the world that doesn't make a mistake? In anycase, the good aspects of the army greatly outweighed the defects. The few flawsthat existed were far below the average level of human imperfection.We must consider it a great credit to the army of the old Empire that it placedthe individual above mob-rule at a time when majorities were everything, andeveryone based their beliefs on the mob's conscience. The army's teaching was indirect opposition to the Jewish Democratic idea that one should blindly worshipwhatever the greatest number of people believed. Instead, the army upheld faithin the personal values of the individual above the collective values of the mob.It even trained what was most urgently needed: real men. In the swamp of auniversally spreading softness and femininity, three hundred and fifty thousandyoung, well-trained men sprang every year from the ranks of the army and mixedwith the population. In two years of training, they had lost the softness ofyouth and gained bodies as hard as steel. The young man who practiced obedienceduring this time was now ready to command. One could distinguish a soldier whohad done his service by the way he walked.The army was the great school of the German nation. This was the reason for thefierce hatred of all those who, through envy and greed, wanted and needed tomake the Empire weak and defenseless. The world could see what many Germans intheir blindness or evil intentions chose not to see; the German army was themightiest weapon that served to defend the freedom of the German nation andguard the livelihood of its children.Along with the Monarchy and the army, there was a third foot to the tripod: theincomparable body of civil servants in the old Empire.Germany was the best organized and best administered country in the world. Itwas easy to criticize the German civil service because of bureaucratic red tape,but other nations were no better off and many were actually worse. But what theother nations did not possess was the wonderful strength of the machine and theincorruptible, honorable spirit of those who served. Better to wade through alittle red tape with honest and faithful men, than suffer through enlightenedand modern characters who were ignorant, exercised poor judgment, andincompetent. To those who like to pretend now that pre-war Germanadministration, while unarguably bureaucratically efficient, was bad at dealingwith business matters, I can only reply: What country in the world had abetter-managed and better-organized business than German government railroads?It was left for the Revolution to destroy this model business structure andthen, after it was thoroughly trashed, they decided it was ready to be takenfrom the hands of the nation and socialized. \"Socialized\", according to themeaning given to it by the founders of this new Republic, actually meant it nowserved international finance capital, who were themselves the controllers of theGerman Revolution.The trait that distinguished the body of German civil servants and the Germanadministrative structure was its independence from the sudden and unfortunatechanges in individual governments. Their momentary politics could have noinfluence on the position of German State civil servants. Since the Revolution,there has been a complete change. Adherence to party policy has replaced abilityand aptitude, and a self-reliance, an independent capability, with an attitudethat is more a hindrance than a help.The wonderful strength and energy of the old Empire rested on the Monarchy, thearmy, and the State officials of the civil service. These were the foundation ofa great strength, a quality completely lacking in the State today: the State'sauthority. Strength depends on the universal confidence that can be placed inthe administration of a commonwealth and not on the babbling in Parliaments orlegislative assemblies (Landtags in some German states), or on laws to protectthe State, or on court sentences passed to frighten those who boldly deny Stateauthority. This confidence is the result of an unshakable inner conviction thatthe government and administration of a country is driven by an impartial andhonest desire for the good of the nation and on a general consistency among thelaws which are in harmony with the moral beliefs of the people. Governmentsystems are maintained by the people's faith in their government's goodwill andhonest sincerity. In the long run, this belief will uphold and promote theinterests of a people and thereby maintain the government, not force or terror.As strongly as certain evils of the pre-war days may have threatened to eat awayand undermine the inner strength of Germany, it must not be forgotten that othernations suffered from most of these diseases, some even more than Germany, andyet they did not collapse and suffer similar destruction at the critical momentwhen they were tested by crisis. When we consider that for every German weakpoint before the war there was an equally great strong point, the final cause ofthe collapse can and must lie in another direction. That is indeed the case.The deepest and most profound cause of the downfall of the old Empire lay in itsfailure to recognize the race problem and to see its importance for thehistorical development of peoples. The events in the life of nations are notexpressions of chance, but processes of natural law, of the need forselfpreservation and to increase the species and race. Even though men may notsee in their mind's eye the motives behind their actions, those actions affectthe course of nations.11. PEOPLE AND RACEThere are certain truths which are so completely obvious that, for the veryreason that they are so common, the average person does not see them or at leastdoes not recognize them. A man may often pass blindly by such obvious truths andbe utterly astonished when someone suddenly discovers a fact that everybodyshould have already known. Columbus' eggs are lying around by the hundreds ofthousands, but a Columbus is rare indeed. (The egg of Columbus refers to an ideaor discovery that appears obvious after it is made; the reference is based on acommon story about Christopher Columbus.) All men, without exception, strollabout the garden of Nature, arrogantly assuming they know and are familiar withall of it. Yet, with few exceptions, they pass blindly over one of the moststriking principles of Nature's rule: the inner separation of the variousspecies of all earth's living creatures.Even the most casual observer can see a firm, basic law that rules all thecountless creatures in which Nature expresses her will to live. All of thedifferent forms of animals keep within specific boundaries, within their ownspecies, when propagating or multiplying their kind. Every animal only mateswith another of the same species. The titmouse pairs with the titmouse, thefinch with the finch, the stork with the stork, the fieldmouse with thefieldmouse, the house-mouse with the house-mouse, the wolf with the she wolf,etc.Only extraordinary circumstances can alter this boundary rule and then it onlyhappens under the pressure of captivity or for some other reason that makesmating within the same species impossible. But, even then, Nature begins toresist with all her might. Her clearest protest is demonstrated in theinfertility of the bastard creature or in restricting the fertility of laterdescendants. In most cases, she deprives them of the ability to resist diseaseor deprives these unfortunates the means to defend against attacks from enemies.This is natural.Every breeding between two creatures that are not from the same level produces aresult mid-way between the levels of the two parents. The offspring will be on ahigher level than the racially lower one of its parents, but not as high as thehigher one. Consequently, in battle, it will eventually yield to the higherspecies because of its deficiencies. That sort of mating runs counter toNature's will to breed life upwards. Nature's will is accomplished by completevictory of the higher species, not by uniting superiority and inferiority. Thestronger must rule. It must not unite with the weaker, thus sacrificing its ownhigher nature. Only those who are born as the weaker being can think this crueland that is why he is a weak and defective man. If this Law did not hold, theevolution of life would be unthinkable.The consequence of this instinct for race purity, which is found universallythroughout Nature, is not only the sharp outward difference between the separateraces, but their uniform nature within themselves of their character that isunique to each species. The fox is always a fox, the goose a goose, the tiger atiger, etc. The only possible difference is in varying degrees of health,strength, understanding, cleverness, and endurance among individual specimens.We will never find a fox which naturally has moments of kindness toward geese,just as there is no cat with a friendly affection for mice.The battle is born out of hunger and love, not because of any native hostility.In both cases, Nature watches with calm satisfaction. The struggle for dailybread conquers the weak, sickly, and undecided, while the males who win thecontest for the female win the right or at least the opportunity of reproductionfor the healthiest individuals. Struggle is the means that improves the health,strength, and stamina of the species and the reason for its evolution to ahigher quality of being.If any other process were the choice of Nature, all development and evolutionwould cease and the progress so far achieved would reverse. There are alwaysmore inferior beings than the best examples of a species. This is simply amatter of numbers and the fact that only some can be the Best among them. Givenequal opportunities for survival and reproduction, the worst part of a specieswould increase so much faster than the smaller number of quality members untileventually the best would be crowded into the background. A correction thatfavors the dominance of the better individual must take place. Nature takes careof this by subjecting the weaker part to difficult living-conditions. That aloneis sufficient to restrict their number to some degree.But these cannot be allowed to increase in number randomly. A new, ruthlessselection method is made and only the strongest and most sound will make thecut.Nature does not desire the mating of a weaker species with stronger individuals.Even less does she desire the mixing of a higher race with a lower race. If thiswere allowed to happen over thousands of years, the efforts of natural selectionwould be for nothing.History shows us countless examples which prove this law. It shows with alarmingclarity that every time Aryan blood has mingled with inferior races, the resulthas been the end of the greater civilization whose members were the flagbearersof superiority. The North American population consists overwhelmingly ofGermanic elements which have mingled very little with inferior colored peoplesand this shows a very different sort of civilization and culture from Centraland South America. In Central and South America, the mostly Latin (meaningpeople of Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese origin) settlers mingled,sometimes on a large scale, with the people who were native to the area. Thisone example by itself clearly and distinctly shows us the effect of racialmixture. The racially pure and almost unmixed Germanic peoples on the AmericanContinent have risen to become the master of their land. He will remain themaster as long as he does not yield to blood pollution by mixing with lesserraces.The result of any crossing of races is this: A. A decline in the level orquality of the superior race.B. A slow but certain wasting disease of physical and intellectual degenerationbegins. To commit such a deviation is nothing more or less than to sin against the willof the Eternal Creator. This action is rewarded with vengeance.In attempting to rebel against the iron logic of Nature, man comes into conflictwith the principles to which he owes his very existence as a human being. Hisdefiance of Nature is bound to lead to his own downfall.To this we always hear the arrogant objection of the modern pacifist which istruly Jewish in its inspiration, and correspondingly stupid: \"But, man canconquer Nature!\" Millions thoughtlessly babble this Jewish nonsense and end byimagining themselves as conquerors of Nature, but their only weapon is an idea,and this is such a preposterous one that it would be impossible to imagine theworld could exist if it were true. Man has never once conquered Nature, but atmost has caught hold of and tried to lift one corner of her giant veil whichconceals her eternal mysteries. He is never able to create anything. He can onlydiscover things. He does not rule Nature, but has only learned to dominate someof Nature's creatures who lack the knowledge he has gained. An idea cannotconquer the foundations of mankind's growth and his being since the idea itselfdepends completely on man. Without man, there can be no human idea in the world.Therefore, the idea is always dependent on the existence of men, and he in turnis subject to all the laws that created the conditions essential for thatexistence.There is more to the matter. Certain ideas cannot be separated from the man whoconceived them. This is particularly true of thoughts which are not based onscience but based on feelings or an \"inner experience\". All these ideas arechained to the existence of the men whose intellectual imagination and creativepower spawned the idea and have nothing to do with pure logic. Such ideasrepresent mere manifestations of feeling, such as ethical and moral concepts,etc. The preservation of those particular races and men is the essential elementfor the existence of the ideas they have created. If someone should trulydesire, with all his heart, for the pacifist idea to be victorious in thisworld, he would have to do his best in every way to help Germans conquer theworld. If the reverse should happen and Germany should be extinguished, the lastpacifist would very likely die out with the last German. I say this because therest of the world has not been so completely fooled as our own people have beenby this unnatural and unreasonable pacifist nonsense. Anyone who seriouslyintended to follow pacifist ideology would have to make up his mind to wage warin order to keep pacifism alive.In fact, this and this alone was what the American world savior, Wilson (WoodrowWilson who was elected President on a peace-at-all-costs platform, but wasforced to join the FirstWorld War later), intended, or at least what our German prophets thought heintended, and they believed that through his plans their ideals would beattained.The humane-pacifist idea may be a perfectly good one but only after the mostadvanced race of men has first conquered and enslaved the world on a scale whichmakes him the only master of the earth. The idea will then have no chance tocause harm. At least it cannot cause harm any greater than the level it isapplied, which will become rare and then impossible once the master race hasconquered all. Battle first, then afterwards, perhaps we will see if pacifismworks. Any other course that does not lead to the strongest race ruling mankindmeans mankind has passed the peak of its development and the end will not be thereign of any supreme moral idea, but degeneration into barbarism and eventuallychaos. Some may laugh at that statement, but our planet moved through space formillions of years without men walking on the surface. Someday, it may do soagain if people forget Nature's laws after they have achieved a higher level ofexistence. They must not forget that their achievement was due to therecognition and brutal application of the laws of Nature and not to followingthe ideas of a few crazy ideologists.Everything we admire on this earth today, science and art, industry andinvention, is the creative product of just a few peoples and perhaps originally,all of one race. The survival of this whole civilization depends on them. Ifthey are destroyed, the beauty of this earth will be buried with them. No matterhow much the soil may influence mankind, the result of that influence willalways differ according to the races in question. The infertility of a territorymay encourage one race to strive for supreme achievement. Another race mayaccept bitter poverty and starvation along with all the consequences. Theultimate outcome is determined by the inner natural tendencies of a people andthe way they deal with external influences. What brings one race to starvationwill train another to work hard.The great civilizations of the past have all been destroyed simply because theoriginal creative race died out as a result of pollution of their blood lines.In every case, the original cause of the downfall has been the failure toremember that all civilization depends on men, and not vice-versa. In order topreserve a particular civilization, the type of men who created it must also bepreserved. But this preservation is dependent on the inflexible law that it isnecessary and just for the best and strongest men to be the victor and only theyhave the right to continue. The many, who would desire to live, must fight.Any man who will not fight for his place in this world of constant struggle,does not deserve to live.Even though this may sound harsh, it is the way things truly are. It will be aneven harsher fate that befalls the man who believes he can conquer Nature, forhe only insults her. Suffering, disaster, misfortune, and disease will beNature's response to him. The man who makes the mistake of ignoring the law ofrace cheats himself of the happiness which is fated to be his. He blocks thetriumphant advance of the greater race, and thus the sine qua non (Latin meaning\"indispensable ingredient or requirement for\") of all human progress. Burdenedwith humanitarian interests and human sentiment, he falls back among thehelpless beasts.It is useless to argue over what race or races were the original flagbearers ofhuman civilization and the real founders of everything we consider as theworld's humanity. It is simpler to ask this question about the present time.Now, the answer is plain and simple. All human culture, art, science, andinvention which surround us are almost exclusively the creative product of theAryan race. This very fact justifies the deduction that the Aryan alone was thefounder of a superior type of human life and is the prototype of what we mean bythe word \"man\" today. He is the Prometheus (the intelligent Titan of Greek mythwho brought fire to earth for man) of humanity from whose brilliant mind thedivine spark of genius has always sprung, ever rekindling the fire which, in theform of knowledge, has illuminated the night of unspeakable mysteries, and thussent man up the road to lordship over the other creatures of this earth. Takehim away, and perhaps within a few thousand years, profound darkness willdescend again upon earth, human civilization will vanish, and the world willbecome a desert.If we were to divide humanity into three classes, the founders of civilization,the maintainers of civilization, and destroyers of civilization, the Aryan wouldbe the only possible representative of the first class. He laid the foundationand built the great walls of all human creations, and only the outward shape andcolor are determined by the particular characteristics of the individualpeoples. It is the Aryan who furnished the great buildingstones and plans forall human progress, and only the execution depends on the character of thevarious races. Within a few decades the whole of Eastern Asia, for example, willcall a single culture its own, however this culture is not its own creation butwas built on the foundation of Hellenistic spirit (built on Greek achievement),but it was also built with Germanic technology, just as in our own case. Onlythe outward form will show traits of Asian character; the foundation is Aryan.It is not true that Japan is superimposing European technical progress on herown civilization as many people assume. Original European science and technologyhave long been decorated with Japanese style. The basis of life in Japan is notthe product of a purely native Japanese civilization, but it is instead built onthe tremendous scientific and technical work from Europe and America, that is tosay from Aryan peoples.However, this civilization does choose the color of their contemporary life,which because of the inner difference of the culture, is more obvious to theEuropean who sees the outside. Only by integrating these Aryan achievements canthe Orient take a place along with other countries in general human progress.Aryan scientific and technical achievements provide the foundation that supportstheir general life and struggle for daily bread in Japan. Only the outwarddecoration has gradually changed to fit the Japanese character.If, starting today, all future Aryan influence on Japan were to end, as ifEurope and America were both destroyed, Japan's present advance in science andtechnology might continue for a short while, but within a few years, the wellwould run dry. The Japanese internal character would gain hold again, and thepresent civilization would become stagnant and would sink back into the sleepthat it was awakened from seven decades ago by the wave of Aryan civilization.Just as the present Japanese development and culture owes its existence to theinfluence of Europe and America, we can also be assured that in the distant pastan outside influence, an outside culture, brought into existence the Japaneseculture of that day. The best proof of this is the fact that their culture latersuffered stagnation and paralysis when the influence stopped, and it remainedthis way until it was revived seven decades ago. This can happen to a race ifthe original creative racial core has been lost, or if the outside influencewhich supplied the stimulus and the materials for the first cultural developmentis removed. If it is known that a race receives and absorbs the fundamentalsubstance of a civilization from alien races, and progress comes to a halt eachtime the external influence ceases, the race may indeed be called a \"sustainer\"of civilization, but never a \"creator\".Examination of the various peoples around the world from this standpoint showsthat almost none of them are creators; they are nearly always sustainers; theyare merely the recipients of another culture.This is usually how their development occurs: Often, amazingly small groups ofAryan tribes overpowered other peoples and caused the dormant intellectual andorganizing powers of the conquered people to surface. These abilities wereunexercised until the Aryans awoke these abilities in the lesser race. Thebenefits of the particular living conditions in the new territory, such as thefertility of the soil, climate, etc., made it possible for them to accomplishthis cultural reawakening by using the large number of available workers fromthe inferior race. Often in a few thousand or maybe just a few hundred years,they built up civilizations which originally displayed every inner mark of theirfounder's character but were adapted to fit within the special qualities of thelocal area and the characteristics of the subjugated people.But eventually, the conquerors violate the first principle, keeping their bloodpure and not mixing with lower racial stock. They begin to interact with theconquered inhabitants and in doing so, put an end to their own existence. Evenfor the original sin of man, the penalty was expulsion from Paradise.After a thousand years or more, the last visible trace of the former rulingpeople appears only in the lighter skin coloration that its blood bestows on thesubjugated race. It is a stagnated culture of which the Aryans had been the truefounder. Just as the physical and spiritual aspects of the conqueror weresubmerged and lost in the blood of the conquered race, so too was the fuel forthe torch of human cultural progress extinguished. The blood of the formermasters has left a faint glow in the complexion as a sign, and the night of theinferior cultural life is gently illumined by the surviving creations of theancient bringers of that light. They shine throughout the uncivilized state andcan easily make the observer who passes by think he is looking at the image ofthe present people, but he is just looking into the mirror of the past; heactually sees the glow radiated from the original bearers of the fire ofculture.It may be that throughout history such a people have come into contact a secondtime, or even more often, with the race that once brought it civilization,without any surviving memory of this past. Unconsciously, the small shred of theold master's blood which remains will be drawn toward the newly arriving race,and what had originally been possible only by force may now happen through freewill. A new wave of civilization explodes and lasts until those who carry themantle of progress are adulterated and again go down in the blood of alienpeoples.It will be the responsibility of those who study future cultural and worldhistory to make their discoveries from this point of view and not to smotherthemselves in descriptions of outward events, as our present historicalscientific education does too often.Even this short sketch of the development of \"culturesustaining\" nations alsoreveals the growth, work, and decline of the real culture-founders of thisearth, the Aryans themselves.Just as in daily life, the one we call a genius needs a special occasion or evena regular jolt to cause him to shine. A race of people also need such a jolt tobring out the dormant genius. In the monotony of daily life, even outstandingmen may appear insignificant. They never rise above the average level of thosewho surround them. But take that same person and let him face a situation whereothers would give up or freeze in fear and the genius rises visibly out of thisunnoticed, average man, often to the astonishment of everyone who knows him inhis everyday life. This is why the prophet is seldom thought about much in hisown country. There is no better opportunity to observe this than in war. Intimes of testing and trial, when others surrender to despair, those who areapparently innocent children spring up into heroes, headstrong in determinationand ice cold in judgment. If the hour of stress had not been inflicted, no onewould have dreamed that inside that beardless boy was a young hero. Some sort ofimpact is almost always necessary to arouse the genius. The hammer-blow of Fatewill knock one man down and strike against steel in another. Once the everydayouter shell breaks, the hidden core is exposed to an astonished world. Then theworld cringes, refusing to believe that what had seemed to be a man of its ownaverage rank is now, suddenly, a greater being. This process occurs almost everytime an outstanding son of the race appears.Although an inventor does not establish his greatness until the day hisinvention is created, it is a mistake to think that genius itself had nevertaken hold of the man until then. The spark of genius exists in the brain of atruly creative and gifted man from the hour of his birth. True genius is alwayspresent from birth and never taught or learned. This applies, as I have alreadyemphasized, not only in the individual, but in the entire race. Activelycreative peoples have fundamental creative gifts from the beginning, even thoughthe outside observer may not recognize it. Outward recognition only results fromthe accomplishment because the rest of the world is not capable of recognizinggenius by itself. They only see its visible expression in the form ofinventions, discoveries, buildings, pictures, etc. Even then, it may be a longtime before the world recognizes the genius that drove the accomplishment.Just as the genius or the outstanding individual man with extraordinary talentis unable to bring out his ability until it is set in motion by particularstimuli, a race is only able to bring out its creative powers and abilities whenthe right conditions stimulate the peoples into action.These abilities are the clearest in the race which has been, and is, the bearerof human cultural development: The Aryans. The moment Fate imposes specialconditions on them, their inborn abilities surface at a quicker pace and theirgenius is shown through the physical result. The cultures they create are almostalways determined by the soil, the climate, and the conquered people. The lastof these elements is the most important. The more primitive and the greater thetechnical limitations of any acquired culture, the more effort will be requiredfor the civilizing activity and therefore the more manpower will be needed. Whenthe manpower is organized, concentrated, and applied, it can substitute for thepower of mechanical machines. Without the availability of lower ranked men, theAryan could never have taken the first step toward his later civilizing of thosepeople. It is the same as if he had never tamed and used various domesticatedanimals to help build the foundation of civilization.Then he would have neverarrived at a level of technical development which now is gradually permittinghim to do without these very animals. The saying, \"The Moor has finished hisjob, so let him now depart\" (possibly a paraphrase from Shakespeare's Othello,also attributed to the German poet Schiller) has an unfortunate meaning which isdeeply true today. For thousands of years, the horse was forced to serve man andhelp him lay the foundations of a civilization. Now, thanks to the automobileand mechanical devices, the horse himself has become unnecessary. Within a fewyears, the horse will no longer be used, but without his help in days gone by,man would have had difficulty in arriving where he is today.Therefore, the availability of inferior races was one of the most importantelements in the formation of higher cultures. Their labor could compensate forthe lack of technical tools and machines, without which advanced development isunthinkable. Without question, the first civilization of humanity depended lesson domesticated animals and more on the use of racially inferior human beings.It was the enslavement of conquered races which occurred first; only later didanimals find the same fate and not the other way around, as many people wouldlike to think. First, it was the conquered man who drew the plow and only laterdid the horse take his place. Only whining fools and pacifists can consider thisfact a sign of human degradation. This progression had to take place in thisorder so man could finally arrive at a point where these apostles can stand upand make the world listen to their crowing.Mankind's progress is like climbing an endless ladder. To climb higher you mustfirst climb over the lower rungs. Therefore, the Aryan had to follow the roadrequired by reality and not that road dreamed up in the imagination of themodern pacifist. The road of reality is harsh and difficult, but it is the onlyone that finally leads where the pacifist dreams mankind should be, but inreality he is removing the possibility of achieving that dream. The real truthis that those dreamers only lead man away from his goal, not towards it.It is no accident that the first civilizations arose where the Aryan encounteredand conquered lower races and made them do his will. The inferior races were thefirst mechanical tools to serve a dawning civilization.The road which the Aryan must travel was clearly marked. As a conqueror, hedefeated the inferior peoples and controlled their physical labor under hisorders, according to his will, and for his own purposes. In putting them to auseful, but hard task, he not only spared the lives of the conquered, but gavethem a fate that was actually better than their previous socalled \"freedom\". Aslong as he ruthlessly maintained a master's attitude, he remained not only thereal master, but he preserved and advanced the new civilization. This newcivilization depended entirely on his inborn abilities and on the survival ofthe Aryan race. When those who had been conquered began to advance themselves,possibly to the level of using their conqueror's language, the sharp splitbetween master and servant disappeared. The Aryan surrendered the purity of hisblood by intermingling, and lost the right to the Paradise which he had made forhimself. His racial purity declined as it mixed with the native races andgradually he lost more and more of his cultural creativity until finally, hebegan to resemble the natives more than his own forefathers, both mentally andphysically. For a time, he could still live on the cultural substance he hadbuilt, but then stagnation set in and finally, oblivion claimed his race.The ultimate result is that civilizations and empires collapse to make way fornew structures. Mixing of blood and the decline in racial quality that it causesis the main reason for the dying-out of old cultures. Civilizations are notdestroyed by war but because they lose that stamina inherent in a purebloodline. Anything in this world that is not of sound racial stock is a uselesshusk which is blown away in the wind. Every event in world history is anexpression of the racial instinct for selfpreservation, whether for prosperityor suffering. The question of why the Aryan is so important is found in how hisinstincts are expressed and not because he has a stronger instinct forselfpreservation.The individual's will to live is equally great everywhere. Only the actual formit takes will vary. In the most primitive creatures, the instinct ofselfpreservation does not go beyond caring for itself. This selfishness extendsto include time, so that the immediate moment is the most important and nothingis planned for the future. In this state, the animal lives for itself alone,seeks food when it is hungry, and fights only when forced to defend its ownlife. As long as the instinct of selfpreservation takes this form, there is nobasis to form a community or even a primitive family.Once the partnership between male and female becomes a true partnership, notjust for the purpose of mating, it then requires that the selfpreservationinstinct be extended. The care and struggle for only self now extends to protectthe mate. The male often hunts for food, but when a child is produced, they willboth work to feed their young. One will almost always fight to defend the other.This exemplifies the first forms of selfsacrifice, even though this isinfinitely primitive. When this feeling spreads beyond the limits of theimmediate family, we have the essentials required for the formation of largergroups, and finally, of nations.In the most primitive men on earth, this quality is present only to a verylimited degree, often not going beyond the formation of the family. As thewillingness to put aside purely personal interests increases, the more advancedthe ability to set up extensive communities will become.This will to sacrifice, to devote personal labor and, if necessary, life itselfto others, is most highly developed in the Aryan. The Aryan's greatest power isnot in his mental qualities necessarily, but in the extent of his readiness todevote all his abilities to the service of the community. In him, the instinctof selfpreservation can reach its noblest form because he willingly subordinateshis own ego for the prosperity of the community and is even willing to sacrificehis own life for it, if necessary.The reason for the Aryan's constructive ability and especially his ability tocreate civilizations does not lie in his intellectual gifts. If he only hadintellectual abilities, they might easily be destructive and he would never beable to organize and build. The essential character of the individual depends onhis ability to forfeit his personal opinions and interests and to offer theminstead for the service of the community. Only by serving his community andassuring its prosperity does he receive his own rewards. He no longer works onlyfor himself, but takes his place within the structure of the community, not onlyfor his own benefit, but for the benefit of all. The most wonderfuldemonstration of this spirit is through Work. He understands that his labor isnot just for his livelihood, but his labor serves the interests of the communitywithout conflicting with community's interests. Otherwise, the goal of his workis only selfpreservation without consideration for the welfare of the community.In such a case his work for his own self-interest would be properly calledtheft, robbery, burglary, or usury.This spirit of placing the community's prosperity before the self-interests ofone's own ego, is the first essential element for every truly human culture. This spirit alone has brought about all the great works of humanity. It bringsonly a small reward to the originator, but rich blessings to future generations.This alone makes it possible to understand how so many people can bear a shabbybut honest life filled with nothing but poverty and insignificance; they knowthey are laying the foundation for the existence of the community. Everyworkman, every peasant, every inventor, and every civil servant who laborswithout ever attaining happiness and prosperity is a pillar of this high ideal,even though the deeper meaning of his actions are forever hidden from him.What is true about work as the basis of human survival and of all human progressis true to an even higher degree when it is done for the protection of man andhis civilization. The surrender of one's own life for the existence of thecommunity is the height of all selfsacrifice. Only in this way can we assurethat what we have built is not destroyed by Nature or human hands.Our German language has a word that precisely and splendidly describes thatprinciple: Pflichterfüllung or performance of duty. That means service to thecommon good of the community ahead of personal self interests. The fundamentalspirit that creates this action is what we call idealism. It is the opposite ofegotism or selfishness. It means exclusively the individual's ability tosacrifice himself for the community, for his fellowmen. It is necessary for usto realize that idealism is not superficial emotional gut-reaction orhumanitarianism, but that it is, was, and always will be the necessaryprecondition for what we call human civilization. It is the source that providesmeaning to the word \"human\". To this spirit, the Aryan owes his position in thisworld, and to the Aryan the world owes the creation of \"mankind\". For thisspirit alone shaped a creative force from a pure mind, which was a uniquemarriage of muscular power and great intellect and this built the monuments ofhuman civilization.Without its idealistic spirit, all the mental capabilities of the mind, nomatter how brilliant, would remain mere inner thoughts or technical knowledgewithout any outward expression of the inner value and therefore it would neverbecome a creative force.True idealism is the subordination of one's self, of the individual's interestand life to the community; which is in accordance with the ultimate will ofNature. This is the first essential element for the development of any kind oforganization. It leads men voluntarily to recognize the dominance of power andstrength and makes them into grains of sand within the realm of creation fromwhich the whole universe is made. The purest idealism unconsciously becomes theperfect counterpart to the most profound wisdom.We can immediately see how true this is and how little genuine idealism has todo with a fantasy-utopia by asking an unspoiled child, a healthy boy, forinstance.This boy can listen to the rantings of an \"idealistic pacifist\" withoutunderstanding a word he says, but the same boy will immediately be ready to turnon his heel and sacrifice his young life for the ideal of his people.This willingness results from an instinct in the unconscious which obeys adeeper understanding, a need to preserve the species at the expense of theindividual if necessary. He naturally protests against the prophetic speech ofthe pacifist, who tries to disguise himself as something other than the selfishcoward that he is, and is constantly seeking ways to violate the laws of Nature.It is a necessary part of human evolution that the individual has a spirit ofselfsacrifice which favors the prosperity of the community and not on thedisgusting dreams of cowardly wise guys and critics who pretend to know morethan Nature and seek to violate her decrees.When self-interest threatens to replace idealism, we notice an immediateweakening in the force that maintains the community. When the community breaks,so falls civilization. Once we let self-interest become the ruler of a people,the bonds of social order are broken. When man focuses on chasing his ownhappiness, he falls from Heaven straight to Hell.Future generations do not remember the men who pursued their own self-interests,but they glorify the heroes who sacrifice their own happiness.The most extreme contrast to the Aryan is the Jew. The selfpreservation instinctis developed more strongly in the socalled \"chosen people\" than in any otherpeople in the world. The best proof of this is the mere fact that the race stillexists. What other people have undergone so few changes of mind and of characterin the last two thousand years as the Jew? What people have gone through greaterupheavals and yet always come through the most tremendous catastrophes ofhumanity unchanged? An infinitely tenacious will to live and to preserve one'sspecies is demonstrated by this fact! The intellectual qualities of the Jew havebeen trained through thousands of years. He is considered \"cunning\" today and,in a certain sense, always has been. But his intellectual ability is not theproduct of his own evolution, but of object-lessons from others. The human mindcannot climb without steps on which to stand. The spirit requires successivesteps to climb upward. Every upward stride needs a foundation, one which is laidin the developments of the past, and this can only be found in a civilization ofpeople. Knowledge rests only to a small degree on one's own experience andpredominately relies on the accumulated past experiences and knowledge ofothers. The general level of civilization provides the individual with thiswealth of preliminary knowledge which allows him to easily take further steps ofprogress on his own. This is primarily done without the individual even beingaware of it. The boy of today, for instance, grows up surrounded by an absolutemultitude of technical achievements from past centuries. He takes theseachievements for granted, without noticing things that only a hundred years agowere a mystery to the greatest minds. However, these achievements are criticallyimportant to him if he is ever to understand our progress in a certain area orto improve on it. If a genius from the 1820's were suddenly to return from thegrave today, he would encounter a monumental intellectual adjustment before hecould hope to understand present time. Facing a new piece of technology would bemore difficult and confusing for the genius than it is for a modern averagefifteen-yearold boy. This genius would lack all the endless preliminaryknowledge which the present day population absorbs automatically, as they growup among the technological products of their particular civilization.For reasons which will immediately be apparent, the Jew has never possessed aculture of his own and the basis for his knowledge has always been furnished bythe civilizations of others.In every age, his intellect has developed by using the civilization surroundinghim. The reverse of that process has never taken place. The selfpreservationinstinct of the Jewish people is greater than that of other peoples. Even iftheir intellectual powers at first appear to be equal to other races, theycompletely lack the all important requirement of a civilized people, the spiritof idealism.The Jewish people's willingness to selfsacrifice does not go beyond the basicinstinct of individual selfpreservation. Their strong feeling of racialsolidarity is based on a very primitive \"herd\" instinct like you see in manyother forms of life. It is worth mentioning that this herd instinct leads tomutual support only as long as a common danger makes it seem useful orunavoidable. The same pack of wolves which a moment before was united indevouring its prey breaks up into individuals once their hunger has beensatisfied. The same is true of horses. They will band together in order todefend themselves against attack and then scatter again when the danger is past.The same holds true for the Jew. His apparent will to selfsacrifice isdeceptive. It exists only when the life of each individual is at stake and analliance becomes absolutely necessary for the preservation of the individual.The moment the common enemy is defeated, the common danger avoided, or theplunder secured, the apparent harmony of the Jews' pact among themselves comesto an end, giving way once more to their original natural tendencies.The Jews are in agreement only when a common danger forces them, or when acommon prey tempts them. When they are not faced with either case, their mostinsensitive selfish qualities take over and in an instant, these united peoplebecome a swarm of rats carrying on bloody battle, bitterly fighting against eachother.If the Jews were alone in the world, they would smother in filth and slop andwould try to outwit and exterminate one another in a bitter battle. However, thelack of any willingness for selfsacrifice and the expression of their owncowardice turns even this battle into a pretense.It is a complete mistake to assume an idealistic selfsacrifice is seen in theJews when they come together to fight, or rather, when they come together toexploit their fellowmen. Even here, the Jew is guided by nothing but blatantindividual selfishness. For that reason, the Jewish \"State\", which should be avital organization aimed at the preservation and increase of a race, has noboundaries. In order to have definite borders for a state, which give itstructure, one must have an idealistic spirit within the state's race and aproper understanding of the idea of labor. Any attempt to form or even topreserve a state that has no boundaries will fail if this attitude towards workis missing. Without a State, the sole foundation which a culture needs to growdisappears. Despite the Jewish people's apparent intellectual qualities, theystill have no true civilization, at least not a civilization of their own.Whatever pretense of a civilization the Jew possesses today, comes from thecontribution of other races, mostly those who were damaged by them.In order to judge the place Jewry holds in human civilization, we must alwaysremember that there has never been any Jewish art and there is none today. Thetwo Queens of the Arts, architecture and music, owe nothing original to Jewryfor it has contributed nothing and created nothing. What Jewry accomplishes inthe field of art is either a shorter and simpler version of existing works oroutright copies of the intellectual products of others. In other words, the Jewlacks those qualities which distinguish that creative and culturally favoredrace who are the founders of civilization, the Aryans.We can see the extent the Jew's usurp a civilization created by others, or to bemore accurate how they corrupt it, if we look where he is seen most frequently,in the art which depends the least on personal originality and requires nooriginal invention, by which I mean the dramatic arts. Even here, he is reallyonly using tricks to re-arrange the work of others, he can more correctly becalled a monkey-grinder (Meaning the organ-grinder man of the time period, astreet performer of questionable morality who cranks a barrel-organ playing arepetitive tune as his monkey collects tips from the crowd.) He lacks the finaltouch of greatness or flair which is necessary to produce a truly great work. Heis not the brilliant creator, but the superficial imitator, and all hisretouching and little tricks cannot hide the fact that everything he produceslacks energy or life.Then the Jewish press provides its loving aid and shouts such high praises overevery clumsy and inadequate performer, no matter how mediocre, as long as he isa Jew. The press makes him sound so amazing and wonderful that the rest of theworld is fooled into believing it is in the presence of a real artist, but intruth, the man is nothing more than a low-class mime. The Jew possesses nocivilization-building power. He has none and never did have the idealismrequired to improve and develop mankind. Consequently, his intellect is neverconstructive, but will always be destructive. In very rare cases, his intellectmay seem, at best, a stimulus, but even then we see how it becomes twisted intothe model for the poet's words: \"The power whose will is always evil but whoends up doing good\". (Originally in German: kraft, die stets das böse will undstets das gute schafft, is a paraphrase of a riddle from Faust which, based onwhat is happening in the play where Mephistopheles makes this statement, appearsto imply here that Jews do bad things which have the unintentional result ofproducing something good.) It is not through the Jew's assistance that humanityprogresses, but in spite of him.Since the Jew has never had a state with definite territorial boundaries andcould never call a civilization his own, some have said they are nomads.That idea is a deceptive mistake. The nomad definitely has a clearly definedterritory, although he does not cultivate; however, he is unlike the farmer whosettles on a piece of land. Instead he lives off his herds which he follows asthey wander about his territory. The reason he wanders is because the soil isinfertile and therefore cannot support a settlement. The deeper cause, however,lies in the lack of a technical civilization which is needed to compensate forthe sparse resources. There are areas where development has taken place overmore than a thousand years, and it was only possible because of the technologyof the Aryan, who is able to make himself the master over large areas andestablish solid settlements that can support him. If he did not have thistechnology, he would either have to avoid these areas or live as a constantlywandering nomad. That is if, after thousands of years of living with histechnical developments, the idea of a sedentary nomadic life was not intolerableto him. We must remember that at the time when the American continent was beingsettled, many Aryans struggled for a livelihood as trappers and hunters etc.They were often in large groups with their wives and children and always on themove. Their existence was exactly like that of nomads. But, as soon as theirnumbers grew to a certain point and better equipment made it possible to tamethe land and resist the natives, more and more settlements sprang up throughoutthe country.The Aryan was probably the original nomad and, over the course of time, settledin one place. But even so, he was never a Jew! No, the Jew is not a nomad. Eventhe nomad had a definite concept of \"work\", which would serve as the basis whichhe built his civilization on. There is a certain amount of idealism in theattitude of the nomad, even though it is primitive. His whole nature may beforeign to the Aryan, but it is not disgusting to him. However, this attitudesimply does not exist in the Jew. Therefore, the Jew has never been the nomad,but instead has always been a parasite fattening himself on the body of otherpeoples. The fact that he has abandoned previous regions was not by choice. Hewas driven out by his hosts who had become tired of having their hospitalityabused by these \"guests\". Jewish expansion is an act typical of all parasites.He is constantly looking for a new land for his race.This has nothing to do with being a nomad because the Jew never dreams ofleaving an area or vacating a territory once he is there. He stays where he is,and he holds on to it so intently that he is very hard to get rid of even byforce. He only spreads to new countries when conditions necessary for hisexistence attract him. However, unlike the nomad, he doesn't change his previousresidence. He remains a typical parasite, spreading like a harmful bacteriawherever he finds a suitable place to grow. The effect of this parasite,wherever he happens to be, causes the host nation to die off sooner or later.The Jew has always lived in the states of other races and within that state hehas created his own state. This state within a state sailed under the colors ofa \"religious community\" and continued to do so as long as he was not forced toreveal his true nature. Once he thought he was strong enough and no longerneeded to hide, he would drop the veil and suddenly all would see what so manyhad refused to see and to believe previously, the real character of the Jew.The Jew's life as a parasite within the body of other nations and states is theorigin of an unusual characteristic which caused Schopenhauer (ArthurSchopenhauer, the German philosopher) to describe the Jew as the \"great masterof lies\". This kind of existence drives the Jew to lie and to lie regularly andmethodically in an orderly, businesslike way which comes as naturally to them aswarm clothes to those who live in cold climates.His life within a nation can only continue if he convinces the people that Jewsare not a separate people, but merely a \"religious community\", although anunusual one. But this itself is the first great lie.In order to carry on his existence as a parasite among other nations, he mustconceal his inner character. The more intelligent the individual Jew is, themore successful his deception will be. This deception may even convince parts ofthe host nation that the Jew is really a Frenchman, an Englishman, a German, oran Italian, just a person of a different religious persuasion. Governmentoffices are particularly easy victims of this notorious trick becausebureaucrats have little sense when it comes to history and only react to afraction of actual history. In such circles, independent thinking is oftenconsidered a sin against sacred rules that determine who is promoted and who isnot. Because of this, we must not be surprised that the Bavarian State Ministry,for instance, even today doesn't have the faintest idea that the Jews aremembers of a separate people and not of a simple \"religious group\".One glance at the world of Jewish newspapers immediately proves this, even tosomeone of the most ordinary intellect. Of course, the Jewish Echo (a Jewishnewspaper) is not yet an official government journal, so in the mind of thesegovernment officials they have no need to read it.Jewry has always been a nation with definite racial characteristics and it hasnever been identified solely as a religion. Their need to advance in the worldcaused the Jew to search for a method that would distract undesirable attentionfrom its members. What could have been more effective and more innocent inappearance than a religious community? Even here, everything is borrowed, orrather stolen. The Jew could never create a religious institution on his ownbecause he lacks any form of idealism which would be needed to create such acover. The lack of idealism means that a belief in any life hereafter isabsolutely foreign to him. According to the Aryan concept, no religion could beconceived that lacks a belief in some form of life after death. In fact, theTalmud (the record of Jewish Law, ethics, customs, and history) is a book thatexplains how to prepare for a practical and prosperous life in this world and itsays nothing about preparation for the hereafter.The Jewish religious teachings consist mainly of rules to keep the blood of Jewspure and to regulate the dealings of Jews among themselves and even more withthe rest of the world, with the nonJews. Even here, their rules consist ofextremely petty economic guides and are not concerned with ethical problems. Fora long time, there have been very detailed studies made which reviewed the moralvalue of Jewish religious teachings. These studies were certainly not made byJews because the Jews twist their statements to suit their own purpose. TheAryans who conducted these studies found this kind of \"religion\" to bedetestable. The clearest indication of what this religious education can produceis the Jew himself. His life is only concerned with this world and his innerspirit is as foreign to true Christianity as his nature was two thousand yearsago to the great Founder of the new teaching Himself, Jesus Christ. Jesus madeno secret of His feelings toward the Jewish people, and even used the whip todrive this rival out of the Lord's temple. Even then, the Jewish religion wasjust a means to make money as a business. Christ was nailed to the cross for hisintolerance of the Jews, while our present Christian political parties lowerthemselves in elections by begging for Jewish votes. Afterwards, they try tohatch deceitful political plots with the Jewish atheist parties and against itsown nationality.On this first and biggest lie, that Jewry is not a race but a religion, the Jewbuilds subsequent lies. To him, language is not a way to express his thoughts,but a way to conceal them. When he speaks French, his thinking is Jewish. Whilehe is fabricating German rhymes, nothing he says can be believed because he isjust expressing the nature of his own race, that of the lie. As long as the Jewhas not become the master of the other peoples, he must speak their languages,but the instant they become his slaves, they will have to learn an artificialuniversal language like Esperanto (Esperanto is an artificial internationallanguage based on word roots common in Europe) so that Jewry could rule themmore easily.The whole existence of these people completely depends on one continuous lie andthis is uniquely proven in the \"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\" (which is anantisemitic work outlining a plot by Jewish and Masonic elements to achieveworld domination. Today the manuscript is known to be a forgery)that is sobitterly hated by the Jews. The Frankfurter Zeitung (the Frankfurt Newspaper)keeps groaning to the world they are a forgery which is the best proof that theyare genuine. What many Jews wish to do unconsciously is consciously made clearhere. It does not matter what Jewish mind these revelations come from. Whatmatters is that they uncover the nature and activity of the Jewish people withabsolutely horrible accuracy and show their inner connections, as well as theirultimate goal. This book shows how the Jewish mind works, and the activitiesdescribed, as well as the methods, are characteristic of the Jewish people. Thebest test of the authenticity of these documents is by studying current events.Anyone who examines the historical development of the last hundred years withthe revelations in this book will immediately understand why the Jewish press isso upset and denounces it constantly. Once the contents of this book have becomegeneral public knowledge, the Jewish threat can be considered destroyed.In order to know the Jew properly, it is best to study the road he has takenthrough other nations during recent centuries. It will be enough to followthrough one example in order to fully understand. Since his career has alwaysbeen the same, just as the peoples he devours have remained the same, in theinterest of simplicity we will break up his development into definite steps,which I will indicate by letters of the alphabet.The first Jew came to what is now Germany during the advance of the Romans. Asalways, they came as traders. During the turmoil resulting from the greatmigration of German tribes, they seemed to disappear again. Jews reappeared withthe first formation of a Germanic state and this may be considered the beginningof the new, and this time permanent, Jew infiltration of Central and NorthernEurope. The same process has occurred wherever Jewry came into contact withAryan peoples.Letter A. With the foundation of the first permanent settlement, the Jew issuddenly \"there\". He appears as a trader at first and does not bother to hidehis nationality. He lives openly as a Jew. This is evident because of theextreme physical racial difference between him and his hosts. His knowledge ofthe local languages is minimal, and the clannish nature of the local people istoo strong for him to risk appearing to be anything but a foreign trader. Withhis cunning he knew his lack of experience in the host nation was nodisadvantage, but rather an advantage, so it was in his interest to retain hischaracter as a Jew. The stranger finds a friendly reception among his hosts.Letter B. Gradually he begins to take an active role in the local economy, butnot as a producer. He acts solely as a middleman. His skillfulness has been athousand years in the making, which altered his commercial cunning andnegotiation skills so that they were far superior to the Aryans. The Aryans arestill inexperienced and clumsy when it comes to business, but their honesty hadno limits. Within a short time, trade threatens to be monopolized by the Jews.He begins by lending money at extremely high interest rates. He actually startedthe practice of charging interest on borrowed money. The danger of this newmethod of borrowing was not recognized at first and it was even welcomed for itprovided short term advantages.Letter C. The Jew settled down by this point and he now occupied a specialsection, his own market-places in the cities and towns, forming more and more ofa state within a state. He viewed all trade and all money related business to bea privilege provided exclusively by him and he ruthlessly exploited it.Letter D. Finance-related businesses and trade in goods have now become hisprivate monopoly. His ridiculously high interest rates finally begin to arouseopposition. His growing boldness became offensive and his disrespect stirredresentment. His display of wealth further ignites envy. It is the last strawwhen he begins to include the very soil of the earth in his realm of profit anddegrades land into a commodity to buy, trade and sell. He never cultivates thesoil himself and regards it only as an object of development for profit. Heallows the peasants to continue to live upon \"his\" property, but they mustsubmit to the most wicked and excessive demands from their new master. Thedislike of the Jew gradually rises until it becomes open hatred. Hisbloodsucking domination grows so extreme that the people ultimately resist histyranny with violence. People scrutinized the alien more and more closely andthey continued discovering new, disgusting traits and characteristics until thegap between the Jews and their hosts is too wide to be bridged.In times of great public distress, we see the hatred and rage against the Jewsurface. The robbed masses take the law into their own hands and recover theirproperty from the Jew which ruins him and frees themselves of what they believeis an affliction sent by God. In the course of centuries, they have come to knowthe Jew and in times of trouble, they saw his very existence as a danger likethe plague.Letter E. Now the Jew begins to reveal his true character. Using the disgustingtool of flattery, he pays homage to governments, puts his money to work to digdeeper into the community, and in this manner keeps his license to rob hisvictims. Even though the people's rage against the perpetual leech often blazesup, that does not stop him from returning again a few years later in the sametown and resuming his old life all over again. No amount of persecution changedhis ways and he continued taking advantage of men. No matter how loudly thepeople shouted and yelled, no one could run him off.Every time the Jew is chased away, he soon returns and is up to his old tricksagain. To prevent the very worst from happening, Jews were forbidden by law frompossessing land.Letter F. As the power of the princes and kings grew, the Jew elbowed his waycloser and closer to them. He begs for deeds to property and for specialprivileges. The noble lords were always facing financial problems which made iteasy for him to obtain these courtesies once he has made satisfactory payment.It did not matter what this cost him because, within a few years, he knew hewould receive his money back with interest compounded many times. This Jew is anabsolute leech who fastens himself to the body of the unfortunate people wherethey cannot remove him. There he feeds until the princes need money again and,with their own dignified hands, they draw off the blood he has sucked from thepeople. This game keeps repeating itself. The role the German princes played isjust as disgraceful as that of the Jews themselves. These rulers became thepunishment of God on their dearly beloved people and we can still find theirkind among the various government ministers of today. It is because of theGerman princes that the German nation could not free itself from the Jewishtroublemaker. Unfortunately, this never changed, so they received a reward fromthe Jew that they had earned a thousand times over for the sins they committedagainst their people. They associated with the devil and later found themselvesin his power.Letter G. The Jewish entanglement of the princes soon leads to their owndestruction. Slowly, but surely, their support among the people grows weaker asthey cease to represent the people's interests, and spend their time exploitingtheir subjects. The Jew carefully watched for the time when the princes wouldfall and when he sees it coming close, he does all he can to speed up thecollapse. He feeds their constant financial problems by preventing them fromhonoring their true duty to the people, by boot licking and using the mostblatant flattery, by introducing them to vices, and in the process he makeshimself more and more indispensable. His skillfulness, or rather deceitfulness,in all financial matters succeeds in sweeping, no, I should say horsewhipping,new funds from the robbed subjects. These exploited subjects find themselvesdriven down the road to poverty faster and faster. Each court has its \"CourtJews\", as the monsters are called, who torture the people to the point ofhopelessness and arrange the endless pleasures of the princes. How can anyone besurprised that these \"assets\" of the human race receive official honors andclimb into the upper class by joining their families, they not only makenobility look ridiculous, but they actually contaminate it from the inside.Now the Jew is in a better position, politically and socially, to push his ownadvancement forward. Finally, he allows himself to be baptized and in doing sohe gains all the opportunities and rights of the native people. This act of\"business\" delights the churches which believe they have a new son of Faithamong their flock, and this business also delights Israel (the Jewish people,not the country, the country did not exist yet) when they see the successfulfraud they have accomplished.Letter H. In the world of Jewry, a transformation now begins to take place. Upuntil now, they have been Jews. That is to say that they had no interest inappearing to be anything else, and, in fact, could not have done so consideringthe very pronounced racial characteristics which differentiated them from thenative race. As late as the time of Frederick the Great (in the mid to late1700's), everyone regarded Jews as an \"alien\" people. Even Goethe(JohannWolfgang von Goethe, a famous German writer) was horrified at the thought thatsomeday, marriage between Christian and Jew may no longer be legally forbidden.Goethe, Heaven knows, was no extreme conservative and not against progress andcertainly not a blind follower of philosophy. What he felt was nothing but thevoice of blood and reason. His race's blood and common sense spoke the truth tohis ears. Even without all the disgraceful actions occurring in the RoyalCourts, the people instinctively saw the Jew as a foreign substance in its ownbody and formed an appropriate attitude in response.Now was the time for a change to take place. Over the course of more than athousand years, the Jew has learned the language of his hosts so well that heshows his Judaism less and dares to put his \"German\" side in the foreground. Asridiculous and stupid as it may at first seem, he has the audacity to transformhimself into a \"Teuton\" (an ancient German or a speaker of the German language)or an actual \"German\". This was the beginning of one of the most notoriousdeceptions that can be imagined. Since he possesses none of the qualities ofGerman character and can only abuse and twist its language and otherwise hasnever mixed with the Germans to absorb their character traits, his ability topretend to have a German identity depends on his ability to emulate the languagealone. A race is not bound by their language, but entirely by their blood. Thisis something the Jew knows better than anyone. The Jew doesn't care about thepreservation of his own language, but he does care deeply about the purity ofhis blood. A man may change languages and easily learn a new one, but his newlanguage will only express his old ideas. His inner nature is not changed. Thebest proof of this is the Jew, who can speak a thousand languages, and yet hisJewish nature remains intact; he is the same Jew. His characteristics havealways been the same, whether he spoke Latin two thousand years ago as a grainmerchant at Ostia (Ostia Antica, an ancient Roman trading harbor city) ormumbles German gibberish today as a middle man pushing adulterated flour. It isstill the same Jew. It can be taken for granted that this obvious fact is notunderstood by an average clerk's supervisor at any government office or by apolice administrator today since there is hardly anything with less instinct andintelligence running at large than these civil servants chosen by our presentmodel of a government.The reason why the Jew suddenly decides to become a \"German\" is obvious. Hefeels the power of the princes slowly beginning to waver, and acts to strengthenhis own standing. His financial domination over the entire economic system hasalready advanced to a point that it can grow no further until he gains the fullrights of a citizen. He can no longer support the entire enormous structure andhis influence cannot increase anymore without this critical piece. But not onlydoes he want to preserve what he has, he wants to expand further. The higher heclimbs, the more tempting his old goal becomes, just as it was promised to himin ancient times. With intense greed and wide eyes, his alert mind sees thedream coming within reach again; the dream of ruling the world. All his effortsare directed towards becoming a full citizen which gives him full possession ofcivil and political rights.This is why he cleansed himself from the Jewish Ghetto--so he could become afull citizen.Letter I. Through this process the Court Jew gradually developed into thepeople's Jew. This does not mean he lives among the people; no, it means thatthe Jew remains among the noble lords as always and, in fact, tries more thanever to worm his way deeper into their ruling circle. At the same time, anotherpart of his race begins to use flattery as their tool to gain approval with thegood, common people. When we consider what sins the Jew has committed againstthe masses throughout the centuries, how he has persistently squeezed and suckedthem dry, how the people gradually learned to hate him for it, and how thepeople finally came to see his existence as a punishment on them from Heaven, wecan understand how difficult this transformation must be for the Jew. Yes, it ishard work to suddenly stand in front of those victims you whipped raw andpresent yourself as a \"friend of humanity\".He begins by attempting to make amends in the eyes of the people for hisprevious crimes. He starts his transformation by donning the cloak of a\"benefactor\" to humanity. Since his new benevolence is very evident, he isobviously unable to follow the teachings of the old quote from the Bible thatthe left hand should not know what the right hand is giving (Matthew 6:3,meaning do not flaunt generosity, not even in your own mind.) He feels compelledto let as many people as possible know how deeply he feels the sufferings of themasses and what personal sacrifices he is making to help them. With his innate\"modesty\" , the Jew drums his virtues into the minds of the rest of the worlduntil they actually begin to believe it is true. Anyone who does not accept thisbelief is considered to be bitter and unfair to him. Within a very short time,he begins to twist things to make it appear as if, up until now, it was he whohad suffered all of the wrongs and not the reverse. There were many particularlystupid people who believed him and could not help pitying the poor \"unfortunate\"Jew.This, incidentally, is the place to remark that with all his fondness forselfsacrifice, the Jew never becomes poor himself. He understands how to managehis money. His benevolence can be compared to the manure that a farmer spreadsin the field. The farmer does not spread the manure because he loves the field,but in anticipation of future benefits. In any case, everyone knows within afairly short time that the Jew has become a \"benefactor and philanthropist\".What a transformation! Generous actions are taken for granted in others but theycause astonishment and frequently even admiration in this case because it is sounusual for a Jew. People give him much more credit for these deeds than theywould give to any other member of humanity. More than this, the Jew willsuddenly become liberal and then he begins to babble about the necessaryprogress of humanity and how it should be encouraged. He slowly makes himselfthe herald of a new age.It is also true that more and more, he completely undermines the pillars of theeconomy which the people need the most. He used the stock exchanges to buyshares of the national companies thereby breaking in to the cycle of nationalproduction. He then changes production into an object to be bought and sold bybarter and exchange. This robs the factory workers of personal ownership. Withthe introduction of the Jew, the split between employer and employee occurs forthe first time. This later leads to political class resentment. Jewish influenceon economic affairs through the stock exchange grows with tremendous speed. Hebecomes the owner or at least the controller of the nation's labor force.To strengthen his political position, he tries to break down the racial andcivil barriers which still restrict him wherever he goes and which hamper hisadvancement. For this goal, he fights with all his native stubbornness tochampion religious tolerance. Freemasonry has fallen entirely into his hands andthrough it, he has found an excellent instrument to fight for his purposesopenly or gain them by secrecy. Governing circles, as well as the higher levelsof the political and economic privileged class, have fallen into his Masonictrap without them even realizing it.The particular group of people who were beginning to become aware of their ownpower and fight for their rights and freedom are the only ones who cannot yet becontrolled by Jews and their deep level of influence across a wide range ofsociety. Implementation of this control is necessary more than anything elsebecause the Jew can only hope to be elevated to a ruling position if there issomeone ahead of him to lead the way, and he believes he sees this forerunner inthe privilegedclass, as long as he can sweep large numbers of them in. However,the glove manufacturers and fabric manufactures were not caught with thedelicate net of Freemasonry as the Jew had planned. Here, more coarse, but noless penetrating means were required. To Freemasonry, a second weapon is addedin the service of Jewry: the press.He pursues it with all the determination and skill he can muster. With the pressin his pocket, he slowly begins to control all of public life. He traps it,guides it and pushes it. He is in a position to create and direct a force thatis more familiar to us today than it was a few decades ago and we know it as\"public opinion\". At the same time, he claims he is infinitely thirsty forknowledge and praises all progress, but he especially praises that which leadsto the ruin of others. He judges all knowledge and every development based onwhat advantage it gives his own people. Where there is no advantage to him, hebecomes the unyielding, deadly enemy of all light and the hater of all trueculture. He uses all the knowledge he has learned from others exclusively in theservice of his race.He guards the Jewish nationality more than ever before. While he seems to beoverflowing with \"enlightenment\", \"progress\", \"freedom\", and \"humanity\", etc.,he practices the strictest isolation of his own race so they do not mix withothers. He may sometimes give one of his women to an influential Christian, butas a matter of principle he always keeps his male line pure. He poisons theblood of others, but preserves his own purity. The Jew almost never marries aChristian woman while the Christian takes the Jewess wife. But the bastards thatresult from this union always claim their place on the Jewish side. As a result,part of the higher nobility has deteriorated completely. The Jew knows this verywell and they steadily use this method to deceive and confuse the leadingintellectuals of his racial enemies. To disguise his actions and to soothe hisvictims, he talks more and more about the equality of all men, regardless ofrace and color. Eventually, the simpletons start to believe him.The whole character of the Jew has the stink of a foreign being; therefore, thegreat masses of the people do not fall into his snare so easily. He responds byhaving his press paint a picture of him that is completely false yet useful forhis purpose. In comic journals, for instance, great pains are taken to representthe Jews as a harmless little people who have their own unique peculiaritiesjust like everyone else. The comics portray a humorous, but always kind andhonest soul. In the same way, they are always careful to make him seeminsignificant rather than dangerous.His goal at this stage is the victory of democracy, or rather, establishingtotal dominance and rule by parliament which is democracy as the Jew understandsit. This is the system which is best fitted to his needs. It does away with thepersonal element and puts a majority of stupidity, incompetence, and cowardicein its place. The final result will be the downfall of the Monarchy, which willeventually happen.Letter J. The enormous change in economic development leads to a change in thesocial levels of the people. The small craftsmen slowly disappear as they arereplaced by factory workers. This makes it impossible for the individual workmanto win any independence in his existence. As a result, he sinks to the level ofa daylaborer. The industrial factory-worker finds himself in an existence wherehe is rarely ever in a position to create a livelihood that he can live off inhis later life. He is deprived of his future and destitute in the truest senseof the word. His old age is miserable and can hardly be described as any sort oflife.We faced a similar situation once before. It urgently demanded a solution and soone was found. A new social class had surfaced to join the manual laborer andthe craftsman. It was the officials and professional employees, particularly ofthe State. They too were a destitute class in the truest sense of the word. TheState finally found a way out of this unhealthy condition by providing to theState employee that which he could not prepare himself for in his old age. Theyintroduced pensions and retirement pay. Private enterprises slowly followed thisexample. Today, almost every regular employee, who is not a manual laborer,eventually draws a pension if the firm he worked for has grown. By providing forthe old age of the State civil servant, the State instilled in him an unselfishdevotion to duty, which was the finest characteristic of German officials beforethe war. An entire class who had no property was wisely saved from social miseryand assigned a proper place in the social structure of the nation.Now this question rises to face the State and nation again, this time on a muchlarger scale. Masses of people, even numbering into the millions, moved fromfarming communities into the large cities to earn their living as factoryworkers in the newly founded industries. The working and living conditions ofthe new class were worse than miserable. The mechanical transfer of the previouswork methods used by the old craftsmen or farmers to the new factory style wastotally unsuited to their habits or how they think. The daily activity thesegroups were accustomed to was completely different from the intense and constantoutput effort required from the industrial factory worker. Time previouslyplayed a small role to the craftsman, but with the new methods of factory work,time was more important than ever. The takeover of the old working hours by thelarge industrial enterprise was absolutely catastrophic. Past daily productionhad been small because present day intensive production techniques were notused. It was possible for a person to complete a fourteen or fifteen hour workday in the past, but the new system is beyond human endurance where every momentis used to the maximum. In fact, the result of this senseless transfer of oldworking hours to the new industrial activity was disastrous in two directions.First, worker health was shattered and faith in a higher justice was destroyed.Finally, there was the pitiful amount of worker pay on one hand which gave asuperior financial position to the employer on the other.In the country there could be no social problem since the master and worker didthe same work together and even sat together as they ate the same food. But thischanged as a new system gave a different status to masters and workers.The separation of employer and employee now seemed complete in every field oflife. The inner Judaization of our people can be seen by the lack of respect, ifnot contempt, given to manual workers. This is not the German way. The loss ofnational respect in our lives, which resulted from Judaization, transformed theold respect for the work of craftsmen into a definite contempt for any physicallabor at all. From the economic and social change grows a new group of laborersand factory workers who receive very little respect and some day we must askwhether the nation will have the strength to make a place for the new group insociety or whether the class differences will grow into a gap that can never bebridged.One thing was certain, the new social group did not include the troublemakers ofthe community; it included the strongest and most spirited part of our nation.As society became more complex, and as a result, more adulterated, the decayingand destructive effect failed to reach this class. The great masses of the newgroup were not yet touched by the poison of pacifist weakness, but were robustand even brutal when necessary.The privilegedclass paid no attention at all to this significant problem andwithout showing any concern they let events take their course. All the while,the Jew realized the limitless possibilities offered to him for the future. Onone hand, he organized capitalistic methods of human exploitation down to thelast detail. Then on the other, he crept up on the victims of his spirit andactivity to overcome them and gain their favor. Soon the Jew became the leaderof the battle against himself. I am speaking figuratively when I say \"againsthimself\" because the \"great master of lies\" always succeeds in making himselfseem innocent and throwing the blame on others. Since he had the audacity tolead the masses himself, it never occurred to the people that this could be themost legendary fraud of all time. And yet, it was.The new class barely had time to develop out of the economic transformationbefore the Jew clearly recognized it as the new forerunner that he could use toblaze the trail for his own further advancement. First, he used theprivilegedclass to strike against the farmbased economy which created thefactory worker. Now, he uses the factory worker against the privilegedclass.Just as his craftiness helped him acquire civil rights in the shadow of theprivilegedclass, now he hopes to find the road to his own power in the workers'struggle for existence.When the time arrives, the workers' only responsibility will be to fight for thefuture of the Jewish people. Without being aware of it, the laborer is put towork for the very power that he believes he is fighting against. He is led tobelieve he is acting against capitalism, and therefore he is easily made tofight for capitalism. The cry is heard against international capital, but thereal target is the national economy. The current economy must be destroyed sothat the international stock exchange can replace it on the corpse-strewnbattlefield, with Jewish financial world interests.To achieve his goal, the Jew proceeds as follows: he creeps up on the workers inorder to win their confidence, pretending to have compassion for their povertyand circumstances or even anger at their miserable lot in life. He is careful tostudy all the real or even their imagined problems. Then he arouses the desirefor change. With infinite shrewdness, he stirs up the urge for social justice,an innate desire that is sleeping within every Aryan. Once the fire is burning,the Jew turns it into hatred toward those more fortunate and puts the stamp of avery special WorldConcept on the battle; he builds a philosophy designed tocorrect social injustice. He founds the Marxist doctrine.By representing it as part of a series of socially justified demands, the Jew isable to spread his message and inspire the people all the more easily.But at the same time he provoked the opposition of decent people who rejectedthese demands after they recognized the fake philosophy, and distorted form usedto present the concepts. To these good people, it seemed fundamentally unjustand a goal that was impossible to accomplish. Under this covering of purelysocial ideas we find that extremely evil intentions are present. In fact, theyare openly presented, in full public view, with the most bold insolence. Thisdoctrine is an inseparable mixture of reason and absurdity, but it is alwaysarranged so that only the absurd parts could be put into practice and never theparts of reason. By its absolute denial of the personal value of the individualand of the nation and its racial substance, it destroys the basic foundations ofall human civilization which depends precisely on those factors. This is thetrue core of the Marxist WorldConcept , if this creature of a criminal mind canbe called a \"WorldConcept \". The destruction of individuality and race removesthe primary obstacle that prevented domination by the inferior man, the Jew.The very absurdity of the economic and political theories of Marxism give it anunusual characteristic. These pseudo-theories prevent intelligent people fromsupporting the cause, while the intellectually challenged and those who lack anyunderstanding of economics rush to it waving their flags furiously. Even thismovement needs intelligence in order to exist, but the intelligence driving themovement is \"sacrificed\" by the Jew from his own ranks as a glorious service tothe masses. A movement made up of laborers was thereby created but under Jewishleadership. It gives the impression that it aims to improve the conditions theworker lives under, but its true intent is to enslave him and thus totallydestroy all nonJewish peoples.In the circles of the socalled intellectuals, Freemasonry spread their pacifistteaching which paralyzed the instinct for national selfpreservation. This poisonwas then spread to the broad masses of workers as well as the privilegedclass bythe mighty and unceasing Jewish press. A third weapon of disintegration is addedto these two and is by far the most fearful. It is the organization of bruteforce. Marxism plans to attack and storm any shreds of social order it has notyet undermined and to complete the collapse which was started by the first twoweapons.The coordination of these forces is a work of art in itself. There is really noreason to be surprised if those very institutions that are always so fond ofposing as the embodiment of the somewhat mythical authority of the State fall toMarxism. With only a few exceptions, the Jew has always found the most willingtools for his work of destruction in our high and highest State officials. Theseofficials possess an attitude of crawling submissiveness towards those abovethem and arrogant haughty disdain for \"inferiors\". Those are as much marks ofthis class as its reprehensibly slow ability to understand, and that is exceededonly by an absolutely astonishing conceit which occasionally borders on amusing.But these are qualities which the Jew needs in our government offices andtherefore appreciates the most.In rough outline, the practical battle which now begins to take place is asfollows: in order to manage the ultimate goals of the Jewish struggle better,the Jew divides the Marxist organizations into halves. The Jew is not satisfiedwith economic world conquest but also demands political control. These twohalves seem to be separate, but are really one indivisible whole: the politicalmovement and the trade union movement.The purpose of the trade union movement is to assemble the recruits. In the hardbattle for existence, the worker wages war against the greed andshortsightedness of many employers, while the movement offers help andprotection and the possibility of forcing others to provide the worker withbetter living conditions. At a time when the State ignores him, the workercannot leave the defense of his human rights to the blind whim of officials whoare irresponsible and heartless, so he must take his defense in his own hands.The socalled nationalistic upper-middle and privileged classes, blinded by theirown financial interests, put serious obstacles in the way of this lifeand-deathfight by the worker. The employers of the middle and upper class not onlyresist, but often actually sabotages attempts to shorten inhumanely long workinghours, end child labor, provide security and safety to women, and improvesanitary conditions in factories and homes of the working class. While themiddle and upper classes impede the worker at every step, the shrewd Jew sideswith the people who are oppressed. He gradually becomes the leader of the tradeunion movement. This happens easily because he is not interested in a real andhonest correction of social abuses, but only in forming a blindly devotedeconomic fighting force that will shatter national economic independence. Thedirection of a sound social policy will always balance between the necessity ofpreserving the people's health on the one hand and of assuring an independentnational economy on the other hand. These two considerations are not part of theJew's plan, they are not even considered in this struggle, only their completeelimination is the purpose of his life. He does not want to preserve anindependent national economy; he wants to destroy it. Consequently, as leader ofthe tradeunion movement, he has no conscience or doubts to prevent him frommaking demands that go beyond their declared purpose, or making demands that areeither impossible to fulfill or would mean the ruin of the national economy. Hedoes not want to create a solid and tough race of people as followers. He needsa decayed herd ready for submission. This ultimate objective allows him to makethe most absurd and senseless demands because he knows that accomplishing themis unrealistic or impossible. Making these demands, which cannot beaccomplished, will never produce any change in the statusquo. At best, it wouldonly create unrest and turbulence among the masses. This, however, is what he isafter and not a real and honest improvement in social conditions.The Jew's leadership in trade unions will continue until either a massiveeducation campaign opens the eyes of the broad masses and enlightens them to thetrue source of their unending misery, or the State disposes of the Jew and hiswork. As long as the masses lack the ability to understand, and the Stateremains as indifferent as it is today, the masses will follow anyone who makesthe boldest promises in economic matters. In this, the Jew is a master and hehas no moral hesitations to interfere with his activities! In the trade unions,he soon defeats every competitor and drives them away. His inner nature ofgreedy brutality leads him to teach the union movement the most brutal use offorce. If anyone with sound judgment has been able to resist the Jewish traps,his defiance and wisdom are broken by terrorism. The success of this tool istremendous.By using the union, which might under other circumstances be a blessing to thenation, the Jew actually destroys the foundations of the national economy.The political organization works together the with trade union side. The tradeunions prepare the masses for political organization by using violence andpressure to force them into joining. Unions are also the financial source fromwhich the political organization feeds its enormous machine. Trade unions arethe instrument of control for the political activity of their members and itrecruits new members at large political demonstrations. In the end, it abandonsany interest in economic concerns and puts its primary weapon at the disposal ofthe political arm: refusal to work, a general mass strike.Through the formation of tradeunions and a political press, whose content istailored to the limited intellectual scope of the least-educated people, thepolitical and tradeunion organizations have created an instrument they can useto stir up the lowest level of the nation and drive them to commit rash actions.It is the task of the press to cater to the masses' lowest instincts; they makeno effort to lead people with positive ideals which might lift their minds abovethe swamp of their daily lives and lift their spirit to a higher level. This isa gamble which ultimately proves to be successful with the lazyminded and oftenself-important masses.It is this kind of press which attacks anything that might support nationalindependence, cultural values, and economic self-reliance using an absolutelyfanatical war of slander. It pounds away with particular hostility at all thosehonorable characters who will not bend to the Jewish assumption that they shouldbe dominated, or at those whose naturally inspired ability could threaten theJew. In order to be hated by the Jew, it is not necessary to challenge him. Themere suspicion that a man might someday stumble on the idea of opposition, orbecause of his superior genius, he might add to the strength and greatness of anation which the Jew finds hostile, is enough for the Jew to act against him.The Jew has a reliable instinct in such matters which will always sense theinnermost thoughts of those he deals with. His hostility toward anyone who doesnot share his thoughts, anyone he does not consider a kindred spirit, willflare, and they will be judged as his enemy. Since the Jew is not the victim butthe aggressor, he sees his enemy not only in the man who attacks, but also inany man who is capable of resisting him. The methods that he attempts to use tobreak down such bold, but respectable souls are not the methods one wouldconsider part of honorable battle. His choice of weapons are lying and slander.The Jew is not frightened by anything and his cruelty becomes enormous. As aresult of this, we shouldn't be surprised if our people someday view thepersonification of the Devil, the symbol of all evil, as the Jew himself. Theignorance of the broad masses when it comes to the inner nature of the Jew, andthe blindness and stupidity of our upper classes, makes the people an easyvictim of this Jewish campaign of lies. While natural cowardice makes the upperclasses turn away from any man the Jew attacks with lies and slander, stupidityor simplemindedness makes the broad masses believe everything they hear. TheState authorities either hide behind a wall of silence or prosecute the victimof an unjust attack just to put an end to the Jewish journalistic campaign, andthat is what usually happens. The procedure of quieting down any such trouble,which in the eyes of one of these jackassesinoffice, is supposed to maintaingovernmental authority and safeguard peace and good order. Gradually the Marxistweapon in the hands of the Jew becomes a constant bogey-man to decent people.Fear looms like a nightmare on the mind and soul of decent people. They begin totremble in front of the fearful enemy and in that moment they become his doomedvictims.Letter K. The Jew's domination of the State government seems so assured that hecan now openly admit his basic racial and political beliefs and publicly callhimself as a Jew again. One part of the Jewish race quite openly admits to beingan alien people, though not without lying again, even here.When Zionism ( a movement to create an independent Jewish State) tries toconvince the world that the racial self-determination of the Jew would besatisfied with the creation of their own State in Palestine, the Jews are onceagain craftily pulling the wool over the eyes of the stupid goyim (Goyim is anoffensive Jewish word meaning gentile or a non-Jew, also a reminder to theaudience that the Jews had an offensive word for them.) They never intended tobuild a Jewish State in Palestine, not for the purpose of living in it anyway.They just want an organization headquarters for their international swindlingand cheating with its own political power that is beyond the reach andinterference from other states. It would be a refuge for crooks who were exposedand a college for future swindlers.It is a sign of their growing confidence and security that some proclaimthemselves as part of the Jewish race and others are still falsely pretending tobe Germans, Frenchmen, or Englishmen. This impudence and the horrible way theyengage in relations with the people of other nations makes it obvious that theysee victory clearly approaching.The black-haired Jewish boy waits, with Satanic delight on his face, for thehour when he can corrupt the unsuspecting girl with his blood, and in seducingher, steal her from her people. The Jew will attempt to undermine the racialfoundations of the nation to be conquered using every means possible.The Jew steadily works to ruin women and girls so that he can break down thebarriers of blood on an even larger scale. It was the Jews who brought the negroto the Rhine. The motive behind this is clear and his intention is always thesame. He wants to destroy the hated white race through bastardization. Hecontinues to bring negroes in as a flood and force the mixing of races. Thiscorruption puts an end to white culture and political distinction and raises theJew up to be its masters. A racially pure people, which is conscious of itsblood, can never be defeated by the Jew. In this world, the Jew can only be themaster of bastards. This is why he continually tries to lower the racial qualityby poisoning the blood of individuals among the targeted peoples.The Jew begins to replace the political idea of democracy with that of adictatorship for the working class. In the organized masses who follow Marxism,the Jew finds he is holding a weapon that allows him to do without democracy andpermits him instead to conquer and rule the people through the iron hand of adictatorship. The Jew works systematically in two directions for the revolution:economically and politically. Any nation that violently resists his internalattack is surrounded by a net of countries which fall more easily. This ringforms a network of enemies around his target and incites the nation into war,and finally, if necessary, when the troops are on the battlefield, he raises theflag of revolution, right when the country is least prepared.Economically, the Jew shakes the State until its social services begin to sway.They become so costly that they are transferred away from national control andput under his financial control. Politically, he blocks funding and denies theState access to the resources it needs for selfpreservation, he destroys thefoundations of any national resistance or defense, he destroys faith in thegovernment leadership, he ridicules the nation's history, and he dragseverything that is truly great into the gutter.Culturally, the Jew corrupts art, literature, and theater. He makes fun ofnational sentiment, upsets all ideas of beauty and nobility and idealism andanything good. He drags people down into the realm of his own lowest nature.Religion is made ridiculous and morals and decency are represented as old andworn out. He continues his attack until the last support on which the nationalbeing must rest, which the nation needs if it is to fight for survival in thisworld, is gone.Letter L. Now the Jew begins the great and final Revolution. As he battles hisfinal few steps to political power, he tosses aside the few veils he stillwears. The democratic Jew, the popular Jew, become the \"Bloody Jew\", and hereveals himself as a tyrant over the people. Within a very few years, heattempts to eliminate the intelligent classes of the nation, and by robbing thepeoples of their natural, intellectual leadership, prepares them for the slave'sdestiny under his tyrannical dictatorship.The most horrible example of this tyranny is Russia, where the Jew has killed orstarved close to thirty million people, sometimes using inhuman tortures toenforce his savage fanaticism and assure domination over a great people. This isdone to satisfy a crowd of Jewish intellects and financier bandits. The end doesnot mean just the end of the freedom for the people oppressed by the Jew. Italso means the end of the Jew himself as these national parasites begin todisappear. After the death of the victim, the leech itself also dies sooner orlater.If we review all the causes of the German collapse, the failure to recognize therace problem and especially the Jewish menace, remains the ultimate and decisivefactor. Standing up under the defeats on the battlefield in August of 1918 wouldhave been child's play. They were nothing when compared to the victories of ourpeople in past battles. It wasn't those military defeats that led to ourdownfall. We were brought down by a power that had been preparing us for decadesto suffer these defeats. They systematically robbed our people of the politicaland moral instincts that allowed us to survive, the very qualities that give apeople the right to exist.By neglecting their responsibility to preserve the racial foundations of ournationality, the old Empire also discarded the only right that can give a peopletheir authority to live in this world. Nations who become mongrels or allowtheir people to be bastardized, have sinned against the will of EternalProvidence. Their collapse at the hands of a stronger force is not an injusticedone to them, instead it is the restoration of justice. If a people no longerrespect the qualities given to it by Nature, qualities which are deeply rootedin its blood, it surrenders its right to complain when its earthly existence isat an end.Every negative event in the world can be turned into a positive one. Everydefeat may father a later victory. Every lost war may be the cause of a laterresurgence. Every distress may inspire a new surge in man's willpower. A newspiritual rebirth may spring from every oppression, but this can occur only aslong as the racial blood is kept pure. The loss of blood purity by itself willforever destroy inner happiness and forever lowers man. The result of impuritycan never be eliminated from man's body and spirit.If we compare all the other problems we face in life against this one questionof race, we immediately realize how small those daily problems are.Those problems are all temporary and limited, but the preservation of bloodpurity continues for as long as there are men on this earth. All the significantsymptoms of decay before the war can be traced back to these basic racialcauses. Whether the question is one of universal justice, or of a massive warton economic life, or signs of cultural decline, or indications of politicaldegeneration, or one of defective school teachings, or one of negativeinfluences through the press, there is one truth that is present always andeverywhere--- the bottom line is that the source of our problems is a neglect ofour own people's racial concerns and a failure to see an approaching alienracial threat.Therefore, all attempts at reform, all social work and political efforts, alleconomic advancement, and all apparent increases in spiritual knowledge haveultimately failed to produce any results of value. The nation and that beingwhich makes it possible, the State, have failed to build inner strength. Theyhave not grown healthier, but have visibly wasted away from this disease. Allthe false prosperity of the old Empire could not hide the inner weakness, andevery attempt to strengthen the Empire was abruptly halted when this, the mostimportant question, was ignored and set aside.It would be a mistake to think that all of those who doctored the Germanpolitical body with various political ideas and their leaders were bad ormalicious men by nature. No matter what they did, their work was condemned tofail because, at best, they only saw the symptoms of our general sickness andtried to combat those obvious signs. They then walked blindly past the rootcause of this disease. Anyone who has calmly and systematically traced the oldEmpire's line of political development cannot help but realize that even whenthe German nation was unified and on the rise, its inner decay was already infull swing. Despite all the political successes that seemed to occur and anincreasing economic wealth, the general situation grew worse from year to year.Even the rising tide of Marxist votes at the Reichstag elections foreshadowedthe ever-approaching inner and outer collapse. The successes of the middle andupper class political parties meant nothing. This was not only because theycould not prevent the numerical growth of the Marxist flood, even when they hadsocalled victorious middle-upper class elections, but mostly because theyalready carried the seeds of degeneration within themselves. The upper classworld itself had no idea it was infected with the rotting flesh virus of Marxistideas. The occasional visible resistance to Marxism was usually due to envy andcompetition between ambitious leaders and not based on principals or beliefs bythose determined to fight to the bitter end. One figure alone fought throughoutthose long years with unshakable perseverance, and this figure was the Jew. TheStar of David rose higher as the will for the selfpreservation among our peopledisappeared.In August of 1914, the battlefield was not stormed by a solid nation with adetermined spirit. Only a small glimmer of the nation's selfpreservationinstinct remained as a result of the Pacifist-Marxist paralysis inflicted on ourpolitical body. In those days the enemy within remained unrecognized. Thisfailure to see the inner cause meant all outer resistance was useless. That iswhy Providence did not deliver a sword of victory as the reward, but insteadfollowed the law of eternal retribution. From this realization came the guidingprinciples and the tendency of our new Movement. We were convinced that, only byrecognizing these truths could we alone stop the decline of the German people,and lay a solid foundation on which a new state may someday exist. A state thatwill not be part of an alien machine of economic concerns and interests, but abeing of the people. A Germanic State in a German nation.12. EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATIONAL SOCIALIST GERMAN WORKERS' PARTYAt the close of this first volume, I want to describe the early development ofour movement and briefly discuss a number of the problems we faced. I do notintend to make this a full dissertation on the intellectual aims of themovement. The intent and mission of the new movement is so tremendous that theywill have to be discussed in their own volume. In that second volume, I willdiscuss at length the foundations of the movement's program and attempt toexplain what we mean by the word \"State\".By \"we\", I mean all the hundreds of thousands who see the same fundamental goalin their mind's eye, but can't find the perfect words to describe what is intheir heart. All great reforms have a unique aspect where, at first, one mansteps forward as a champion to represent many millions of supporters.His goal is the same as the heart's desire inside hundreds of thousands of menfrom centuries before. The world waits until someone finally appears as theherald of the masses to raise the flag of their deepest desire and lead them tovictory with a new idea.Millions have a strong desire in their hearts to see a radical change in thepresent condition of our nation. This fact is proven when we see the unhappinesssuffered by our people. This discontent is expressed in a thousand forms. Forone man, it is manifested as discouragement and despair. In another, it appearsas disgust, anger, and resentment. Still others may become indifferent as aresult of their profound discontent or their feelings may be expressed asviolent wrath. We can see even more of this inner discontent in the people whohave become election-weary and have quit dropping their ballot altogether, whileothers may seek refuge in fanatical left-wing extremes. Our young movement willappeal to all of these. Our aim was not to be an organization of the contented,satisfied and well-fed, but instead to unite the suffering and the discontented,the unhappy, and the dissatisfied, those who could not find peace. Above all,our organization must not float on the surface of the political body, but musthave its roots in the foundation of the people.Taken purely from a political standpoint, the nation had been torn in half by1918. One half, which was by far the smallest, includes the classes of theintellectuals and nobles. This class excludes all those who do physical labor.It is outwardly a nationalist group, but they cannot understand the meaning ofnationalism except as a very flat and feeble method to defend socalled Stateinterests. These interests seem to be identical with the interests of theMonarchy. This class tries to defend its ideas and aims with intellectualweapons that are both incomplete and shallow with only a superficial effect.Such weapons proved to be a complete failure when pitted against the enemy'sbrutality. With one violent blow, the ruling class of intellectuals was nowstruck down. Trembling in cowardice, it swallowed every humiliation from thecruel victor.The second class is the great mass of the workers united in, more or less,radically Marxist movements. These movements are determined to break down anyintellectual resistance using brute force. The Marxist movement does not haveany intention of being nationalist, but deliberately opposes any advancement ofnational interests, and equally supports all foreign oppression. This group isthe largest in number and strength. It, most importantly, includes thoseelements of the nation required for a national revival. Without them, a revivalis unthinkable and even impossible.By 1918, it was obvious that any recovery of the German people could only bepossible by restoring the nation's strength and then regaining outside power.This does not require arms as our leader class of \"Statesmen\" keep babbling, butstrength of will. At one time the German people had more than enough weaponry.Those tools were not enough to protect our freedom because the national instinctfor selfpreservation and the will to survive were missing. The best weapon is auseless, lifeless clump if there is no spirit ready, willing and determined tomake use of it. Germany became defenseless because the will to preserve thepeople's survival was absent and not because they lacked the weapons.Today, when our left-wing politicians, in particular, try to point todisarmament as the unavoidable cause of their cowardly, weakwilled, submissive,or more accurately traitorous foreign policy, there is only one answer to theirclaim: No. The truth is the other way around. Your antinational, criminal policyof surrendering national interests, was the reason you delivered up our arms.Now, you try to claim that a lack of arms is the reason why you behaved likedisgraceful wretches. This, like everything else you do, is a lie and a bogusclaim.This reproach must fall equally on the politicians of the Right. Thanks to theirmiserable cowardice, the Jewish gang that came into power in 1918 could stealthe nation's arms. They have no reason or right to refer to the presentdisarmament as the reason they are forced to exercise wise caution, which ispronounced \"cowardice\", when dealing with foreign policy matters. The nation'sdefenselessness is the result of their cowardice.The question of regaining German power is not \"How do we manufacture arms?\" thereal question is, \"How are we to produce the spirit that enables our people tobear arms?\" When a strong will rules the spirit of the people, they will find athousand ways, each of which ends with a weapon. Give a coward ten pistols and,in an attack, he will still be unable to fire a single shot. A wooden stick inthe hands of a courageous man is worth more than ten pistols in a coward'shands.Regaining our people's political power is mainly a matter of recovering ourinstinct for national selfpreservation. If for no other reason, this instinct isnecessary because, as shown by experience, any foreign policy decisions of thestate are guided less by the armaments on hand, and more by the real or supposedmoral strength of a nation. A nation's value in an alliance is determined by theexistence of an intense national will to survive and a heroic courage in theface of death, not by lifeless piles of armaments. An alliance is not madebetween arms, but between men."},{"pageContent":"The British will be the most valuable ally in the world as long as itsleadership and the spirit of the great masses permit the brutality anddetermination needed to fight a battle once it has begun, all the way through,to a victorious end, and using every means available, with completely recklessdisregard for the length of a commitment or the great sacrifices required. Aslong as this spirit stands strong, then the actual military armament availablecan be completely inadequate when compared to that of other nations and it willnot matter.If we realize that the restoration of Germany is a matter of regaining ourpolitical will for selfpreservation, then it is also clear that this can only beaccomplished by converting those who are deliberately antinational intonationalist masses and not by winning over elements which are alreadynationalists.As a young movement whose goal is the resurrection of a sovereign German State,we will have to direct our battle totally toward winning the great masses. Oursocalled \"nationalist leading class\" is so pitiful in general and even thoughits nationalist spirit may seem inadequate, there is no reason to expect seriousresistance to a strong nationalist domestic and foreign policy from them. Evenif the German privilegedclass, for narrow-minded and shortsighted reasons,should persist in passive resistance, as it did toward Chancellor Bismarck whenthe hour of deliverance was at hand, we still have no reason to fear an activeresistance because they are admitted and notorious cowards.The situation is different with the masses of our international finance-mindedfellow Germans. Not only does their more primitive roughness naturally draw themtoward violence, but their Jewish leadership is more brutal and ruthless, whichmeans they would not hesitate to use violence. They will strike down any Germanrevival just as they broke the backbone of the German army. They will not onlydo all they can to block any national foreign policy, thanks to their largenumbers in this State of parliamentary government, but they will block anyeffort to regain German strength and with it any possibility of beneficialalliances. We are not the only ones who recognize that our fifteen millionMarxists, Democrats, Pacifists, and Centrists, are a weakness. This sameobstacle is seen even more by foreign countries, who measure of the value of apossible alliance with us according to the weight of this handicap.No one is going to ally himself with a state in which the active part of itspopulation is, at the very least, passively against any decisive foreign policy.We must also face the fact that an instinct of selfpreservation will make theleadership of these parties of national treason hostile toward any solution;otherwise they would lose their current positions. A short look into historymakes it simply unthinkable that the German people could ever regain thenation's status without holding those who were responsible for the collapse ofour State accountable for their actions. When future generations sit injudgment, November of 1918 will not be seen as mere rebellion, but as hightreason against the nation. Any recovery of German sovereignty and politicalindependence is linked to our people's ability to recover their unified will.Even from a purely technical standpoint, the idea of a German liberation fromoutside control is obviously nonsense until the great masses are also ready tosupport this idea of freedom. From a purely military point of view, it must beclear, especially to any officer who gives it a little thought, that we cannotcarry on a foreign battle with student battalions. We need the strength andmight as well as the brains of the people. We must also keep in mind that anynational defense built solely on intellectual ranks is a waste of anirreplaceable treasure. The young German intellectuals who joined the volunteerregiments and met their deaths in the fall of 1914 on the plains of Flanderswere missed deeply later. They were the dearest treasure the nation had andtheir loss was never made good during the war.The battle itself cannot be fought unless the working masses are part of thestorm battalions. The technical preparation is also impossible to carry outwithout the inner unity of will in the nation itself. Our people, in particular,are living without a true military, completely disarmed, under the thousand eyesof the Versailles Peace Treaty. The nation cannot make any practicalpreparations to win its freedom and human independence unless the army of spieson the inside is cut down to the nub. Only those whose native lack of characterallows them to betray anything and everything for the proverbial thirty piecesof silver will remain. Those people can be taken care of; however, there aremillions who oppose the national recovery based on their political convictions.Those people are not so easily overcome. They cannot be defeated until the causeof their opposition, the international Marxist WorldConcept , is combated andits teachings are torn from their hearts and minds.From any standpoint where we examine the possibility of recovering ourindependence as a state and a people or from the standpoint of establishingforeign policy as an equal state among states, technical armament, or thestruggle itself, the one indispensable element we need is to win over the broadmasses of our people to the idea of national independence.If we do not regain our freedom from the clutches of other nations, we cannothope to gain anything from inner reforms. Any changes that do occur will onlymake us more profitable as a colony to our occupiers. The surplus from anysocalled economic improvement will go into the pocket of our internationalmasters, and any social improvement will increase our productivity, which inturn benefits only them. Cultural progress will not be the fortune of the Germannation at all. Progress depends too much on the political independence anddignity of a nation.We can only obtain a satisfactory solution for the problem of Germany's futureby winning over the broad masses of our people so they support a national idea.Therefore, the work of educating the masses must be considered our top priority.This priority must be pursued by a movement which is not out to meet the needsof the movement itself but is forced to consider the consequences of what itdoes, or does not do, based on what the future result will be.We realized as early as 1919 that the new movement's highest aim must be thenationalization of the masses. From that tactical point of view, a series ofrequirements resulted: 1. No social sacrifice would be considered too great ifit meant winning the masses to our side for a national revival. No matter whateconomic concessions are made to our wage earners today, they cannot compare tothe ultimate gain for the whole nation if they help bring back the common peopleto their nationality. Only narrow-minded, shortsighted people, like those foundall too often among our employers, can fail to realize that in the long run,there can be no economic improvement for them and no further economic profit ifthe inward solidarity of our nation is not restored.If during the war, the German tradeunions had ruthlessly protected the interestsof the workers, the war would not have been lost. Even if during the war, theyhad fought the money-hungry employers for the demands of the workers theyrepresented by constant strikes, the war still would not have been lost. Atleast this would be true, and the war would not have been lost. If they had beenas fanatical in their German nationality toward the nation's defense and hadequal ruthlessness for the Fatherland and given what is due the Fatherland, thenthe war would not have been lost. How trivial even the greatest economicconcession would have been when compared to the enormous significance of winningthe war! A movement that intends to restore the German worker to the Germanpeople must realize that economic sacrifices are no consideration at all as longas they do not threaten the independence of the national economy.1. The national education of the broad masses can only take place through socialimprovement. This alone will create the general economic conditions that allowthe individual to share in the cultural treasures of the nation.2. The nationalization of the broad masses can never be accomplished by halfwaymeasures or by weakly arguing the socalled objective merits of your position. Itcan only happen by ruthlessly and fanatically concentrating on achieving aone-sided goal. A people cannot be made \"nationalist\" in the sense of our modernupper and privilegedclass; their arguments have too many limitations andreservations. The people can only be made truly nationalistic with the intensitythat comes from taking an extreme position. Poison is driven out only bycounter-poison and only the shallowness of the privileged leader-class spiritcould ever think the middle road is the path to Heaven; the Kingdom of Heaven isnot obtained by compromise.The broad masses of a people do not consist of professors or diplomats. Theirweak ability to understand abstract ideas makes them driven by the world ofemotion rather than intellect. Their attitudes are formed by emotional impulsesand can be positive or negative. Their opinions will only be swayed by thoseextremes and never by a halfway idea floating between the two. This emotionalbasis for their attitude also brings with it extraordinary stability. It isalways harder to battle against Faith than to battle knowledge. Love is lesssusceptible to change than esteem. Hatred is more long lasting than meredislike. The driving force behind the most tremendous turnovers on this earthhas never resulted from an intellectual insight directing the masses, butinstead from a fanaticism dominating them and hysteria hurling them onward. Hewho wishes to win the broad masses must understand that the key to the gates oftheir hearts is not objectivity, which is nothing more than weakness, but adetermined and strong will.3. The soul of the masses can be won only if those who lead the movement aredetermined not merely to carry through the side of our struggle for the goodjust to achieve their own aims, but they must also be absolutely determined todestroy the enemy that opposes them. When the people see brutal and unceasingattacks upon an opponent, they also see the truth behind their own just cause.If the attack fails to destroy the enemy, if the battle is ended early, beforethe aggressor has completely dominated the enemy, the people will seeuncertainty in their own cause; they will see this incomplete vanquishing as asign that their side may in fact be unjust.4. The great masses are themselves part of Nature and therefore subject to herpassions. Their feelings do not allow them to understand how a handshake can bemade between men who have declared themselves as enemies. What they want isabsolute victory. They demand to see the stronger raise the banner of theconqueror and the complete extinction of the weaker or his unconditionalsurrender to the dominance of the superior. The nationalization of our massesand the struggle to save the soul of our people will only succeed if theinternational poison spread among them is exterminated.5. All the great problems we face today are short-term difficulties that resultfrom simple origins which have clear and definite causes. But among them all,there is only one with truly great importance. It is the problem of preservingthe nation's race. The strength or weakness of man is deeply rooted anddependent on his purity of blood. Nations that do not recognize and respect theimportance of their racial stock are like men who foolishly try to train apoodle to be a greyhound. Such a man fails to understand that the speed of thegreyhound and the intelligence of the poodle are not qualities that can betaught, but they are qualities which are inherent in race. A nation that failsto preserve their racial purity also sacrifices the unity of their soul in everyway. The disunity of their nature is the inevitable result of the disunity oftheir blood. The change in their intellectual and creative force is similarlythe result of the change in their racial foundations. The man who would free theGerman people from those bad characteristics, characteristics which are not partof its natural makeup and come from foreign sources, that man must first releasethe nation from the origin of these foreign characteristics. Until we clearlyrecognize and accept the race problem and the Jewish problem, the German nationcan never rise again. The race question is the key to world history and to allhuman civilization.6. Assigning the great mass of people who are now in the internationalist campto their proper place in a national community does not mean that we willsacrifice the protection of their class interests; we will not abandon theworker. Differing interests among labor and trade groups are not the same asclass division, but these differences are natural consequences of our economiclife. The grouping together of trade members and workers does not interfere withthe concept of a true national community. A national unity is one that unifiesall problems concerning the life of the nation so that no one is left out.In order to bring into the national community or into the State one of the newtrade or worker classes means we must not lower our current upper classes, butinstead must raise the lower classes to a higher level. The higher class cannever be the one who starts this process. It must be the lower class who isfighting for equal rights. The present privilegedclass did not gain theirposition within the State by legislation or action of the aristocracy.They achieved their position through their own energy under their ownleadership.A movement cannot help the German worker take his place among the Germancommunity if that movement depends on weak displays of brotherhood, witheveryone patting each other on the back as they talk about the problems ofsociety before ending their meeting with a handshake. No, the movement mustdeliberately improve the workers' social and cultural position, and this activerole must continue until the greatest and most difficult to bridge differencescan be considered overcome. A movement which has this kind of positivedevelopment as its aim will have to gain its supporters primarily from theworkers' camp. It can recruit the intellectual only if that person completelyunderstands the goal the movement is working toward. This transformation processwill not be finished in ten or twenty years. Experience shows that it will takemany generations.The obstacle that prevents today's worker from taking his place in the nationalcommunity is not his worker interests, but rather the obstruction comes from hisinternational leadership and his attitude which is hostile to the people and theFatherland. If the very same trade unions had a leader who was fanaticallynationalist in political concerns, that leader would turn millions of workersinto precious members of their nationality. This would happen regardless ofindividual battles over purely economic concerns.A movement that aims to restore the German worker to his people in an honorableway, and to relieve him from the internationalist madness his head has beenfilled with, must make a forceful stand against a certain common attitude inbusiness circles. This attitude preaches that national community means acomplete surrender, without resistance, of all economic rights of the wageearnerto the employer. This belief furthermore claims every attempt by the workers todefend themselves, even when it comes to rightful and necessary economicinterests of the wageearner, are attacks on the national community. Those whouphold this attitude are deliberate liars. In a community, all obligations forone side must be equally subject to the other side.If a worker sins against the spirit of a real national community by makingexcessive and unreasonable demands or makes demands without considering theireffect on the common welfare and the survival of a national economy, that workerhas acted against the national community. And so does the employer who relies onhis power to violate this community. If he misuses the national labor power byexploitation, and inhumanely treats workers under his management, and throughthese unjust actions makes millions by profiteering on the sweat of others, thenhe has no right to call himself a nationalist and no right to speak of anational community. He is a rogue who pursues his own self interests and byintroducing social discontent, he provokes later struggles that will hurt thenation one way or another.The young movement must draw its supporters mainly from the reservoir of themasses, of our wageearners. We must snatch them from their internationalistmadness, relieve their social distress, lift them above cultural misery, andlead them into the national community as a united, useful element, who arenationalist in feeling and intent.If we find in the circles of the nation's intellectuals that there are men witha warm heart for their people and its future, who realize deeply how importantthe struggle for the soul of the masses is, then they will be welcomed in theranks of the movement as a valuable intellectual backbone. But winning theprivilegedclass, voting cattle, must never be the movement's aim. If we targetedthe intellectual set, we would be burdening ourselves with a group whoseexisting thought process and nature would paralyze our efforts to recruit amongthe common people. The idea of uniting the great masses, both the upper andlower classes, within the movement has a certain theoretical beauty; however, itis also an obstacle. We must face the fact that the ability to influence theminds of those who already have a certain spirit and to spread our message amongthe privilegedclass masses at public demonstrations can gain some recruits, butno amount of discussion or influence can change certain qualities or vices oftheir character, attributes which have been around for centuries, and make thoseundesirable qualities disappear from this privilegedclass group. Differences incultural levels between the privilegedclass and working class, as well asdifferences in their attitudes toward economic questions are still so great,that the moment the excitement of the demonstration had died out, their presenceand nature would immediately become an obstacle to the movement.Finally, the purpose of the Movement is not to produce a new set of levelswithin the existing group of nationalists, but to win over those who areantinational. It is this perspective and strategy that will guide the whole movement. 7. This one-sided, but clear attitude must also be expressed in the movement'spropaganda.If the movement's propaganda is to be effective, it must aim in one directiononly, that is to say at one class only. If it attempts to aim at both upper andworker classes, the difference in their intellectual preparation, theireducational background, would either prevent the message from being understoodby one side, or be rejected because it appears to simply state obvious anduninteresting truths by the other class.Even the wording and the tone could never be equally effective on two classeswhich are so noticeably different. If the propaganda sacrifices primitive wordsand sharp expressions, the broad masses will not connect with the message. Butif the propaganda includes straightforward statements that appeal to the masses'feelings and uses expressions they commonly use, the intellectuals will objectand declare it to be coarse and vulgar. Among a hundred public speakers, therewouldn't even be ten who can speak with equal effect in front of an audience ofstreet-cleaners, mechanics, and sewer workers today and tomorrow, give a lecturewith the same intellectual substance in front of an auditorium of collegeprofessors and students. In a thousand speakers, there may be one who canaddress mechanics and college professors at the same time, and in a style thatnot only speaks on both their levels, but can influence both of them equally, orpossibly even captivate them so strongly that the result is a roaring storm ofapplause. We must never forget that the greatest idea which embodies a noblespirit and supreme worth can only be circulated to the public through thesmallest of minds. The most important point is not what the inspired vision ofthe creator of an idea was when he set out to spread his message, but what theannouncement of this idea to the masses translated into, how those who spreadthe message shape its meaning and how successful they are in leading the massesto accept the idea.The ability of the Social Democracy movement, and the whole Marxist movement, toattract followers depended on the unity and the one-sidedness of the public ittargeted. The more limited and narrow their argument's line of thought was, themore easily it was accepted and digested by masses whose intellectual abilitywas on the same level with what they were told.As a result of this knowledge, our new Movement laid down a clear and simpleguideline. The theme and form of the propaganda used to promote our message isto be aimed at the broad masses exclusively and the quality of propaganda canonly be measured by its success.The best speaker at a popular meeting of the common people is the one whocaptures the heart of the masses and not the one who is able to harmonize withthe spirit of the intellectuals who attend. If an intellectual attends this kindof meeting and complains about the lowbrow level of the speech, even though hecan clearly see the lower class has been rallied and moved by the speech, itproves that he is incapable of thinking and worthless to the young movement. Theonly intellectual who is valuable to the movement is the one who understands themission and purpose so completely that he has learned to judge the work ofpropaganda totally by its success and not by the impression it makes on himpersonally. The purpose of propaganda is to completely win over those who areagainst nationalism and not to entertain intellectuals who are alreadynationally-minded.In general, those lines of thought which I briefly summed up in the \"WarPropaganda\" chapter should be considered critical guiding rules for the youngmovement. These concepts proved to be of great value when deciding on the typeof propaganda and how it would be distributed to best accomplish its work ofenlightenment. Success has proved these methods to be sound.8. The aim of a political reform movement can never be attained by explainingtheir views to the public or by influencing the ruling powers. A movement canonly obtain political reform by taking political power into its own hands. Everyidea that is meant to shake the world has the right and duty to secure the meansnecessary to carry out its aims, and it must continue until they areaccomplished. Success is the only earthly judge of right and wrong in such anundertaking. Success does not mean, as in 1918, the victory of gaining power initself. True success must be for the benefit of a nation. It must serve thecommon interests of the people. Therefore, a coup d'état cannot be consideredsuccessful, although thoughtless State's Attorneys in Germany today believe itshould, merely because the revolutionaries have succeeded in seizinggovernmental power. It is only successful when the basic purposes and goals ofthe revolutionary action prove they can do the nation more good than theprevious regime did when they have been placed in practice. This is somethingwhich cannot be claimed by the German Revolution, as that bandit raid in thefall of 1918 called itself.9. If the conquest of political power is what is required to accomplish themovement's goals and reform the state, then the movement must consider from thevery beginning that it is a movement of the masses, and that it is not assembledfor a tea party or a bowling game.The young movement is by nature and inner organization anti-parliamentarian.That means that both in general beliefs and in its own inner structure, it isagainst majority rule where the leader is only a figurehead and apuppet-executor of the will and opinion of others. When dealing with thesmallest and greatest problems, the movement upholds the principle of absoluteauthority for the leader, who also carries the highest degree of responsibility.Here is how the results of this principal are applied in the Movement: Thechairman of a local group is appointed by the next higher leader. He is thedirector of the local group and responsible for them. All the committees in thelocal group are under his authority-- he is not under their authority. There areno voting committees, but only working committees. The director is the chairmanover the committees and he divides up the work for them. The same principleholds true for the next superior organizational level above, the district, thecounty, or the city. The leader is always appointed from above and endowed withabsolute power and authority. Only the leader of the entire party is elected bythe general assembly for the purpose of organization law. He is the exclusiveleader of the movement. All the committees are under his authority; he is notunder the authority of any committee. He dictates and bears the responsibilityon his shoulders. The followers of the movement are free to hold him accountablebefore a new election and to relieve him of his office if he has not upheld theprinciples of the movement or has not served its interests. He is then replacedby the new and more able man, who has the same authority and the sameresponsibility.One of the most important tasks of the movement is to put this principle inforce, not just within its own ranks, but throughout the entire State. The manwho would be leader has supreme and unlimited authority but also carries thefinal and greatest responsibility. A man who is incapable of this kind ofresponsibility or who is too cowardly to face the results of his action isworthless as a leader. Only a man of heroic quality has the true talent forleadership.The progress and civilization of mankind are not products of the majority, butthey depend totally on the inspiration and strength of a single personality. To encourage and promote this progress is one of the essentials for regainingthe greatness and power of our nationality.Because of our principles we must be anti-parliamentary and any participation ina legislative organization can only be for the purpose of ultimately destroyingit from within and thereby eliminate an institution where we see one of the mostserious symptoms of mankind's decay.10. The movement definitely refuses to take a stand on questions that areoutside the limits of its political work or immaterial to its aims because theyare of no importance in achieving our principle goals. The movement's job is notreligious reformation but a political reorganization of our people. It considersboth religious denominations to be equally valuable and acknowledges that theyprovide vital support for the existence of our people.Therefore, the movement will attack those parties that try to degrade thisfoundation by turning religious institutions into a tool for their own partyinterests. Those institutions provide our political body with religious and moral support.Finally, the movement's job is to create the foundations which are necessary forany republic or any Monarchy to survive. Our job is not the restoration of oneparticular form of government or the destruction of another form. The movement'smission is not to found a Monarchy or to strengthen a republic, but to create aGermanic State. The question of what form a State government should take is notimportant in principle, the form is merely chosen based on whatever type is themost practical and useful.Once the people realize the great problems and duties of its existence, theywill be able to work together as a State and the question of outwardformalities, such as governmental structures, can no longer lead to innerstruggles, so such matters can be easily worked out.11. The movement's inner organization is about convenience, not principle.The best organization is the one that places the fewest middle men between theleadership of a movement and its individual supporters. The job of anorganization is to communicate a specific idea that has originated in the mindof an individual to a large group of people and to supervise how that idea istransformed into reality. The organization structure itself is just a necessaryevil. At best, it is a means to an end; at worst, it becomes an end in itself.Because the world produces more mechanical beings than it produces intelligentminds with ideal natures, the forms that an organization can take are moreeasily constructed than the ideas themselves. It is easier to build thestructure itself than it is to build its substance of ideas which the structureis built to support.The path of every idea that strives to be fulfilled, especially one thatinvolves major reforms of an existing system, is outlined as follows: It beginswhen some inspired idea springs from the brain of a man who feels he is calledupon to share his insight with the rest of mankind. He preaches his views andgradually wins a certain circle of supporters. This process of direct andpersonal communication of a man's ideas to the world around him is the mostnatural and by far the most ideal method. As the number of followers increases,it becomes impossible for the founder of the original idea to carry on directlywith the innumerable followers while trying to both lead them as a leader andguide them in the doctrine. When the group grows to a point where it can nolonger support one-on-one interaction, an organizational structure is required.The ideal condition comes to an end and in its place we have the necessary evilof organization. Small sub-units are formed by the creation of local groups ofmembers, for instance, and these represent the nuclei for the growth of thepolitical movement's later organization.However, if the unity of the doctrine is to be maintained, sub-groups cannot becreated until the authority of the intellectual founder and his beliefs areaccepted absolutely and completely. The next requirement is a centrally-locatedheadquarters and its importance for a movement cannot be overestimated.The location should be chosen such that it is surrounded by the magic spell of aMecca or a Rome. This place can give a movement a particular strength that onlycomes from inner unity because it provides recognition that there is one creatorand leader who represents this unity.In forming the first nuclei of the organization, it is critical to maintain theimportance of the place where the idea originated. This place must be preservedand the importance must continue to ramp up until it is paramount to themovement. This growth of the theoretical, moral, and actual dominance of theplace where the movement began must occur at the same rate that newnuclei-groups are added and as they, in turn, demand new interconnectionsbetween their cells. The increasing number of individual followers make itimpossible to continue direct dealings with them and that lead us to theformation of our lowest level groupings. Eventually the number of followers willincrease dramatically, and the lowest form of organization will grow whichforces us to establish higher units, which may be politically described as anarea or district division.It may be easy to maintain authority of the original headquarters over thelowest local groups, but it will be very difficult to preserve this positionwhen the organization becomes more developed and has various levels of uppermanagement. However, maintaining the authority of the original headquarters isthe first essential for a unified movement. Without a unified movement, thecontinuation of the organization and the ultimate accomplishment of the ideabecomes impossible. When these larger middle management groups must be unitedinto still larger and higher units in the organization, maintaining the absolutesupremacy of the original place of foundation, its school of teachings, etc.,above them becomes more and more difficult.Consequently, the mechanical shape an organization takes must not be expandedbeyond the point where the spiritual authority of headquarters is guaranteed.With such political entities, this guarantee can only be given through strengthof force.From this, we established the following guidelines for the movement's innerstructure: A. Initially, we must concentrate all work in a central location, inone single city, this will be Munich. We must train a group of followers who areabsolutely reliable and, with them, develop a school we can use to circulate themovement's doctrine. In order to gain authority which will be needed later, itis essential that we secure the greatest possible number of visible successes inthis one city. Such prestige will be beneficial for subsequent expansion.In order to make the movement and leaders well known, it is necessary not onlyto publicly shake the faith in the invincibility of the Marxist doctrine, but toprove that a contrary doctrine is possible.B. Local groups can be formed only after the authority of the central managementin Munich is absolutely recognized and acknowledged.C. Establishing district, area, or national groups is to take place only whenneeded, and then only after the absolute recognition of headquarters as the seatof authority has been achieved. Also, the creation of subordinate cells dependson the availability of possible leaders who are qualified to lead the cells.Here there are two solutions: 1. The movement must acquire the necessary fundsto train capable minds who can become leaders. It then becomes possible tosystematically use these resources in whatever manner they are needed. Thismethod is easier and quicker, but it requires much greater financial resources.These leaders, who are trained, can only work full-time for the movement if theyare paid a salary.2. Because of the financial limitations of a young movement, it is not in aposition to employ such leaders. Instead it must initially rely on those whowill serve on an honorary basis. This method is slower and more difficult.Under these particular limitations, the movement's leadership must let largedistricts remain fallow and inactive if a man does not emerge from among itsfollowers who is able and willing to put himself at the disposal of the centralauthority and to organize and lead the movement in that particular district.There may be some regions where no leader steps forward at all. Other regionsmay have two or three potential leaders who are equally qualified.This unequal distribution of potential leadership is frustrating and it willtake years to overcome. The essential element for the creation of any cellorganization is always finding a leader who is able to lead it. All the militarycompanies of an army are worthless without officers. In the same manner, apolitical organization is equally worthless without the appropriate leader. Itis better for the movement not to form a local group than to allow it to becreated and then fail because a guiding and forceful leader's personality wasmissing.The desire to be a leader is not an adequate qualification. A leader must haveability. Energy and a strong will are more important than intellectual genius. Acombination of ability, determination, and perseverance is the most valuable ofall.12. The future of a movement depends on the devotion, or more correctly, theintolerance for other beliefs that its followers exhibit in defense of it as theonly true cause. They must be convinced and enforce the belief that their owncause, as opposed to other similar causes, is the only just cause.It is a huge mistake to believe that the strength of a movement can be increasedby uniting with another similar movement. Growth by merger means an immediateincrease in numbers which appears to outside observers that the organization hasincreased in power and resources. In truth, the organization has simply absorbedgerms which will be a source of inner weakness and this will cause sufferinglater on. No matter what anyone says about the similarity of two movements, suchcloseness never really exists. If they were truly so similar, there would beonly one movement and not two. It doesn't matter where the differences are. Evenif the difference is in the inconsistent abilities of the leadership alone, thenwe have found the difference.The natural law of all development never accepts the joining of two unequalbeings. True joining only occurs when the stronger gains victory over theweaker. When this natural selection happens, the strength and energy of thevictor is increased by the struggle itself.Uniting two similar political party structures may produce momentary advantages,but in the long run, any success gained in this way will cause inner weaknessesto appear later. The greatness of a movement is only guaranteed by theunhampered development of its inner strength, the protection of that strength,and the constant increase of that strength until it achieves final victory overall rivals. More than that, we may say that a movement's strength and its rightto exist increases only when it recognizes that adherence to the principle thatstruggle is necessary for growth and that it will only reach the peak of itsstrength when complete victory is finally achieved. The movement can neverattempt to accomplish this victory through instant or short term gains, but onlythrough perseverance and absolute intolerance of any opposition. Only in thisway will the movement enjoy a long stretch of growth.Movements which have expanded from the union of similar organizations, whereeach made compromises to achieve the joining, are like plants grown in ahot-house. They shoot up quickly, but they lack internal strength and are notsubstantial enough to stand the test of time or to resist violent storms. Thegreatness of any powerful organization, which embodies an idea in this world,depends on the absolutely religious fanaticism with which it establishes itselfwhen compared to others. It must be fanatically convinced that it is right andjust, and it must be absolutely intolerant of any idea or organization that iscounter to its own teaching. If an idea is right and it takes up the sword ofbattle with this mindset, it is invincible and any persecution only strengthensit.The greatness of Christianity was not established through compromise. They hadno reason to engage in negotiations of appeasement with those who had roughlysimilar, ancient philosophical opinions. It was created through unyielding andfanatical declaration and defense of its own teachings.The apparent head-start that movements gain by uniting with similar movements ismore than offset by the steady increase of strength that occurs when a doctrineand its organization remain independent and fight for themselves.13. As a matter of principle, the movement must train its members to regardstruggle as something that they are actually striving for and not as somethingcasually to engage in out of necessity. They must not fear the hostility theirenemy directs towards them, but must regard it as the justification for theirown right to exist. They must not try to avoid the hatred of the enemies to ournationality and our philosophy, but they should embrace that hatred.Enemies will use lying and slander as expressions of their own uneasyfrustration. Anyone who is not attacked, lied about, and slandered in the Jewishnewspapers is no decent German and no true National Socialist. The bestmeasuring stick for the value of a man's principles, the honesty of hisconvictions, and the strength of his determination is how much deadly venom hisname arouses from the enemy who hates him deeply.Followers of the movement, and in a broader sense all of the people, must bereminded again and again that in his newspapers, the Jew always lies.Even an occasional truth is only intended to cover a bigger lie; therefore, evena truth becomes a deliberate untruth. The Jew is the \"Great Master of Lies\" andhe uses his weapons of lying and deceit in battle.Every Jewish slander and every Jewish lie is a scar of honor on the body of ourwarriors. The man they insult the most is closest to us in spirit and the manthey have a mortal hatred for is our best friend.Any one of our followers who picks up the Jewish newspaper in the morning anddoes not see himself slandered in it, has accomplished nothing the previous day.If he had served any purpose, he would be persecuted, insulted, slandered,abused, and attacked by the Jew. Only the man who effectively opposes thisdeadly enemy of our nationality and who is also an enemy of all Aryan humanityand civilization can expect to find the slanders of the Jewish race and the warof these people pointed at him.When these principles become second nature to our followers, the movement willbe unshakable and invincible.14. The movement must encourage respect for individual personalities using everymeans possible. The movement must never forget that all human values are basedon personal values. Every idea and every achievement is the result of thecreative power of one man, but the public's admiration for great men is not onlya tribute of gratitude to that man, that same reverence is the factor that bindsthem together into one group with a strong unifying bond.Individuality is irreplaceable, particularly if that individual possesses thevital cultural and creative elements and not the purely mechanical elementswhere a man goes through the motions as if he were a puppet.No student can replace a master painter and successfully complete hishalffinished painting. Neither can the great poet and thinker, the greatstatesman, or the great general be replaced by another. Their activity is an artin itself. What they accomplish cannot be taught mechanically, but such talentis inborn and a gift of Divine grace. The world's greatest revolutions andachievements, its greatest cultural accomplishments and immortal deeds in thefield of statesmanship are all forever linked and inseparable from the name thathistory has chosen to represent each achievement. If we do not give properrespect and reverence to one of those great spirits, then we lose the greatsource of strength that emerges from speaking the names of any and all great menand women.The Jew knows this better than anyone. Those they call great men are only greatat destroying humanity and its civilization, but the Jew is careful to makecertain those figures continue to be admired and idolized. Yet, when any othergroup of people shows reverence for those of their own who have outstandingminds or made fantastic accomplishments, the Jew tries to represent those greatsouls as unworthy and brands such reverence as a \"cult of personality\". (A cultof personality occurs when the state uses the press to create a heroic image; itcan also be called manufactured hero worship.) When a people become cowards andyield to such Jewish claims and disrespect, they surrender the mightiest forcefor inner strength they possess.This force is founded in reverence for genius, and it comes from teaching andadoration of these men as examples of what we can be. Such reverence does notcome from dictating to the masses whom they should adore.When human hearts break and human souls fall into despair, they find a greatconqueror of distress, of shame and misery, of intellectual bondage and physicalforce who looks upon them from the twilight of the past and extends theireternal hands to encourage men of despair. Woe to the people who are ashamed tograsp those hands! In the early days, when our movement was emerging, wesuffered the most from insignificance. Our names were unknown. We began to doubtthe chances of our success because of our obscurity. The hardest thing was atthe beginning, when there were sometimes only six, seven, or eight who met tolisten to the speaker. Back then, it was difficult to awaken and maintain afaith in the tremendous future of the movement within this tiny circle.There were only six or seven men and they were all poor, nameless devils whowere joining together with the intent of forming a movement. Someday, thismovement must succeed where the great and powerful mass parties had failed. Theymust resurrect a German Empire with even greater might and magnificence. At thattime, if we had been attacked or even just laughed at, we would have been happy.The most depressing fact was the complete indifference we encountered. This waswhat weighed on my mind the most at that time.When I entered the circle of a handful of men, there was neither a party nor amovement to speak of. I have already described my first impressions of thislittle group. In the weeks that followed, I had the time and opportunity tostudy the appearance of this socalled Party, although, at this point, there wasnothing to see. Heaven knows the picture was uncomfortably distressing. Therewas simply nothing there. Absolutely nothing whatsoever. There was the name ofthe party and the leading committee which consisted of all of the party members.This felt like the very thing we wanted to combat, a miniature parliament. Heretoo, as in parliament, voting was the course to reaching a decision. While thebig parliaments shouted until they were hoarse for months, at least they arguedabout large problems. In this little circle, even the reply to a letter receivedgreat attention and such a wonderful event, as having someone write to the partywould initiate endless dialogue.The public knew absolutely nothing of all this. Not a soul in Munich knew theParty even by name, except for its handful of followers and their newacquaintances.Every Wednesday, there was a committee meeting in a Munich café, and then once aweek there was an evening where the group listened to a speaker. Since theentire membership of the \"movement\" was represented in the committee, the samepeople naturally showed up at both meetings.What we had to do was finally break out of the little circle, gain newfollowers, and above all, make the movement's name known at all costs. We used the following technique to accomplish this: We decided to hold monthlymeetings for the public. Later, we began meeting every two weeks.The invitations were written on a typewriter or some were even written by hand.We distributed or delivered them ourselves the first few times. Each of uscontacted his circle of acquaintances and tried to persuade some of them tovisit one of these meetings. The result was pitiful.I can still remember how once, during those early days, I had delivered close toeighty invitations and, that evening, we waited expectantly for the crowd ofpeople to come. After waiting for an hour after our regular starting time, thechairman finally opened the meeting. There were seven of us, the same old seven.We began having the invitations typed and duplicated at a Munich stationaryshop. The result was that at the next meeting there were a few more listeners.The number gradually rose from eleven to thirteen, to seventeen, totwenty-three, to thirty-four listeners. By taking up little collections among uspoor devils, we were able to raise enough money to publish an advertisementabout the meeting in the Munich Observer, which was still an independentnewspaper. The result this time was astonishing. We had arranged to hold themeeting in the Munich Hofbräu house cellar, not to be confused with the MunichHofbräuhaus Banquet Hall, which was a small hall with a capacity of barely ahundred and thirty persons. To me, the room seemed like a huge auditorium andall of us were afraid the great building would have noticeable gaps in the crowdthat night. At seven o'clock, there were a hundred and eleven persons inattendance and the meeting was opened.A Munich professor delivered the main address, and I, as second on the program,was to make my first public speech. To Mr. Harrer, chairman of the party at thattime, having me speak seemed very risky. This gentleman, otherwise a goodgentleman beyond any doubt, was convinced that I might be able to do a lot ofthings, but speaking was not one of them. Afterwards, he was still of the sameopinion.The matter of my speaking ability turned out quite differently, however. Thiswas my first time to speak in public and I was allowed twenty minutes to speak.I spoke for thirty minutes. This event proved what I had felt all along: I couldspeak. At the end of thirty minutes, the people in the little room wereelectrified. The first expression of their enthusiasm was demonstrated followingmy appeal for the self-denial of those present. That appeal resulted in thecontribution of three hundred marks. This was a great relief. At that time, ourfinances were so strained that we could not even afford to have the doctrine ofthe movement printed, let alone distribute leaflets. Now we had a small fundthat could finance the most urgent and necessary expenses. The success of thisfirst and largest public meeting was important in another way too.I began adding some fresh and younger members to the committee's strength.During my years of military service, I had met a large number of faithfulfriends who slowly began to enter the movement in response to my urging. Theywere all energetic young men who were accustomed to discipline. They had grownup during their military service and learned the principle that \"absolutelynothing is impossible, and where there is a will, there is a way\".After only a few weeks of working with the new members, I realized how necessarythis new blood was. The chairman of the party at that time, Mr.Harrer, was a journalist and as such he had a good background in generalcultural knowledge. But he had one great handicap that was detrimental for aparty leader. He was no speaker. He was a man of conscience and exact in everydetail, but he could not motivate with driving passion. This was probablybecause he was not gifted as a speaker at all. Mr. Drexler was the chairman ofthe Munich local group at that time. He was a simple working man. He was alsonot impressive as a speaker and had never served in the army, not even as asoldier during the war. His whole nature was weak and uncertain. He had missedthe one school that could turn soft and undecided natures into men. Thereforeneither man was made of the stuff that would have enabled him to carry in hisheart a fanatical belief in the victory of a movement. Neither man could breakdown whatever barrier his opposition might use to block the rise of the new ideausing unshakable strength of will and with the most brutal ruthlessness. Theonly characteristics suited for this task were those acquired in the militarywhere men learned virtues of mind and body and such men can best be described asswift as greyhounds, tough as leather, and hard as Krupp steel. (Krupp is aGerman family of steel and munitions manufacturers known as Krupp Works whoincidentally assisted in rearming Germany after the First World War.) At thattime I was still a soldier myself. I had been polished on the inside and outsidefor almost six years. At first, the others must have felt as if I was a strangerin this circle. I had forgotten the words, \"you can't do it\", \"it won't work\",\"we can't risk that\", or \"it's too dangerous\". This matter was dangerous.The entire undertaking was by its very nature dangerous.In 1920 a nationalist meeting that dared to appeal to the broad masses and toissue a public invitation was simply impossible in many parts of Germany. Thosewho attended were disbursed and sent home with broken heads. True, this was nogreat trick and conducting diplomacy based on a big stick was a feat anyonecould accomplish. If a dozen Communists showed up, even at the largestprivilegedclass mass meetings, they would scatter and run like rabbits beingchased by dogs. The Reds hardly noticed meetings filled with nothing more thanprivilegedclass chatter. Those \"clubs of the harmless\" presented no danger tothe Reds and they realized that fact better than the actual members of theseorganizations. However, they were much more determined to wipe out a movementthat seemed dangerous to them and were willing to use any means possible. Themost effective tool for them to use at these times was always terrorism andviolence.To the Marxist betrayers of the people, any movement that announced it plannedto win over the masses, which had previously been in the exclusive service ofthe international Marxist Jew and the Stock Exchange parties, was a threat. Thevery name \"German Workers' Party\" had the effect of issuing a challenge. It waseasy to see that conflict with the Marxist agitators, who were still drunk withvictory from the Revolution, would begin at the first opportunity whichpresented itself to them.At that time, the entire circle of the movement had a certain level of fear whenit faced the prospect of this kind of struggle. They wanted to appear in publicas little as possible because they were afraid of being beaten. In their mind'seye, they already saw the first large meeting being broken up and the movement,perhaps, shattered forever. I had a hard fight for my argument that we must notavoid this struggle, but must go out and meet it. We must equip ourselves withthe only shield that gives protection from violence. Terrorism is not overcomeby intellect, but by terrorism. The success of the first public meetingstrengthened my position in this respect. They courageously planned for a secondone on an even larger scale.About October, 1919, the second large meeting took place in the Eberlbräucellar. The subject was BrestLitovsk (meaning the 1918 Treaty of BrestLitovsk,which marked Russia's exit from the war) and Versailles(the Treaty of Versailleswhich ended the First World War). Four men spoke. I spoke for nearly an hour andmy success was greater than at the first demonstration. The number attending hadrisen to more than a hundred and thirty. An attempted disturbance was foiled bymy friends. The would-be troublemakers were \"helped\" downstairs with the benefitof broken heads.Two weeks later, a second meeting took place in the same hall. The attendancerose to more than a hundred and seventy. It was quite a good crowd for the room.I spoke and again, my success was greater than at the previous meeting.I pushed for a larger hall. Finally, we found one at the other end of the cityin the German district of the Dachauer Road area. The first meeting in the newhall was not attended as well as the previous ones. There were only a hundredand forty people. Hope in the committee began to sink again. The eternaldoubters thought they knew why attendance was poor and claimed that we werehaving too many demonstrations too frequently. There were \"spirited\" disputesabout the matter. During these disputes, I maintained the position that a cityof 700,000 inhabitants could handle not just one meeting every two weeks, butten meetings every week. I told them that we must not be discouraged bysetbacks, that the path we had chosen was right, and that sooner or later,success was bound to come if we were persistent and stayed strong.Through the whole winter of 1919-1920 we faced one continuous struggle tostrengthen the victorious force of the young movement and to raise the level ofpassion to the level of faith, a faith that is strong enough to move mountains.The next meeting in the same hall proved I was right again. The attendance roseabove two hundred. The publicity was excellent and it was also a financialsuccess. I urged that we immediately arrange for another meeting. It took placebarely two weeks later and the crowd of listeners rose to over two hundred andseventy.Two weeks later, we called the followers and friends of the young movementtogether for the seventh time. The same hall could barely hold all the people.There were over four hundred. At that time, the inner shaping of the youngmovement took place on a more serious level. The discussions often caused somemore or less violent disputes in the little circle. The various sides discussedwhether or not the young movement should even be called a Party. I have alwaysseen this attitude as proof of the incompetence and intellectual pettiness ofthe critic. These are, and always have been, the people who cannot distinguishoutward appearance from inner strength and who try to judge the merits of amovement by how pompous and pretentious the name is. The last straw was whenthey suggested we use the archaic vocabulary of our forefathers (the oldGermanic language of Roman times).They had trouble understanding that even if a movement has not accomplished itsideas and goals, it is still a party no matter what it calls itself.When someone wants to carry out a bold idea that would benefit his fellowmen, hemust begin by finding followers who are ready to stand up and fight for hisgoals. Even if this purpose is just to destroy the other parties that exist atthe time and to therefore end the disunity among them, the supporters of thisview and announcements of this decision form a party in themselves until theobjective has been achieved. Playing with words like this is splitting hairs andshadowboxing for some advocate who likes to theorize about the popularity of theparty's name, and whose practical success is inversely proportional to hiswisdom. It is ludicrous for him to imagine he can change the character of everyyoung party movement by simply changing its title.On the contrary, if there is anything unnatural to people, it is tossing aroundancient Germanic terms that don't fit the present day and have no significanceto the modern listener. Reviving such terms can easily mislead people intothinking the important element in a movement is in its outward vocabularyinstead of the internals of the party. This is a truly destructive tendency, butone which is seen countless times today.I have repeatedly warned our followers about these German tribal wanderingscholars who cannot show a single positive accomplishment except for theirability to inflate their own abundant egos. The young movement had and still hasto beware of a number of such men who are known to say that they have beenfighting for this same idea for thirty or forty years. Well, if anyone who hasstood up for a socalled idea for forty years without producing any results orwithout even preventing advancement of the enemy, then he has spent forty yearsproving his own incompetence.The primary danger from people of this character is that they do not want totake their place as parts of the movement, as regular members fighting for acause. Instead they ramble on about circles of leadership that they see as theappropriate place for their contribution based on their long-continuous labors.It is disastrous and regrettable when a young movement hands itself over to suchpeople! A business man who has systematically driven a great business into theground through his forty years' work is not up to the task of founding a newone. Neither is a supporter of people's rights who is as old as Methuselah, andwho has spent the same amount of time messing up a great idea, until eventuallyhe caused it to seize up so that it no longer worked or made any progress. Thatperson is not the right man to lead a new, young movement! On top of that, onlya fraction of all these people come into the new movement to be a useful partthat spreads the doctrine and serves the idea of the new doctrine unselfishly.They are usually attracted by the chance to bother the public once again withtheir own ideas under the protection of the movement or through theopportunities it offers. They generally seem to be incapable of describingexactly what these ideas are.People with this kind of nature characteristically rave about ancient Germanicheroism. They talk about the old times of primitive ages, stone hatchets, aspear and buckler shield, but in reality, they are the most craven cowards thatcan be imagined. The very people who wear bearskin tunics and a helmet with thehorns of oxen on their bearded heads and swing through the breeze German tinswords made to carefully imitate the ancient ones in every detail, preachnothing but an intellectual battle, and they quickly scatter when faced with thefirst Communist rubber club. Future generations will have little reason toglorify the heroic epics of these \"warriors\".I know these people well enough to be profoundly disgusted with their pitifulplayacting. They are the subjects of ridicule among the broad masses, and theJew has every reason to spare these comedic champions-of-people's-rights fromcriticism and even to prefer them to the real warriors of a coming German State.Yet these buffoons are infinitely proud of themselves, claiming to know what isbest about everything despite all proof of their complete incompetence. Theybecome an absolute pest to all those straightforward and honorable fighters. Notonly do they dilute the heroism of the past, but they attempt to hand down tofuture generations a picture of their own acts as heroism.It is often difficult to tell which among these people are acting out ofstupidity or inability and which are, for some special reason, only pretendingto be stupid and actually have a hidden motive. This is especially true in thecase of the socalled religious reformers whose beliefs are based on ancientGermanic customs. I always have the feeling they are sent by forces that do notwant the resurrection of our nation. Their activities actually lead the peopleaway from the struggle against the common enemy, the Jew. They allow theirstrength to be sapped by inner religious disputes that are as senseless as theyare damaging.For these very reasons, it is necessary to set up a strong central power withabsolute authority for the movement's leadership. Only this strength can put astop to such harmful elements as these rabble-rousers. One of the greatestenemies of a unified, strictly conducted and guided movement are these activistAhasueruses. (Ahasueruses means wandering Jews, a reference to the mythologicalstory about a Jew who taunted Christ and was cursed to wander the world untilthe second coming.) What they truly hate about the movement is that it has thepower to put an end to their mischief.There was a reason the young movement settled on a definite program and avoidedusing the word \"Racialist\" in it. (A Racialist is someone who is interested inrace or makes decisions based on race or studies race, usually informally.) Theconcept of \"racialism\" is unclear and indefinite which makes it impossible as abasis for a movement. It also does not offer any standard to judge what themembers actually stand for. The more vague this concept is and the more open tointerpretation it becomes, the more it appeals to everyone. Anyone can seewhatever they want in the movement.Injecting an idea into a political struggle that is vague and capable of manyinterpretations will ultimately destroy the solidarity and lead to harshfighting within the fellowship. A political movement cannot survive if theindividual is allowed to decide on his own what he believes the movement standsfor. It is outrageous that people are running around today with the \"Racial\"symbol on their hats and how many of them have created their own definition ofwhat the idea means.There is a well-known professor in Bavaria ( in early Mein Kampf editions he waslisted as Professor Bauer but the name was removed from later editions) who isfamous for fighting with intellectual means and very successful in marches onBerlin, that is to say, intellectual marches on Berlin. He has decided theracialist concept is synonymous with a Monarchy. This educated mind has so farforgotten to explain in more detail the identity of our German Monarchies of thepast which can be associated with the modern \"racialist\" concept or whichmonarchies were for-the-people. I fear the gentleman will become confused if heis required to give a precise answer. For it is impossible to imagine anythingmore non-racialist than most of the German monarchical states of the past. Ifthey had been race-aware, if they were representative of the people, they wouldnever have disappeared or their disappearance would furnish the proof of theinstability of the racebased WorldConcept .Everyone interprets the idea as he happens to understand it. Such a wide varietyof opinions is unacceptable as a basis for a fighting political movement. I amnot even referring to their separation from reality and particularly theignorance these people display when it comes to the soul of the nation which iscommonly seen in these racialist movements, these John the Baptists of thetwentieth century. (satirically meaning prophets of what is to come.) The valueof these people is clearly illustrated in the way they are treated by theLeft-Wing parties. They find them ridiculous so they let these people rant andrave and just laugh at them.Anyone in this world who is not hated by his enemies is worthless as a friend tome. Therefore the friendship of these people for our young movement was not onlyworthless but downright dangerous. In fact, that was the main reason we chosethe name \"Party\" in the first place. We hoped that this would scare off a wholeswarm of racialist sleepwalkers. This is why we also described ourselves as theNational Socialist German Workers' Party.The word Party scared off the fanatics who live in the past, as well as the bigtalkers who spout meaningless phrases about the \"racial idea\". The other part,National Socialist German Workers, freed us from a whole parade of knights ofthe \"intellectual\" sword and all the ragged misfits that carry \"intellectualweapons\" as a shield to cover their cowardice.Naturally the most violent \"attacks\" on our new movement came from theseracialists. Of course the attacks were not physical, but only with theirfavorite weapon of pen and ink, just as you would expect from such racialist penheads. To them, there was something revolting about our principle which stated,\"If a man offers us violence, we will defend ourselves by violence\". Theycriticized us profusely claiming we possessed a rude type of worship for therubber club and that our ranks lack any form of intellect. These quacks fail torealize that in a meeting of racialists, a Demosthenes can be silenced by justfifty idiots who rely on nothing but their lungs and their fists if those idiotsdo not want to let him speak. (Demosthenes was a Greek statesman and orator whowas a major political speaker; here, meaning even a great speaker can be easilysilenced.) The inborn cowardice of the racialist always keeps him out of anysuch danger. He does not make noise when he works and he never steps out of thecrowd--he is always careful to stay silent.Even today I cannot warn our young movement strongly enough against falling intothe trap of these \"silent workers\". They are not only cowards, but they are allincompetents and donothings. When a man knows something is going to happen, andhe realizes it is a real danger, and he sees, with his own eyes, the merepossibility of solution, he damned well has the duty and obligation to act. Hemust make a public stand against evil and openly work for its cure, not work\"silently\". If he does not do so, he is a miserable weakling who has forgottenthe meaning of duty and a failure either through cowardice or through lazinessand inability. The great majority of the \"silent workers\" merely pretend to knowwhat Heaven knows. None of them has any ability, but they all try to fool thewhole world with their smoke-screen. They are lazy, but with their alleged\"silent\" work, they appear to be enormously active and productive. In a word,they are swindlers and political day-workers who find the honest work of othersdisgusting. When one of these racialist moths prefers the darkness in the valleyof \"silence\", you can bet a thousand to one that in the dark, he is notproducing but stealing and stealing from the fruit of others' work.In addition, there is the arrogance and conceited disrespect that this lazy,night owl crowd dumps on the work of others. They constantly complain about theworks of others in a condescending way, and in so doing they actually help thedeadly enemies of our nationality.Every last follower who has the courage to stand on a table in a tavernsurrounded by his enemies and boldly and openly defend his views accomplishesmore than a thousand of these lying, treacherous sneaks. He definitely willconvert and win over one man or another to the movement. His achievement can betested and proved by the success of his activity. However, the cowardly fraudswho boast of their \"silent\" work and hide themselves in disgraceful anonymityare worthless and may be considered in the truest sense of the word useless whenit comes to working for the revival of our people.At the beginning of 1920, I urged the scheduling of our first great massmeeting. This resulted in differences of opinion in our group. Some of theleading Party members thought the event was premature and would result indisaster. The Marxist press had begun to show an interest in us and we werefortunate enough to gradually to win their hatred. We started attending themeetings of other parties and to speak during the discussion period at theirmeetings. Of course, we were all shouted down immediately. But it did have onegood result. People learned about us. As the familiarity grew, their anger andhatred for us rose. This gave us good reason to hope for large scale attendanceof our friends from the Red camp at our first great mass meeting.I also realized that there was a real chance that our meeting would be dispersedby the Marxists. But the battle had to be fought. If it wasn't fought now, thenit would be a few months later. It was up to us to immortalize the movement onthe very first day by standing up for it blindly and ruthlessly. I knew how theminds of the supporters of the Red camp worked too well, and I was certain thatan extreme resistance is the best way to make an impression and maybe even towin followers. We only needed the determination to make that resistance happen.The chairman of the party at that time, Mr. Harrer, felt that he could not cometo an agreement with my views about whether or not the time was right for ourfirst mass meeting and, as an honorable and upright man, he withdrew from theleadership of the movement. Mr. Anton Drexler moved up into his place. Iremained in charge of the organization of propaganda myself and I carried itthrough without compromise.The date of this first great public meeting of our previously unknown movementwas set for February 24th, 1920.I personally directed the preparations. They were very brief. The entireorganization was set up to make lightning-fast decisions. On questionsconcerning the attitude we should display and the purpose of the meeting, we hadto reach the final answers before the mass meeting occurred which was withintwenty-four hours. These points were to be announced by posters and leafletsbased on our doctrine. I have already laid down the broad outlines in mydiscourse on propaganda and these were now used. These guidelines includeeffectiveness with the broad masses, concentration on a few points, perpetualrepetition of these points, self-assured and selfconfident wording of the textin the form of a positive statement. We circulated the leaflets with greaturgency and then waited patiently for results. For a color, we deliberatelychose red. It is the most inflammatory and was bound to provoke and enrage ourenemies the most, thus making them aware of us in one way or another.In Bavaria, the connection between Marxism and the Center political party wasplain to see when one looked at how the ruling Bavarian People's Party (whichhad splintered from the Center party) tried to weaken and later to destroy theeffect of our posters on the masses of workers who had been swayed to theMarxist side. If the police could find no reason to take steps against us, thenour rivals would ultimately complain about the \"traffic conditions\". Finally, sothey could silence their Red spiritual ally, the rival German National People'sParty was able to have these posters completely forbidden. It was too late. Theposters had already given hundreds of thousands of misled and misguided Redworkers a chance to return to their German nationality. These posters are thebest proof of the tremendous struggle which the young movement went through atthat time. These posters will also bear witness to future generations of thedetermination and justness of our principles and the illogical response ofsocalled national authorities when they blocked an unwelcome nationalizationand, in doing so, blocked a redemption of the great mass of our nationality.Our flyers will also help to destroy the misconception that there was anationalist government in Bavaria at the time and will document for futuregenerations the fact that the government in Bavaria during 1919, 1920, 1921,1922, and 1923 was not the product of a nationalist inclinations, but wascompelled to take into consideration the mass of people who were graduallybecoming more nationalist-minded which forced the government to appearnationalist as a result. The government did everything to hinder this process ofrevival and make it impossible.There are two outstanding men who we must acknowledge as exceptions: The PoliceChief at the time, Ernst Pöhner (a radical anti-Semite who participated in the1923 Beer Hall Putch), and his devoted advisor, Chief Bailiff Frick (WilhelmFrick, who was also part of the Beer Hall Putch in 1923), were the onlyhigh-level state civil servants who had the courage to be Germans first andofficials second. Ernst Pöhner was the only man in a responsible position whodid not ask for the approval of the masses, but felt himself answerable to hisnationality and was ready to risk everything and to sacrifice everything, evenhis personal existence if necessary, for the resurrection of the German people,which he loved most of all. He was always a thorn in the side of thosebribe-seeking officials who acted against the interests of their people and thenecessary advancement of its freedom, and who instead acted on the orders oftheir employer, without considering the welfare of the people or the nationalproperty entrusted to them. Above all, Pöhner was one of those rare men with apersonal nature which, in contrast to most of our socalled governmentalguardians, did not fear being hated by traitors of the people and of thecountry, but he instead hoped for that hatred and saw it as the natural propertyof a decent man. The only happiness for him amid the misery of our people wasthe hatred he received from Jews and Marxists, who fought their entire battleusing lies and slander.Pöhner was a man of rock solid honesty, of Roman simplicity, and Germanstraightforwardness. To him, \"better dead than a slave\" was not a catchword butthe personification of his whole character. I consider him and his colleague,Dr. Frick, as the only men holding positions in state government who have theright to be called co-founders of a nationalist Bavaria.Before we held our first mass meeting, we had to prepare the necessarypropaganda material and to have the guiding principles printed in the program.The guiding principles that we had in mind when drawing up the program issomething I will discuss at great length in the second volume. Here, I willmerely say that the program was made to give form and substance to the youngmovement and to present its aims in a manner that could be understood by thebroad masses. In intellectual circles, there have been sneers and jokes aboutour program and attempts to criticize it. But the soundness of our ideas wereproven by the effectiveness of the program.During those years, I saw dozens of new movements come and go without a trace.Only one survived: the National Socialist German Workers' Party.Today, more than ever, I am convinced that even though people may fight it andtry to paralyze it and that petty party ministers may block our free speech, itdoes not matter because they cannot prevent the ultimate victory of our ideas.When the very names of the current State administration and parties areforgotten, the foundations of the National Socialist program will be the basisof a future State.Our four months of meetings before January 1920 had slowly allowed us to save upthe money we needed to print our first leaflet, our first poster, and our firstprogram.I will end this volume with the first great mass meeting of the movement becausethat is when the Party burst through the narrow confines of being a small cluband extended its influence by reaching into the most tremendous factor of ourtime, public opinion.I had only one concern: Would the hall be filled or would we speak to an emptyroom? I was firmly convinced that if the crowd came it would transform the dayinto a great success for the young movement. So, I anxiously looked forward tothe evening.The meeting was to begin at 7:30 P.M. At 7:15, I entered the banquet hall of theHofbräuhaus on the Place in Munich and my heart nearly burst with joy.The meeting hall that before seemed so very large to me was now overflowing withpeople, shoulder to shoulder, a mass of almost two thousand. Most importantly,the very people we wished to reach were there. More than half of the people inthe hall seemed to be Communists or Independents. They already expected ourfirst great demonstration would come to an abrupt end. But the result was notwhat they expected.After the first speaker had finished, I took the floor. Within a few minutes,there was a flood of interruptions from shouts and there were violent episodesin the hall. A handful of devoted war comrades and other followers removed thetroublemakers and gradually succeeded in restoring some semblance of order. Iwas able to resume speaking. After half an hour, the applause slowly began todrown out the yelling and bellowing. Now I took up the task of explaining ourprogram for the first time.As the minutes passed, the taunting was drowned out more and more by shouts andapplause. When I finally presented the twenty-five ideas, point by point, to thecrowd, asking them to make their own judgment on each one, they accepted oneafter another amid growing cheers, unanimously and unanimously again. When thelast point had found its way to the heart of the crowd, I had in front of me ahall full of people united by a new conviction, a new faith, a new will.After almost four hours, the hall began to empty. The mass of people rolled,pushed, and crowded shoulder to shoulder like a slow river toward the exit. I knew they were going out into the German people and spreading the principlesof a movement that could no longer pass into oblivion.A fire had been started and from this flame, a sword would someday be forgedthat would win back freedom for the Germanic Siegfried and life for the Germannation. (Siegfried is both a German male name meaning peace by victory and anopera by Wagner where a strong sword is forged and the main character is namedSiegfried; it also means the average man or a German John Smith.) In step withthe coming revival, I could feel the marching of the Goddess of Revenge whowould bring vengeance for the treasonous deed of November 9th, 1918. The hallgradually emptied. The movement had started.VOLUME TWO -- THE NATIONAL-SOCIALIST MOVEMENT1. WORLD-CONCEPT AND PARTYOn the 24th of February, 1920, the first great public mass demonstration of ouryoung movement took place. In the Banquet Hall of the Munich Hofbräuhaus (anextension of the famous beer maker Hofbräu brewery), the twenty-five points ofour program were presented to a crowd of almost two thousand and every singlepoint was received with enthusiasm.We finally had an opportunity to make the first principles clear and explainedour plan for action that would lead our struggle to clear away the chaos oftraditional views and ideas and the vague even harmful aims that were everpresent. A new force had appeared to split the corrupt and cowardlyprivilegedclass world and this force would shatter the Marxists' wave ofconquest. This new movement would ride the chariot of Fate in front of theMarxists' march to triumph and halt it at the last moment, before it reached itsgoal.It was obvious that the new movement's only hope to achieve the necessarysignificance and the required strength for the gigantic struggle ahead was if itsucceeded from the beginning in filling the hearts of its followers with thesacred conviction that we were not simply spouting a new election slogan intothe political arena, but this new movement was placing a new WorldConcept , oneof great importance, in front of the people. Think about how pitiful theprograms of these other socalled \"party platforms\" are. They are usually stucktogether and shined up or reshaped from time to time, but one platform isbasically the same as the next. To understand them, we must look at the motiveswhich drive their construction. These motives, especially of the privilegedclass\"platform committees\", must be put under the microscope so we can trulyunderstand and judge how valuable these outrageous beliefs they call platformsare.There is only one reason which leads to the re-writing of party platforms or themodification of existing ones: the concern over who will win the next election.Whenever it begins to dawn on these parliamentary craftsmen that the good oldcommon people are about to abandon the party and slip out of the harness of theold party bandwagon, the leaders repaint the bandwagon's wheels. Then, come thesocalled \"experienced\" and \"shrewd\", usually old, parliamentarians. These arethe star-gazers, the party astrologers, who can recall a similar crisis, intheir \"long political apprenticeship\", when the people's patience ended and massdefections loomed. They feel the same kind of calamity drawing dangerously near.So, they resort to the standard formulas: form a \"committee\", listen to what thegood old common people are saying, sniff at the newspapers and gradually smellout what the common people want, what they hate, and what they hope for. Everytrade and business group and every class of employee is carefully studied as itsmost secret wishes are examined. Even the \"empty catchwords\", which are used bythe now dangerous opposition, are suddenly reexamined. Frequently, to thesurprise of those who first coined these phrases, they suddenly appear quiteinnocent, as if the ideas were taken for granted or obvious. Some of them areeven found in the intellectual library of the old parties.So, the committees meet, \"revise\" the old platform, and write a new one in a waythat gives everyone what he wants. This parliamentary class changes theirconvictions just as the soldier changes his shirt in the field, whenever the oldone wears out. No one is left out, the farmer's agriculture is protected, theindustrialist's products are protected, the consumer is guaranteed stable marketprices, the teachers' salaries are raised, and the civil servants' pensions areimproved. The State is to take good care of widows and orphans, commerce ispromoted, prices are to be lowered, and taxes are to be practically abolished.Sometimes, one group may have been forgotten or a new demand among the peoplewas not discovered by the party in time to add this revision. Any overlookedconcessions are stuck on, wherever there is space, at the last moment. Thepatches are put in place until the party can faithfully hope that the army ofmiddleclass Philistines and their wives are soothed and satisfied once again.Now, armed with faith in the Lord and the unshakable stupidity of the votingcitizens, the party can begin the struggle for \"reshaping\" the Reich, as it iscalled.When election day is over and the parliamentarians have held their last massmeeting for five years, with no further need to consider the commoners, theyfocus on fulfillment of their higher and more pleasant duties. The committeethat created this new platform disbands again and the struggle for reshapingassumes the form of a battle for one's daily bread. Maybe this is why gatheringsof parliamentarians are called diets (an alternate meaning of diet is a formallegislative assembly.) The parliamentarians draw their daily pay by simplyshowing up and the \"struggle\" degrades into a humdrum \"daily routine\".Every morning the Honorable Gentleman, the Deputy of the parliament, goes to theHouse and though he may not make it all the way in, he at least goes as far asthe entryway where the attendance lists are kept. He labors strenuously for thepeople by entering his name there and receives his welldeserved reward in theshape of a small payment for his long and exhausting efforts.After four years, just about the time their term of service is to expire, orduring other critical periods when the end of session for the parliamentary bodydraws nearer and nearer, these gentlemen suddenly feel an irresistible urge comeover them and they have a desire to take action. Just as the caterpillar cannothelp turning into a butterfly, these parliamentary worms leave the home of theirspecies and flutter out on new found wings to the good old common people. Oncemore they speak to the voters, telling them about their own tremendousaccomplishments and the stubbornness of their opponents. But sometimes theyencounter rude and unfriendly expressions thrown at them from the stupid massesinstead of grateful applause. If this lack of gratitude from the people risesbeyond a certain level, there is only one thing that can save the day. The gloryof the party must be shined up again and surely the party platform needs morerepairs. The party platform committee is set up and the charade begins all overagain.Considering the rock solid stupidity of the public, we cannot be surprised atthe resulting success of these tactics. Steered by its newspapers and blinded bythe attractive new party program, the privilegedclass and the working classcombine into a united voting herd as they go back into their old stalls andelect the same old deceivers. Then the \"man of the people\" and the \"candidate ofthe working class\" is transformed back into a parliamentary caterpillar where hecan continue gorging himself as he clasps to the branches of State life, wherehe will only to be transformed into a glittering butterfly again four yearslater.There is nothing more depressing than watching the whole process in soberreality and seeing the never-ending fraud for oneself.The privilegedclass camp of politicians cannot draw enough spiritual strengthfrom this kind of self-indulgent dealing to fight a battle with the organizedpower of Marxism. These upper class people never seriously thought of battlingthem at all. With the admitted limitations and intellectual inferiority in theseparliamentary snake-oil-salesmen, who are supposed to represent the white race,how can they seriously expect to make any progress using Western Democracyagainst a doctrine that, at best, is designed as the means to destroy Democracy.Marxism is the means to an end, and that end is the destruction of WesternDemocracy by paralyzing the political body, which in turn leaves the path openfor itself. For now, one part of Marxism very shrewdly tries to pretend it isconnected to the principles of democracy, but we must never forget that when thecritical moment is upon us and Marxism is breathing down our necks, theseprivilegedclass legislators did not think a penny's worth of their time could besacrificed to reach a majority decision on the protection of Western Democraticprinciples. These privilegedclass parliamentarians believe the security of theReich is guaranteed by the monumentally superior numbers on their side so theyremain blind while Marxism snatches power with a crowd of thugs, deserters,political evangelists, and Jewish amateur intellects; these legislators aregiving the current democracy a resounding slap in the face through their failureto act.Only a legislator with the devout spirit of a witch-doctor could possiblybelieve that the wicked determination of those who support and profit from thisMarxist plague could be halted simply by uttering the magic spell of WesternDemocracy.Marxism will march along side democracy until it indirectly succeeds in gainingsupport for its criminal intentions from the very nationalist intellectual worldwhich Marxism has marked for extermination. If Marxist leaders became convincedtoday that, somewhere in the witches cauldron of our parliamentary democraticsystem, a numerical majority might suddenly be brewed which would furiouslycombat Marxism, the parliamentary hocus-pocus would be over in an instant.Instead of appealing to the democratic conscience, the flagbearers of the RedInternational movement would send out a fiery call to action to the workingclass masses and their battle would jump from the stuffy air of ourParliamentary chambers into the factories and spill onto the streets. Democracywould immediately be over. What the intellectual prowess of these parliamentaryapostles-of-the-people had failed to accomplish in the Parliament would now beaccomplished by the crowbar and the sledgehammer wielded by the excited workingclass masses who would achieve the Marxist goals in a flash, just as in the fallof 1918. With one crushing blow, they would teach the privilegedclass world howcrazy it was to think that one can resist the Jewish worldconquest with thetools of Western Democracy.As I have said before, it requires a trusting soul to honor the rules of thegame, when he is faced with an opponent who sees the rules only as a masqueradefor his own benefit and then the instant he no longer finds those rules give himadvantage, he throws them overboard. In all political parties of privilegedclassorientation, the entire political struggle consists of a scramble for individualseats in Parliament. During this time they adhere to convictions and principlesuntil those principles begin to weigh them down, and then they are tossedoverboard as easily as bags of sand. Naturally, their political platforms andprograms are setup in a similar way so they can be discarded just as quickly.The party's strength is measured by that scale, but in reverse, the more weightthey discard, the more bogged down they become and hence the weaker they become.They don't have that powerful magnetic attraction which the great masses want tofollow, that aura of an irresistible impression, of great and outstandingprinciples, and of the convincing force of unconditional faith in thoseprinciples, along with the fanatical fighting courage to defend them.At a time when one side, armed with all the weapons of a WorldConcept , eventhough it is absolutely criminal, prepares for the attack on an existing order,the other side can successfully resist only if it covers itself in the form of anew, and in our case political, faith, and exchanges the catchwords of a weakand cowardly defense for the battle-cry of a bold and brutal attack.If someone, especially one of the socalled nationalist privilegedclass ministerslike a Bavarian Centrist, accuses our movement of working for an \"upheaval\",there is just one possible answer to such a political Tom Thumb: \"Right you are.We are trying to make good what you in your criminal stupidity failed to do. Youand your principles of parliamentary position-jockeying helped to drag thenation into a black pit, but we will aggressively set up a new WorldConcept andwith fanatical fervor, unshakably defend its principles. We will build the stepsthat our people will one day be able to again climb to the Temple of Freedom\".When our movement was founded, we devoted our primary efforts toward preventingour army of fighters, for a new and high conviction, from turning into a meresociety for the furthering of parliamentary interests. The first preventivemeasure was the creation of a program that urged the development of a partywhose inner greatness was designed and calculated to frighten off the petty andweak minds of our present party politicians. The soundness and necessity of ouridea, to establish a sharp definition of our program's aims, was best shown bythose fatal problems which led to Germany's collapse. The recognition of theproblems faced by Germany was bound to give a shape to the new State-concept,which, in turn, is an essential element in a new WorldConcept .In the first volume, I dealt with the word \"racialist\", pointing out that thisdesignation is too obscurely-defined as an idea to allow it to form a solidfighting group. There are many groups that are as different as night and dayfloating around at this time under the blanket name \"racialist\". So before I goon to explain the aims of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, I wouldlike to clarify the idea \"racialist\" and its relation to the Party movement.The word \"racialist\" is vague. It does not clearly express any specific idea andit is subject to many interpretations, and it is as limitless in practicalapplication as, for instance, the word \"religion\". It is also difficult for usto create a clear picture in our mind about what it means, either fortheoretical or practical descriptions. The term \"religious\" becomes concreteonly when it is connected with a sharply defined form which is actuallypracticed. It sounds very pretty to say someone is \"deeply religious\", but thatis usually a hollow statement, for it says nothing about a man's character.There may be a very few individuals who feel themselves satisfied by such ageneral term and others who may even assign to it a definite picture of aparticular spiritual state.But the great masses are not made up of philosophers or saints. An absolutelygeneral and non-specific religious idea like this will be turned into thelistener's personal interpretation. It does not lead to an effective innerreligious craving that one possesses when the purely abstract and unlimitedworld of ideas shapes itself into a clearly defined faith. This is not an end initself, but only a means to the end. However, the means is the essential way ofattaining the end. This end is by no means solely a theoretical ideal, but thebottom line is that it is extremely practical. In fact, we must realize thatgenerally, the highest ideals always correspond to a profound vital necessity inour lives, just as the nobility we see in beauty is ultimately determined by aform that is logical and useful in the end; [the beauty of form follows itsfunction.] Faith helps to raise man above the level of a mere animal existence,and it contributes to strengthening and safeguarding his existence. Hisreligious training includes religious doctrine, but in practicality alsoincludes morals, ethics, and the principles it supports. If you eliminate thisreligious training, it will result in a critical weakening of the foundations ofhis existence. It is safe to say that man lives to serve higher ideals, but thatthese higher ideals also are the essentials for his existence as a man. Thecircle is complete.Even the general term \"religious\" implies certain basic ideas or convictions.Some of these are the immortality of the soul, the belief in eternal life, andthe existence of a higher Being. These ideas, though firmly believed as factualby the individual, are still subject to the interpretation of that individualand subject to his acceptance or rejection of them if the emotional power behindthem does not take on the force of an undeniable law that is the doctrine thatdefines a clear faith. More than anything else, this doctrine is the fightingelement which breaks through the outer appearance of fundamental religious viewsand pushes those superficial, theoretical trappings aside to clear the path fora deep and committed faith. Without a clearly defined faith, the multiple vagueforms of religious feeling followed by individuals would not only be worthlessfor human life, but probably would contribute to general disintegration.The same analysis for \"religion\" is true for the term \"racialist\". It tooembodies certain basic ideas. But these, even though of outstanding importance,are so vague in form that they have no value beyond an opinion more or lessdeserving of recognition. The ideals of a WorldConcept and the requirementsdeduced from them are not understood by pure feeling or men's inner will anymore than freedom is conquered by a universal desire for it.No, only when the idealistic longing for independence is organized to fight inthe form of military force can the compelling desire of a people be transformedinto a splendid reality.Even a WorldConcept that is totally sound and of the utmost value for humanitywill never have any practical value and will never shape the people's livesuntil its principles have become the banner of a fighting movement. The movementwill remain a party until its work has been completed by bringing its ideasvictory, and its party doctrines form the new State whose principles shape thecommunity.If an abstract intellectual concept is to serve as the foundation for futuredevelopment, the first requirement is to create a clear understanding of thenature, the character, and the extent of this idea. This is the only way amovement can be founded so that it maintains the inner cohesion and uniformityof its convictions and from this uniformity it will develop the necessarystrength for the battle. General concepts must be molded into a politicalprogram, a general WorldConcept into a definite political faith. Since its aimmust be one that is within reach and can be accomplished in the real world, thisfaith must not only serve the idea, but must include the means that will be usedto fight and to win victory for the idea. Along with the theoretically soundintellectual idea which was originally declared by the program maker, thepolitician must use his practical insight to shape the idea into an achievableplan. An eternal ideal that is the guiding star of humanity must adjust itselfso that it takes into account the weaknesses inherent in man because of generalhuman imperfection, and only then can it avoid failure the instant it begins.The founder of the idea, the explorer of truth, must be joined by the man whoknows the people's spirit, and they must work together in order to extract whatis humanly possible for tiny mortals from the realm of ideals and eternal truthand to give it a shape that can be used in the fight.This transformation of a general and idealistic WorldConcept into a definite,tightly organized, political, fighting brotherhood of faith, which is unified inboth mind and will, is the most significant achievement we can hope for. Anychance of victory for the idea depends completely on this successfultransformation of an idea into a practical plan. Out of a crowd of millions whoindividually have at least some understanding of these truths, and a few who mayfully understand them, one man must arise who can form clear and rock solidprinciples. This man will create a force out of the shifting tide ofunderstanding that exists in the broad masses, and this force will be so strongit cannot be doubted. He must fight to make the truth of these ideas exclusiveso that no others can be considered and continue in his fight until he createsan unshakable rock out of man's will and a single solid belief rises from aworld of free flowing and shaky ideas. The right to take such action comes fromnecessity and the right of the particular man to take this action is justifiedby his success.When we try to find the inner core meaning of the word \"racialist\", we come tothe following conclusion: The ordinary concept that exists in politics is thatthe State, in itself, has creative and cultural energy it can use to build acivilization, but it has no understanding of the essentials of race in thecreation of a State. The State is thought to be more of a product of economicnecessities, or at best, the natural result of a political lust for power. If weextend this view to its logical conclusion, it leads to a misconception ofracial forces, and it leads to the idea that the individual is of littleimportance. If we deny that the different races vary in respect to their generalpowers of creativeness in their own culture, then this must mean that when weevaluate the individual person, he too does not vary in his powers ofcreativity. The assumption that the races are alike leads to a similar attitudetoward peoples, and thereby toward individual men. Consequently, internationalMarxism itself is just the transformation, by the Jew Karl Marx, of a longexisting WorldConcept into a definite political profession of faith. Without thewidespread preexisting foundation of such a poison, the amazing politicalsuccess of this doctrine would never have been possible. Among millions ofpeople, Karl Marx was the one man who, with the sure eye of the prophet,recognized the poisons essential to his plan were already in the swamp of aslowly decaying world. He separated and identified those poisons, like ablack-magic wizard, to make a concentrated solution he could use to speed thedestruction of the free nations on this earth. All this was done to serve hisrace.Marxist doctrine is the extract of the intellectual soul of today's universalWorldConcept that is boiled down into a concentrated form. For that reasonalone, any struggle against it by our privilegedclass is impossible and I wouldeven say such a fight would be ridiculous. The privilegedclass world is alreadysaturated with all these Marxist poisons. It has already declared its devotionto a similar WorldConcept which differs from the Marxist concept only in itsdegree and in the character of the privilegedclass people who hold thosebeliefs. The privilegedclass world is Marxist, but they believe they can somehowdominate and keep the privilegedclass in control. However, true Marxism worksday and night to deliver the world into the hands of the Jew. The racialistWorldConcept , on the other hand, recognizes the importance of the racialcomponent of humanity. In principle, it sees the state only as a means to an endand its end is the preservation of the racial existence of mankind. In otherwords, racialist theorists are far from believing all races are equal, butunderstand different races have inferior or superior merit along with theirdifferences. This understanding obligates racialism to honor the universal Willof Nature that rules the universe and assists in the victory of the better andstronger and to demand the subjugation of the inferior and those weaker. Inprinciple, it acknowledges the aristocratic idea of Nature and believes in thislaw's authority down to the last individual creature. Racialism recognizes thatraces have different values and there are different values of individual men.Out of the masses we see the significance of the individual emerge, and thiseffect results in the organizing force of racialism and not the disorganizingforce of Marxism. It believes the ideal of humanity is a necessity since itregards the achievement of this ideal as the sole essential element for theexistence of mankind. However, it cannot allow an ethical idea to prevail ifthat idea represents a threat to the racial life of those who maintain a higherethical ideal. In a world that has become bastardized and negroid, any conceptof what is beautiful in humanity and noble and any image of an idealized futurefor our part of humanity would be lost forever.Human culture and civilization on this planet are inseparable from the existenceof the Aryan. His extinction or downfall would bring the barbaric uncivilizedages on the globe once more. In the eyes of any racebased WorldConcept ,undermining of the existence of human culture by destroying the one group thatsustains it, is the most repulsive crime possible. He who dares to harm thehighest likeness of the Lord on this Earth offends God, the Creator of thismiracle, and is the cause of our expulsion from this Paradise.Therefore, the racebased WorldConcept agrees with the profound will of Nature.It restores that free play of natural forces which lead, stage by stage, levelby level, to a continuous improvement of the race by natural selection until thebest of humanity acquires its rightful possession of this earth and finally winsa free hand to rule which will extend throughout the world and even beyond thisworld. We all have a feeling that in the distant future, man may be faced withproblems that are so big, only an outstanding race and a powerful ruling nationwhich is supported by the entire world will be capable of solving.It is obvious that attempting to impose such a general definition on theextensive meaning of a racebased WorldConcept may lead to a thousand differentinterpretations. In fact, there is hardly even one of our newer politicalorganizations that does not in some way fall back on this concept of the world.The very existence of racialism, as opposed to the multitude of othervariations, proves there is a difference in their concepts. The MarxistWorldConcept , which is led by a unified head organization, faces a jumble ofopposing views which makes little impression on the enemy's united front.Victory cannot be achieved by such weak weapons. Only when the internationalWorldConcept that is politically led by organized Marxism is opposed by aracebased concept that is equally unified and equally organized and equally wellled, will these two camps meet on even ground, and that is when victory willstand with the camp that has eternal truth on its side. However, this is onlypossible if both sides possess equal fighting energy from their members.The organized embodiment of a WorldConcept can exist only if there is aprecisely defined formula that lays it out. What doctrines are for religiousfaith, the party principles are for the political party. Therefore, a tool mustbe made for the racebased WorldConcept , just as the Marxist party organizationclears the road for internationalism, the racialist movement needs a partyorganization that will allow it to take its rightful place in battle. This isthe aim of the National Socialist German Workers' Party.The party's ability to embrace and integrate the racialist idea into its ownorganization is indispensable for the victory of the racebased WorldConcept .The best proof is a fact that it is admitted, at least indirectly, by those whooppose the integration of racebased ideas with party principles into a partyunit. The very people who never become tired of insisting that the racebasedWorldConcept is not the \"hereditary property\" of an individual party, and cannotbe claimed by a single party because it sleeps or \"lives\" in the hearts ofmillions of people, are proving themselves wrong because the fact that this ideaexists in millions has not stopped the approaching victory of the opposingWorldConcept of Marxism. If this concept did exist in a clear way in theirhearts, the German people today would have already won a tremendous victory, andthey would not be standing on the brink of an abyss. What brought success to theinternationalist WorldConcept of Marxism was the fact that it was maintained bya political party organized as an offensive militant storm troop. What defeatedthe opposing WorldConcept was a lack of the uniform and united support needed tofight for their cause. A WorldConcept doctrine cannot fight and win if it allowsthe unlimited freedom for anyone to interpret its meaning. It can only fight andwin if it is clearly defined in the limited and consolidated form of a politicalorganization.For this reason, I took it upon myself to sort out the extensive and unformedsubstance of a general WorldConcept and to remodel those central ideas into arigid dogmatic form. These clearly defined doctrines are capable of unifying thepeople who pledge themselves to these principles. In other words, theNationalSocialist German Workers' Party adopts the essential elements from theracebased WorldConcept. These principles form a political declaration of faithby taking into consideration practical realities and limitations, the times welive in, and the available human resources as well as their weaknesses. Thiscreates a closely-knit organization consisting of the greatest mass of peoplepossible, and it provides the basis for a fight to victory on behalf of thisWorldConcept.2. THE STATEEven in 1920-1921, the now exhausted privilegedclass world continued tocriticize our young movement by saying that we had a hostile attitude toward thepresent State. Party gangs representing a collection of political views assumedthey were justified in attempting, by any means possible, to suppress the youngand unpleasant message of our new WorldConcept . In the process, they somehowforgot that the present-day privilegedclass world itself no longer had anyuniform concept of what the State meant, they have no uniform definition for it,and they cannot reach an agreement among themselves. After all, those who do theexplaining are often employed at our institutions of higher learning asprofessors of civil law. Their highest duty is to find explanations andinterpretations that support those officials who currently provide their breadand butter through State support. The more impossible a state's make-up becomesas it grows and grows, the more artificial and unintelligible the definitionsthat try to give a purpose to its existence become. What could an Imperial-RoyalUniversity professor write about the meaning and purpose of the State in acountry whose State's existence embodied the greatest monstrosity of thetwentieth century? This was a difficult task because the present-day professorof civil law has less of an obligation to be truthful than to face pressure toserve a specific purpose. This purpose is the preservation of that particularhorror, the monstrous human machine now called the State, which he must salvageat any cost. No one should be surprised if, in the discussion of this problem,realistic considerations are avoided as much as possible, and in their place ajumble of \"ethical\", \"moral\", and other intellectual values, tasks, and aims aresubstituted.In general we can distinguish three approaches used by these theorists: A. Thegroup which believes the state is simply a voluntary association of human beingsunder a governing power.This group is the largest. In its ranks, we find the worshipers of ourpresent-day principle of authority, in whose eyes the will of the people playsno part at all. To them, the fact of a state's existence in itself makes itsacred and invincible. To accept this craziness of the mind, one would need anabsolutely dog-like adoration of socalled state authority. In such people'sheads, the means is turned into an end in the twinkling of an eye. The state isno longer there to serve men. The men are there to worship a state authoritythat embodies the ultimate and somehow the official spirit. To prevent thiscondition of silent, ecstatic worship from being transformed into one ofdisorder, the state authority itself exists only to maintain peace and goodorder. In this fashion it is no longer a means or an end. The state authoritymust guard peace and civil order, and peace and civil order in turn must makepossible the existence of the state authority. Between these two poles all oflife must revolve.In Bavaria this approach is represented primarily by the state craftsmen of theBavarian Center party, which goes under the name \"Bavarian People's Party\" (theparty that splintered from the main Center Party in 1919). Formerly in Austriathe Black-and-Gold Monarchy supporters carried this stasis-ofstate attitude.(Black and Gold were the royal colors of the House of Hapsburg and theLegitimists, who supported a Monarchy system and believed in a succession ofkings based on fixed rules.) In the Reich itself, it is often the conservativeelement whose concept of the state follows this same path.B. The second group is somewhat smaller in number. It includes those who atleast attach a few qualifications to the existence of a state. They want auniform administration and a single language, if only to make day to dayadministration easier. The maintenance of state authority is no longer the soleand exclusive purpose of the state. The welfare of the subjects is alsoincluded. Ideas of \"freedom\", which are mostly based on misunderstandings of theword, intrude themselves into the idea of what constitutes a state. The form ofgovernment no longer appears sacred by virtue of the simple fact that it exists,but it is tested to show that it has some use and is good for something. Themere fact that the government has existed a long time does not protect itagainst the criticism of the present. Beyond that, this concept expects thestate to provide economic stability and advantages for the individual, and,therefore, the state is judged from the standpoint of how well it promoteseconomic productivity. We find supporters of this view among our ordinary Germanprivilegedclass, particularly the members of our liberal democracy.C. The third group is the smallest in number. It sees the state as a way toachieve political power. This power is mostly imagined in a vague and distantway as an ethnic group of people within the state that is defined and unified bya specific race and language. They desire a single state language to directnationalization in their own direction. However, this idea is completelymistaken.In the last hundred years, it has been a disaster to watch how the word\"Germanization\" has been played with by those circles just mentioned, eventhough they often did so with the best of intentions. I myself can stillremember how, in my youth, this particular term conjured up a host of extremelymistaken ideas. Even in PanGerman circles at that time, one often heard theopinion that Austrian Germans might, with the assistance of the government,succeed in Germanizing the Austrian Slavs. They never realized for a moment thatGermanization can only be applied to a country and never to a group of people.What most people thought the word meant was the forced use of the Germanlanguage. But it is an unimaginable mistake to think that a negro or a Chinesecan become a native German simply because he learns the German language andspeaks it in the future and perhaps will cast his vote for a German politicalparty.The fact that any such Germanization is in reality a deGermanization was neverclear to our privilegedclass nationalist world. If forcing a common languagecould today bridge and eventually wipe out previously obvious differencesbetween various races, it would be the beginning of bastardization and, in ourcase, it is not a Germanization, but a destruction of the Germanic element inour people. This has happened all too often in history when a conquering peoplesuccessfully force their language on the conquered, but then a thousand yearslater, when its language is spoken by a different people, they find theconquerors have really become the conquered.Nationality, or rather race, is not in the language, but in the blood. It couldonly be possible to speak of Germanization if this process succeeded in changingthe blood of the inferior. But this is obviously impossible. A mingling of bloodwould produce a change, but that change would mean a decline in the quality ofthe superior race. The final result of such a process would be the destructionof those very qualities which once made victory possible for the conqueringpeople. Cultural abilities would disappear if they were mated with a lower race,even though the resulting mixed breed spoke the language a thousand times betterthan the previous superior race. For a time, there will still be some strugglebetween the differing spirits of the original races. It may be that thedeclining people, in a last effort, produce surprising cultural achievements.But these are only single products belonging to the remaining elements of thehigher race, or bastards of the first generation in whom the better blood stillpredominates and strives to break through. Such cultural masterpieces are neverthe products of the final descendants of such hybrids. These mixes will alwaysexhibit a cultural quality that moves backwards and does not progress.Today it is fortunate that the Germanization of Austria by Joseph II never tookplace. ( Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor over Austrian lands until 1790 imposed aspart of the Age of Enlightenment the requirement that German be spoken insteadof Latin or local languages; it was not well-accepted especially, with themassive number of reforms accompanying it.) Its result would probably have beenthe survival of the Austrian State, but the price would have been the loweringof the racial quality of the German nation from sharing the same language amongseveral peoples. Over the course of centuries, a certain herd instinct wouldprobably have crystallized, but the herd itself would have been inferior. Apeople constituting a state might have been born, but the civilizing element inthose people would have been lost.It was better for the German nation that this process of mixing didn't happen,even though it was not due to any noble insight, but to the narrow-minded,shortsightedness of the Hapsburgs. If it had occurred, the German people todaycould not be described as a cultural factor any longer.In Austria as well as in Germany itself, socalled Nationalist circles were andare influenced by similar false reasoning. The often demanded policy ofGermanizing the Polish East unfortunately always rested on the same myth. Here,too, they believed the Polish element could be Germanized by simply changing thelanguage. This would have had a fatal result. A people of an alien race wouldexpress their alien thoughts in the German language, thereby compromising thenobility and dignity of our nationality by its own inferiority. Our Germanity isseriously damaged when a Jew, chattering in their version of the Germanlanguage, sets foot on American soil. They are labeled as Germans because manyAmericans are unaware of conditions in Germany. No one in Germany would everconsider these unclean immigrants from the East as Germans just because theyspeak a language that is mostly German.Historically, the soil that our forefathers conquered with the sword and settledwith German farmers has been the most useful Germanized element.Unfortunately, this colonization introduced alien blood into the body of ourpeople, and this contamination created that destructive idea which disconnectsour people called German hyper-individualism. (Laissez faire is the belief inpursuing economic goals free from any government regulation.) This unfortunatequality is frequently even praised. Even in this third group, many consider thestate as an end in itself and they believe the preservation of the state is thehighest duty of human existence.To sum up, the deepest roots of these views fail to tap into the understandingthat the true power which creates culture and substance of character depends onracial elements and that the state's primary task is the preservation andimprovement of the race. It is the race which is the essential element for allhuman cultural development. The ultimate conclusions from these false conceptsabout the nature and purpose of a state were drawn by the Jew, Marx. Heseparated the state concept from racial obligations, without offering any otheracceptable substitute, and used the privilegedclass to smooth the path for adoctrine which nullified the value of the state.Even here, the struggle of the privilegedclass world against the InternationalMarxist was bound to be a failure from the beginning. It had long ago sacrificedthe foundations which would be necessary to provide a solid footing for theirideas and beliefs. The cunning adversary, recognizing the weaknesses of itsenemy's structure, is rushing to the assault with weapons furnished by that sameenemy, even if those weapons were handed over unintentionally to the Marxists.It is, therefore, the first duty of a new movement, which is standing on thefoundation of a racebased WorldConcept , to explain the nature and the meaningof the State in a clear way.We can conclude that the state is not an end in itself, but a means to an end.The State is indispensable when it comes to forming a higher human civilization,but the State is not the cause of that higher civilization. The civilizationdepends exclusively on the existence of a race capable of creating that culture.There might be hundreds of states on earth which are excellent models ofgovernment, but if the Aryan bearer of civilization were to die out, no culturecould continue to exist, at least not a culture that would match theintellectual level of the advanced peoples of today. We may go further and saythat because we can form states, that in itself does not mean the human racecannot be destroyed if their superior intellectual ability and flexibility arelost as a result of the disappearance of the race which possesses the criticalcultural creation elements.If, for instance, the surface of the earth were turned upside down today by amassive earthquake and a new Himalaya mountain range were to rise from theocean, the civilization of mankind would be destroyed in one cruel catastrophe.No state would continue to exist; all the bonds of order would be dissolved; thedocuments of a thousand years' development would be destroyed; the world wouldbe one huge corpse-strewn field covered with water and mud. Yet, if from thischaos of horror just a few men of a definite race who were capable of creatingcivilization had escaped, the earth would once more show signs of human creativepower when calm was restored, even if it took a thousand years. Only thedestruction of the last civilized race and its individual members wouldpermanently devastate the earth. On the other hand we can see, even frompresent-day examples, that state structures which are founded by races that lackthis cultural intellectual element in their tribal beginnings cannot protect themembers of their race from eventual extinction.Just as certain species of great prehistoric animals became extinct, so man mustgive way if he lacks that certain intellectual strength which is required tofind the weapons necessary for his selfpreservation.The state does not advance cultural progress. The state can only preserve therace which does bring about the advancement. Otherwise, the state may continueto exist for centuries without taking any actions, while, as a result of thestate's failure to prevent the mixture of races, the cultural capacity and theresulting general quality of life among the people have suffered profoundchange. The present state, for instance, may still maintain its own existence ina mechanical way for a considerable length of time, but the racial poison ofinbreeding allowed by our political body produces a cultural decline that isalready horribly apparent today. The existence of a higher level of humanitydoes not depend on the State, but on the race which is the nationality capableof creating that improved level of humanity.This capacity always exists and only needs to be awakened by certain outsideconditions. Culturally and creatively gifted nations or races have theseabilities hidden within them, even though, at the moment, unfavorable outsidecircumstances do not allow the development of these tendencies. It is anunbelievable outrage to represent the native Germans of pre-Christian times as\"uncivilized\" or as barbarians. They were never barbarians. The rugged climateof their northern home simply forced conditions on them that prevented thedevelopment of their creative powers. If they had come to the more favorableregions of the south, their previously undeveloped capabilities would haveblossomed just as what happened with the Hellenes (the early Greek tribes). Thiswould have occurred even though there was no old history to build on and as longas they were able to obtain basic mechanical assistance in the form of lowerraces as workers. This inborn culturebuilding power did not come about justbecause of their presence in the northern climate. Had the Lapps (meaningLaplanders which is a derogatory term for the people of Sami, the culturalequivalent of Eskimos living in Europe) been brought to the South, they wouldhave had no more culturebuilding capacity than the Eskimo. No, this magnificentcreative capacity and growth capacity was granted to the Aryan. It may bedormant within him or it may be awakened in his life. It depends on howfavorable the circumstances are, or whether an inhospitable force of Natureprevents it.Therefore, the following conclusions result: The state is the means to an end.This end is the preservation and advancement of a community which consists ofphysically and spiritually similar beings. Part of this preservation includesassuring the survival of the race and permits the free development of all theforces sleeping within that race. The greatest part of the power of the statewill always be devoted to preserving the physical life and only the remainingpower assists in further intellectual development. We must remember that the oneis always vital to the other, physical and intellectual must both be maintained.States that do not serve this purpose are faulty, even outrages that cannotjustify their existence. The fact that these monstrosities do exist is not ajustification for their existence any more than the success of a crew of piratescan be a justification for high seas piracy.We National Socialists, as the supporters of a new WorldConcept , must nevertake our stand on the celebrated \"basis of facts\", and we must be especiallycareful of mistaken facts. If we did so, we would no longer be the supporters ofa great new idea, but rather slaves of the existing system. We must make a sharpdistinction between the State as a bottle and the race as its contents. Thebottle has a purpose only as long as it can preserve and protect the contents.If it fails in its purpose, it is worthless. The highest purpose of theracebased state is to care for and preserve those racial elements which are thecreators of culture. They produce the beauty and dignity of a higher humanity.As Aryans, we can view the state only as a living organism made up of people. Itdoes not merely assure the preservation of this nationality, but the state mustlead the people to the highest freedom possible by continuing to develop itsspiritual and intellectual capacities.But what is forced on us as a state today is in truth the tainted result ofprofound human error that brings with it unspeakable suffering as itsconsequences.We National Socialists know that this attitude is revolutionary in the modernworld and we are branded as revolutionaries for it. However, our thoughts andactions are not determined by the applause or disapproval of our contemporaries,but by our inescapable duty to a truth we have recognized. We must believe thatfuture generations with the benefit of hindsight will not only understand ourpresent course of action, but will also confirm it is the right one and praisethose who followed this path.From this we National Socialists set our standards for the evaluation of thestate. The state value will be relative when viewed from the standpoint of theindividual nations, but it is absolute when viewed from the standpoint of allhumanity. In other words, the merit of a state is not found by looking at thecultural level of the state or by comparing the importance of this state's powerrelative to the rest of the world, but the only value of a state is in howsuccessfully it serves the race of the nation in question.A state may be described as a model of its kind if it serves the vital needs ofthe race it represents and if by its own existence the state actually keeps thisnational race alive. How this nation is viewed by the rest of the world does notmatter; that is not a criterion for its success. It is not the task of the stateto create abilities but simply to clear the road for those abilities thatalready exist within its people. On the other hand, a state may be called bad nomatter how high its cultural level if it condemns those who carry the culturalability to destruction by allowing the corruption of its racial make-up. Thestate, in practice, destroys the essential element needed for the survival ofthis culture. This culture is not the creation of the state, but is the fruit ofa culturebuilding race protected by its unification as a state. As I said, thestate is not the substance of culture but the form. The cultural level ofdevelopment seen in a specific group of people is not the scale that should beused to measure the goodness of the state in which that race lives. It isobvious that an extensive and deep cultural wealth would appear superior to thatof a negro tribe. However the lifeless mechanical state of theculturally-endowed country may be worse than that of a negro nation if you judgeby the way each state performs its task, how efficiently and effectively thatstate meets the needs of its peoples. The best state and the best form ofgovernment can never bring out capabilities from a people if those abilities arenot and never were present in those people, however, a bad state is certainlyable to gradually kill off abilities that originally did exist through thedestruction of the culturesustaining race. A bad state will tolerate or evenencourage this destruction of their culture bearing members. Consequently thevalue of a state can primarily be judged by its relative usefulness to adefinite race and not by its importance in the world at large.This relative judgment can be formed quickly and correctly. A determination ofthe absolute value is more difficult since absolute value is judged by not onlythe state but even more by the cultural value and the people's high level racialquality of the country in question.If we speak of the higher mission of the state, we must never forget that theactual higher mission essentially belongs to the race. The state only has tocreate circumstances that allow the free development of those people by usingthe natural organizational strength of the state. When we ask how the state thatwe Germans need should be constructed, we must first build a clear idea of thekind of people it is to include and the purpose it is to serve.Unfortunately our German nationality no longer has a unified racial core and theprocess of fusing the various original races has not progressed to a point wherewe can talk about the formation of a new race. On the contrary, the variouspoisonings of blood which have afflicted our political body, especially sincethe Thirty Years' War, have rotted not only our blood, but our national soul. (The Thirty Years' War ended in 1648, and was a devastating war in which a largepercentage of the population of Europe, especially Germany, was wiped out andmany refugees moved to new areas or congregated in cities.) The open frontiersof our Fatherland, the contacts with non-Germanic foreign people along theborders, and especially the continuous strong influx and constant renewal offoreign blood into the interior of the Reich itself, allows no time for acomplete blend. No new race has come from the jumble. The racial elements remainwithin their own groups, side by side. The result is the German people scatterin all directions, particularly at those critical moments when crisis looms andthey should be gathering together instead of separating. The basic racialelements are distributed in various ways. This is not only by territory, butracial distribution can also vary within a small area. With Nordics, we findthey mix with East-Europeans; with East-Europeans, they mix with Dinarics(Croatian and Bosnian races); there are Westerners with both; and there aremixtures among them all. In one way, this has been very harmful. The Germanpeople lack that group instinct which is rooted in uniformity of blood and whichprotects nations from destruction, particularly in moments of danger. Whenpeople face danger, all the small internal differences among them disappearinstantly and they form a united front as the similar-group turns to face thecommon enemy.The jumble of our still unmixed, extremely different basic racial elements givesrise to what we know as hyper-individualism (o r laissez faire). In peacefultimes, it may occasionally do a good service, but overall, it has cheated us ofworld domination. If in its historical development the German people hadpossessed an instinct for group unity which has benefited other peoples, theGerman Empire today would probably be master of the globe.World history would have taken a different course. No man can tell whether thatdream of the blind pacifists might not have already been achieved without havingto plead for it by whimpering and weeping. That dream could be realized in theachievement of a peace that is not supported on the luxuries of tearful,pacifist, mourning women, but founded on the victorious sword of a dignifiedpeople; a sword that puts the world to work for the purposes of a higher cultureand a greater civilization.The fact that there did not exist a nation united by blood has brought usindescribable suffering. It gave glorious capital cities to many petty Germanrulers, but the people of Germany were deprived of their right to rule. Ourpeople suffer from this lack of unity still, but what has brought us hardship inthe past and present may become a blessing for the future. We have been heldback because our race failed to come together and unify; however, it has beenequally fortunate because our dispersed people stayed mostly within their owngroups, and at least part of our best blood has remained pure, escaping racialdegeneration.There is no doubt that a complete merger of our racial elements would haveproduced a unified national body, but as any crossing of races proves, theresulting mixed breed race would have had a smaller cultural capacity than thatoriginally possessed by the highest of the ingredient races. This is a fortunateaspect which results from the lack of complete intermingling. Even today, withinour German nation's body, we have a great stock of pure and unmixedNordic-Germanic people who we can consider our most precious possession for thefuture. In the dark days when we were ignorant of all racial laws, it wasbelieved that a man was simply a man and all men were of equal value. Theunderstanding that there are different merits among the individual racialelements may have been missing back then; however, today we know that a completeintermingling of the elements of our national body would have given us unity andmight have brought us external power, but the cost would have been the loss ofthe highest aim of humanity. This highest aim would have become unreachablesince the one foundation, the one race whom Fate has obviously chosen for thisachievement, would have been lost in the unified people's motley mixture.Previously kind Fate has prevented our race's destruction in spite of ourignorance, but now that we understand, we must examine and use this knowledge.Anyone who talks about a mission of the German people on earth must know thatsuch a mission can only begin by developing a state that sees the preservationand advancement of the noblest surviving element of our race and of all mankindas its primary responsibility. This is the only way the state can take on a highinner purpose. Compared to the ridiculous slogan that claims a state's onlypurpose is in assuring peace and good order that allows quiet, mutualtransactions so everyone may dupe everyone else, yes, jumping away from thatnonsense, the responsibility of preserving and advancing a supreme humanitybestowed on this earth by the goodness of the Almighty Himself seems to be atruly exalted mission. From our current lifeless mechanical state that claimsthe right to exist for its own sake, we must form a living being with the solepurpose of serving a higher idea.The German Reich as a state must include all Germans and must pursue its duty ofgathering and preserving the most valuable racial elements among our people sothat they may be raised slowly and surely to a dominant position in the world.We must replace this stagnate state with a period of battle. As always andeverywhere in the world, the saying will still hold, \"rest not, rust not\".Victory is always won by the man who attacks. The greater the goals which arefought for and the less the masses understand them, the greater the ultimatesuccess will be. This is the lesson learned by world history. The prominence ofthis success is increased if the goal has been formed correctly and the battleis fought with unshakable persistence. It may be more comforting for our presentleaders of the State to work for the preservation of an existing condition thanto fight for a future one. For them, it is much easier to see the state as amechanism which exists simply to keep itself alive because their lives \"belongto the state\", as they are in the habit of saying. They say this as if anythingoriginating in a national state being could logically serve any other purposethan that of the nationality, or as if man could work for anything exceptmankind! It is naturally easier to see the State authority as just the formalmechanism of an organization rather than to regard it as the sovereignembodiment of the instinct for selfpreservation of a race. For the weak minds ofpoliticians, the State and State authority are the end in themselves, whereasfor us, they are just a mighty weapon in the service of the great eternal fightfor life. It is a weapon that everyone must adopt, not because it is a mechanismor tool, but because it is the deceleration of our common will to exist.In the struggle for our new idea, an idea that is in perfect accord with theoriginal meaning of life, we will find only a few fighting allies in thatsociety of officials which is decrepit in mind and body. The only exceptions arethe old men who still have young hearts and fresh spirits. They will come to usfrom the ruling classes, but those who believe the ultimate goal of theirlife's-work is the preservation of existing conditions will never join ourranks.Opposing us is the endless army of the deliberately evil and, even more, thementally lazy and indifferent. Then there are those who have an interest in thepreservation of the existing situation and want to maintain the statusquoforever. It is on the obvious hopelessness of our tremendous struggle and themagnitude of our task ahead that we base the possibility of success. The war-crythat frightens away or discourages weak spirits is the same call that summonsthe nature of true warriors. We must understand that if a group of men riseabove the apathy of the masses, and their total energy and strength isconcentrated towards one goal, that these few percent will rise to be theoverlords of all. World history is made by small groups when this numericalminority embodies the will and determination of the people as a whole.What may seem like an obstacle to many people is in reality the first conditionfor our victory. The very scale and the difficulties of our task mean that onlythe best warriors will join in the battle. This very separation of the strongfrom the weak is a guarantee of our success.In general, Nature takes steps to correct the racial purity of ordinary livingbeings. She has little love for mongrels. The products of such cross breeding,especially the third, fourth and fifth generation, suffer bitterly. Not only arethey deprived of the qualities which were present in the original highestelement in the mixture, but due to the disharmony in their blood, they have lostthe focus of will and determination that is necessary to live at all. Atcritical moments, the racially pure being will make sound and single-mindeddecisions, but the racially mixed one grows uncertain or settles on saferhalfway measures. This shows that not only does a certain inferiority exist inthe racially mixed being as opposed to the racially pure, but also the mixedrace being faces the possibility of becoming extinct more rapidly. In countlesscases we see where the pure race stands strong, while the mongrel breaks down.This is where we see the hand of Nature making adjustments, but sometimes shegoes even further. She makes some of the offspring sterile, reducing thepossibility of further reproduction and preventing further crossbreeds. Thisultimately causes their extinction.If an individual member of a given higher race were to breed with one raciallyinferior, the result would be a being of a lower level than the upper race.More than this, there would be a weakening of the offspring when compared to theracially pure neighbors who had not intermingled. If more blood mingling withthe higher race is completely prevented, the mongrels will constantly interbreedand either die out as a result of their reduced resistance to disease, which isNature's wise decision, or over the course of many thousand years, they wouldform a new mixtured race in which the original individual elements, a thousandtimes crossed, would become completely mixed and no longer be recognizable. Thiswould mean the formation of a new race with a kind of herd resistance, but theywould possess considerably less intellectual and cultural ability in comparisonwith the higher race that took part in the original crossbreeding. Even in thiscase, the mixed breed product would be defeated in the struggle for existence aslong as a higher and unmixed racial group still existed as an adversary. Allstrength that this new racial group built up through unity with its own kind,over the course of a thousand years, would still not be enough to lead tovictory in a struggle with an equally united, but intellectually and culturallysuperior pure race. This happens because of the general lowering of the raciallevel and the consequent decrease in spiritual resilience and creative capacityof the mongrel race.We can, therefore, state the following principles: Any mixing of races willsooner or later, out of necessity, lead to the downfall of the mixed offspringif the superior element in this crossing still exists as a pure racial group.The danger to the mongrel group is eliminated only when the last racially puresuperior individual has disappeared, or when the higher race, which has kept itsblood pure otherwise, intermingles with the small number of mongrels.This is the beginning of a slow process of natural regeneration that graduallyclears up racial poisoning as long as an element of racially pure beings remainand there is no further blood mixing with lower races.This process may take place on its own among beings with a strong racialinstinct, who have simply been driven from the path of normal, racially purereproduction by special circumstances or some outside coercive force. When thispressure ceases, however, the racially pure part that remains will againimmediately strive to mate with its equal and this will put a stop to furtherintermingling. The mongrel offspring naturally move into the background again,except in a case where their number may already have increased and become sonumerous that any serious resistance to mixing on the part of the racially puresurvivors is out of the question.The man who has lost his instincts and does not recognize the obligation Naturehas given him cannot hope for any corrective action on Nature's part until herestores his lost instincts by clear intellectual awareness. Once heunderstands, then he must face the task of making the necessary amends bybringing back what was lost. There is a great danger that once a man no longersees his duty clearly, he will continue to tear down the racial barriers untilthe last remaining shred of his best part is finally lost. Then there would benothing left but a uniform racial mush, which appears to be the ideal sought byour \"wonderful worldreformers\" today. However this puree mix would soon driveall ideals from the world. True, a group of great size might be formed in thatway because a herd animal can be unnaturally combined, but no such mixture canever produce a man who can carry a culture or a man who can be a culturalfounder and creator. The mission of mankind could then be considered at an end.Anyone who does not want the earth to approach that condition must accept thatit is the task, especially of the German State, to be sure, above everything,that all further bastardization is stopped.The current generation of notorious weaklings will immediately yell, scream, andcomplain about interference with the most sacred rights of man. No, there isonly one most sacred right of man and this right is also the most sacred duty.It is to guard the blood and keep it pure, thus preserving the best part ofhumanity and giving these human beings the possibility of a more nobledevelopment of humanity. A racebased nationalist state, will, therefore, have tofirst raise marriage from the level of constant racial contamination and tobless it as the institution that is appointed to reproduce mankind in the imageof the Lord, not monsters that are half man and half ape.Those who protest against this plan on humane grounds corrupt the generationwhere, on the one hand, every degenerate has the chance to reproduce, bringinguntold suffering upon their offspring as well as upon society. On the otherhand, contraceptives are offered for sale in every drugstore and by streetvendors even to the healthiest would-be parents. The courageous privilegedclassnationalist supporters of our present State, which has the highest goal ofmaintaining peace and good order, they regard halting reproduction among thosewho are afflicted with syphilis, tuberculosis, hereditary defects, cripples, andthe mentally retarded as a crime. Yet the prevention of procreation amongmillions of the best and most healthy persons is not regarded as evil and is notan offense against the morals of this pious group, but it is convenient fortheir shortsighted mental laziness. Otherwise they would have to wrack theirbrains for the answer to how we maintain the conditions necessary to sustain andpreserve the healthy members of our nationality who will someday have to performthe same task of sustenance for the coming generation.How worldly and lacking in ideals and shameful this whole system is! People nolonger strive to do their best for the future race, but rather let things justhappen. Our churches also sin against the Lord's image, and then they turnaround only to preach the importance of the Lord's image. This attitude matcheswhat they are doing; they keep talking about the spirit, but let mankind, thepossessor of that spirit, sink into a corrupt and ever lower class. In light ofthis, people gaze stupidly at how ineffective the Christian faith is in theirown country and at the horrible \"Godlessness\" of this physically degenerate andspiritually ragged group of riffraff and filthy people. To try and correct thebalance, they attempt to convert the Hottentots (offensive term for Khoikhoinpeople in South Africa) and the Zulus (Bantu people of southeast Africa) and theKaffirs (offensive term used in South Africa meaning Black African) to theirreligious cause and to bestow on them the blessings of the Church. While ourEuropean people are abandoned, thanks and praise to God for that much, by themissionaries and our people are left to become physical and moral outcasts, thepious missionary travels to Central Africa and sets up negro missions so thatour \"higher culture\" may turn healthy, but primitive and low-grade human beingsinto a corrupt brood of bastards even there.It would be more in agreement with the spirit of this world's noblest Man,Jesus, if instead of annoying the negroes with missions that they do not desireand do not understand, our two Christian churches would teach Europe somethingvery important in a kindly, but serious way. Teach them that when parents arethemselves not healthy and sound, it is more pleasing to God for them to takepity on a healthy little poor orphan and adopt him than it is for theseunhealthy parents to bring a sickly child of their own into the world, whichwould only cause suffering and misery to itself and everyone around it.In this area, the racebased Nationalist state must correct what is not beingdone in any way shape or form by the powers in place. We must make race thecentral point of public life and the focus of the community. We must take stepsthat assure the race of our people is kept pure. We must establish the child asthe people's most precious possession. We must make certain that only healthyparents have children. There is only one thing that is truly shameful, and thatis for the sick and weak to bring children into the world. But even they canreach for the one highest honor and that is to refrain from giving life to anunhealthy child. On the other hand, however, it must be considered extremelyreprehensible to refuse the nation healthy children by withholding them. Here,the state must become the defender of a thousand years' future and supersede thedesires and the selfishness of the individual with the greater needs of thepeople. The State must press for the use of the latest advances in medicine tomake this realization happen. It must identify and actually make sterile allthose who are visibly sick and suffer hereditary taint and those who areseverely infectious so they are incapable of reproduction. On the other hand, itmust assure that the fertility of the healthy woman is not restricted byfinancial considerations resulting from poor management of a state governmentthat can make the blessing of children a curse for parents. We must sweep awaythe lazy, criminal indifference officials of today show towards the social needsof a large family. Instead, the State must take on the role of supreme protectorof this greatest of a people's blessings. Its concern must be devoted to thechild more than to the adult.The person who is not physically sound and unworthy in mind must not extend theline of his suffering by inflicting it into the body of his child. The racialstate must do an amazing amount of improvement in the area of education. Somedaythis work will emerge as a greater deed than the most successful wars of ourpresent privilegedclass age. Through education we must teach the individual thatit is no shame to have an illness, but merely a regrettable misfortune to beweakly and sick. We must also teach them that it is shameful and also a crime todefile this misfortune by giving in to personal selfishness and piling thissuffering on innocent beings. It is a symbol of the highest nobility of spiritand admirable humanity for a man who is innocently sick to go without a child ofhis own and instead to devote his love and tenderness to a young, poor, andunknown child of our nationality whose health offers the promise to somedaybecome an energetic member of the community. It is equally contemptible toproduce a child whose health promises to someday disease an energetic member ofour strong community. In this work of education, the state provides practicalassistance to improve the moral quality of our people. The state must act onthis education principle without regard for whether the public will understandor misconstrue the message or even whether or not the public will approve.If physical degenerates and mental cases were denied the ability and chance toreproduce for just six hundred years, it would not only free humanity from avast misfortune, but it would also contribute to an improvement in overallhealth that today seems almost inconceivable. If the fertility of thenationality's healthiest members is encouraged and brought out through adeliberate and systematic campaign, the result would be a race that haseliminated the present day germs which cause physical and spiritual decay. Oncea people and a state have traveled this road for a time, they will naturallycontinue to direct their attention toward increasing the valuable racial core ofthe people and especially encouraging its fertility so that finally, the entirenationality may share in the blessings of a highbred body of great racialquality.A state must not leave the settlement of newly acquired territories to chancebut must instead set down specific rules. It must establish race commissionswhich will issue permits for those individuals wishing to settle the new areas,but these permits will be issued based on the racial purity of the individuals.Using this method, border colonies can gradually be formed whose populationconsists exclusively of those who possess the highest racial purity and are ofthe highest racial ability. These colonies become a precious national treasurefor all of the people. Their growth will fill every individual member of thepeople with pride and satisfying confidence. After all, these colonies are thefinal seeds which will be needed for the great future development of his ownpeople and of mankind.Our racebased WorldConcept will eventually succeed in creating a noble age wherepeople's primary concern is not the improved breeding of dogs, horses, and cats,but the exaltation of man himself. It will be an age when one race with fullcomprehension of its achievement will silently sit back while the other racesjoyfully sacrifice and give for the benefit of the higher race.It can't be denied that this is clearly possible in a world where hundreds ofthousands upon hundreds of thousands voluntarily take a vow of celibacy under nopressure or obligation other than their willing acceptance of a religiouscommand. Is the same surrender not possible when the religious idea is replacedby the reprimand to end the original sin of race poisoning, whose affects lastforever, and to give to the Almighty Creator beings which are in His own imageand return to Him that which He Himself has made? True, the pitiful army of ourpresent-day lowbrow leaders will never understand this. They will laugh at it orshrug their stooping shoulders and groan their standard excuse, \"That would allbe very nice, but it can't be done!\" It could never be done by you. Yourprivilegedclass world is incapable of accomplishing such an idea. You have onlyone concern, your personal luxuries and you have only one God, your money! Butwe are not speaking to you lowly leaders. We are speaking to the great army ofthose who are too poor to think that their personal luxury is the key to realhappiness in the world, to those who do not see gold as the ruler of existence,but to those who believe in other gods. Above all else, we are speaking to themighty army of our German youth. They are growing up during a greatturning-point in history and their fathers' sins of apathy and indifference willforce them to fight for their survival. Someday German youth will either be thearchitect of a new racial state, or it will be the last witness to the completecollapse and end of the privilegedclass world.This generation suffers through mistakes which it sees and is fully aware of,but satisfies itself, as our privilegedclass world today does, with the cheapexcuse that nothing can be done about it. This is a society which is marked forextinction. Our privilegedclass world can no longer deny the evil conditionsthat exist. It is forced to admit we are surrounded by corruption and evil, butit cannot decide to fight against the evil and it cannot muster up its grimenergy to unite a people of sixty or seventy millions strong so that we can makea stand against the threat facing us.On the contrary, if anyone makes an effort toward change, these leaders makesilly, petty comments, and from a safe distance, they try to prove the idea istheoretically impossible and declare any practical success unthinkable. Noargument is too half-witted to support their nitpicking claims or serve theirmoral attitude. If, for instance, an entire continent were to declare war on thepoison of alcohol and attempt to free its people from the clutches of thisdevastating vice (refers to American Prohibition of 1920), our Europeanprivilegedclass world only would only respond with a blank stare and then asuperior know-it-all condescending shake of the head, which is particularlybecoming to this ridiculous segment of society. But if these foolishdeclarations are not heeded, and the noble society seeking to improve itselfcontinues in its effort, and the good old way of doing things is successfullydiscredited because somewhere in the world someone achieved success by anothermethod, then the success itself is questioned or the value of the originalobjective is declared as unimportant by these privilegedclass fools. Theprivilegedclass leaders do not even consider entertaining a discussion of themeasures for a moral struggle which could possibly sweep away the greatest ofimmorality among out people.We must not fool ourselves. Our present privilegedclass is already worthless tomankind when it comes to any dignified task simply because it has lost allvalues it may have possessed and is evil. It is not evil because it desires tobe evil, but rather because these people are too lazy to rise up against theevil attacking our people. For that reason, those social clubs that float aroundunder the general name of \"privilegedclass political parties\" are nothing morethan an association with an interest in select professional groups and socialclasses. Their most noble aim is only to represent their selfish interests asmuch as possible. It is very plain that this sort of political privilegedclasssociety is not suited for battle, that is to say they are unprepared for abattle where the opposing side is not made up of cautious shopkeepers, butinstead is built from working class masses that have been incited to extremes,are highly enraged and are determined to fight to the bitter end.If we recognize that the first task of the State is in working for the welfareof this nationality and for the preservation and development of its best racialelements, it is natural that this concern goes beyond the birth of the littlenew member of our people. This concern must extend to training the youngdescendants into valuable members of our society who can subsequently propagatethe race further. The racial quality is the first essential for intellectualcapability, and following that, education must begin by promoting physicalhealth. A sound, energetic mind is only found in a sound and energetic body.The fact that geniuses are often physically handicapped and sometimes diseaseddoes not disprove this principle. These are exceptions that only prove the rule.When the masses of a people are made of physical degenerates, we will rarely seea great mind rise out of this swamp. If such a mind does exist, his work willnever be fated for great success. The degraded mob will either be unable tounderstand him at all or their determination and willpower will be so weak thatthey cannot follow the soaring flight of such an eagle.Realizing this, the racebased state must direct its primary educational efforttoward training sound and healthy bodies and not just pumping in knowledge.Development of the intellectual abilities takes second place. The development ofcharacter and especially strength of will and determination, comes first.Together with this we must teach the joy that comes from readily acceptingresponsibility. Scientific education comes last.The racebased Nationalist state must operate from the belief that a man withlittle academic schooling, but who is physically sound and has a good, solidcharacter, who is filled with determination and strong will is more valuable tothe people's community than a brilliant weakling. If a nation is led by scholarswho are physically degenerate, weakwilled, and cowardly pacifists, they will notconquer anything under Heaven nor even be able to assure their own existencehere on earth. In the fierce battle of Destiny, the one who is conquered is notusually the least educated, but is the one who is too weakwilled to put hisdecisions into action.There must be a certain harmony maintained between mind and body. A decayed bodyis not made even a tiny bit more beautiful by a brilliant mind. In fact, thehighest intellectual training could not be justified at all if it were possessedby one who was physically degenerate and crippled, weakwilled, indecisive, andcowardly in character. What makes the Greek the ideal of immortal beauty is themarvelous pairing of magnificent physical beauty with a brilliant mind and noblesoul.If Moltke's words are true, \"In the long run, only the able man is lucky\", theymust certainly be true for the relation between body and mind. (Moltke meansMoltke the Elder, Chief of the Prussian General Staff 1857-1871.) The mind thatis healthy will only dwell in a body that is sound.Physical training in the racebased Nationalist state is not just the concern ofthe individual or the parents and should not be second or third place in thepublic interest. It is indispensable for the self -preservation of thenationality and should be upheld and protected by the state. As far as formaleducation is concerned, the state currently supersedes the individual's right tochoose and imposes community-based education by compelling the child to go to aparticular school without concern for the parents' wishes. To an even greaterdegree, the racebased state in the future will have to establish its authorityahead of the ignorance or the misunderstanding of the individual when it comesto preserving the nationality. The state must arrange its educational work sothat the bodies of youngest children are suitably tempered and toughened so theycan meet the demands they will face in later life.Above all, the state must take care not to create a nation filled withstay-at-home individuals.The job of care and training must begin by teaching the young mother. It waspossible through decades of careful work to achieve antiseptic cleanlinessduring childbirth and to reduce birth related fevers to just a few cases. In thesame manner, it must and will be possible by thorough training of nurses andmothers to introduce a training system for the child in his earliest years thatwill be an excellent basis for later development.In a racebased Nationalist state, the school must set aside much more time forphysical training. It is not acceptable to weigh down the young brains ofstudents with heavy loads of book learning. Experience has clearly shown thatthese students will remember only a small fraction of what they are exposed toand the part they do retain usually consists of unnecessary and trivial factsinstead of the essentials they will need for later life. The young person is notcapable of sifting through the mountain of material and separating out theimportant from the unimportant parts in this sea of knowledge poured into him.Today, the secondary schools only schedule two hours a week for gymnastics andeven those two hours are not mandatory. This is a glaring imbalance of theimportance between purely intellectual and physical training. A single dayshould not go by without the young person's body being trained for at least anhour in the morning and an hour in the evening. This training should be in allkinds of sport and gymnastics. One sport in particular that must not beforgotten is boxing. Many \"racialists\" regard this sport as brutal and vulgar.The current false opinions in \"cultivated\" circles about boxing are quiteastonishing. If a young man learns to fence with a sword and then goes arounddueling, it is socially acceptable and even considered honorable, but for him tobox is thought to be rough. Why is this? No other sport approaches boxing whenwe look at how it builds up aggressiveness, demanding lightningspeed decisions,and training the body in strong agility. It is no rougher for two young peopleto fight out a difference of opinion with their fists than with a piece ofsharpened iron. The man who defends himself with his fists when he is attackedis not less honorable than the man who runs away, yelling for a policeman. Aboveall, the young healthy boy should learn how to stand up to hard knocks and riseagain when he is beaten. Naturally our present-day intellectual warriors regardthis as savage. But it is not the purpose of a racebased Nationalist state tobreed a colony of pacifists who are more interested in appearances thansubstance or to breed physical degenerates. The state ideal is not the honestlowbrow or the virtuous old maid, but the defiant individual representing manlystrength and women who can bring strong men into the world. Sports exist notonly to make the individual strong, agile, and bold, but also to toughen andteach people to endure the difficult world around them.Our entire intellectual upper class was exclusively brought up by being taughtthe refined lessons of manners. If they had all learned to box instead, a GermanRevolution consisting of dandy-men, deserters, and rabble would have never beenpossible. The Revolution was made a success by the cowardly, miserableindecision of those who guided the State, and its success was not due to thebold and courageous energy of the revolutionaries. Our entire intellectualleadership had been educated with \"intellectual weapons\" and was defenseless themoment the adversary picked up a real physical weapon. The revolution waspossible only because our schools of higher learning preferred to train civilservants, engineers, technicians, chemists, lawyers, literati, and did not trainmen to be real men. They were more concerned that they would run out ofprofessors. Our intellectual leadership has always been brilliant in itself, butwhen it comes to willpower and accomplishment, our leadership has been beneathcontempt.No amount of training will make a coward into a courageous man. It is equallycertain that a man with some amount of courage may be paralyzed in hisdevelopment if his education is inferior from the outset and does not encouragehis strength and agility. The confidence one gains from physical excellencegreatly increases a man's courage and even awakens his aggressiveness. This canbe judged best by the army. Our military men were not all heroes here any morethan anywhere else. Overall, they were average. But the superior training givento the German soldier in peacetime injected the giant military being with ahypnotic faith in its own superiority and this faith was built up to a degreeits enemies never thought possible. The immortal spirit and courage displayed bythe onrushing German army in the summer and fall of 1914 were the result of thetireless training through the long, long years of peace. This training led mento achieve the greatest of deeds and out of feeble bodies it produced aselfconfidence that was never lost, not even in the horror of the greatestbattles.Our German people are broken and crushed. They lie exposed to the kicks of theworld, and they need the hypnotic strength inherent in selfconfidence beforethey can restore themselves. This selfconfidence must be trained into the youngmembers of our people from childhood. Our children's entire education andtraining must be planned to give him the certainty that he is absolutelysuperior to all others. Through building his physical strength and agility, hemust regain his faith in the invincibility of his entire nation. What once ledthe German army to victory was the sum total of the confidence that each soldierfelt in himself and soldiers' common confidence in their leadership. In orderfor the German people to stand on their feet again, they must restore theirconviction to re-conquer their freedom. This can only be achieved whenconviction exists equally in the hearts of the grand total of all the millionsof our people. We must not allow ourselves to be deceived in this.The collapse of our people was overwhelming, and the effort to bring this agonyto an end must be equally overwhelming. Anyone who believes that our people canobtain the strength to shatter the present world structure and throw the brokenchains of slavery in the faces of our enemies from our present privilegedclasseducation, which teaches us peace and good order, is bitterly mistaken. Thispath would lead to our destruction. Only an extra dose of national willpower, athirst for freedom, and the utmost passion can correct what we have lost.Even the clothing youth wear must be suited to this purpose. It is sad to seehow our young people are already subject to a fashion-madness that does itsshare to turn the old saying, \"Clothes make the man\", into a disastrous one.Youth is the time when clothing must work for education. The boy who wears longtrousers and is wrapped up to the neck in the summer, loses any desire forphysical exertion just because of his clothing. To solve this problem we mustappeal to ambition and vanity. Not vanity of fine clothes, which obviously noteveryone can afford, but vanity of a beautiful, well-formed physique, whicheveryone can create.A strong body will be useful in later years too. A young girl must have theopportunity to become acquainted with her knight. If physical beauty were notcompletely pushed into the background and hidden by our fancy world of fashion,the seduction of hundreds of thousands of girls by bowlegged, disgusting Jewbastards would not be possible. It is also in the best interest of the nationthat the most beautiful specimens should find one another and help create newbeauty for the nation.This is more necessary than ever today because military training is no longerrequired. That was the one institution that at least partly compensated duringpeace times for what the rest of our education system failed to do, and now itis gone. The success of military training was not exclusively in the developmentof the individual, but in its influence on the relations between the sexes. Theyoung girl prefers the soldier to the civilian.The racial state must not only carry through and supervise physical educationduring the official school years, but must also take responsibility after schoolis completed. As long as a boy is still developing physically, this developmentneeds to be encouraged and it will be to his benefit. It is nonsense to thinkthat the state's right to supervise its young citizens immediately terminateswith the end of school life and suddenly resumes during military service.This is a right just as much as it is a duty. The present-day State, which takesno interest in healthy people, has criminally neglected its duty. The currentstate policy allows young people of today to experience damnation on the streetsand in brothels instead of maintaining control and continuing their physicaldevelopment until they become healthy men and healthy women.At this time, the state cares nothing about continuing this training. Whatshould be important is the goal to make these training regiments a reality andresearch the best methods for such training. The racebased state will also haveto consider the intellectual training and the physical development of postschoolyears as the state's job and maintain this training through state institutions.This education can be the preliminary training for later army service.The army should not have to teach the young recruit the simplest drillinstructions. At this point the military will no longer receive recruits assuch, but they will simply turn the already physically trained young man into asoldier.In the racebased state, the army will no longer need to teach the recruit how tostand and to walk, but its job will be that of the final and highest school oftraining for the Fatherland. The young recruit in the army will receive thenecessary training at arms, but he must also be molded further so that he isprepared for his later life. The crowning point of military training must bethat which was the greatest merit of the old army. In this school, the boy is tobe turned into a man. In this school, he must learn to obey and through thisexperience he will gain the fundamentals which will later enable him to command.He must learn to be silent when he is rebuked justly, and also learn to sufferunfairness in silence when it is necessary. Fortified by faith in his ownstrength and carried away by the intensity of Esprit de Corps (common morale orteam spirit), he must become convinced of the invincibility of his nationality.When he has finished his army service, he is to be given two documents: hisdiploma of state citizenship, a legal document which permits him to enter intopublic life, and his health certificate, proving his physical fitness formarriage.The racial state can also carry on the education of the girl using the sameprinciples as the boy's training. The main emphasis must be placed on physicallifestyle above all, secondly on the development of spiritual and mentalaspects, and lastly on intellectual beliefs. The unshakable aim of femaleeducation must primarily be on her future as a mother.The second consideration of the racial state must be to foster characterbuilding in every way. Of course the most essential qualities of character arealready present in the individual person. The man who is selfish will alwaysremain so and at the other end of the spectrum, the idealist will always be anidealist. But in between those extremes, there are millions of people who seemto have vague and indistinct characters and they can benefit from sucheducation. The born criminal will always be a criminal, but people who have alimited criminal inclination can still become valuable members of societythrough proper education. On the other hand, bad training may create truly badpeople from those who were previously only indecisive characters.There were many complaints during the war about the fact that our people couldnot keep their mouths shut! This weakness made it very difficult to keep theenemy from learning important secrets! We must ask ourselves the question, \"Whatdid the German education system do before the war to train individuals to bediscrete and keep quiet?\" Unfortunately, even in school, the little tattletalewas often favored over his more discreet comrades. Then and now, gossiping isregarded as praiseworthy \"frankness\" and silence as shameful stubbornness. Didanyone make any effort to represent discretion as a manly virtue? No, because inthe eyes of our current school administrators, these values are of littleimportance. But these \"trifles\" cost the State countless millions in judicialexpenses because ninety percent of all lawsuits for slander are caused solely bya lack of discretion.Irresponsible statements are blabbed about without considering the consequences.Our economic life is constantly harmed by those who recklessly reveal importantmanufacturing techniques. The secret preparations for national defense areturned into an illusion simply because the people have not learned to hold theirtongues, but are happy to talk about everything to anyone. In war this easyflowing chatter may lead to the loss of battles and contribute to the disastrousoutcome of the overall struggle. We must realize that if the youth are nottaught something, they will not do it when they are older. That is why theteacher must not try to find out about silly boyish pranks by encouragingunpleasant tattling. Youth forms a ministate of its own and faces the adultswith a certain solidarity, which is perfectly natural. The bonds between theten-year-old and his friends of the same age are stronger than those withadults, which is also natural for children. A boy who tells on his friends isbetraying his friend, and when this tattling suddenly occurs on a large scale,it exposes a nature that is equivalent to high treason. This kind of boy cannotbe considered as a \"good, well-behaved\" child, but as a boy who lacks thequality of character needed to care about others. It may be convenient for theteacher to increase his authority by making use of such failings, but aspiritual seed has been planted in this youthful heart that may later havedisastrous results. It frequently happens that a little tattletale has grown upinto a great villain.This is just one example. There is no deliberate effort to develop good, noblequalities of character in the schools today. In fact they practically teachagainst them. In the future, a much stronger emphasis must be placed on thiskind of character building education. Loyalty, selfsacrifice, and discretion arevirtues which a great people must possess. The teaching and repetition of thesevalues in the schools is more important than much of what students are taughttoday. Breaking the habit of complaining, tearful whining and of howling whenhurt etc., would also come under this heading and must be taught as well. If aneducational system forgets to start out by teaching the child that even pain andhard knocks must be handled in silence, it must not be surprised if at somelater crucial moment, like when the man is at the front lines of battle, theentire postal service is devoted exclusively to delivering whimpering andwailing letters filled with complaints back and forth. If there had been alittle less knowledge poured down the throats of our children in primary schooland a little more self-control, that effort would have been rewarded from 1915to 1918.In its educational work, the racebased Nationalist state must attach thegreatest importance to character-development along with physical development.Many moral disorders in our present political body can be lessened, if notaltogether eliminated, by proper moral education. The development ofstrength-of-will and determination, as well as the development of a willingnessto assume responsibility, should be of the utmost importance.The army has a principle that: A command is always better than no command. Withyoung people, this should be taught as: An answer is always better than noanswer. Not to answer for fear of saying the wrong thing should be moreembarrassing than to give an incorrect answer. Starting from this primitivebasis, youth must be trained to have the courage to act.There is a common complaint that in November and December of 1918, every singleperson in authority was revealed as a failure and that no one, from the Monarchon down to the last divisional commander, had the strength to make a responsibledecision on his own. This terrible fact is the handwriting on the wall for oureducation system. The cruel catastrophe of 1918 was the result, on an enormousscale, of what already existed on a small scale all around us. It is this lackof will which makes us incapable of resistance today and not a lack of weapons.It affects our entire people and blocks every decision involving any risk. Nogreat decision can be made which does not involve great risk; the greatness of adeed consists of its boldness.Without knowing it, a German general succeeded in finding the classic formulafor this pitiful lack of will when he said: \"I act only when I can count on afiftyone percent probability of success\". (General Otto von Lossow is who saidhe would join the 1923 Putsch only if there was a 51% chance of success) Thetragedy of the German collapse is found in this \"fiftyone per cent\". He whodemands a guarantee of success from Fate renounces the significance of a heroicdeed. Heroism exists only where one is convinced deadly danger is a condition ofaction and one still takes the step which may perhaps bring success. A victim ofcancer, whose death is a certainty otherwise, does not need to calculate afiftyone percent chance of success in order to risk an operation.Even if this operation offered only a one-half of one percent chance of success,a courageous man will not hesitate to risk surgery, and if he chooses not totake the risk, he should not whimper for his life.Our present disease of cowardly indecision and lack of will results mainly fromour incorrect education during our youth. The devastating effect of thiseducation error continues into later life finding its conclusion and itscrowning form in the lack of moral courage seen in our leading statesmen."},{"pageContent":"The same source produces the cowardice that rages today, and it can be seen whenone is faced with responsibility. The origin of this mistake can be traced backto the education our youth receives. It saturates all of public life and isimmortally perfected in the institution of parliamentary government.Unfortunately, even in school, instructors attach more importance to remorsefulconfessions and to the promises \"not to do it again\", by the little sinner thanthey do to an honest admission. To many a popular educator today, the honestadmission is considered to be a sign of habitual delinquency. As incredible asit may seem, the prophecy of the gallows has been foretold for many a young boysimply because he displayed some of the qualities that would be of great valueif they were common among all of our people.The racebased Nationalist state of the future must concentrate on training thewill and the decision making ability in our youth. Beginning with infancy, thestate must implant the idea in the hearts of our youth that one should be readyto accept responsibility and to make an honest confession. Only if the educationsystem recognizes this need and how much the impact will benefit the nation, andthen only as the result of centuries of education, a national body will existthat is no longer subject to those weaknesses that disastrously contributed toour present collapse.The State's educational job of academic school training can be taken over by thenew racebased state which only needs to make slight modifications. These changesare in three fields.In the first place, children's brains should not be burdened with things theywill not need or with things that they will forget. Almost ninety-five percentof what they are taught is forgotten. The classes taught in primary and grammarschools are an unusual mixture. In many of the individual subjects, the volumeof material to be learned has increased so greatly that only a fraction can beremembered and only a fraction of that can be used. On the other hand, what islearned is not enough to train a man to make a living in a certain trade. Take,for instance, the ordinary civil servant who has graduated from secondary schoolor from the upper secondary school. When he is thirty-five or forty, he istested to determine how much school learning remains, knowledge that he once sopainfully acquired. Then we see how little of all the stuff that was drummedinto his head can be remembered! One answer offered is: \"Maybe, but the purposeof learning so much was not simply to instill tons of information for later use,but to train his memory and his thinking power and the brain's ability toreason\". This is true in part. But still there is a danger that the youthfulbrain may be drowned in a flood of impressions that it rarely has the ability tomaster, and the child cannot filter or judge what is of greater or lesserimportance among the individual elements in that flood. On top of that, theessential parts of knowledge are the ones which are forgotten and lost, theunnecessary parts of knowledge are retained. Therefore the main purpose oflearning so much is lost. The brain cannot be made to learn by dumpingunmeasured piles of educational instruction on it, but it can learn by supplyingit with knowledge which the individual needs for later life. Through him, then,society benefits.The justification for the current method is misleading because when such anexcessive mass of material is thrown on a person in his youth, in his later lifehe retains none or only nonessential parts. I see no reason why millions ofstudents over the course of years should be forced to learn two or three foreignlanguages that they can only rarely use, languages they mostly forget. Out ofone hundred thousand pupils who learn French, for instance, scarcely twothousand will have the chance to use any of this knowledge later. The otherninetyeight thousand never use it in their entire lives. Children spendthousands of hours learning something which has no value or meaning to themlater. Even the objection that this is part of a general education of the mindis false. This claim would only be valid if students retained what they learnedthroughout their lives. So it is really for the benefit of the two thousandpeople who will use this knowledge of the language that ninetyeight thousand areweighted down with useless information and sacrifice valuable education time.Also the \"language\" I have used as an example, French, is not one that givestraining in \"logical thinking\" like Latin does. It would therefore be much moreappropriate for students to learn only the general outlines of a language.Provide the student a simple sketch of the essentials that would give him someknowledge of the characteristics of the language and perhaps introduce him tothe origins of grammar and illustrate pronunciation and sentence structure byexamples. This would be enough for average students and it would be easier tounderstand and retain. Ultimately it would be more valuable than the usualmethod of cramming the entire language into a student's mind, especially whenthe language is never really mastered and is later forgotten.We would no longer risk that only a few disconnected fragments of theoverwhelming quantity of materials would by chance stick in their memory. Thisway, the young person would be given only the most noteworthy parts to learn andonly the important aspects of the language would be taught.The basics of a language would be enough to last most people the rest of theirlives. Anyone who really needed the language later would have a basicunderstanding to build on and, by his own choice, he could practice and learn itthoroughly. This would make the necessary time available to schedule physicaleducation and for the increased requirements in the fields already mentioned.The methods currently used to teach history need to be changed. Very few peoplehave such a strong need to learn from history as the Germans do, but there isscarcely any other nation that makes a poorer use of historical knowledge thanGermany. If politics is history in the making, then our historical education isalready impaired by the nature of our political leadership. There is no point incomplaining about our political performance if we are not determined to improvethe political education our people receive. In ninety-nine out of a hundredcases, the result of our current history education is disgraceful. A few scrapsconsisting of a handful of dates and names are usually all the student canremember, while any clear line of historical development is completely missing.The essential elements from history, the ones that really count, are not taughtat all. It is left up to the brilliance of the individual student to figure outinner motives behind actions and the causes of events by sifting through theflood of facts and looking at the sequence of events.One may resist the idea that this unpleasant state of affairs exists among ourpoliticians, but we only have to carefully read the speeches that are deliveredby our parliamentarians on political problems during a single session on anytopic, such as foreign policy, to see the truth for ourselves.Remember that foreign policy is, or at least is claimed to be, the flower of theGerman nation. A great section of these politicians wore out the benches of oursecondary schools; some even attended institutions of higher learning. Yet theirspeeches demonstrate that the historical education these people received wastotally inadequate. If they had never studied history at all but simply had alittle common sense, the country would have followed a better course and theywould have been more useful to the nation.We must reduce the amount of material students are required to learn, especiallyin history classes. The main reason anyone learns history is to grasp the bigpicture and understand historical development and how it affects current events.The more we focus what is taught, the more hope there is that the individual'sknowledge will later create a return that will benefit the entire community. Wedo not learn history in order to know what has happened in the past, but welearn history so that it may be our guide for the future. We use that knowledgefor the preservation of our own nationality. This is the real purpose behindlearning history, and educational instruction is only a means toward that end.Even here the means has become the end in itself and the true end no longerexists. Don't let anyone tell you that a thorough study of history requiresconsideration of all these individual bits of information and only their sumtotal make it possible to determine the broad outlines. To determine these broadconnections is the task for a specialized researcher. The ordinary average manis no professor of history. For the common man, a history education exists togive him a measurement for the current political landscape and a historicalreference that he needs in order to make up his mind about the political eventsin his own nation. Anyone who wishes to become a history professor may give thesubject profound study later on his own. Naturally when he chooses this course,he will have to concern himself with every detail, even the smallest. For thateven our present day historical instruction is not enough. Our current system istoo broad in scope for the average man and far too limited in scope for thescholar.It is also the task of a People's State to assure that a world history will bewritten in which the race problem is elevated to a dominant position.Summing up: The people's racebased state will have to put general education intoa form that focuses on the essentials. Outside of that, we must offeropportunities for more detailed, specialized, scholarly training to those whodesire this detailed education. The individual person only requires a store ofgeneral knowledge in a broad outline, and he will receive a thorough detailedand specialized training only in the field that will be his occupation in laterlife. General training should be required in all fields, while specializationshould be left to the choice of the individual.This will allow current school schedules to be shortened by reducing the numberof classes that would then make additional time for the development of the body,the character, the will, determination, judgment, etc. Our present day schoolinstruction, especially in secondary schools, gives no importance to thetraining of people for their jobs later in life. This is easily seen in the factthat people may attend three completely different sorts of schools but still endup in the same career. What counts is general cultivation and not thespecialized knowledge that has been poured into students. When specificknowledge is needed by a student, it cannot be obtained within the curriculum ofour present-day secondary schools. It is the job of the People's racebased Stateto someday eliminate this sort of halfway measure.The second change for the People's racebased State in the scholastic programmust be the following: It is the nature of our materialistic age that educationis focused more and more toward the subjects of pure science, such as appliedmathematics, physics, chemistry, etc. Though these are necessary for an age inwhich technology and chemistry are kings and they are the most visiblecharacteristics of daily life, it is, however, dangerous for the generaleducation of a nation to be aimed exclusively at pure sciences. On the contrary,education must always focus on teaching ideals. Our system should be adapted tofocus on studies of the literature, art, and civilization of Greece and Rome,offering only the basics needed to prepare people who will later followvocational training. If education is not changed in this way, we will besacrificing an inner strength that is more important for the preservation of thenation than any technical skill. Specifically, the study of ancient times mustnot be left out of historical teaching. Roman history is the best teacher whenit is properly understood in a broad sense, not only for today, but probably forall time. The marvelous beauty of the ideal Hellenistic (Ancient Greek) culture,must also be preserved. The differences between individuals must not be allowedto break down the greater racial community that they share. The struggle ragingtoday has a great goal: a culture is fighting for its existence; a culture thatcovers thousands of years of history and encompasses the Germans and Greeks.We must create a sharp distinction between general educational and thespecialized knowledge of higher level studies. Higher level knowledge threatensto sink more and more into the service of Mammon (the false god of greed) andmaterial wealth. General education must be a counter-weight of ideals againstspecialized knowledge education. One principle must be constantly pounded home:that industry and technology and trade and commerce can grow only as long as anational community, founded on ideals, provides the necessary conditions forthem to flourish. These ideals are based on selfsacrifice and denial and not onmaterialistic selfishness.The present education system's main objective is to pump into young people theknowledge they will need for advancement in later life. It is expressed thisway: \"The young man must one day become a useful member of society\". By this,they mean his ability to earn a living in an honorable way. The superficialtraining as a good citizen they receive, which is mostly accidental and on theside, is feeble from the beginning. Since a state is just a form, it is veryhard to train people to see this form as an ideal to be served, let alone makethem feel any commitment toward it. A form is too easily broken. But, as we haveseen, the idea of a State has no clear meaning today anyway. There is nothingleft but the generic \"patriotic\" education. The old Germany placed a strongemphasis on the glorification of insignificant leaders, even small localleaders. This emphasis was often not very clever and usually appeared verystupid. There were so many of these minor figures that it became impossible forour people to know who were the truly great men and who were nothing. As aresult, our broad masses had a very deficient knowledge of German history. Heretoo the sweeping line of historical development and meaning of history wasmissing.It is obvious that this limited historical education provides no opportunity toever generate any true nationalist enthusiasm. Our educational administratorslacked the skill to pick out a few names from the historical blob of our peopleand make those great figures part of the entire German people. This would haveheld together the entire nation by giving them a firm, uniform bond of knowledgeand enthusiasm that would have become a shared rallying point. Educators werenot able to make the really important men of our people seem like toweringheroes in the eyes of the present day.They were not able to point everyone's attention towards them and produce aunited state of mind. They were unable to pick from the various school subjectswhat was glorious for the nation and what would help education rise above thelevel of a matter-of-fact description and to kindle the national pride with suchshining examples. To them, elevating important individuals would have seemedlike an unfair exercise of judgment of the worst sort when placing oneindividual above another. This would not have been well received because todayeveryone believes both sides of any argument should be given equal status, andone side can never be favored above another. Paying attention to the patriotismfelt for a succession of royal dynasty rulers seemed more pleasant and easier tobear than the blazing passion of strong national pride. Patriotism for minormonarchs could always be used by the current administration when it was needed;however, strong national patriotism might some day take control itself. Monarchpatriotism ended in veterans' associations where they would hear none of it.Nationalists' passions followed a course that would have been hard to predictand this frightened monarchs away from it. Nationalism is like a temperamentalthoroughbred horse which will not allow just anyone in the saddle. It's nowonder rulers preferred to keep away from such a menace. No one seemed to thinkit was possible that some day a war might come whose artillery fire and gasattacks would put this kind of patriotism to a radical test of endurance. Butwhen a war did come, the lack of supreme nationalist passion was avenged in aterrible way. People had little inclination to die for their imperial and royalsovereigns and most of them did not even recognize the \"nation\" as a nation.Now that the Revolution has swept over Germany and monarch patriotism wasautomatically extinguished, the purpose of teaching history has become nothingmore than to pass along factual knowledge. The current state has no use for\"nationalist\" enthusiasm and what patriotism it does want, it will never have.There could be no patriotism backed by the ultimate strength of a nation'speople in this age of a dynasty that is influenced by international interestsfirst. There is even less possibility of building enthusiasm and patriotism fora parliamentary government. There isn't much doubt that the German people wouldnever stay on the battlefield four and a half years under the motto, \"For theParliament\". Those who created this miracle structure of government would be theleast likely to stay.As a matter of fact, this Parliamentary Republic owes its disorderly survival toits willingness to voluntarily pay any reparations and to sign any territorialwaiver placed in front of it. The Parliamentary Republic is pleasing to the restof the world in the same way a weakling seems more agreeable than a strong,solid man to those who meet him. The fact that the enemy is fond of thisparticular form of government is also the most devastating criticism of it. Theylike the German Parliamentary Republic and let it live because they could neverpossibly find a better ally for the job of enslaving our people.The \"splendid\" parliamentary institution owes its present survival to this factand this fact alone. That is why it can abandon any nationalist education andwhy it is satisfied with the current Reich flag heroes. Of course those \"heroes\"would run like little rabbits if they had to protect this flag with their blood.The new Nationalist state will have to fight for its existence. It will not gainits existence by signing a Dawes Plan (an unsuccessful attempt by the allies tocollect war reparations from Germany by the Dawes Committee), and it will not beable to defend its survival by signing papers. For its existence and itsprotection, it will need the very thing that the current administration believesthey can abandon. The more precious and worthy the form and substance of the newNationalist state are, the greater the envy and resistance from the enemy willbe. The best protection will not be in its weapons, but in its citizens.Fortress walls will not defend the State; it can only be saved by a living wallof men and women who are filled with supreme love of Fatherland and fanaticalnationalist enthusiasm.The third point to consider in the education system is that the new Nationaliststate must find a way to advance national pride in the sciences as well. World history and the entire history of civilization must be taught from thisstandpoint.An inventor must not be presented as great just because he is an inventor, buthe must be shown to be greater still because he is an inventor who is a memberof our people. Admiration for any great deed must be transformed into pride forthe lucky achiever as a member of one's own race. From the myriad of great namesin German history, the greatest must be selected and so impressively presentedto the youth that they become towers of strength and create an unshakablefeeling of national pride.The school curriculum must be systematically built up from that standpoint.Organized education must be shaped so that the young person leaves school as acomplete German and not as a half-pacifist, democrat, or something else. Forthis national feeling to be genuine from the very beginning and not just anempty pretense, one inflexible principle must be hammered into the stillmalleable minds of youth: He who loves his people proves it only by hiswillingness to sacrifice for them. There is no such thing as a national-feelingthat aims only to benefit personal interests. There is no such thing as anationalism which includes only certain social classes. Cheering and shoutingprove nothing. Yelling the loudest doesn't give a person the right to callhimself a nationalist unless a great, loving care for the preservation of acommon, healthy nationality stands behind those hoots and hollers. One cannottruly be proud of one's people if they are ashamed of any social class withinthose people. If one half of a people are miserable, oppressed, and destitute,how can anyone be proud of such a state. Only when a nationality is solidphysically and morally can the joy in belonging to such a people rightfully risein everyone's heart to that height of feeling which we call national pride. Butonly the man who knows the greatness of his nationality will feel this highestpride.A personal spirit of nationalism and a sense of social justice must be combinedin the hearts of the youth. If that is done properly, someday a nation ofcitizens will arise that will be committed to one another and forged together bya common love and a common pride, unshakable and indestructible forever.The fear of showing unfair preference for a side has become our age's symptom ofits own weakness. Everyone wants to give equality to both sides without making adecision, without commitment. Fate will never choose our era for any great deedbecause we lack any overflowing energy. To the contrary, any display of suchexuberance is considered totally inappropriate. The greatest changes in thisworld would not have been imaginable if their driving force had been limited tothe privilegedclass virtues of peace and good order. Great change isaccomplished only when driven by fanatical and hysterical passions. There is nodoubt that this world is moving toward a great disturbance and revolution iscoming. The only question is whether this change will benefit the Aryan or if itwill be for the profit of the wandering Jew.By appropriate education of our youth, the racebased Nationalist state will haveto form a generation that is prepared to face the decisions that will be thelast and greatest and will decide the destiny of the globe. The people whotravel this road first will be the victors.The fulfillment of the racial state's educational work includes burning anappreciation of race into the hearts and minds of the youth entrusted topreserve it. Youth must be imprinted both through instinct and understandingwith the importance of their race. No boy and no girl should leave schoolwithout possessing an ultimate understanding of the importance in maintainingthe purity of their blood. This will create the basis which will preserve ournationality's racial foundations and assure the conditions for further culturaldevelopment are kept intact. All the physical and intellectual training in theworld would be for nothing if that training were given to a being who was notready and determined to preserve the characteristic qualities of its race.If we fail to instill this racial appreciation, we would have a widespreadproblem, a problem that we Germans already regret, yet perhaps without fullyunderstanding the extent our tragedy has reached today. In the future we wouldbecome cultural manure to fertilize other civilizations. In the common mind ofour present privilegedclass, they see only a lost citizen when they look at alost individual member of our people. They fail to see a lost member of our racewho can never be recovered. There is a painful realization that, despite all ourknowledge and ability, our blood line is still headed for oblivion. Bycontinually mixing with other races, we lift them from their lower culturallevel to a higher one, but we ourselves fall forever from our own race's greatheights.This racial education will be completed in military service. The military is thefinal state of the regular education for the average German.Just as important as the physical and mental training in the new racebased statewill be, so too is the importance of classifying people and their abilities sothe right people may be selected for positions in the State. Today we take thisselection for granted. In general the children of upper-class parents or thosewho have become wealthy are the ones considered worthy of higher education. Heretalent is a secondary consideration. A peasant boy may have far greater gifts oftalent than the child of parents who can trace their lineage through generationsof upper class families. The peasant child may not have the knowledge of thecity child, but the city child's greater knowledge has nothing to do with thequality of his talents. This knowledge comes from the abundance of feelings,experiences and images that the wealthy child is exposed to as a result of hismore wellrounded education and his abundant surroundings. If the talentedpeasant boy had grown up from infancy in similar surroundings, his capacity forintellectual achievement would be altogether different.Today there is one single field in which a man's origin matters less than hisnatural gifts and it is the field of art. In art one cannot simply \"learn\", butrather must have talent born in him. His parents' money and property meannothing. This natural ability is only later subject to how wisely the existinggift is developed. This is the best proof that genius is not confined to theupper classes or to the wealthy. The greatest artist frequently comes from thepoorest home. Many a village has seen their small boy later become a celebratedmaster.It does not speak well for the wisdom of our age that we do not take advantageof this truth for our collective intellectual life. People foolishly believethat what applies to art is not true of the sciences. There is no doubt that aman can be trained in certain mechanical skills, just as an expert can teach apoodle the most astonishing tricks. But in animal training, it is not theanimal's own intelligence alone that creates such tricks. The same is true ofman.Even a man who has no talent can be taught certain scientific tricks, but theprocess is just as lifeless and as uninspired as teaching a dog to jump througha hoop. It is even possible by using a certain intellectual hammer to poundabove average knowledge into an average person, but it still remains lifelessand unproductive knowledge. The result of such knowledge cramming is a man whomay be a walking encyclopedia, but who still fails miserably in every situationand at every crucial moment in life when he needs to apply that knowledge. Hehas to be given special, intensive new training for every task, no matter howsimple, and is unable to make the slightest contribution on his own to thedevelopment of mankind. Knowledge that is drilled into a man by this sort ofmechanical method is only adequate for filling a present day state civil servicejob.It is obvious that among the nation's population, there will be people withtalents in every possible field. It is also obvious that the value of knowledgeis greater when even the simplest information is brought to life by theappropriate talent of the individual. Creative leaps in achievement can occuronly when talent and knowledge are joined.The sins of modern mankind against this rule are never ending and can be seen inanother example. The illustrated newspapers occasionally show theprivilegedclass how a negro for the first time has become a lawyer, a teacher,perhaps even a minister, or a heroic opera tenor somewhere or other.The feeble-minded privilegedclass looks at such a miracle of animal trainingwith admiration and astonishment before overflowing with respect for thismarvelous result of modern education. At the same time the Jew is very shrewdabout using this as new proof of the theory that \"all men are equal\", which heis forcing down the peoples' throats, is valid. It never dawns on the wearymiddleclass world that such a news article is actually a sin against all reason.It is criminal insanity to train a born half-ape until one believes he has beenturned into a lawyer, while millions of members of the highest of civilizedraces must remain in a position totally unworthy of them. It is a sin againstthe will of the Eternal Creator to let hundreds and thousands of His most giftedcreatures decay in the modern worker-laborer swamp while Hottentots and Zulusare being tamed for intellectual professions. As with the poodle, it is justanimal training and not \"scholastic\" education. The same care and pains spent onintelligent races would prepare every individual for similar achievements andeach would be a thousand times more adept.This state of affairs would be intolerable if these reports were about anythingother than the rare exceptions. It is already impossible to tolerate todaybecause talent and aptitude are not what are used to qualify for highereducation. The thought is positively insufferable that hundreds of thousands ofabsolutely untalented persons are thought worthy of higher education every year,while other hundreds of thousands who are highly gifted go without any advancededucation at all. The loss the nation suffers because of this discrepancy isimmeasurable. The wealth of important inventions created during the last fewdecades has shown an extraordinary increase, particularly in North America,because many more talented people from the lower classes have a chance at highereducation there than they have in Europe.Knowledge merely ladled out is not enough to spark discoveries. This spark mustbe brought alive by talent combined with knowledge. But we attach no importanceto this gift of talent. Today good grades are all that count.The new people's state will have to intervene in education here as well. Howeverit is not the state's job to preserve the educational dominance of an existingclass in society. The state's job is to find the most capable minds among theentire nation and to drape them with honor and dignity. It is not just thestate's obligation to give the average child a basic education, but its duty isto place talent on the road where it belongs. Above all, its highest concernmust be to open the doors of the schools of higher learning to every talentedperson, no matter what social class he comes from. We must do this because it isthe only way we can grow inspired leadership for the nation from a class that iscurrently only filled with unproductive knowledge.There is another reason why the state must look ahead to our future and helpaspiring talent. Especially in Germany our intellectual classes are so isolatedand fossilized that they have no living connection with those in the socialclasses beneath them. This has evil results in two ways. In the first place, theintellectuals have no understanding of and no sympathy for the broad masses.Their connection to the people has been broken too long, they no longer have thenecessary psychological understanding needed to relate to them. They have becomestrangers to their own people. Secondly, these upper class intellectuals do nothave the necessary strength of will. Strength of will is always weaker inintellectual social classes than in the primitive mass of the people. God knows,we Germans have never lacked academic scientific education, but strong will anddecisiveness have totally eluded us.The more \"intellectual\" our statesmen have become, the more deficient theiraccomplishments have been.The political preparations and military equipment for the First World War wereinadequate. This was not because those who governed our people wereinsufficiently educated, but because they were over-educated, stuffed withknowledge and intelligence, but they had no sound instinct and lacked energy andboldness. It was a catastrophe that our people had to defend themselves in thisbattle under a weakling philosopher Chancellor. If instead of aBethmann-Hollweg(Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, Chancellor of the German Empireuntil 1917 who was viewed as a moderate) we had a more forceful man of thepeople as a leader, the heroic blood of the infantry soldier would not have beenshed in vain. In the same way, the excessive intellectual refinement of ourleadership was the best ally for the revolutionary November criminals. Byshamefully holding back the national budget, which the public entrusted to them,instead of risking it in its entirety to build defenses, these intellectualsthemselves made the success of the Allies and the Revolution possible.The Catholic Church is a splendid counter example. The fact that its priests areunmarried forces it to draw the new generation of the clergy from the greatmasses of the people instead of from its own ranks. This significant effect ofcelibacy is not usually recognized. It is the reason for the incredibly vigorousstrength in this ancient institution. Because the giant army of priests isconstantly recruited from the lowest classes of the peoples, the Church not onlyremains instinctively close to the emotional world of the people, but assuresitself of the energy that is always available from the broad masses of thepeople. This accounts for the amazing youthfulness, intellectual adaptability,and iron strength of will in this giant beast.The new racebased state will make sure the educational system provides aconstant supply of new blood from the lower social classes to the existingintellectual classes. It is the state's duty to carefully and thoroughly siftthrough the population and discover those of obvious innate talent and put themto work for society. State offices do not exist to provide posts for specialsocial classes, but to accomplish the tasks they are given. That will only bepossible if capable and strong-willed personalities are trained for service inthese offices. This selection process is true for the intellectual leadership ofthe nation in every field and for all those who take part in intellectual andmoral leadership, not just civil service. The greatness of a people is revealedby how well they succeed in training the most able minds for the fields thatthey are best suited to and how they are put to work for the national community.If two nations of basically equal resources are competing, the one whose besttalents are represented throughout its intellectual leadership will bevictorious and the one whose leadership is just one big common feedingtrough forcertain groups or social classes, which does not consider the natural ability ofindividual members, will be defeated.In our present-day world, this seems impossible. There will be immediateobjections from some, if for example, the son of a high state governmentofficial is expected to become a craftsman simply because another son ofcraftsman, seems more capable as a civil servant than the official's son. Thatmay be true given the present social status of manual labor. For that reason,the new racebased state will have to encourage a new attitude toward the idea oflabor. Through centuries of education, it will have to break the bad habit ofsneering at physical labor as a lowly occupation. The state will have to judgethe individual man on how he contributes, not by the nature of his work, but bythe form and excellence of his performance. This may seem shocking to an age inwhich the dullest bum newspaper writer is thought of more highly than the mostintelligent precision mechanic, simply because the writer works with the pen.This incorrect evaluation is not part of our nature, but it has beenartificially taught. This attitude has not always existed. The present unnaturalstate of affairs results from the general diseased condition of ourmaterialistic age.Every kind of work has two types of value: a purely material value and an idealvalue. The material value lies in the practical importance of a job for the lifeof the community. The more the members of the nation benefit from someone'swork, the higher the material value of that job. Consequently, this job's valueis shown by how much someone is paid for his work. In contrast to this purelymaterial value, is the ideal one. The ideal value does not depend on theimportance by material standards, but on the degree of its fundamentalnecessity, how important is the work to the country as a whole. Certainly, thematerial advantage of an invention to the country may be greater than that of anordinary mason's assistant job, but society depends as much on the small serviceas it does on the great one. Society makes a concrete evaluation of a job'svalue to the community by varying the rate of pay, but society must establishthat every worker is equal whenever each individual does his best in his ownfield, whatever that may be. The evaluation of a man depends on his contributionto the community and not on his wages.In a reasonable state where individuals are directed in their vocations, eachmust be assigned to the activity that suits his ability. In other words, ableminds must be trained for the work they can do best. Ability, however, is nottaught but born. It is a gift from Nature and not a developed skill that can beattributed to man. Consequently, one's social position should not force a job onthe individual. His job should be determined by the abilities he was born withand by the education the community has provided to him. A man's value must bebased on the way he handles the job he has been made responsible for by society.The vocation that an individual follows is not the purpose of his existence butonly the means to his livelihood. He should continue cultivating and refininghimself to reach a higher level as a human being, but he can only do this withinhis cultural community, which must always rest on the foundation of a state. Hemust make his contribution to preserving this foundation. Nature has alreadydecided the form of his contribution. All he must do is return to the nationalcommunity, zealously and honestly, what it has given him. The man who does thisearns the greatest esteem and the highest respect. A material reward may begiven for achievements that are beneficial to society. However, the individualreward comes from the appreciation he receives; an appreciation that everyonewho devotes what Nature has given him and returns what national community hastrained him for back to the service of his nationality is entitled to. Thatmeans it is no longer shameful to be a good craftsman, but it is shameful towaste God's days and the nation's bread and butter as an incompetent stateofficial. It will then be taken for granted that a man will not be assigned to aduty if he does not have the gifts for it from the start.Personal effectiveness in one's job is the sole standard that will determine hisright to general participation and his right to participate in legal or civilaffairs on an equal level.The present age is cutting its own throat. It introduces universal voting andchatters about equal rights but cannot find any foundation for this equality. Itsets a man's value based on how much he earns, which destroys the basis for themost noble equality that can possibly exist. Equality does not and cannot dependon individual achievement; instead equality exists only in the way everyonefulfills his obligations to the community. That is the only way natural chancecan be eliminated in judging the value of a man and the individual be made thearchitect of his own importance.In the present age, when entire groups of people judge one another by theirincome, they are incapable of understanding this idea. But this is no reason forus to abandon the idea. On the contrary, the person who wants to heal thisinwardly sick and rotten age must first gather the courage to expose the causesof the disease. The NationalSocialist Movement must take this as its duty and gobeyond any narrow-minded elitism to gather and sort out those people who are thewilling forces in our own nationality, ones who are willing to champion a newWorldConcept .There is no doubt that objections will be made saying it is difficult toseparate the opinion one has, from the amount of pay, and therefore the loweresteem associated with physical labor comes from the lower rate of pay. Thislower rate of pay means a man is less able to participate in the cultural wealthof his nation. This inability to improve his cultural knowledge damages theman's personal culture and has nothing to do with his work in itself. The mostunderstandable reason that someone would find physical labor objectionable isbecause the lower pay necessarily means the cultural level of the manual laborermust be lower and that, in turn, justifies the lower value people hold formanual labor.This idea is commonly believed to be true. Because of this, it will be necessaryin the future to avoid excessive differentiation in wage scales. Let no one saythat this would cause accomplishment to end as pay scales were equalized. Itwould be the saddest sign of an age's decay if higher intellectual achievementwas only driven by the desire to receive higher pay. If this point of view hadbeen the prevalent one in the world previously, mankind would be without itsgreatest scientific and cultural possessions. The greatest inventions, thegreatest discoveries, the most revolutionary scientific work, and the mostsplendid monuments of human civilization were not given to the world out of acompulsion for money. On the contrary, their creation frequently represented arejection of the earthly pleasures of wealth.It may be true that money has become the exclusive ruler of life today, but thetime will come when man will kneel to higher gods again. Many things around ustoday may owe their existence to the desire for money and property, but there isalso very little of it that mankind would truly be any poorer without.Another task of our movement is to work for the day when the individual willreceive what he needs to live on, but at the same time will uphold the principlethat man does not live exclusively for material pleasures. This will beillustrated in a wisely constructed universal pay scale that will allow everyhonest working man a respectable and decent existence as a human being and as amember of the nation.Don't let it be said that this perfect condition is an ideal that this worldcould never withstand in practice and would never actually achieve. We are notso simple as to believe that a perfect age can ever happen. But this does notrelieve anyone of the obligation to fight against the faults we see, to overcomeweaknesses in the system, and to strive for the ideal. Harsh reality will alwayslimit what we seek to accomplish. For that very reason, man must do the best hecan and aspire to reach the ultimate goal. Failures must not distract him fromhis purpose, for he cannot abandon a judicial system simply because errors slipthrough, and he would not condemn all medical science just because there isstill sickness in spite of our best efforts.We must never fail to uphold the strength of an ideal. If anyone isfaint-hearted at the thought of upholding ideals, I would like to remind him,especially if he has been a soldier, of a time when heroism was the mostoverpowering testimony to the strength of idealistic motives. Men did not dieover concern for their daily bread, but for love of the Fatherland, belief inits greatness, and national patriotism. When the German people abandoned theseideals to follow the practical promises of the Revolution and exchanged therifle for a knapsack, our people found themselves, not in an earthly Heaven, butrather in a purgatory of unending contempt and distress. This is why it isnecessary to establish a faith in an idealistic Reich to battle against thereckoning imposed by the present materialistic Republic.3. STATE MEMBER VS. STATE CITIZENThe structure that is today erroneously called the State, identifies only twokinds of men: citizens and aliens. Citizens are those who possess the right ofcitizenship either by birth or by later naturalization. Foreigners are those whoenjoy the same right in another country. In some places there are alsocomet-like beings that are considered stateless, who simply wander the universe.These are persons who have the \"honor\" not to belong to any of the present-daystates and possess no right of citizenship anywhere.Today, the right of citizenship is acquired primarily by birth within theboundaries of a country. Race or membership in the nation plays no part at all.A negro who used to live in the German protected territories and now has aresidence in Germany brings a \"German citizen\" into the world if he has a child.In the same way any Jewish, Polish, African, or Asian child can be declared aGerman citizen.That is one kind of naturalization, by birth within an extended territory andthere is another possibility for later naturalization, by paperwork. There arevarious qualifications required to become naturalized like this. For instance,the prospective candidate will preferably not be a burglar or a pimp; he will bepolitically safe, which is to say he is a harmless political fool; and finally,that he will not become a burden on his new national home. In the present\"materialistic\" age, this means he will not be a financial burden. In fact, ifone is believed to be a potentially good taxpayer, his state citizenship can berushed. Racial considerations play no part whatsoever.The whole process of acquiring citizenship is pretty much like joining anautomobile club. A person sends in his application, it is checked and approved,and one fine day, he is informed on a slip of paper that he has become acitizen. The information is even put in a humorous and joking manner.The applicant who was previously a Zulu or Kaffir is notified: \"By thesepresented, you are now become a German Citizen\".[sic] This magic trick isaccomplished by the signature of a State official. What Heaven could notattempt, one of these Theophrastus Paracelsus officials can do with a scribbleof his hand (Theophrastus Paracelsus was a Swiss alchemist, astrologer,physician in the 1500's who traveled in Germany and was connected toLutheranism; he is meant to be a magician in this reference, even thoughTheophrastus disliked that label.) One scratch of the pen and a MongolianWenceslaus is suddenly turned into a real \"German\". (Mongolian Wenceslausappears to refer to a Czech Saint Wenceslaus but here means a Mongolian Saint,not of the Germanic race.) No attention is paid to the race of one of these new\"citizens\". His physical health is not even considered, though he may becrawling with syphilis.Nevertheless, to the modern state he is welcome as a citizen, as long as he isnot a financial burden or a political menace.Every year, these structures we call states, absorb poisons which they canbarely survive.The citizen is different from the alien because all public offices are open tothe citizen; he may be required to serve in the military; and he is allowed totake part in elections. Those are his main benefits. The foreigner enjoysprotection of personal rights and personal liberty the same as a citizen andsometimes, even more. At least this is how it plays out in our present GermanRepublic.I know that people will not enjoy hearing all this, but there is nothing moreempty-headed and insane than our present naturalization law. Currently there isone state that is making at least a feeble effort to create a better system. Ofcourse, it is not our model German Republic where this good sense has takenhold, but the United States of America. By excluding all immigrants who areunhealthy and outright refusing entry to certain races, the Americans areshowing at least faint signs of a common attitude in the racebased Nationaliststate idea.The racebased Nationalist state divides its population into three classes: StateCitizens, Subjects of the State, and Foreigners.One becomes a State Subject by simply being born in the State. State Subjectstatus does not entitle its possessor to hold public office or to be politicallyactive, such as participating in elections, either actively or passively, norrunning for office or voting. The race and original nationality of every StateSubject must be proven. The State Subject is free at any time to relinquish hisSubject status and become a citizen of whichever country is his own.The foreigner is distinguished from the State Subject by the fact that theforeigner already holds citizenship in a foreign state. The children who are State Subjects of German nationality are required to gothrough the school system, which is established for every German.Through the school system, he undergoes the training to make him into a raceconscious and nationally aware member of the people. Then when he leaves school,he has to go through the additional physical training prescribed by the state,and finally he enters the army. The army training is of a general nature. Itwill include every single German, and provide training that will make him usefulto the military based on his physical and intellectual abilities. On completionof his military duty, state citizenship is solemnly granted on the healthy youngman of faultless character. This is the most valuable document of his entireearthly life. He then becomes a full state citizen and is able to enjoy allthose rights and privileges. The state must make a sharp distinction between twogroups of the people, the ones who support and maintain the existence andgreatness of the state, and the ones who simply live here as \"gainfullyemployed\" elements within a state.When a person receives his certification of state citizenship, he must take asolemn oath to the national community and State. This oath must be a common bondthat brings together all social classes. It must become a greater honor to be astreet-cleaner and a citizen of the Reich than to be a King in a foreign statewho is not a citizen of the Reich. The state citizen is a privileged gentlemanwho enjoys advantages not available to the alien. The citizen is the master ofthe Reich. But this higher dignity comes with its obligations. The man withouthonor or character, the common criminal, or the traitor to the Fatherland, mayhave this honor taken away at which time they become a mere State Subject again.The German girl is a State Subject and only becomes a citizen when she marries.Citizenship may, however, be granted to female German State Subjects if theyhave independent careers.4. PERSONALITY AND THE IDEA OF THE PEOPLE'S STATEIf the racebased NationalSocialist State achieves its main interest, thedevelopment and preservation of the human strength of the state, then it willnot be enough to simply promote the racial aspects of society and then toeducate society, and finally prepare individuals for practical life. It willhave to also make adjustments in its own organization so that it reflects thesame values it promotes.It would be insane to judge man's value by his race and then turn around anddeclare war on the Marxist claim that, \"all men are created equal\", if one werenot determined to follow through to the logical conclusion. Once we recognizehow important the purity of blood is and the importance of race in ability, thenthe logical conclusion is that these tests must be applied to the individualperson. Just as I must assess nations differently based on the races that fillthem, I must assess the individual person within that national community race.The fact that a nation is not simply a nation carries over to the individualwithin a national community. The value of a nation varies based on those racesin it, and the value of a man varies based on the racial elements within him.It's the same thing when we say a mind is not simply a mind, the same as anyother! Even when the elements of blood are the same within a race, theirqualities are subject to a thousand subtle variations.The first thing we see from this understanding is what I would call the morecrude realization. It is that we must promote the qualities found to be raciallyvaluable within the national community and to encourage them to multiply.This task may be considered crude because it can be recognized and accomplishedalmost \"mechanically\". However, it is more difficult to recognize the mostvaluable minds that have the intellectual and idealistic qualities needed by thecommunity and to grant them the influence which is not merely given out due asuperior brain, but most importantly, granted based on their ability to beuseful to the nation.This separation according to ability and capacity cannot be accomplished byunemotional, unthinking mechanical means. It will be part of the constantstruggle that is decided through the daily labors of life.A WorldConcept that rejects the idea of blind rule by democratic masses andgives the world to the best people, to the highest quality human beings, mustobey the same noble principle it follows within its people and make absolutelycertain that the best minds become the leadership and those great minds are thepredominant influence over the people. This WorldConcept does not build on theidea of majority, but rather on that of character.Anyone who today assumes that a racebased NationalSocialist state is onlydifferentiated from other states by emotionless qualities, such as betterconstruction of its economic system, does not have the faintest idea what aWorldConcept really is. If they think it is created through a better balance ofwealth and poverty, or a greater voice in the economic process for the broadmasses, or by more equal pay through the elimination of excessive wagedifferences, they have been blinded by the superficial aspects. Everything Ihave just described offers no security and does not guarantee our permanentsurvival. It offers even less of a claim to greatness. A people who becomebogged down in these outward reforms would not have the slightest chance ofvictory in the struggle for the nation's existence. Any movement that believesbalancing the social classes and promoting equal economics, though noble, arethe sole core of its mission, will not produce any great results or any truereform of existing conditions. All of its activity eventually becomes wrapped inshowiness and totally preoccupied with appearances, without giving the peoplethe inner preparation that they need to finally overcome this I say withcertainty, those weaknesses we suffer from today.To understand this more easily, it is useful for us to look back at the realorigins of human cultural development.The first step man took that visibly removed him from the animals was hisability to invent. The very first invention was the discovery of tricks andstrategies that were used to make the fight for life easier against othercreatures and sometimes were the sole reason a struggle had a favorable outcomefor man. These primitive inventions do not reveal the character of theircreators because these inventions or strategies are only seen by present day manand then only as a mass phenomenon, a collection of hunting methods anddefensive actions spanning a long period. There are also certain tricks andshrewd precautions that can be observed in animals. Man is unable to determineor explore the origin of these actions, so he simply resorts to describing theseactions as \"instinctive\". In the present case, this word means nothing. Anyonewho believes in a higher development of living creatures must admit that everyimpulse and every act in their battle for life must have had a beginning at sometime. One individual must have done it first, then it was repeated, then othersrepeated it more widely until, at last, it became a part of the subconscious ofall the members of a given species and appeared as an instinct.This is easier to understand and easier to believe in the case of man. Man'sfirst clever steps in the battle to control other animals must surely have beenmade by members of his own civilization who were particularly gifted. Even here,character was once the absolute source for good decisions and conduct that werelater adopted by all mankind until they were finally taken for granted. In thesame way, all common military strategy originated in one particular mind, and itthen spread and came to be generally taken for granted after many years.Sometimes it may have taken hundreds of years to become widespread. Mansupplements his first invention by a second invention. He learns to use otherthings. He puts objects and even living creatures, to work in the struggle topreserve his own existence. This is where the inventive nature of man, as we seeit everywhere around us today, begins. We can see from these material inventionsthat character is a component in such creations more and more clearly. Thisstarted with the use of the stone as a weapon and continued to the domesticationof animals, the artificial production of fire by man, and on to the various andadmirable inventions of our day, and each of these sprang from the mind of anindividual. This becomes clearer as we look at more recent inventions, or if welook at the more significant and decisive inventions of history. We know thateverything we see around us in the way of material inventions was produced bythe creative energy and ability of individual persons. Fundamentally, all theseinventions help raise man higher and higher above the animal world and theydefinitely remove him from it.They serve humanity's constant progress in the effort to reach higher levels.Even those things that made life easier, such as a simple trick for the manhunting in the jungle long ago, helps now, because it is the basis for brilliantscientific understanding, to make mankind's battle for its present existenceeasier, and to forge the weapons for the struggles of the future. In itsultimate results, all human thinking and invention serve man's fight for life onthis planet. This is true even if the socalled practical use of an invention ora discovery or a profound scientific insight into the nature of things may notbe immediately obvious. All things together help to raise man more and moreabove the living creatures around him. They strengthen and consolidate hisposition so that he expands and becomes the dominant being on earth in everyrespect.All inventions result from the work of one person. Intentionally orunintentionally, all these persons are great contributors to mankind. Their worklater gave tools to millions, even thousands of millions of human beings, tomake their life-struggle easier.From the beginning of the present material civilization, we see individualpersons as inventors who complement one another and each builds on the work ofthe one before. The same thing is true when we look at how those inventions areused in new ways. All the processes of production are in themselves inventionsand depend on individuals to think them into existence. Even purely theoreticalmental work is the exclusive product of an individual person. This is impossibleto measure in detail yet still indispensable for all further materialinventions. The masses do not invent and the majority does not organize orthink. No, it is always from the character of the individual man.A community must be organized so that it assists as much as possible the work ofthese creative forces and makes good use of them in the community. Whether theinvention is material or mental, the most valuable part of the invention is theinventor's character. The first and highest concern of a national organizationis to place him in a position where he is most useful to the community. It isthe organization's purpose to put this very principle into practice. Only inthis way is it released from the curse of mechanization so the community maytake on life of its own. It must endeavor to set leaders where they manage themasses, and consequently to make sure the masses are led by the leaders.The organization must encourage these leaders to emerge from the masses andremove all barriers that could possibly interfere with their rise. In doing so,it must follow the principle that the blessings of mankind have never come fromthe masses, but they have come from the creative minds of individuals. In thereal world, these creative minds are the founders and providers of the humanrace. It is in the best interest of the community to make certain these men havethe dominant influence and to assist them in their efforts. Unquestionably, theinterests of the community are not satisfied and not served by the rule of themasses, but only by the leadership of those whom Nature has equipped withspecial talents for that purpose. The masses are not experts, the masses do notpossess thinking power, and certainly the masses are not Divinely gifted. Onlyindividuals have these powers.These great minds are revealed mainly through the hard battle of daily lifeitself. Many are broken and destroyed in the process, which only proves they arenot destined for the ultimate positions of responsibility. At last, only thechosen few remain. This process of selection still goes on today in the areas ofeducation, theory, creative art, and economics. However, in the area ofeconomics particularly, it is already subject to severe handicaps. The same idearules the civil service state administration and is also seen in the power ofthe military defense forces of the nation. In all these areas, the idea ofcharacter, its authority over those of lower rank, and its responsibility tothose of higher rank, still dominates. Today, only the area of politics hascompletely turned its back on this most natural principle. All of humancivilization is the result of the creative activity of individual persons whodirect the national community and especially those who act as leaders. But inpolitics, the most important principle becomes the strength of the majority.From the top it trickles down, and it gradually begins to poison all life andultimately dissolves it. Even the destructive effect of Jewry's activity, whichwe can see in other nations, result from its constant effort to undermine theimportance of the individual person in those nations hosting their presence. TheJew seeks to replace the power of the individual by the domination of themasses. The organizing principle of Aryan humanity is replaced by thedestructive principle of the Jew. The Jew becomes the festering rot of nationsand races and, in a larger sense, the solvent of human culture.Marxism is the pure essence of the Jew's attempts to eliminate the importance ofcharacter in every aspect of human life and replace it with the numerical powerof the masses. Its political counterpart is the parliamentary form of governmentwhose disastrous work we can see going on from the tiny nucleus of the villageall the way up to the top of the Reich. Their economic counterpart is the systemof trade union movements, which do not serve the true interests of thewageearner, but only the destructive purposes of the international world Jew.The farther our economic system moves away from the influence of the characterprinciple, the more it surrenders itself to the effects of the masses. Thenational economy should be productive and provide a valuable service to thecommunity, but it will gradually become involved in the inevitable decline asthe power of character is replaced by the influence of the masses. All workcouncils, which were established by the unions, try to gain influence overproduction instead of protecting the interests of employees, so they serve thesame destructive purpose. They harm the total production system and, in turn,harm the individual worker. The members of the nation cannot be satisfied in thelong run by fancy theoretical phrases. They will only be satisfied when theyreceive the goods they need to carry on their daily lives, and through thisprocess they create a collective conviction among the national community thatresults in the interests of the community being guarded by the individual, andthe interests of the individual being upheld by the community.It would not matter if Marxism was able to implement its mass-rule theory andhappened to take over today's existing economic structure because it would notprove anything. The reliability or myth of this principle is not determined byits ability to take over and manage a system that already exists. The only validtest is whether or not it has the creative power to build up such a culturebased on its own principles. If Marxism were to take over and continue thepresent economic structure under its own leadership, even if it tried a thousandtimes over and was successful in taking control every time, it would provenothing. Marxism would not be able to use this principle to create a system likethe one it takes over today, not one that works at any rate. Marxism has givenpractical proof of this. Not only has it never succeeded in creating acivilization or even an economic structure, but it has been unable to continuethe operation of existing structures according to its principles. When it hadthe opportunity, it was forced to almost immediately make concessions and returnto the ideas of the character principle. It cannot do without these principleseven in its own organization.What most clearly distinguishes the new racebased WorldConcept from the MarxistWorldConcept is the fact that the new racebased WorldConcept recognizes thevalue of race and the importance of the individual and makes these the pillarsof its whole structure. These are the most important factors that carry itsWorldConcept .If the NationalSocialist movement failed to understand the fundamentalsignificance of this essential principle-of-character and instead only outwardlypatched up the present State or actually considered the mass-rule standpoint asits own, it would then be nothing more than another party competing with Marxismon its own principles. It would no longer have a right to call itself aWorldConcept . If the National Socialist program sought to crowd out individualsand replace them with the masses, that would mean National Socialism itself wasalready eaten away by the poison of Marxism, just as the world of ourprivilegedclass political parties are today.The new racebased state can best care for the welfare of its citizens byrecognizing the importance of the individual's value in anything and everythingrelating to the operation and leadership of the community. Maximizing productionin every field assures that every individual receives the maximum possible shareof that overall output. For that reason, the new racebased State must remove thecurrent obscene political leadership, especially the highest leadershippositions, from the grip of majority rule by parliament. This will assure thatit will be replaced by the right of the individual, and personal responsibilitywill be placed there instead.From that, we can draw the following conclusion: The best state constitution andform of state government are those that give the greatest importance andgoverning influence to the best minds of the national community.Those men who are most capable in the economic world cannot be appointed bysomeone in a high position. They must fight their own way up the ladder ofsuccess. They provide themselves with endless training, from the smallestbusiness deal all the way through to the greatest industry, and the challenge oflife alone does the testing. Similarly, political brains cannot be suddenly\"discovered\". Geniuses with an extraordinary ability cannot be judged by thesame rules we use for normal humanity.The individual principle must be anchored in the state's organization, from thesmallest city council through the head of the government of the entire Reich.There must be no decisions made by a majority, but only decisions made byresponsible persons. The word \"council\" must be brought back to its originalmeaning. Every man will have \"counselors\" to assist him, but ultimately one manmakes the decision.The principle that made the Prussian army a marvelous instrument of the Germanpeople must someday be transferred to form the basis of the state, and thatprinciple is this: Every leader will be invested with full authority over thosebelow him, and he will carry full responsibility toward those above. Even thenwe will not be able to do without parliaments, but their counselors will onlyprovide counsel, and one man alone will have the responsibility, authority, andthe right to command.Parliaments are necessary to identify those minds that will gradually emerge andcan later be entrusted with positions of great responsibility.The general picture of how this will work follows: From the village up throughthe government of the Reich, the new racebased state will not have arepresentative body that decides anything by majority vote but only advisorybodies that assist the chosen leader. The leader divides up duties among them,and as needed, they resume absolute responsibility in certain fields, just asthe leader or chairman of the particular body has the responsibility on a largerscale.On principle, the new racebased state will not tolerate the practice of askingadvice or accepting advice on matters that require special knowledge, forinstance in economic matters, from people who lack that knowledge and cannotpossibly understand the matter due to a lack of training and experience. Fromthe beginning the state must divide its representative bodies into political andoccupational chambers.The cooperation between the two will be assured by a special Senate that willhave authority over them.No vote will ever be taken in either of the Chambers or in the Senate. They areworking institutions, not voting machines. The individual member has an advisoryvoice, but never a decisive voice. Decisive action belongs solely to theparticular chairman who is responsible for the matter being considered.This principle of directly connecting absolute authority with absoluteresponsibility will gradually cause a group of leaders to emerge. This would bequite unthinkable in our present irresponsible parliament. The nation's stateconstitution and political structure will then be brought into harmony with thelaws of nature to which the cultural and economic fields already owe theirgreatness.For those who may question the practicality of these principles, I would askthat you not forget the system of parliament, which uses democratic majorityrule, has not always controlled mankind. On the contrary, majority rule is onlyfound in very brief periods of history, and those have always been periods ofdecline for the people and nations.Such a transformation cannot be produced by purely theoretical measures decreedfrom the top down, since logically it cannot be limited to the constitution of astate and expected to propagate, but it must penetrate all other legislation andall of civil life. A radical change like this can and will occur only through amovement which is built up in the spirit of these ideas and bears the principlesof the coming state within itself. Therefore, the NationalSocialist Movementeven today should make itself completely at home with these ideas and put theminto practice within its own organization. That way, in the future, it may notonly lay down the same guidelines for the state, but may put the perfected bodyof its own organization at the state's disposal.5. WORLD-CONCEPT AND ORGANIZATIONI have tried to draw a general picture of the new racebased State; however, itwill not be realized by simply understanding what is necessary to construct astate. It is not sufficient to know how a racebased state should look. Much moreimportant is the problem of where to start. We cannot expect the existingpolitical parties, which are mainly landlords of the present state, to take anyaction themselves toward change or to voluntarily alter their present attitude.This is impossible because they are being directed by Jews, Jews here and Jewsthere and Jews everywhere. If current events are allowed to develop unhindered,the final result will be the realization of the Pan-Jewish prophecy, and the Jewwould devour the peoples of the earth and become their master.In contrast to the millions in the German privilegedclass and workers who ambleto their destruction mainly out of cowardice coupled with apathy and stupidity,the Jew follows his chosen path without hesitation, fully conscious of hisfuture goal. A party led by him can fight for only Jewish interests, and thesehave nothing in common with the needs of the Aryan.To transform the ideal image of a racebased Nationalist state into reality, onemust seek new forces that are willing and able to undertake the battle for suchan ideal, and one must especially avoid forces related to the current system.And a battle it must be, because the creation of a new racebased state firstrequires the elimination of the present Jewish concept of a state. It oftenhappens in history, that the greatest problem faced is not the formation of anew state of affairs, but in clearing out room for it. Bias and self-interestsform a solid front and use every means to prevent the victory of a new idea theyfind disagreeable and menacing. The champion of such an ideal, with all hispositive intentions for it, is forced to fight first in order to wipe out theexisting state of affairs.As unpleasant as it may be to the individual followers, a young doctrine ofgreat importance and new significance must use the tool of criticism in allsharpness as its first weapon of assault.It shows little historical insight when the socalled racialists of today keepdeclaring that they have no intention of indulging in negative criticism butonly in constructive work. This nonsense is as childish and as idiotic as it istruly indicative of the \"racialist\", and it proves how little they know of theirown history. Marxism has an aim also, and it is no stranger to \"constructivework\", even if that work is nothing more than the creation of a tyranny ofinternational world finance, by which I mean Jewry! Nevertheless, it began itsconstructive work by practicing criticism and has continued for seventy years.And how destructive it was! This corrosive criticism continued until theconstant gnawing of the acid undermined the old State and brought it tocollapse. Only then did the socalled \"constructive work\" of Marxism begin.However, this was actually natural, right, and logical. You cannot abolish thecurrent system by simply emphasizing and insisting on a future one.Explaining the necessity for change will not win over followers of the presentsystem and it certainly will not convert those with an interest in the existingstate of affairs. Unfortunately, it may easily happen that both conditions willexist side by side, so that the new WorldConcept becomes a political party, andonce that happens, it can never escape from its own limitations. WorldConcept sare intolerant and cannot be satisfied with the role of being a \"party amongothers\". They arrogantly demand complete and exclusive recognition forthemselves and a complete transformation of public life so that it follows theirviews. A true WorldConcept cannot tolerate any continuing existence of aprevious state of affairs side by side with their views.This is equally true of religions. Christianity could never be content withbuilding its own altar. It was driven to destroy pagan altars. The faith couldonly grow when there was no controversy, and it did grow out of this fanaticalintolerance. In fact, intolerance is absolutely indispensable for the growth ofany faith. Now one may object and say such occurrences in world history arerelated mainly to Jewish ways of thinking, and it is true that this kind ofintolerance and fanaticism are common symptoms of Jewish nature. This may beright a thousand times over; however, it is part of all history, and thoughdeeply regrettable, and though we may only grudgingly admit it is part ofhistory, and you can even say this intolerance is not part of human nature, yetit does not change the fact that this is how the world exists today. The men whowant to rescue our German people from the current troubles cannot dwell on howwonderful it would be if things were different, but they must determine howthose current conditions can be wiped away. A WorldConcept full of hellishintolerance cannot be shattered, except by an idea that is promoted with asimilar spirit of intolerance, an idea that is defended by the same intensewill, and at the same time is pure and absolutely true in itself.People today may be troubled to discover that the first intellectual terrorismwas inflicted by Christianity on the unrestricted ancient world. However, hewill not be able to dispute the fact that since that time, the world has beendriven and dominated by Christian forces. Force can only be broken by force, andterrorism can only be broken by terrorism. Only then can a new order be created.Political parties are inclined to compromise; WorldConcept s never compromise.Political parties adjust their views to match those of their adversaries; WorldConcept s proclaim their own infallibility.Political parties almost always start off by planning to achieve total anddictatorial domination. They almost always have some small tendency towardbecoming a WorldConcept . But the very limits of their program rob them of theheroism that a WorldConcept demands. This spirit of compromise and placationattracts small and feeble souls who could never champion any crusade. The resultis that very soon they are stuck in their own miserable pettiness. This is howthey give up the fight for a WorldConcept and resort to using socalled\"constructive cooperation\" to secure a place at the feedingtrough of theexisting regime. Once they have squeezed into their place, they will stay therefor as long as possible. This is their whole aim. If they are ever pushed awayfrom the common trough by some brutally-inclined feeder, they simply strain andscheme, whether by force or slyness, to push to the front again and feed amongthe hungry drove. They will use whatever means are necessary to again eat fromthe cherished fountain of nourishment, even though they sacrifice their mostsacred convictions. They are the jackals of politics! No WorldConcept is everprepared to share its place with another. It can never be ready to help in anexisting regime that it condemns, but instead, it feels obligated to fight thecurrent state-of-affairs and the entire world of hostile ideas belonging to thatorder by every means possible until it achieves the enemy's downfall. Thisbattle of destruction to collapse the adversary, which they instantly recognizeas a threat and oppose with united resistance, requires determined warriors. Thepositive battle to build and establish its own new ideology also requiresdetermined warriors. Therefore, a WorldConcept can lead its ideas to victoryonly if it unites the most courageous and energetic elements of its age and hasthe best people in its ranks, solidly shaping them into a vigorous fightingorganization. To accomplish this, it is necessary to keep these elements in mindand to pick certain ideas from its WorldConcept that can be wrapped up in brief,precise, slogan-like qualities that make them suitable as a doctrine of faithfor a new fellowship of men.While the platform of a strictly political party is a formula for success in thecoming election, the program of a WorldConcept is a formula that declares war onan existing order, an existing state of things, and an existing WorldConcept .That does not mean it is necessary for every individual who is fighting for thisWorldConcept to have a complete understanding and knowledge of the ultimateideas and reasoning of the movement's leaders. It is more important that a fewfundamentals are made clear to him and the most essential basic lines stampedpermanently in his mind so that he is absolutely convinced of the need for thevictory by his movement and his doctrine.The individual soldier is not instructed in high level strategic planning.Instead, he is trained for rigid discipline and a fanatical belief in thejustice and strength of his cause, and this makes him totally devoted to thecause without any reservations. The same thing must be taught to the individualfollower of a movement so that he knows it is important, and he is fighting fora great future and a supreme purpose.An army would be worthless if it only consisted of generals. A politicalmovement that upholds a WorldConcept is equally worthless if it tries to be areservoir of \"thinking\" people. No, it needs the discipline of the simplesoldier as well. The survival of any organization depends on the service of abroad and emotionally driven mass of people who are willing to serve a supremeintellectual leadership. It is more difficult to maintain discipline with acompany of two hundred equally intelligent men than to maintain discipline witha company of one hundred and ninety with less intellectual capacity and only teneducated men among them.In the past, the Social Democracy Marxist movement has used this fact to theirgreat benefit. It recruited from the masses our discharged soldiers who werealready accustomed to discipline. The Marxists took them under its own equallyrigid discipline. Its organization was an army that consisted of both officersand soldiers. But here, the German laborer, who was now discharged from thearmy, was the soldier and the Jewish intellectual became the officer, and theGerman trade union officials could be considered the non-commissioned officers.Our privilegedclass was always shaking their heads in confusion when they sawthat only the socalled uneducated masses belonged to Marxism. They failed torealize this was the reason for its success.While the intellectual privilegedclass parties formed a useless andundisciplined mob, Marxism used the non-intellectuals to form an army of partysoldiers who blindly obeyed their Jewish masters as they had once obeyed theirGerman officers. The German middleclass thought they were above worrying aboutthe mental reasoning of the \"ignorant\" lower classes so they paid no attentionto them. They also failed to consider the potential consequences or to realizethe deeper meaning, and they certainly failed to see the danger that existed inthis recruitment of the masses. On the contrary, they believed that a politicalmovement that consisted only of intellectuals was superior simply because it wasan intellectual movement. They assumed a group of intellectuals had more of aright and a greater chance of gaining power than the uneducated masses wouldpossibly have. They never realized that the strength of a political party is notfound in the great intelligence of individual members, but rather strength is inthe disciplined obedience of the members who follow their intellectualleadership. What counts is the leadership itself. If two bodies of troops arefighting, the victor will not be the one whose individual members have the mostadvanced strategical training; the winner will be the one with the superiorleadership and with better-disciplined, more blindly obedient, andbetter-drilled troops. This is a basic principle that we must constantly keep inview when testing the possibility of moving a WorldConcept into action andmaking it a reality.Now that we know we must transform a WorldConcept into a fighting movement inorder to lead it to victory, it is logical that the movement's program mustconsider the human resources at its disposal. On one hand, the ultimate goalsand guiding ideas of the movement must be firmly fixed and immovable. On theother hand, the propaganda of the recruiting program must adapt to appeal tothose whose help is necessary for success. This propaganda must be brilliant andpsychologically sound when adapted to the target audience. Without them, eventhe most brilliant idea would always remain just an idea. If the racebasednationalist idea is to grow from a vague thought into a clear success, it mustcarefully select certain guiding principles and ideas calculated by nature andsubstance to attract and hold a great mass of men. Only this mass can guaranteethese ideas in the form of a WorldConcept that will be fought for. This mass isthe German working class.For this reason, the program of the new movement was summed up in a handful ofguiding principles, twenty-five in all. They are intended to give a roughpicture of the movement's intent to the ordinary man of the people. They are, toa certain extent, a political profession of faith. On the one hand, they are togain followers for the movement and on the other hand, they are to unite thosefollowers by welding the recruits together by giving them a common obligation.The following realization is important and must always be remembered: Theprogram of the movement is beyond questioning and is absolutely sound in itsultimate aims. But, since it has had to be written down based on what wasthought at the time, the opinion may eventually arise that perhaps certainprinciples should be worded differently and better formulated. This is usuallydisastrous because it takes something that should be unshakably firm and opensit to discussion. If we allow a single point to be dragged outside the realm ofa strict doctrine, discussion will not produce a new, better, and unifiedformulation. It is far more likely to lead to endless debate and general chaos.In such a case, the alternatives must always be weighed. Which is better? A newand more succinct formula that causes a dispute within the movement, or a formthat is less than perfect, but establishes a logical, unshakable, inwardlyunified entity? If carefully considered, the unshakable entity will always bepreferred. Since changes are only a matter of outward form, making correctionsmay seem desirable or even possible over and over again. Due to men's focus onthe outward appearance, there is great danger that they may see this externalre-formatting of a program as the main business of a movement and assume thegoal is to tinker with the program. But if that is the focus, the will andstrength to fight for the idea will diminish, and the energy that should bedirected against the outside world is consumed by internal battles over theprogram.If the broad outline of the doctrine is actually sound and it has, up to thispoint, been considered a rock solid law, it is not nearly as harmful to keep aformula that is less than ideal or may not agree exactly with the truth than totry improving it by opening it up to discussions that may have damagingconsequences. Revisions must be absolutely avoided as long as the movementitself is still struggling for victory. How are we to fill men with blind faithin the truth of a doctrine if we spread uncertainty and doubt by constantlymaking changes to it? We must always seek the inner meaning of the doctrine andnot become distracted by the outer shape. This inner core is unchangeable, andfor its own sake, we can only hope that by keeping away all actions that candivide and create doubt, the movement may gain the strength necessary tomaintain itself.Here, too, we can learn from the Catholic Church. Although its dogmaunnecessarily conflicts sometimes with science on many points, the Church is notwilling to sacrifice one syllable of this dogma. It rightly realizes that itsstrength is not in adjusting to match the scientific results of the moment,which are constantly changing, but in firm devotion to doctrines that areestablished and form its character of faith. It is more solid today than everbecause of this. We may safely foretell that as events become more fleeting andthey begin to change faster, the strong and stable fixed pole of the Church willattract even greater numbers of the blindly devoted.Anyone who truly and seriously desires the victory of a new racebasedWorldConcept must realize that only a movement that is capable of fighting isequipped to succeed and that such a movement can hold its own only if it isbuilt on an unshakable, impregnable, and solid program. In formulating itsprogram, the movement must never dare to make concessions to the passing spiritof the times, but must always maintain the form that has been decided as theright one, or at least maintain it until the movement is victorious. Until thishas happened, any attempt to introduce arguments about the suitability of somepoint of the program will shatter the unity and fighting strength of themovement in the same degree its followers participate in such inner discussions.An \"improvement\" carried out today might be subjected to renewed criticalscrutiny tomorrow and possibly another better substitute found the day after.Anyone who allows this to happen opens up a road whose beginning he knows, butwhose end is lost in a boundless expanse.This important realization had to be used in the young NationalSocialistmovement. In the program of the Twenty-Five Points, the NationalSocialist GermanWorkers' Party has a foundation that must remain unshakable. The movement'spresent and future members must never feel it is their task to rework theseguiding principles but must feel duty bound to them as they stand. Otherwise,the next generation might waste its strength on similar purely formal workwithin the party instead of bringing new followers and new power to themovement. For the great number of followers, the essence of our movement will beless in the words of our doctrine and more in the meaning we give them.The young movement originally owed its name to these considerations. The programwas later drawn up in accordance with these and that was how the circle of ideasbecame rooted. To bring victory to the new racebased ideas, it was necessary tocreate a people's party, a party consisting not just of intellectual leaders,but of manual workers too.Any attempt to accomplish the new racialist lines of thought without thisforceful organization would be useless today and forever, just as it has provento be in the past. Therefore, it is the movement's right and its duty toconsider itself the champion and the embodiment of these ideas. The basic ideasof the NationalSocialist movement are racebased--racialism is NationalSocialism.If National Socialism is to conquer, it must declare this set of ideasabsolutely and exclusively as its own. Here too it has the duty and the right tostress that any attempt to maintain the racebased idea outside the confines ofthe NationalSocialist German Workers' Party is pointless and impossible, and inmost cases, such claims are outright fraud.If anyone today accuses the movement of acting as if it \"owned\" the racebasedidea, there is just one single answer: We not only own it, but for all practicalpurposes, we created it.Nothing that previously existed under the name racialist was fit to influencethe destiny of our people in the slightest because these ideas all lacked clear,unified formulation. In most cases, these ideas were a collection of mereisolated, disconnected convictions, which varied in their soundness. They oftencontradicted one another and never had any cohesion among themselves. Even ifthis cohesion had existed, it was too weak to build a movement from. This iswhat the NationalSocialist movement accomplished alone.Today, all kinds of societies, big and small, even \"great parties\", lay claim tothe word racialist. This is a result of what our NationalSocialist movement hasaccomplished. If it had not been for our work, none of these organizations wouldever have dreamed of even of saying the word \"racialist\".The word would have meant nothing to them and been incomprehensible to theirleaders. It was only the work of the NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers'Party) that made this concept into a meaningful word, and now everyone uses it.Our party's successful work in enlisting support through its propaganda hasshown the power of racialist ideas. Others are forced, if only by their greed,to gain new members, to at least pretend they want something similar.It is the same old story. They exploited our work to help their party at theelections. For them, the word \"racialist\" is just a superficial, empty catchwordthat they use to counter the attraction their members have for ourNationalSocialist movement. They are concerned for their own movements and fearour movement, which is carried by a new world-view of universal significance, asignificance which is so great that they can only speculate about the truemeaning, and they can only suspect how dangerous it is for one party to be theexclusive torch bearer of this idea. It is only this fear for their own survivaland alarm at the rise of a movement supported by a new WorldConcept that makesthem use this new word of \"racialist\". Eight years ago, they didn't even knowthis word. Seven years ago, they laughed at it. Six years ago, they called itstupid. Five years ago, they fought it. Four years ago, they hated it.Three years ago, they put it on trial. Finally, two years ago, they added it totheir vocabulary as their own war-cry for their battle.Even today we have to keep pointing out that none of these parties has any cluewhat the German people actually need. The most striking proof of this is thesuperficial way they use the word \"racialist\". All those fakeracialists roamingaround with hybrid ideas are just as dangerous. They build fantastic plans basedon nothing more than a concept. It may sound like a good idea, but alone, it istotally meaningless and cannot be used to lead a great, unified fightingfellowship, and it is certainly unfit to build one. These people who brewtogether a program, partly from their own thinking and partly from what theyhave read in other programs, are often more dangerous than those who admit theyare enemies of the racialist idea. The best among these fakeracialists areunproductive theorists, but even here, most of them strut arrogantly towardsdisaster. They often believe they can cover up their spiritual and intellectualnonsense and their instability by hiding behind a flowing beard and adistracting people with primitive Germanic gesturing.To contrast all these unsuccessful attempts, it is a good time for us to recallwhen the young NationalSocialist movement began its struggle. 6. THE STRUGGLE OF THE EARLY DAYS. THE IMPORTANCE OF SPEECHESThe first great meeting on February 24th, 1920 in the Hofbräuhaus Banquet Hallwas still fresh in our mind when we began preparing for the next meeting.Previously, we thought it was a bad idea to hold a small meeting once every twoweeks, or even once a month in a city the size of Munich, but we were nowplanning to have a great mass-meeting once a week. One fear and one alone kepttroubling us: Would people come and would they listen to us? I personally wasunshakably convinced, even then, that once people are there, they will stay andlisten to what we had to say.During those days, the Munich Hofbräuhaus Banquet Hall became almost sacred tous. It was the place where we had a meeting every week, and every week it wasfilled with more attentive people than the time before. We started with \"WarGuilt\" about the responsibility for the war, and at that time the general publicdid not think about it much--they did not care. We went through the PeaceTreaties. Almost everything that was discussed seemed to stir the crowd, whichmade it appropriate material for campaigning. With strong interest all around,we paid particular attention to the Peace Treaties.Again and again, our young movement had been foretelling to the great masses ofpeople what would fall on their heads and now, almost every prophecy had beenfulfilled.Today it is easy to talk or write about those things, but in those days beforeour first big meetings, a public mass-meeting that embraced the irritations ofthe working classes, instead of demonstrating privilegedclass weaknesses, anddealt with \"The Peace Treaty of Versailles\" was viewed the same as an attack onthe Republic and a sign of die-hard, Monarchy supporters. At the very firstsentence that criticized the Versailles Treaty, the speaker could expect to bethe target of the stereotypical interruption: \"And BrestLitovsk? BrestLitovsk!\"(Meaning the 1918 Treaty of BrestLitovsk, which marked Russia's exit from thewar with extremely harsh terms and massive losses of territory and resources forRussia; here the crowd appears to mean \"But the Treaty of Versailles was theresult of our abuses in the Treaty of BrestLitovsk, so we brought this hardshipon ourselves; anyone who attacks the Versailles Treaty must want to bring backthe Monarchy\".) The crowd would keep roaring this again and again until itgradually became hoarse or the speaker gave up trying to convince them ofwhatever his point was. One could have beaten his head against the wallsympathizing with the misery of these poor people! The crowd would not listenand would not understand that Versailles was a shame and a disgrace, and thedemands it made amounted to an unheard of plundering of our people. The Marxistshad worked their destruction, and the enemy propaganda poisoned our peoplebeyond the reach of reason. We were not even allowed to complain about thisdisgrace openly. Who were we \"little\" Germans to complain about anything whenthere was such immeasurable guilt on the other side! What had theprivilegedclass done to stop this dreadful collapse, to oppose it, and to clearthe path for truth by better and more complete understanding? Nothing andnothing! In those days, the great racialist apostles, which we see all aroundtoday, were nowhere to be seen. They may have been talking in clubs or at teaparties among their own like-minded circles, but they never ventured among thewolves where they should have been. The only time they were with the wolves waswhen they had an opportunity to howl with them.I realized that the question of War Guilt must be clarified through historicaltruth for the small group that made up the Party. Providing an understanding ofthe Peace Treaty to the great masses was an indispensable step toward themovement's success in the future. In those days, the masses still saw the Peaceas a success for democracy. It was necessary to make a stand against the treatyand the first step was burning ourselves into the people's minds forever as anenemy of that Treaty. Later, when bitter reality revealed the real deception andexposed the hatred concealed in the Treaty, the memory of our earlier attitudewould win us the confidence of the masses.Even then I always advocated making a stand against misguided public attitudes,regardless of whether it was popular at the time or even if it generated hatred;I was ready to start the battle. The NSDAP must not be a follower of publicopinion, but must become the master of public opinion. It must not be themasses' servant, but their lord. When a movement is still weak, there isnaturally a great temptation to follow the crowd and join in the shouting byusing the slogans and battle-cries of the enemy. This temptation comes at a timewhen an overwhelmingly superior challenger has already succeeded, throughseductive deceit, in forcing the people to make crazy decisions or formincorrect beliefs. This is true especially when the young movement believesthere are a few obvious slogans used by the enemy that seem to speak for the newmovement equally well. Human cowardice accepts such arguments eagerly if itbelieves they give it justification for expressing \"its own point of view\", evenif it is following in the criminal footsteps of the enemy.Several times I have been in situations where it took extreme energy not to letthe ship of the movement drift into artificially created currents or fromactually sailing right into them. The last time was when our hellish press, theHecuba of the existence of the German nation, succeeded in blowing the problemof South Tyrol out of proportion, which could be disastrous to the Germanpeople.( Hecuba of ancient Greece had a vision that she would give birth to thedestruction of Troy, here the reference means the press will cause thedestruction of the German nation.) (South Tyrol was an Austrian province lost toItaly with the Treaty of Saint-Germain , which dissolved the Austrian-HungaryEmpire at the end of the First World War. Hitler believed the German populationin Southern Tyrol was insignificant, and it was not part of his originalPanGerman plan; he was willing to let Italy keep it while many people wanted itback.) Without stopping to think about exactly who they were working for, manysocalled \"nationalist\" men and parties and societies joined the general outcryout of weakness when they were faced with the public opinion that had beenthoroughly inflamed by the Jews. This helped to senselessly strengthen theattack against a system that we Germans should regard as the one ray of light ina corrupt world. (The ray of light is the fascist Italian government ofMussolini even though it is not explicitly stated.) While the internationalworldJew slowly but surely strangles us, our socalled patriots lash out against theman and the system that have dared to withdraw from the Jewish-Freemason embraceand to resist this spreading poison. (The unnamed man and the system areMussolini and his government, which took control of the Italian press.) Butthese weak characters could not avoid being blown in the wind of public opinion,and so they surrendered to its call. And a surrender it was. Though thesepeople, in their wretchedness and lies may not admit it, maybe not even tothemselves, it is nevertheless the truth that only weakness and a fear of thetemper of the masses, which was only stirred up by the Jew, made them take partin the outcry. All other explanations they offer are disgraceful excuses fromthe guilty little sinner himself.It was now necessary to yank the course of our movement around with an iron handin order to preserve it from ruin by following this misguided trend.When the flame of public opinion is being fanned by every force that could driveit and is burning bright in one single direction, it is unpopular to follow acourse in a different direction and, in fact, often dangerous to the life ofanyone who dares attempt such a course correction. Many men in history have beenstoned for actions that future generations fell to their knees and thanked themfor carrying through.That is why a movement must count on posterity to be its judge and not theraging applause of the passing minute. Undoubtedly, we will find the individualsuffering torment at those times when he must maintain a true course, but hemust never forget that every such instant will be followed by redemption. Amovement that is trying to reshape the world must serve the future and not thepassing hour.We can easily say that some of the greatest and most long lasting successes inall of history were the ones that were the least understood at their outsetbecause they were in sharp opposition to general public opinion, its views, andeven its desires.We learned this for ourselves at our first public appearance. We did not \"courtthe favor of the masses\" at our appearances but instead we opposed thefoolishness displayed everywhere by the people. During those years, I wouldappear before a group of people who believed the opposite of what I was sayingand wanted the opposite of what I wanted. It would take two hours to lift two tothree thousand people out of their former convictions, to shatter thefoundations of their established understanding, until, blow by blow, I finallyled them to stand on the firm ground of our convictions and brought them to theside of our WorldConcept .I quickly learned that it was important for me to knock the weapon of reply frommy opponent's hand at the very beginning. We soon noticed that those whochallenged us in open-forums shared a very definite \"repertoire\" of constantlyrecurring objections. The uniformity of their replies made it obvious they hadreceived special training from their masters. This is how we were able torecognize the incredible discipline in our adversaries' propaganda methods. I amvery proud, even today, that I was able to effectively counter their propagandaand eventually to best its creators at their own work. Within two years, I hadbecome the master in the art of propaganda.It was important in every single speech to determine in advance what objectionswould be raised by the crowd. This way, these objections can be totally torn topieces in the speech before discussion is even possible. It was always a goodidea to bring up possible objections oneself and then to prove how they wereinvalid or show that they did not apply. The listener who came in an honestspirit, even though he was filled with the objections he had been trained touse, was then more easily won over by the preemptive rebuttal of the objectionsthat had been stamped on his memory. Everything that had been drilled into himwas automatically countered, which meant he was attracted more and more to thespeech.When I was still an instructor for the military troops, I delivered my veryfirst lecture on \"The Peace Treaty of Versailles\". After that experience, Ialtered my speech by calling it \"The Peace Treaties of BrestLitovsk andVersailles\". As I learned from the discussion after my first lecture, peopleknew nothing whatsoever about the Treaty of BrestLitovsk, but they had beenindoctrinated by their parties' skilled propaganda machine to ridicule thistreaty because they were taught it was one of the world's most shameful acts ofrape that Germany had committed against Russia. The constant insistence of thislie meant that millions of Germans saw the Peace Treaty of Versailles as therevenge for the crime we had committed at BrestLitovsk, and they felt that anystruggle against Versailles was a moral outrage. They were often deeply honestin this belief. This was one of the reasons why the disrespectful and horribleword \"Reparations\" was adopted into Germany's language. This hypocritical lieseemed to be a fulfillment of higher justice to millions of our misled fellownationals. It was horrible, but that is what they believed. The best proof ofthis was the success of the propaganda I initiated against the Peace Treaty ofVersailles, which was now introduced by a discussion of the Treaty ofBrestLitovsk. I compared the two Peace Treaties, point by point, and showed howabsolutely humane BrestLitovsk was when compared to the inhuman cruelty of theVersailles Treaty. My success was incredible. I then spoke on that subject inmeetings of two thousand people where I was often met by thirty-six hundredhostile eyes. Three hours later, I would have in front of me a surging crowdfilled with solid resentment, righteous anger and absolute rage. Once again, agreat lie had been uprooted from the hearts and minds of a crowd of thousandsand a truth planted in its place.At that time, \"The True Causes of the First World War\" and \"The Peace Treatiesof BrestLitovsk and Versailles\" were the two lectures I considered my mostimportant ones. I repeated them dozens of times in various ways until a clearand unified attitude was established among the first members of the movement.For me, these meetings had another advantage. I gradually became a mass-meetingspeaker and grew skillful in evoking feelings and developing gestures that areneeded in a great room holding thousands of people. Except for some smallcircles, no one seemed to understand the need for good speech making skills.Many of those parties now throw out their chests and act as if they were theones responsible for the change in public opinion. If a socalled nationalistspeaker did give a similar lecture somewhere, it was only for groups thatalready shared his opinion and, at best, did nothing more than reinforce theirexisting beliefs.There was no need to convince those who were already believers. What was moreimportant was to use explanation and propaganda to recruit those who were on theenemy's side of the fence as a result of their training and opinions. We usedleaflets to explain this. While I was still in the army, I had written a leafletthat compared the Peace Treaties of BrestLitovsk and Versailles. That leafletwas widely distributed. Later, I used elements of it for the Party, and itproved to be very effective. The first party meetings were memorable because thetables were covered with all kinds of leaflets, newspapers, and pamphlets. Eventhen, however, the main emphasis was on the spoken word. Only the spoken word iscapable of producing truly great revolutions, and this is based on soundpsychological reasons.As I have said before, every great and world-shaking event has been produced bythe spoken word and not by the written word. This claim was followed by a longdiscussion in some of the press. They naturally took a very sharp stand againstmy assertion, especially the privilegedclass smartalecks.The reason for this confused many of my skeptics. The privilegedclass intellectsprotested my confidence in the power of public speaking because they lacked thestrength and ability to influence the masses with the spoken word. Theyconcentrated on purely literary activities, abandoning the real campaigner'sweapon of public speaking. The necessary result of this habit led to whatdistinguishes our privilegedclass today. They lost the instinct needed toinfluence or motivate the masses.The speaker receives constant feedback from the crowd he is speaking to, and hecan constantly judge from the faces of his audience whether they understand hismessage, and if his words are having the desired effect on them. The writer doesnot know his readers at all. Therefore, he will not address any specific groupof people but will keep his writing general. Writing in this way causes him tolose the psychological delicacy and adaptability he needs. In general, abrilliant speaker will write better than a brilliant writer can speak, unless hetoo practices the art of speaking constantly. There is also the fact that themasses of people are lazy by nature. They will not pick up and read somethingunless it goes along with their own existing beliefs or offers what they hopefor. Therefore, a written work about a specific issue is usually only read bypeople who already belong to that movement. A poster or a leaflet may be shortenough to be quickly read by one who thinks differently. There is a betterchance for response from a picture in all its forms, up to and including themotion pictures or movies. Here, man depends even less on his brain. It isenough simply to look or, at most, read very short captions.Many people are much more willing to take in a pictorial representation than toread a longer written work. The explanation a picture can give in one quick lookwould require a lot of tedious reading. So a picture is worth a thousand words.The most essential point is that you never know whose hands the written materialwill fall into and no matter who picks it up, its form remains the same.In general, it will be more effective if this form agrees with the intellectuallevel and character of those who are reading it. A book intended for the broadmasses must, from the start, use a different style and mental level than wouldbe used in a work destined for readers in the higher intellectual classes.Written matter approaches the spoken word only when it is adapted to exactlymatch the audience. The speaker may discuss the same topic as a book, but if heis a great and inspired speaker, he will rarely repeat the same argument twicein the same way. He will always allow himself to be influenced by the listenersso that his feelings will give him precisely the words he needs to move hisaudience at that moment. If he makes even the slightest mistake, he has a livingadmonishment constantly in front of him. As mentioned earlier, he can read fromthe expressions of his listeners to see whether, firstly, they understand whathe is saying, secondly whether they can follow it all, and thirdly howcompletely they are convinced of the truth of what they hear. If he, firstly,sees that they do not understand him, he will make his explanation so simple andplain that even the dullest among them can grasp it. Secondly, if he feels thatthey cannot follow him, he will build up his ideas so carefully and slowly sothat even the feeblest among the crowd is not left behind. If he, thirdly,suspects that they do not seem convinced of the truth of what he says, he willgo on repeating those truths with new illustrations, addressing the unspokenobjections he can sense, disproving and shattering them until, finally, theattitude and expression of even the last opposing group shows it has surrenderedto his arguments.With human beings, it is frequently a matter of overcoming prejudices that arenot founded on reason, but supported only by feeling; many times these feelingsare deep in the unconscious mind. Overcoming this barrier of instinctivedislike, emotional hatred, and preexisting objections is a thousand times harderto correct than a belief based on faulty facts or mistaken opinion. False ideasand incorrect facts can be eliminated by instruction, but emotional resistancescannot. Only an appeal to these mysterious forces themselves can be effective.Such an appeal can rarely be made by the writer, but almost exclusively by thespeaker.We can see the most striking proof of this in the privilegedclass press. Evenwith their skillful writing and multi-million reader circulation, they were notable to stop the great masses from becoming bitter enemies of theprivilegedclass world. The flood of newspapers and books produced year afteryear by the intellectual crowd simply beaded up and flowed off the millions ofthe lower classes like water off of oiled leather. This proves either of twothings.Either it proves the writing of our privilegedclass world used the wrongarguments or it proves the hearts of the broad masses cannot be reached bywriting alone, especially when the writing has so little psychological appeal,as is the case here.Never let it be said that this statement is disproved by Marxism itself justbecause it produces many writings, especially because of the effect of writingsby Karl Marx. A great German-Nationalist paper in Berlin tried to make thisargument.Probably a more shallow defense of a flawed view has never been attempted. Whathas given Marxism its astonishing power over the broad masses is not the formal,written product of Jewish brains, but the enormous wave of speeches filled withpropaganda that have taken possession of the masses through the years. Out of ahundred thousand German workers, on an average, not a hundred know about Marx'sbook. It has been studied a thousand times more by intellectuals and the Jewsthan by followers of the movement in the great working classes. In fact, thebook was not written for the broad masses at all, but entirely for theintellectual leadership of the Jewish machine to guide them in world conquest.The Jewish machine itself was fired by a different fuel, the press. This is whatdistinguishes the Marxist press from our privilegedclass press. The Marxistpress is written by agitators and the privilegedclass press attempts to campaignusing professional writers. The Social Democratic back-alley editor returns tohis editorial chair from the meeting hall where he has gained an unparalleledknowledge of his customers. But the privilegedclass pen-wielder leaves his studyto appear before the broad masses where he is sickened by their smell and findshis written words are useless to him.What has won the millions of workers over to Marxism is not the way the MarxistChurch Fathers write. It is the tireless and tremendous propaganda work of tenthousands of tireless campaigners, from the top all the way down to the smallestunion official and the party delegate and the person who answers questions atthe end of speeches. It is the hundreds of thousands of meetings at which thesespeakers, standing on a table in a smoky pub room, have hammered away at themasses, acquiring a wonderful knowledge of this human fodder, a knowledge thathas enabled them to choose the right weapons to attack the stronghold of publicopinion. It is the gigantic mass demonstrations and the marches of a hundredthousand men that have burned into the shabby little man a proud convictionthat, even though he is a poor worm, he is part of a great dragon whose fierybreath will someday send the hated privilegedclass world up in flames and bringfinal victory to the lower class dictatorship.The propaganda of speeches is what prepared the men and made them willing toread the Social Democratic press, so the press was the next step following thespoken word. In the privilegedclass camp, professors, bookworm scholars,theorists, and writers of every kind sometimes tried to speak, while in theMarxist camp, the speakers sometimes tried to write. The Jew deserves specialattention because his deceitful skills of twisting the truth and his clevernessmade him an effective writer, but his true strength is in his abilities as aprovocative speaker.This is why the privilegedclass newspaper world doesn't have the slightestinfluence on the attitude of the broadest classes of our people. This is alsodue to the fact that it is largely Jew-controlled and therefore has no interestin truly enlightening the broad masses. It is hard to overthrow emotionalprejudices, subconscious beliefs, or feelings and replace them with otherbeliefs that depend on invisible forces and conditions for them to be accepted.The speaker who senses the mood of the audience well can judge all of thesefactors and adapt his message. He knows that even the time of day his speech isgiven is important in determining its effectiveness. The same speech, the samespeaker, and the same subject have entirely different results at ten in themorning, at three in the afternoon, and in the evening. As a beginner, Isometimes called meetings in the morning. I still remember a demonstration westaged in the MunichenerKindl Cellar as a protest \"against the oppression ofGerman territories\".(MunichenerKindl means Munich's Child, the name of Munich'scoat of arms.) At that time, it was Munich's largest hall, and it seemed a veryrisky venture. To make it easy for the movement's followers to attend and foreveryone else who might come, I set the meeting for a Sunday morning at teno'clock. The result was devastating, but extremely instructive. The hall wasfull and the impression stunning, but the room was like ice. Nobody warmed up,and I was deeply unhappy at not being able to establish any relationship, noteven the slightest connection, with my audience. My speaking was no worse thanat other times, but there were no results. When I left the meeting, I wascompletely dissatisfied, but one experience richer. Similar attempts that I madelater led to the same result.This should not have surprised us. You only need to watch the performance of aplay to see the difference in impression and effectiveness at three in theafternoon and the same play with the same cast at eight in the evening. A personwith a keen sensitivity and the ability to analyze this emotional state willimmediately see that the magnificence of the afternoon performance is not asstrong as the evening's performance. The same statement holds true for film. Inthe case of the theater, it might be possible to say the actor does not work ashard in the afternoon as in the evening, but the movie does not change betweenthe afternoon showing and the nine in the evening showing. No, the time itselfhas a definite affect on the room as well as on me. There are halls thatmysteriously leave one feeling cold and somehow violently resist any generationof warmth. Men's traditional memories and impressions of a place may alsodecisively influence their reaction. A performance of Parsifal at Bayreuth willalways have a different affect from anywhere else in the world. (Parsifal is anopera about the Knights quest for the Holy Grail, written by Richard Wagner.Bayreuth is a city in northern Bavaria where Richard Wagner lived until hisdeath.) The mysterious magic spell of the Festival Heights opera house in theold city of The Margrave cannot be equaled or substituted by dressing up anotheropera house with fancy decorations. (The Bayreuth Festspielhaus, or FestivalHeights, is an opera house that was specially constructed for and is exclusivelydevoted to the performance of Wagner's operas. Margrave is a title of a militarygovernor and here describes Margrave Christian of Kulmbach, who was responsiblefor constructing many grand buildings in the city when he moved the capitalthere in 1603.) All these cases require the invasion of a man's freedom of will.This is the most true when it comes to political meetings. These meetings areattended by people who are already against you, people who have to be won overto a new purpose. In the morning and during the day, people's willpower seems toresist with the greatest energy any imposition of an outside will, and theyrefuse to recognize an outside opinion. In the evening, on the other hand, thatwillpower yields more easily to the dominating force of a stronger willedspeaker. In truth, every such meeting is a wrestling match between two opposingforces. A man of dominating force, a man who has the character of an apostle,and a man who is an outstanding speaker will be the one who succeeds in winningover men whose resistance has already been naturally weakened. Their resistanceis more easily overcome than those who are still in full possession of theirforce of will and their intellectual strength.The same purpose is served by the artificial and mysterious twilight of Catholicchurches, the burning candles, incense, etc.This wrestling match between the adversaries to be converted and graduallydevelop his wonderful sensitivity to the psychological the speaker willrequirements ofpropaganda, a sensitivity the writer will never have. Therefore, the writtenwork, with its limited effectiveness on its own, is better used to preserve,strengthen, and deepen an already existing view or set of principles. Greathistorical revolutions have never been produced by authors, but accompanied bytheir written words.The French Revolution ( 1789-1799 was an uprising of the lower economic classesagainst the aristocracy) would never have happened through the discussion ofphilosophic theories. It had to find an army of troublemakers led by majesticdemagogues who inflamed the passions of an already tormented people. Finally,the frightening volcanic eruption that followed made all of Europe freeze intheir tracks with horror. Similarly, the greatest revolutionary upheaval ofrecent times, the Bolshevist Revolution in Russia (1917), came about not throughLenin's writings, but through the hate-stirring speeches of countless aggressiveapostles, both great and small.The uneducated masses were not inspired to start the Communist Revolution byreading theoretical ideas of men like Karl Marx, but by the shining heavenpromised to them by the thousands of agitators who were working for an idea. Soit was and so it always will be. It is just like our German intellectual class,with their stubborn isolation from life, to believe that a writer must beintellectually superior to a speaker. This idea is wonderfully illustrated by areview in a nationalist paper, which I already mentioned, which said that one isoften disappointed when they see a great orator's speech in print. That remindsme of another review I saw during the war. It put the speeches of Lloyd George(who was British Prime Minister in the last half of the First World War and forfour years afterward), Munitions Minister at that time, painstakingly under themagnifying glass to arrive at the \"brilliant\" conclusion that these addresseswere intellectually and philosophically inferior, they were unoriginal, andtheir conclusions were obvious. I picked up a copy of these speeches myself in atiny booklet, and I could not help laughing out loud at the way thesemasterpieces were able to psychologically and spiritually lead the masses. Itleft the ordinary German penpusher completely blank. This man judged thespeeches simply by the impression they made on his own detached nature, whilethe great English demagogue successfully influenced the mass of his listenersand the entire lower classes of the English nation as much as possible. Fromthat standpoint, this Englishman's speeches were marvelous performances becausethey displayed an absolutely astonishing knowledge of the soul of the lowerlevels of the common people. Their effect was, in fact, tremendous.Compare these speeches to the futile babble of a Bethmann-Hollweg ( GermanChancellor until 1917). His speeches did appear to be more intelligent, but inreality, they showed only the man's inability to speak to his people. He was astranger to them. Yet the birdbrain of a common German scribbler whose intellecthas been stagnated by scientific knowledge, who does not understand the masses,could only evaluate the intellect of the English Minister by the impression thata speech intended to affect the masses made on his own nature. He naturallycompared those speeches with the ones of a German statesman whose intellectualchatter fell on much more fruitful soil with the intellectual writer. LloydGeorge was in genius not merely equal to a Bethmann-Hollweg, but a thousandtimes superior. He proved this by the way he formed and expressed his speechesso that they opened the hearts of his people to him, finally bringing the peopleto carry out his will absolutely. The very primitive nature of the language heused, the directness of its forms of expression, and the use of easilyunderstandable, elementary examples prove the Englishman's outstanding politicalability. I must measure a statesman's speeches to his people by the effect theyhave on his people and not by the impression they make on a universityprofessor. That alone is the measuring rod of the speaker's genius.Our movement was founded a few years ago from nothing. Today it is impressiveenough to be bitterly persecuted by every enemy of our people, both internal andexternal. The astonishing development of our movement is to be attributed to theconstant awareness and application of these conclusions.As important as the writings of the movement may be, in our present situationthey will be of more value in the training of superior and subordinate leaderswithin the organization than for winning over the masses from our enemies. Onlyin the rarest cases will a convinced Social Democrat or a fanatical Communistlower himself to purchase a NationalSocialist book or even pick up a pamphlet,read it, and from it gain an insight into our understanding of the universe orstudy the criticism of his own beliefs. Even a newspaper will very seldom beread unless it bears the stamp of party affiliation from the start. Even if anewspaper were read, it would do little good. The overall impression of a singlenewspaper issue is so scattered and its effect so disjointed that one cannotexpect a result after the reader reviews a single issue. One cannot expect aperson who has to count every penny to subscribe to a paper that containsopposing views purely out of a desire for objective enlightenment. Barely one ina thousand will do it. Only the man who has already been won by the movementwill regularly read the party journal to keep up with events within hismovement.The leaflet for a speech is different matter. A person is much more likely tolook at it, particularly if it is free, and even more if the headline vividlyproclaims a subject that everyone is talking about at the moment. When he hasread it, he may become aware of new attitudes and points of view, even of a newmovement. This impulse gives a gentle push but never creates a strongconviction. The leaflet can only suggest or call attention to something. It onlybecomes effective in connection with subsequent and more thorough instructionand enlightenment, and that always means a mass meeting.The mass meeting is necessary because this is where there the individual sees,for the first time, a large fellowship. While, as a budding member of a youngmovement, he may feel isolated and may fear he will be left alone with his newunderstanding, the mass meeting has a strengthening and encouraging effect onhim. The same man would march to the attack with a unit, in a company, or in abattalion, as long as he was surrounded by all his comrades, and he would do sowith a lighter heart than if he had to march alone. In a group he always feelssafer, even though in reality there may be a thousand reasons to argue againstit.The community created by the great demonstration strengthens not only theindividual, but it also unites the group and creates Esprit de Corps (Teamspirit or group morale). The man who is the first in his business or factory toexpress a new doctrine and is subjected to heavy pressures needs the strengthfound in the conviction that he is a fighter for, and a member of, a great,all-embracing body. He can only get his first impression of this body from acommon mass demonstration. When he comes from his little workshop or from a bigfactory, where he may feel small indeed, into a mass meeting for the first timeand finds thousands and thousands of men with similar convictions around him,then he submits to the magic influence of the masses. When he is seeking truthand is swept away into the tremendous stream of hypnotic intoxication andenthusiasm of three to four thousand others, then he surrenders to the magicinfluence of the mass-mind. When the visible success and the affirmation ofthousands confirm the rightness of the new doctrine and awaken for the firsttime a doubt about the truth in his previous beliefs, then he yields to themagic influence of the mass-suggestion. The will, the longing, and the strengthof thousands accumulate in each individual. The man who comes into such ameeting doubting and wavering goes away inwardly fortified and strengthened. Hehas become a member of a community.The NationalSocialist movement must never forget this. It must never let itselfbe influenced by the privilegedclass idiots who think they know something abouteverything but have tossed away a great State along with their own existence andthe dominating control of their own social class. They are enormously smart, cando anything, and understand everything. There is only one thing they could notdo. They could not prevent the German people from falling into the arms ofMarxism. Here they were a wretched and pitiful failure. Their present conceit iscaused by their cockiness, which is well known to be the companion of stupidity.Ignorance is the mother of audacity. If these people believe the spoken word hasno special power, it is because they have already convinced themselves, thankGod, that their own ranting words are ineffective.7. THE STRUGGLE WITH THE RED FRONTIn 1919, 1920, and 1921, I personally visited a number of privilegedclasspolitical meetings. They always affected me in the same way as the prescribedspoonful of cod-liver oil from my childhood. One is supposed to take it, and itis supposed to be good for you, but it tastes horrible! If the German peoplewere to be tied with ropes and dragged to these privilegedclass\"demonstrations\", and the doors were barred so no one could leave until eachperformance ended, maybe then it would bring success within a few centuries.Still, I must frankly confess that I would probably lose all pleasure in lifeand I doubt I would want to be a German any more. Fortunately, this cannot bedone, thank Heavens, and it is not surprising that the sound and unspoiledmasses avoid privilegedclass mass meetings just as the Devil avoids holy water.At these meetings I came to know these prophets of a privilegedclassWorldConcept . From that experience I can say that I am truly not surprised andeven understand why they attach no importance to the spoken word. I haveattended meetings of the Democrats, the German Nationalists, the German People'sParty, and of the Bavarian People's Party, which are actually a branch of theCenter Party. The thing that struck one immediately was the uniformity of theaudience. It was filled exclusively with their own party members. There was noform of discipline needed because it was more like a boring group of card gameplayers than a meeting of people who had just gone through their greatestrevolution. The speakers did everything possible to preserve this peacefulatmosphere. They spoke, or rather they read their speeches aloud as if they werereading a fancy newspaper article or a scientific dissertation. They avoided allrough language and occasionally sprinkled in a feeble professor's joke, at whichpoint the honorable Party Officers would laugh dutifully, but not loudly, whilepretending it was a provocative remark. They chuckled with quiet, refinedrestraint, all very dignified.I once attended a meeting in the Wagner Hall at Munich. It was to commemoratethe anniversary of the Battle of Leipzig. (In 1813, Napoleon suffered a severedefeat by the Germans ending French occupation of Germany, in this, the largestbattle in Europe up to that time.) The speech was delivered, or rather it wasread by a dignified old gentleman, a professor at some university. On the raisedplatform, at a table, sat the officers of the party.The man on the left had a monocle, the man on the right had a monocle, and theman in between was without a monocle. They were all three in Prince Alberts (afrock coat, knee length black Victorian era formal coat). Anyone in attendancewould have thought they were either in a court of law about to undertake anexecution, or at a solemn baptism or some religious act of consecration. Thesocalled speech, which might have looked quite nice in print, was simplyterrible in its effect. Within forty-five minutes, the whole meeting hall hadfallen into a trance that was interrupted only when the occasional observer leftthe hall, or by the rattle of the waitresses, and always by the ever morefrequent yawning of numerous listeners. I stood behind three working men whowere attending, either because of curiosity or they may have been sent asappointed lookouts by their own party. They looked at one another from time totime with obvious grins and finally nudged one another before very quietlyleaving the hall. One could tell by looking at them that they had no intentionof causing any disturbance, and in that company, it was really not necessary todisturb anything.Finally, the meeting seemed to be drawing to a close. The professor's voice hadgrown fainter and fainter. After he finished his speech, the chairman of themeeting stood up from between the two monocle wearers and raved in front of the\"German sisters and brothers\" present about how his feelings of gratitude wereso great and how great their feelings must also be, for the unique and splendidspeech which Professor X had given in a manner that was so enjoyable and soprofound. He went on to say that it was truly an \"experience\" and even an\"achievement\", and it would be a sacrilege if this sacred moment, followingthese logical statements, were befouled with a discussion. So on behalf of allthose present, he would omit that part of the evening.Instead, he requested that everyone stand and join in the cry, \"We are a unitednation of brothers\", etc. Finally, in conclusion, he asked everyone to singDeutschland Über Alles.They did sing, but it seemed to me that by the second stanza, the number ofvoices grew fewer. They swelled again tremendously in the refrain. Then, on thethird stanza, my feeling was confirmed. I do not believe everyone was quite surewhat the words were. But what difference do the words make, as long as such asong resounds to Heaven with all the fervor of a German-Nationalist heart? Thenthe meeting broke up and everyone rushed to get out quickly, some for a beer,some to a cafe, or or some just to the fresh air.Yes, out, out into the fresh air! That was my feeling. Was this how theyglorified a heroic struggle by hundreds of thousands of Prussians and Germans?For shame, for shame! No doubt, the government is fond of things like this\"peaceful assembly\". The Minister for Peace and Good Order need not fear thatthe billows of enthusiasm will suddenly burst the legal limits of civil decency.There is no chance that these people, intoxicated with enthusiasm, may suddenlystream from the hall and rush, not to the cafe or the pub, but to march in stepby fours side-by-side through the streets singing Deutschland Hoch in Ehren (Oh,Germany High In Honors), and annoy a peace-loving police force in need of rest.No, the government is satisfied with these kinds of citizens.Then, there were the NationalSocialist meetings. I must admit, they were not\"peaceful assemblies\". There, the waves of two WorldConcept s collided. Theyended with a fanatical outburst of racialist and national passion and not withthe dull drum of some patriotic song. From the very beginning, it was importantto introduce unquestioned discipline in our meetings and to absolutely assurethe authority of the meeting's chairman. What was spoken in those meeting wasnot the lifeless slop of a privilegedclass speaker. It was always engineered insubstance and form to rouse a reply from the challengers. And there wereadversaries in our meetings. Often they came in large crowds with a fewappointed agitators among them and all their faces reflected the sameconviction: Tonight, we'll take care of you! Oh yes, often the agitators wereliterally led in by rows, our Red friends, with their duty carefully drilledinto them and their instructions to smash the whole affair that evening andorders to put a stop to it! Often, everything hung precariously in the balance,and only the ruthless energy of our meeting chairman and the brutal recklessnessof our hall-guard halted the enemy's intentions! They had every reason to beprovoked too.The red color of our posters alone attracted them into our meeting-halls. Theordinary privilegedclass was quite horrified to see us using the red of theBolsheviks and regarded it as very curious scandal. The spirits amongGerman-Nationalists kept whispering to one another their suspicion thatbasically, we were only a variation of Marxism, maybe even Marxists or some kindof Socialists in disguise. These brains have still not grasped the differencebetween Socialism and Marxism. When they discovered that we omitted the standardgreeting \"ladies and gentlemen\" and instead used \"comrades\" and that amongourselves we spoke only of \"Party comrades\", many saw this as proof of theMarxist ghost. How often we shook with laughter at these simpleminded, scaredprivilegedclass rabbits with their clever guesswork about our origin, ourintentions, and our aim.We chose the color red for our posters after careful and thorough consideration.It was in order to provoke the political Left wing, to drive them into fury, andto lure their members into our meetings. If nothing else we could at least breaktheir people away and gain a chance to talk to them.It was enjoyable during those years to follow the confusion and helplessness ofour adversaries as they constantly shifted their tactics. First, they called ontheir followers to ignore us and to stay away from our meetings. They mostlycomplied. But later, a few people did come. The number increased slowly butconstantly, and the impression made by our doctrine was obvious. The leadersgradually became more nervous and uneasy. Finally they made the mistake ofconvincing themselves that they could not continue to watch this development insilence, but must put an end to it by terrorism.Then came the appeals to those \"class-conscious\" working people to attend ourmeetings as a group in order to strike at those responsible for \"monarchist,reactionary agitation\" and to strike hard with the fists of the lower class.All at once it seemed our meetings were filled with workmen a full forty-fiveminutes before the meeting's start time. They seemed like a powder keg thatmight blow up at any moment and the fuse had already been lit. But it neverturned out that way. People came in as our enemies and went out, if not as oursupporters, at least as thoughtful and critical examiners who were ready toquestion the soundness of their own doctrine. Gradually through the night ithappened, and after my three-hour speech, followers and opponents would bejoined into one single enthusiastic mass. By then, any signal to break up themeeting was useless.Now the leaders really did become frightened. They sided with those who hadoriginally said it was a bad idea to send workers in large groups to ourmeetings. After making some pretense to justify the change, they went back totheir previous opinion and declared that the only sound thing to do was toforbid workers from attending our meetings at all. Then most of those workersquit coming. But within a short time, the whole game started over again.The ban was not observed after all. More and more of the comrades came andfinally, those in their party who supported the use of radical tactics gaineddominance again and decided our meetings must be broken up. It turned out thatafter members attended two, three, or eight or ten meetings, breaking them upwas more easily said than done. Every single meeting we held resulted in afurther crumbling of the Red shock troops. Their previous slogan was suddenlyheard again: \"Working class people! Comrades! Stay away from the meetings of theNationalSocialist agitators!\" The same indecisive and wavering policy could alsobe seen in the Red press. First they would try to freeze us out with silence,and when they became convinced that was not working, they would go back to theopposite extreme and refer to us constantly. We were \"mentioned\" in one way oranother every day. Most references tried to explain to the worker how absolutelyridiculous our whole existence was. But after a while, these gentlemen realizedthat their efforts were not harming us, to the contrary, they helped us becausemany individuals began to naturally ask themselves why so much press was devotedto something if it was really so ridiculous. People grew curious. Then there wasa sudden shift, and for a time the press treated us as absolute criminalsagainst humanity. They wrote article after article explaining our criminalbehavior and offering proof again and again, and finally they used falsescandalous stories of every kind in an effort to completely turn the publicagainst us. But within a short time, they saw that these attacks were alsoineffective. In the end, their efforts helped to concentrate attention on usmore than ever.At that time, I took the position that it makes no difference whether they laughat us or abuse us, whether they describe us as clowns or criminals. As long asthey mention us and continue to concern themselves with us, we will graduallyappear in the eyes of the workers as the only force that can put up a fight.They wish to know what we really are and what we really want. Then we will showthose pack-hounds of Jewish journalists some fine day.One reason their plans to break up our meetings never reached even a startingpoint was because of the unbelievable cowardice of our opposition leaders. Inevery case they sent their young cubs in and waited outside the hall to watchthe scattering.We were almost always well-informed about the intentions of these gentlemen. Forreasons of practicality, we left many of our Party members within the Red partyranks. We also knew what was going on because the Red puppeteers themselves wereseized with the gift of running their mouths, which was very useful to us andunfortunately it is still very common among our German people. They could neverhold their tongues when they had hatched anything of this sort, and in fact,they usually began cackling before the egg was laid. We often had time to makeextensive preparations before the Red dispersion-groups themselves knew how fastthey would be thrown out.This turbulent period compelled us to take protection measures into our ownhands. We could not count on official protection. On the contrary, experiencehad shown that when officials intervene, it never benefits anyone except thosecausing the disturbance. The police would bring the meeting to an end after anydisturbance, and an end to the meeting was the goal of the hostile intruders.In fact, the police began using a horribly unjust method of control. If theauthorities receive a threat or otherwise hear that a meeting is in danger ofbeing broken up, they do not arrest the one who has made the threat, but forbidthe innocent parties from holding their meeting. The police mind sees this pieceof wisdom, shocking as it may seem, as a proud piece of police work. They callit a \"preventive measure against infraction of the law\".This means the determined gangster has the power, at any time, to make thedecent person's political activities impossible. In the name of peace and goodorder, the governmental authority bows to the gangster and asks the other partynot to provoke him. So, if NationalSocialists wanted to hold meetings at certainplaces, and the tradeunions declared this would lead to resistance by theirmembers, the police never considered even the possibility of putting theseblackmailing crooks in jail but instead forbade us from holding our meeting atall. Indeed these instruments of the law even had the incredible shamelessnessto send this notice to us in writing on countless occasions.If we were to protect ourselves from such censorship, we had to make sure thatany attempt made to break up our meetings would be rendered impossible at thestart.We must also consider the fact that any meeting that must be protected by largebattalions of police discredits its organizers in the eyes of the broad masses.Meetings that can only be held when a large police detail is present, have noattraction for others. Obvious strength from one's own side is necessary to winover the lower levels of society.Just as a courageous man can conquer a woman's heart more easily than a coward,a heroic movement will win the hearts of a people sooner than a cowardlymovement that survives only through police protection. The young Party had touphold its own existence, protect itself, and it had to break the enemy's circleof terror itself.Meeting protection was built in two ways. The first way was through the forcefuland psychologically sound management of the meetings. When we NationalSocialistsheld a meeting in those days, we were the only masters present. We sharplyemphasized our mastery every single minute and never tolerated interruptions.Our opponents knew that anyone who dared to incite trouble would be harshlythrown out, even if we were only a dozen against five hundred. In the meetingsat that time, particularly outside of Munich, there would be fifteen or sixteenNationalSocialists facing five, six, seven, or eight hundred opponents. But evenso, we would have tolerated no challenges and the audience at our meetings waswell aware that we would have been killed before we would surrender. More thanonce a handful of Party members successfully maintained themselves in heroicfashion against the yelling and thrashing of superior numbers of Reds.In such cases, the fifteen or twenty men would have undoubtedly been overpoweredin the end. But the opponents knew that at least two or three times as many oftheir own people would have their heads cracked first, and they did not want torisk that.We wanted to understand Marxist and privilegedclass meeting methods, and welearned a great deal by studying their techniques. The Marxists alwaysmaintained unquestioned discipline at their meetings, so there was absolutely nopossibility of a Marxist meeting being broken up by a privilegedclass group. TheReds, however, had their own intentions when it came to disrupting othermeetings. They not only developed a fluent skill in this area, but in largesections of the Reich they finally went so far that they declared any nonMarxistmeeting itself as provoking the working class. This was especially true when thepuppeteers suspected that their own sins might be discussed at a meeting thatrevealed the treachery of their activity through their corruption and deceptionof the people. Whenever such a meeting was announced, the entire Red pressraised a furious outcry. Even though they have nothing but contempt for the law,they urgently turned to the authorities demanding that they prevent this\"provocation of the working class in case worse things might happen\". They chosetheir wording depending on the particular official's degree of foolishness,which also determined how successful they were at accomplishing their objective.However, if the official's post was occupied, for once, by a real German civilservant rather than just a political creature filling an office seat, and herefused such an offensive and bold request, the result would be the familiarappeal to their party members not to tolerate such a \"provocation of the workingclass\", but to attend the meeting in a large group on the scheduled date and to\"put an end to the shameful plot by privilegedclass creatures using thecalloused fist of the working class\".There is nothing like watching one of these privilegedclass meetings andexperiencing the whole disgraceful and dreadful way in which it is conducted.Often, a meeting was simply called off as a result of threats. There was so muchfear among them that the meeting scheduled for 8:00 often didn't start before8:45 or 9:00. When the meeting did occur, the chairman used several complimentsin an effort to make it clear to the attending \"gentlemen of the opposition\",how happy he and all the others present were that they could attend and welcomedmen who were not yet on their side of the fence. What an outright lie! Hecontinued by saying it was only through mutual discussion, which from thebeginning he would solemnly promise them, that their different ideas could bebrought closer together, they could create mutual understanding, and the gapbetween them could be bridged. At the same time, he assured them that it was notthe meeting's purpose to alienate people from their previous views, but thateveryone should find salvation in his own way. However, he should also let hisneighbor discover his own beliefs. Therefore, he requested that the speaker beallowed to finish his remarks, which he assured the crowd would not be very muchlonger, so the world would not see again any shameful display of bad bloodbetween German brothers. Ugh! The brothers from the political Left usually didnot take kindly to this sort of talk. Before the speaker had even resumed hisspeech, he had to stop amid the grossest insults. Often one had the impressionthat he was even grateful to Fate for cutting short the agonizing process. Inthe middle of a huge uproar, these privilegedclass bullfighters would leave thearena, unless they were thrown down stairs with cracked heads, which oftenhappened.So, the Marxists found the way we conducted our first meetings to be veryunusual for them. They walked in convinced that they could play the same littlegame with us they had so often played before. \"Today, we'll be the ones tofinish this up\". Many of them yelled this boast as they walked into our meeting,but immediately, they found themselves sitting outside the entrance to the hallbefore they could interrupt a second time.In the first place, the way we conducted our meetings was different. We did notbeg to be graciously permitted to speak, and we did not start out by promisingan endless discussion opportunity for everyone. We simply and abruptly said thatwe were the masters of the meeting. We were masters in our own house, and anyonewho dared to make so much as a single interruption would be harshly thrown outthe way he had come in. Further, we were not responsible for what happened tothe fellow who spoke out of turn. If there was time and if we felt like it, wewould have a discussion. If not, then we wouldn't. The speaker, Party comrade soand so, now had the floor. Such a bold deceleration astonished the Marxists.In the second place, we had a strictly organized hall guard. With theprivilegedclass parties, the hall guard or rather their ushers, consisted mostlyof gentlemen who thought that they had a right to authority and respect becauseof their age. Since the masses in their hyped-up Marxist excitement carednothing about anyone's age or authority and had no respect, there waseffectively no privilegedclass hall guard at all.From the very beginning of our serious activity in holding the meetings, Iintroduced the organization of a hall guard as a group to control the crowds.This group included nothing but young men. Some of them were friends I knew fromthe army and others were recently recruited members of the Party who wereinstructed and trained from the beginning to believe that terrorism can only bebroken by terrorism; that the bold and determined man has always been the one tosucceed in the world; and that we are fighting for an idea so tremendous, sogreat, and so noble that it deserves to be sheltered and protected with the lastdrop of blood. They were saturated with the doctrine that if reason remainssilent, then violence has the last word. The best defensive weapon is attack.They were also taught that our control troops should have the reputation ofbeing a desperately determined fighting fellowship and we were not a debateclub. These young people had been longing for such a battle-cry! This generationof men from the trenches has been disappointed and outraged, filled with disgustand hatred for the actions of the cowardly and unmanly privilegedclass! Here iswhere everyone really began to understand how the Revolution had been madepossible only because of the catastrophic failure of the privilegedclassleadership. The fists to protect the German people from the Revolution wereavailable even then, but the heads that were needed to pledge themselves toaction were not to be found. How the eyes of my young men used to shine at mewhen I explained to them how necessary their mission was, and when I assuredthem again and again that all the wisdom in the world would fail if it is notbacked up by strength to protect and defend it.I told them that the gentle Goddess of Peace can only walk beside the God ofWar, and that every great deed of peace requires the protection and assistanceof strength. The necessity and vision of military duty appeared in a much morevivid light! This is not duty in the frozen sense of old, fossilized officialswho are serving the dead authority of a dead State, but in a living realizationof a duty strong enough that one will surrender his life to defend the existenceof his people as a whole, anywhere and anytime. How those young men stood up toaccept their duty! They would fly like a swarm of hornets at anyone whodisturbed our meetings, not caring if they were met with a superior force or ifthey had to sacrifice through wounds and blood. They were obsessed with thegreat idea of clearing the road for our movement's sacred mission.As early as midsummer of 1920, the organization of the hall-guards graduallybegan to take on a definite shape. In the spring of 1921, it grew so large ithad to be split into divisions of one hundred each, which, in turn, were dividedinto smaller groups.This organization was urgently needed because our meeting activity had continuedto expand. We did still frequently meet in the Munich Hofbräuhaus Banquet Hall,but more often it was in the larger halls around the city. The BürgerbräuBanquet Hall and the MunichenerKindl Cellar were the scenes of greater massmeetings in the fall and winter of 1920-1921, but the picture was always thesame. Even then and in those large halls, demonstrations of theNationalSocialist German Workers' Party usually had to be shut down by thepolice because of overcrowding even before the start of the meeting. Theorganization of our control troops raised a very important question. Until now,the movement had no party symbols and no party flag. The absence of thesesymbols was already causing problems and it was not acceptable for the future ofthe movement to be without them. One immediate disadvantage was that partymembers had no distinguishing outer mark to show their allegiance. Lookingtowards the future, it was unacceptable to be without a distinguishing mark thathad the emblem of the movement and that could be set against symbols of theInternational Marxists.Even in my youth, I had many opportunities to see and understand the emotionalimpact a symbol has on the mind. After the war when I was in Berlin, I observeda mass demonstration of Marxism in front of the Royal Chateau and PleasureGarden (Lustgarten park). A sea of red flags, red armbands, and red flowerscreated a tremendous visual spectacle for this demonstration, which had anestimated hundred and twenty thousand marchers. I could feel and understand howeasily the average man could give in to the hypnotic spell of such a granddemonstration. The privilegedclass, as a political party, represents ormaintains no WorldConcept of any kind; therefore, they had no flag of their own.This party consisted of self proclaimed \"patriots\", and for that reason they ranaround in the colors of the Reich. If these colors had been the symbol of adefinite WorldConcept , it would have been understandable how the nobility ofthe State could see in these colors a flag that was the sign of their ownWorldConcept , since their WorldConcept was the State and Reich flag that cameto be through their own efforts.But this was not the real situation. The Reich had been put together without thehelp of the privilegedclass and the flag resulted from the war. Therefore, it was actually only a State flag that had no meaning in the sense ofa particular mission for some WorldConcept .German Austria was the only place in the Germanspeaking territories where therewas anything like a privilegedclass party flag. Some of the nationalists fromthe privilegedclass there had chosen the colors of 1848, black, red, and goldfor their party flag. (There were a series of German revolutions in 1848 basedon nationalist sentiment and political reform. The black-red-gold flagsymbolized unity among the people.) This created a symbol which, while it had noimportance for a WorldConcept , it did have a revolutionary character from theperspective of State policy. We should remember today that the bitterest enemiesof this black-red-gold flag at that time were Social Democrats and ChristianSocialists or the clergy. In those days, the church parties especially were thevery ones who insulted, slandered, and soiled those colors. Just as in 1918 whenthey dragged the blackwhite-red German flag in the gutter (the Pre-Weimar flag).True, the black, red, and gold of the German parties of old Austria were thecolors from 1848, and this period may have been fantastic and was representedindividually by the most honorable of German souls, even though the Jew stoodinvisibly in the background as the puppeteer. It was, therefore, treason to theFatherland and a shameful sell-out of the German people and what they stood forthat made these flags so agreeable to Marxism and the Center party. Today theyrevere them as sacred and set up militias to protect the flag they once spatupon.Up until 1920 there was no flag that opposed Marxism, at least not one whichwould have represented its direct opposite as a WorldConcept . Even if thebetter parties of the German privilegedclass, after 1918, would no longer lowerthemselves to take over the black-red-gold national flag as their own symbol,they still had no agenda of their own for the future that could oppose the newpolitical development of the Revolution. At best, their idea was to reconstructan Empire that had already vanished.The blackwhite-red flag of the old Empire owes its resurrection as the standardof our socalled nationalist privilegedclass parties to this idea of restoring adead Empire.It should be obvious that the symbol of the government, which Marxism succeededin overthrowing under shameful circumstances, is not a suitable symbol for thosewho would see this same Marxism destroyed again. As sacred and dear as the oldand beautiful colors must be, especially when they were fresh and youthful, toevery decent German who has fought for them and has seen the sacrifices of somany under those colors, that flag is not the symbol for a battle of the future.In contrast to the privilegedclass politicians, I have always maintained theview in our movement that it is a real blessing for the German nation to havelost the old flag. What the new Republic does under its flag is unimportant tous. But we should thank Fate from the bottom of our hearts that it was mercifulenough to protect the most glorious battle-flag of all times from being used asa cover for the most shameful prostitution. The present Reich, which sells-outitself and its citizens, must never fly the heroic blackwhite-red flag of honor.As long as the November disgrace lasts, let it wear its own outer garment andnot steal one from a more honest past. The conscience of our privilegedclasspoliticians should tell them that anyone who desires the blackwhite-red flag forthe current State is stealing from our past. The old flag really was beautiful,but only for the old Empire, just as the Republic has chosen a new one that issuited to itself.This was the reason why we NationalSocialists could not consider raising the oldflag as a symbolic expression of what we were working for. After all, we did notwant to awaken the old-dead Empire, which was destroyed by its own faults. Wewanted to build a new State.A movement that fights against Marxism today must show the symbol of the newState everywhere, even in its flag. The question of the new flag and itsappearance occupied our minds a great deal at that time. Proposals came from allsides, although they were more well-intended than they were acceptable. The newflag had to be a symbol of our own battle and have a striking poster-likeeffect. Anyone who has been involved with the masses will realize that thesethings that seem unimportant are actually very important matters. An effectiveemblem may ignite the first spark of interest and create a desire to know moreabout a movement in hundreds of thousands of cases.For this reason, we had to decline the suggestion that we use a white flag. Thatrecommendation came from many areas. A white flag would have surely identifiedour movement with the old State and with those feeble parties whose solepolitical aim is to restore the old Empire. Besides, white is not a compellingcolor. It is suitable for innocent societies of maidens, but not for rebelliousmovements in a revolutionary age.Black was also suggested. It was appropriate for the time, but there was nosignificance that suggested our movement's intent. Also, this color is notcompelling enough either, so it would not attract attention. Blue and white wereout of the question, despite their wonderful aesthetic effect. Those are thecolors of one German State (Bavaria) and represent a political attitude ofnarrow interest and very state-specific ideas, which did not have a greatreputation. It would have been difficult to associate any significance with ourmovement in these colors. The same was true of black and white. (Black and whitewere the dominant colors on the Prussian flag.) Black, red, and gold were out ofthe question. (Those were the colors of the despised Weimar Republic.)Blackwhite-red, in the familiar form (the form of the old German Monarchystriped flag) was out of the question for reasons that have been mentioned.However, this color combination is the most effective of all. It is the moststriking and harmonious combination there is.I was also inclined to retain the colors of the old flag because they are themost sacred thing to me as a soldier and because their aesthetic effect appealsfar more than any other to my artistic sense. Nevertheless, I had to decline allof the countless sketches that came in from the members of the young movement.Most of them incorporated the swastika into the old flag. As the Leader, I didnot want to immediately present my own design to the public since it was quitepossible that someone else might produce one equally good or perhaps evenbetter. In fact, a dentist from Starnberg (a town in Bavaria Germany nearMunich) brought in a design that was not bad at all. It was a lot like mine, buthad one flaw, the swastika; it had curved ends and a thin white circle aroundthe swastika.Meanwhile, after countless attempts, I had finally drawn the final form. It wasa flag with a red background, and a white disk with a black swastika in themiddle. After many experiments, I also established a balance between the size ofthe flag and the size of the white disk as well as the shape and thickness ofthe swastika lines.And that's how it remained. Arm bands for the guard troops were orderedimmediately. They were red bands bearing the white disk with the black swastika.The party badge was designed along the same lines. It was a white disk on a redbackground with the swastika in the middle. A Munich goldsmith, Mr. Füss,produced the first practical design and that is the one we have kept.In midsummer of 1920, the new flag appeared in public for the first time. Itsuited our movement perfectly. The movement and the flag were both young andnew. No one had ever seen it before and its effect was like a firebrand (aperson who stirs up trouble or kindles a revolution). We were all childishlydelighted when a faithful woman Party member completed the design for the firsttime and delivered the finished flag. Within a few months, we had half a dozenof them in Munich. The constantly expanding guard troops were mostly responsiblefor the spread of the new movement's symbol. And this is truly a strong symbol.Our respect for the past is demonstrated by each color, and it is passionatelyloved by us all because it calls forth so much honor from the German people. Itwas also the best image to show the desire of the people who were driving themovement. As NationalSocialists, we see our political program in our flag. Inthe red, we see the socialist ideas of the movement; in the white, thenationalistic; in the swastika, the mission of the fight for the victory of theAryan man. At the same time, we see victory for the creative work of a culture,which was antiSemitic and will be antiSemitic eternally.Two years later, when the guard troops had grown in number to many thousands ofmen who now formed an elaborate Storm Detachment, we saw that it was necessaryto give this defense organization of our young WorldConcept a special symbol ofvictory that we called the Standard (meaning a degree or level of excellencesymbolized by a flag or emblem) I sketched it myself and gave it to the mastergoldsmith, Mr. Gahr, to execute. Since that time, this Standard has been thesymbol and field-badge of the NationalSocialist battle.The number of people attending meetings kept growing in the year 1920. Finally,we began holding two meetings a week during some weeks.Crowds gathered in front of our posters. The largest halls in the city werealways filled. Tens of thousands of those misled by Marxism found their way backto their national community to become warriors for a free German Reich. We werewell known in Munich. We were the talk of the town. The word \"NationalSocialist\"was widely discussed and was recognized as a clear political program. The crowdof followers and members began to grow consistently. By the winter of 1920-1921,we were a strong party in Munich.Except for the Marxist parties, there was no other party at that time that couldhold such mass demonstrations as we did. The nationalist parties certainly couldnot. The MunichenerKindl Cellar, which held five thousand people, was filled tooverflowing more than once. There was only one meeting hall we had not yet daredto try, the Zirkus Krone (Crown Circus Hall).At the end of January, 1921, serious concerns arose again for Germany. The ParisAgreement was to become a reality by signing the London Ultimatum. According tothis, Germany had obligated herself to pay the insane sum of a hundred billiongold marks with this deal. (The London Ultimatum of 1921 eventually setGermany's war reparations at 132 Billion Marks and demanded the first billion tobe paid within 25 days.) A worker's coalition of socalled racialist societies,which existed for a long time in Munich, proposed sending out invitations for alarge general protest over the matter. Time was critical, and I became nervousafter seeing the constant hesitation and delays in their decisions. First, theytalked about a demonstration in the Konigsplatz (an open square or parade fieldin Munich), but they let it drop because they were afraid of being violentlyscattered by the Reds. Then they planned a protest demonstration in front of theField Marshals' Hall, but this was also canceled. Finally, they proposed a jointmeeting in the MunichenerKindl Cellar hall. Days went by, but the big partiesignored the planned protest and the workers' coalition itself could not decideon a definite date for the proposed demonstration.On Tuesday, February 1, 1921, I demanded a final decision be made urgently. Iwas put off until Wednesday. On Wednesday, I absolutely insisted on a clearstatement when and if the meeting was to take place. Again, the answer wasindefinite and evasive. The story was that they \"intended\" to turn out theworkers' coalition for a demonstration a week from Wednesday. I had lost allpatience, so I decided to carry out the protest demonstration by myself.On Wednesday afternoon, I dictated the wording for a poster to a typist in tenminutes and had the Zirkus Krone (Crown Circus) hired for the next day,Thursday, February 3.This was definitely a daring move. Not only was it questionable whether thegigantic room could be filled, but there was the further danger that the meetingwould be broken up. I feared our hall guard troops were not adequate for thishuge room, and I was unsure how to handle the situation if the meeting werebroken up. I expected it to be much more difficult to manage a large crowd inthe Circus building than in an ordinary hall. As it turned out, the opposite wastrue. In the giant room, it was actually easier to overpower a dispersion troopthan it was in closely-packed halls.One thing was for sure! Any failure could set us back for a long time. If theReds were successful just once in dispersing us, it would have destroyed ourimpression among the people and would have encouraged our adversaries to repeattheir success. It might have led to sabotaging our entire meeting activities. Itwould have taken many months and desperate battles to overcome such an incident.We only had one day for our posters to work, Thursday. Unfortunately, it rainedall morning, which made us reasonably afraid that the weather would cause manypeople to stay at home rather than hurry through rain and snow to a meetingwhere there might be violence and killings.Thursday morning, I felt fear suddenly set in. I was afraid the hall would notbe filled. If only a few people showed up, I would have looked like a fool inthe eyes of the workers' coalition. I hurriedly dictated a few leaflets with anappeal to attend the meeting and they were printed for distribution in theafternoon. The two trucks I hired were covered in as much red as possible. A fewof our flags were attached to them and each one was manned with fifteen ortwenty party members. They were ordered to drive around the streets of the citycontinuously throwing out leaflets and distributing propaganda for the massdemonstration that evening. It was the first time that trucks with flags hadever gone through the city with no Marxists on board. The mouths of theprivilegedclass fell open as they stared at the cars draped in red and decoratedwith fluttering swastika flags. In the outer districts where workers lived,countless clenched fists were raised by those who were obviously furious at thelatest \"provocation of the working class\". In their mind, only Marxism had theright to hold meetings and ride around on trucks.If these kinds of things were done by others, it was the Marxists' holy right toconsider it a provocation because, until now, they were the sole owners of thismonopoly.By 7:00 in the evening, the Circus was not filled. I received telephone reportsevery ten minutes and was uneasy about it because, by 7:00 or 7:15, the otherhalls were usually half filled or sometimes nearly completely filled. Soon thereason became clear. I had not counted on the new hall's huge size. A thousandpeople made the Hofbrauhaus Hall look like it was well-packed, while the Circushall simply swallowed up those thousand people. More encouraging reportsfollowed a little while later and by 7:45, they said that the hall wasthree-fourths full and there were more large crowds standing in front of theticket booths. Then I drove to the meeting hall.At 8:02 I arrived in front of the Circus hall. There was still a crowd of peoplein front. Some of them were just curious and many of them were opponents whopreferred to wait outside. When I went into the enormous hall, I was just asexcited as I had been the year before at the first meeting in the MunichHofbräuhaus Banquet Hall. Only after I squeezed my way through the wall ofpeople and reached the high platform did I see the full extent of theachievement. The meeting hall was in front of me like a giant shell and wasfilled with thousands and thousands of people. The center of the arena was sofilled that it appeared black with spectators. More than 5,600 tickets had beensold and if we count the total number of unemployed, poor students, and ourhall-guard troops, there must have been about 6,500 people there.My theme was \"Future or Downfall\". I could feel my heart leap with convictionbecause I saw that the future was right in front of me.I began and spoke for about two and a half hours. After the first half-hour, Iknew the meeting would be a great success. I made a connection with thesethousands of individuals. By the end of the first hour, the applause began tointerrupt me in growing spontaneous outbursts. After two hours, the applausebecame less frequent and led into that solemn stillness that I have experiencedso many times since then in that hall and which will never be forgotten by asingle person who was there. The breathing of the huge crowd was almost the onlything that could be heard. When I had spoken my last word, there was a suddenflood of emotion that found its outlet and its conclusion in a chorus ofDeutschland Über Alles, which the crowd sang with ultimate passion.I waited for almost twenty minutes watching the gigantic hall slowly empty andthe tremendous sea of people find their way out through the great central exit.Then I left my post extremely happy and went home.Photographs were taken of this first meeting in the Circus Hall at Munich. Theyshow the magnitude of the demonstration better than any words possibly could.Privilegedclass papers printed the photos and reports of the meeting but onlymentioned that it had been a \"nationalist\" demonstration and omitted the namesof those responsible for making it happen, in their usual modest fashion. Forthe first time, we advanced far beyond the confines of any of the ordinaryparties of the day. We could no longer be ignored. We did not want anyone tothink this meeting's success was an isolated stroke of good luck, so Iimmediately scheduled a second demonstration at the Circus for the followingweek. That meeting was a success just the same as before.Again the gigantic hall was filled to bursting with masses of people. I decidedto hold a third meeting on the same scale the following week. For the thirdtime, the giant Circus hall was jammed with people from top to bottom.After this successful beginning in 1921, we began holding more meetings inMunich. I now started to hold not just one a week, but in many weeks, two massmeetings. In midsummer and late fall, there were sometimes three meetings aweek. From now on, we always held our meetings in the Circus hall and found toour satisfaction that each evening was a similar success.The result was a constantly growing number of followers for the movement and agreat increase in registered members too. This success naturally kept ouropponents from getting any rest. Their tactics wavered between terrorism and aconspiracy of silence. In time they were forced to realize that they could nothinder the movement's development by either method. So, as a last supremeeffort, they decided on an act of terrorism they hoped would put a definite stopto any further meetings.As a show of force, there was a mysterious assault on a parliamentary deputy bythe name of Erhard Auer (a member of the Bavarian Parliament and the SocialDemocratic Party). He was allegedly shot at by somebody one evening. That is tosay, he was not actually shot, but an attempt had been made to shoot at him. Theoutstanding presence of mind and the proverbial courage of a Social Democraticparty leader thwarted the cunning attack and made those evil perpetrators whowere responsible run away in shame. They fled so fast and so far that the policewere never able to find the slightest trace of them. This mysterious occurrencewas now used by the Social Democratic party in Munich to arouse public sentimentagainst our movement in a most extreme way. They hinted at what was to happennext through their standard boisterous ramblings. Measures were taken to makesure we did not get out of hand, that our movement did not grow, and to makesure we were cut down to the root. They said the fists of the lower class wouldintervene in good time. Within a few days, the time for intervention arrived.The meeting in the Munich Hofbräuhaus Banquet Hall where I was to speak had beenchosen for their final settlement of accounts. On November 4, 1921, between 6:00and 7:00 in the evening, I received my first confirmation that the meeting woulddefinitely be broken up and that great masses of workers from some of the Redcontrolled factories were being sent to the meeting to disrupt the proceedings.It was a bit of misfortune that we did not receive this information earlier.That day, we had moved from our respected business office on Sternecker Lane inMunich and were in the process of moving to a new office space. Actually, wewere out of the old one, but could not move into the new one because work on itwas still in progress. The telephone had been pulled out of the old office andthe new office did not yet have a phone installed. There were a number ofattempts to inform us by telephone the day of the intended dispersion, but withno phone installed, they were in vain.As a result, we only had a very small number of hall-guard troops for protectionat the meeting. We had forty-six men to do the job of one hundred, and the alertsystem was not yet developed that could summon any considerable reinforcementsin only one hour at night. Besides, that kind of alarmist rumor had reached ourears countless times before without anything coming of it. The old saying that\"Announced revolutions seldom take place\" had always proved true in the past forus. So, for this reason, everything may not have been done that could haveprepared us for a dispersion with vicious determination.Previously, we believed the Munich Hofbräuhaus Banquet Hall was not well suitedto dispersion tactics. We were more concerned about it in the largest halls,particularly the Circus. In that respect, the Circus taught us a valuablelesson. Afterward, we studied the entire security question with a morescientific method and arrived at some surprising and interesting results. Theseresults had fundamental importance later in the organization and in the tacticalmanagement of our Storm Troops.When I came into the lobby of the Hofbräuhaus at 7:45, however, there could beno doubt about their intentions. The hall was overcrowded and for that reasonthe outside doors were closed by the police and no one else was allowed in. Theopponents, who had come very early, were inside the hall and our followers weremostly outside. The little Storm Troop waited for me in the lobby. I had theinside doors to the big hall closed and then I lined up the forty-five orforty-six men. I told the young men that today, for the first time, they wouldprobably have to be true to the movement no matter what. I told them that noneof us must leave the hall unless we were carried out dead. I would stay in thehall and did not believe that a single one of them would desert me.However, if I saw anyone turn into a coward, I would personally tear off hisarmband and take his badge. Then, I instructed them to rush in at the slightestattempt to break up the meeting and to remember that the best defense is anattack. A triple \"Heil\" which sounded rougher and more hoarse than usual was theanswer.Then, I entered the hall and looked over the situation with my own eyes. Theywere packed inside, and from where they were sitting they tried to drill into mewith their eyes. Countless faces were looking at me with grim hatred, whileothers had mocking frowns and emitted shouts that were very clear.They would say, \"We'll finish you today\", and that we should \"Look out for ourguts\", and that they would \"Stop our mouths for good\", and various other prettyphrases. They were aware of their superior force and felt strong.Nevertheless, it was possible to open the meeting and I began to speak. In theHofbräuhaus Banquet Hall, I always stood against one of the long walls of thehall and my platform was a beer table. So, I was actually in the very middle ofthe crowd. Maybe that was one reason why there was always an attitude ofcamaraderie in this particular hall that I have never found anywhere else.In front of me, and especially to my left, there were nothing but opponentssitting and standing. They were extremely tough men and youths, mainly from theMaffei locomotive works, from Kustermann and the Isaria works, etc. Along theleft wall of the hall, they had moved close to my table and they now began tocollect beer mugs. That is, they kept ordering beer and putting the empty mugsunder the table. They gathered whole batteries of them. (A Battery is a group ofsimilar things placed together to be used.) I would have been surprised if thismeeting had gone off smoothly. I was able to speak for about an hour and a halfdespite all the heckling and, at this point, it almost seemed as if I wouldremain in control of the situation. The leaders of the dispersion troops seemedto feel this themselves and they became more and more uneasy. They kept goingout and coming back in, then talking very nervously to their people. But then, Icommitted a small psychological error in trying to prevent an interruption whensomeone shouted. I realized it the moment it was out of my mouth; I had giventhe signal for them to cut loose.There were a few angry shouts, then a man suddenly jumped on a chair and yelledinto the hall, \"Freedom!\" This was the battle-cry of the Social Democrats. Onthe signal, the fighters for freedom began their work.Within a few seconds, the whole hall was filled with a roaring and screamingmob. Countless beer mugs flew like howitzer shots over their heads.Chair legs were cracking, mugs were smashing, and there were groans, screaming,and shouting. It was an insane uproar. I stood still where I was and could seemy young men doing their duty to the utmost. I would have liked to have seen aprivilegedclass meeting in that situation! The game had not started when myStorm Troopers, as they were called from that day forward, attacked. In packs ofeight or ten, they fell like wolves on their enemies and gradually began tohammer them out of the hall. Within five minutes, most of them were streamingwith blood. In that moment I came to really know many of them for the firsttime. At the top was my faithful Maurice, my present private secretary, Hess,and many others, who, although severely wounded, continued their attack as longas they could stay on their feet. (Maurice is Emil Maurice, a watchmaker. As hissecretary, Hitler dictated part of Mein Kampf to him as they both served time inprison together.) The hellish turmoil lasted twenty minutes. By then, my men,numbering less than fifty, had almost finished pounding seven or eight hundredenemies out of the hall and down the stairs. In the left rear corner of thehall, a large group held out, resisting desperately. Suddenly, there were twopistol shots from the entrance towards the platform. Then a wild flurry ofgunshots began.My heart leapt as memories of the old war flooded to me.From then on, there was no way to tell who was doing the shooting. The onlything I can say is from that moment on, the rage of my bleeding young menincreased tremendously. Finally, the last troublemakers were overpowered anddriven from the hall.About twenty-five minutes had passed. The hall looked as if an artillery shellhad burst in it. Many of my followers were being bandaged and others had to betaken away in cars, but we remained masters of the situation. Hermann Esser, whohad taken over as chairman of the meeting that night, said, \"The meeting willcontinue. The speaker has the floor\". I resumed speaking.After we had terminated the meeting, an excited police lieutenant suddenlyrushed in madly waving his arms and bragged to the hall, \"This meeting isdissolved\". I could not help laughing at this come-lately straggler who had sucha true policeman's ego. The smaller they are, the bigger they want to appear.We learned a great deal that evening, as did our adversaries. Until the fall of1923, the Münchener Post did not warn us again about the fists of the workingclass. (The Münchener Post, Munich Post, had a long running campaign againstHitler and closely followed the Nazi party but did not focus on their politics.)8. THE STRONG MAN IS MIGHTIEST WHEN ALONE"},{"pageContent":"I have already mentioned the existence of a worker's coalition ofGerman-racialist societies and will take this opportunity to briefly discuss theproblem presented by these worker's coalitions.When we say worker's coalition, we mean that a number of worker societies enterinto a certain mutual relationship to assist them in carrying out their work.They chose a common leadership of lesser or greater authority and plan thingstogether. This means the clubs, societies, or parties must always have similaraims and do things in a similar way. The ordinary average citizen is pleased andreassured when they learn that the societies who form such a working coalitionhave found their \"points of agreement\" and \"put aside their differences\". Thegeneral belief is that such a union means a huge increase in strength, and thatthe smaller groups who would be weak on their own suddenly become a power to bereckoned with. But this is usually not the case.It is interesting and I think important if we are to properly understand thisquestion, to clearly look at how the formation of these societies, groups,coalitions, etc., all claiming to pursue the same end, can come together at all.It would be logical for one issue to be supported by just one society. It doesnot seem reasonable for several societies to work for the same end. Undoubtedly,that end was originally envisioned by just one society. Somewhere, a manproclaims a truth, summons people to solve a certain problem, sets a goal, andforms a movement to make his purpose a reality.This is how a club or a party is founded so that it can eliminate existing evilsor to achieve a certain state of affairs in the future.When such a movement comes into existence, it has a certain right of priority.It is obvious that everyone who intends to work for the same end should take hisplace in the movement to strengthen it and better serve the common purpose.Every intellectually alert mind should consider joining this group asindispensable to the real success of the common struggle of the group.Therefore, assuming they are reasonable and possess a certain degree of honesty,there should be only one movement for one goal. I will prove this later.There are two reasons why forming a coalition does not gain a small groupstrength. The first one, I might almost call tragic, and the second one ispitiful and is to be found in human weakness itself. But the bottom line is thatI see both as elements capable of strengthening the will, its energy andintensity, and can make a solution to the problem possible. The tragic reasonwhy there is usually more than one society trying to solve a given problem isthat any really large achievement on this earth is generally the fulfillment ofa wish that has been around for a long time and has been in the hearts ofmillions of men. In fact, it may be that the problem has been around forcenturies and people are moaning and groaning over the intolerable condition,but the desire for change remains unfulfilled. Nations that can no longer findany heroic solution for such distress may be described as feeble andunproductive. However, the best proof of a people's strength and of its beingfated to survive is the fact that one day, Fate grants it the brilliant man whocan fulfill their long held desire. It may be the release from some greatoppression, elimination of bitter distress, or contentment of the people's soulwhich has become restless from their insecurity.Great questions of our time naturally lead thousands in their attempt to takepart in the solution. Many feel called upon and Fate nominates several choiceswho are tested by natural forces which only gives victory to the strongest andmost capable and entrusts him with the solution to the problem.There may be a people who are dissatisfied for centuries with their religiouslife and long for a revival. Because of this spiritual pressure, dozens of menarise who believe they are chosen to relieve this religious distress throughtheir insight and their knowledge, either as prophets of a new teaching or asfighters against an existing one.Here too, the strongest man who is selected by forces of natural order findshimself fated to carry out the great mission, but the knowledge that he alone iscalled remain unknown to others until much later. On the contrary, they regardthemselves as equally entitled to and equally chosen to accomplish this task,and these contemporaries are unable to distinguish the one man among them who issupremely gifted and deserves their sole support, until the very end.Over the course of centuries or sometimes within a single era, various men ariseand start movements to fight for aims which are the same, or at least are feltto be the same by the great masses. The people have vague desires and generalconvictions so they cannot clearly understand the real nature of a goal, orfully comprehend their own wishes, or even envision how the goal could beachieved.The tragedy is that all those men are striving toward a single goal by takingdifferent roads without knowing or working with any of the others pursuing thesame goal. Therefore, with the purest faith in their own mission, they think itis their duty to go their own way alone.What at first seems tragic is that such movements, parties, or religious groups,etc., are created independently of each other, from some universal desire oftheir time, and they all work in a single direction toward the same goal bydifferent paths. Too many people believe that combining the strength used by thegroups traveling down different roads into one unified journey would be morecertain to bring success and bring it faster. But this is not the case. Natureherself, using pitiless logic, decides who succeeds by putting the variousgroups in competition with one another and forcing them to struggle for victory.Then, she leads the movement that has chosen the clearest, shortest, and surestroad to success to its final goal. The choice between the right or wrongdirection can never be decided if the various groups are not allowed to competefreely. The final decision of victory is not in the hands of inflexible humanknow-it-alls; the decision is left to that most dependable proof---the proof wesee through success---and success is what always verifies the justice of anaction.If various groups are marching on separate roads toward the same goal, they willcompare their efforts and methods to their competitors. This forces them to testthe quality of their own path more thoroughly, shorten it if possible, and drawon their deepest energy to arrive at the goal sooner. This contest improves thebreed of the individual fighter. Mankind frequently owes its successes tolessons learned from the mistakes of failed past attempts. What at first mayseem like a tragic disjunction, this separation of individual efforts is nowrecognized as the means that eventually produces the best course and leads tovictory.We can see there was a common opinion in our history that the two possible pathsfor a solution to German problems should have been united from the beginning.These paths are the policies of Austria and Prussia, and their ruling houses,Hapsburg and Hohenzollern. According to this opinion, one road or the othershould have been followed by uniting their forces. If that had been done, theroad of the party that was the most impressive would have been chosen, thatwould be Austria. However, the Austrian purpose would never have led to a GermanEmpire.The strongest unified Empire of Germany rose from the very thing that millionsof Germans despised with all their heart and that same thing which was the finaland most frightening result of our internal strife. The German Imperial Crownwas brought home from the battlefield of Königgrätz (which was a decisive 1866battle in the Austrian-Prussian war where Prussia defeated Austria; the battleis named for the Czech city ) and not from the battles before Paris as mostpeople thought (this means the real victor between these two ideas or methodswas decided in Königgrätz and not in later, smaller battles). The founding ofthe German Empire was not the result of common intent pursued along a commonroad, but the result of a conscious, and sometimes an unconscious, struggle fordominance by separate interests. From this struggle, Prussia eventually emergedvictorious. Anyone whose political affiliation does not blind him to the truthmust agree that the socalled wisdom of men would never have made the same wisedecision that was made by the wisdom of life. Two hundred years ago, who in theGerman lands would seriously have believed that the Prussia of theHohenzollerns, and not the House of Hapsburg, would someday be the nucleus, thefounder, and the teacher of the new German Empire? On the other hand, who todaywould deny that Fate made a better choice, which it did. Who could imagine therebeing a German Empire at all if it were based on the principles of a decadent,cowardly, and degenerate Austrian dynasty? After centuries of struggle, naturalconflict finally put the best man in the position he had earned.That will always be and it will eternally remain as it has always been. For thatreason, there should be no regret when different people take separate roads fora single goal. The strongest and swiftest will be recognized and will become thevictor.There is also a second reason why similar movements try to reach similar goalsby different methods. This reason is not tragic but is totally pitiful. Itoriginates in the sorry mixture of envy, jealousy, ambition, and a desire totake what belongs to others. This kind of ambition is unfortunately often foundin individual members of the human race.Whenever a man steps out of the crowd who understands fully the nature of thedisease suffered by his people, he realizes their distress and seriouslyattempts to alleviate it; at the moment he envisions a goal and chooses the roadthat may lead to that goal, all the critical people turn their ears toward himand enthusiastically track the actions of this man who has drawn the public eye.These people are just like sparrows watching a more fortunate bird who has founda piece of bread. They seem to be uninterested, yet they keep a vigilant watchto steal his crumb at the first unguarded moment. A man only has to place onefoot on a new road and immediately many lazy loafers become alert, sensing someprofitable tidbit that may be at the end of that road.The moment they have found out where their prize is hidden, they eagerly set outto reach the goal by another and, if possible, quicker road.Once the new movement has been founded and it has established a definiteprogram, these people rise up and claim they are fighting for the same cause,but they don't do this in an honest way by joining the ranks of the movement andacknowledging its priority. Instead, they steal the program and start a newparty of their own. They are bold enough to tell their unthinking contemporariesthat they had the same idea long before the other man. They are frequentlysuccessful in showing themselves in a favorable light instead of attracting theuniversal contempt they deserve. It is disrespectful for a man to write downanother's idea and claim it as his own, or to steal the basic points fromanother's program and then pretend it was his own creation. This disrespect canbe clearly seen among those who originally caused the division by forming theirseparate new organization. When they think the adversary has too big of a headstart to catch up, that is when they shout the loudest about the need forharmony and unity. The current \"racialist disunity\" is due to this exactprocess.It is true that the formation of a whole series of groups, parties, etc.,described as racialist resulted entirely from the natural development of affairsin 1918-1919 and the founders of these were not at any fault for theirmovement's creation. As early as 1920, the NSDAP had definitely surfaced as thevictorious party among them all. Nothing was more brilliant or fundamentallyhonest than the decisions of the various founders of other parties when theymade the truly admirable decision to sacrifice their own, obviously lesssuccessful movements, to the stronger one and dissolve their smaller groups orunconditionally incorporate them into the larger.This is particularly true of the leader of the then German Socialist Party inNuremberg, Julius Streicher, who was also a school teacher in Nuremberg.( Julius Streicher published an antiSemitic newspaper of offensive cartoons andantiSemitic children's books. Streicher had his own personal followers andmerged them with the Nazi party. He also participated in the failed 1923Putsch.) Our NSDAP and his German Socialist Party had been founded with the sameultimate aims, but they were founded completely independently. At first, he toowas filled with holy conviction for his movement's mission and future. But assoon as he saw clearly and beyond any doubt that the greater strength andswifter growth of the NSDAP had made it the mightier force, he discontinued hisactivity for the German Socialist Party and the worker's coalition. He urged hisfollowers to take their places in the NSDAP, which had emerged victorious fromthe struggle, and to go on fighting for the common aim within its ranks. Thiswas a difficult thing to do but this decision was totally honorable on his part.No division remains from these early days of the movement. The honest will andintent of those men led almost without exception to an honorable, upright, andproper outcome. What is now called \"racialist disunity\" owes its existenceexclusively to the second cause I have explained. It is created by ambitious menwho never had any ideas or goals of their own, yet felt \"called upon\" preciselyat the moment they saw the undeniable truth that the NSDAP's success hadmatured.Suddenly, political programs emerged that were outright copies of ours. Ideaswere circulated that had been borrowed from us; aims were set up that we foughtfor years earlier; paths were chosen that the NSDAP had already traveled. Theytried every way possible to explain why they felt compelled to establish thesenew parties, despite the longexisting NSDAP, but the more noble they claimedtheir motives were, the more dishonorable these masquerades became.In reality, only one reason drove their actions. This reason was the personalambition of the founders who wanted to play a role their own smallness did notallow them to otherwise play. The only ability they had was the great boldnessto take the ideas of others, a boldness that in ordinary civil life is usuallycalled stealing.There was no idea or concept created by others that one of these politicalkleptomaniacs did not soon collect for his new business. The people who did thiswere the same ones who later tearfully moaned about the \"racialist disunity\" andtalked constantly about the \"necessity of unity\" in the secret hope that theycould make others so weary of the constant theft accusations and protests, thattheir counterparts would throw the thieves not only the ideas they had created,but the entire movements meant to carry them out.But if the thieves did not succeed in that endeavor, and if the profits of theirnew enterprise failed to keep up with expectations because of the inferiorintellect of the owners, they often sold out cheaper and were satisfied if theyended up in one of the socalled worker coalitions.At this time, all those leaders who could not stand on their own feet unitedinto these worker coalitions in the belief that eight lame men, arm in arm,would create one big gladiator. If there were one healthy man among the lameones, he needed all his strength to keep the others on their feet and ended upparalyzed himself.Joining such worker coalitions must always be regarded as a question of tactics,but at the same time we must never lose sight of the following basic conclusion:The formation of a worker coalition never turns weak organizations into strongones, but it can and frequently will weaken a strong organization. The beliefthat a strong unit must result from the union of weak groups is mistaken. Anymajority under any conditions has been shown by experience to be the embodimentof incompetence and cowardice so that any group of societies, if they are ruledby an elected governing body of several persons from their own membership,yields to cowardice and weakness. This sort of union also prevents the free playof natural forces, halts the struggle that selects the best man, and foreverprevents the healthier and stronger from achieving the necessary and finalvictory. Such unions are enemies of natural development. They usually interferefar more with the process of finding a solution than they strengthen it.For purely tactical reasons, the supreme leadership of a movement, with theirattention focused on the future goals of the organization, will form someagreement with a similar group on certain questions for a very short time, andwill even agree to participate in joint activities or meetings. But this cannever lead to a longterm association unless the movement is planning to abandonits mission of salvation. Once it is entangled in such a coupling, it loses theopportunity and the right to use its strength to the fullest, to claim its placethrough natural development, to overcome its rivals, and to reach its goal asthe one and only victor.It must never be forgotten that nothing truly great in the world has ever beenachieved by an alliance. It has always been through the triumph of theindividual. The very origin of joint forces carries with it the germ of its ownlater decay. Great intellectual revolutions that shake up the world are onlyconceivable and only possible when they are monumental struggles by individualsand never when they are enterprises of coalitions.Above all, the new racebased state will never be created by the compromisingindecisiveness of a racialist worker-coalition, but only by the iron will of asingle movement that has fought its way through all that opposed it.9. BASIC THOUGHTS ON THE MEANING AND ORGANIZATION OF THE STORM TROOPSThe strength of the old State rested on three pillars: the Monarchy form ofgovernment, the civil administrative bodies, and the army. The Revolution of1918 did away with the Monarchy, weakened the army, and brought party corruptionto the civil administrative bodies. With that, the fundamental supports of anystate authority were smashed to bits. These supports almost always depend onthree elements---the same elements that are the fundamental base for allauthority.The first requirement for the creation of authority is popular support. However,if authority depends solely on this foundation, it is shaky, unreliable, andweak. Everyone who is supported by popularity alone must aim at improving andstrengthening this authority through the generation of power. Power, through theuse of force, is the second fundamental for authority. Authority through poweris more stable and reliable, but not always stronger than authority throughpopularity. If popularity and power are combined and they can survive togetherfor a certain time, then that authority may form an even stronger basis, theauthority of tradition. If popularity, power and tradition are united, authoritycan be considered unshakable.The Revolution destroyed all authority by tradition. Tradition was rudely torndown with the breakup of the old Reich, the removal of the Monarchy form ofstate, and the annihilation of its symbols of former grandeur. The result was aheavy blow to state authority.Even the second pillar of state authority, power, was no longer present. Inorder to carry through the Revolution at all, it was necessary to remove theorganized force and power of the State, which was the army. They had to usepieces torn from the army as the fighting element of the revolution. Althoughthe armies from the front had not been effected by this destruction, the acid ofdisorganization in the homeland still started to eat away at them when theyreturned from the fields of glory and left their heroic battle behind. Thebattle had lasted four and a half years, and their journey ended once theyarrived at the garrisons for their discharge papers, and they were faced withthe confusion of voluntary obedience, as it was called, imposed in the era ofsoldier selfgovernment through the Soldiers' Councils.No authority could be built from this collection of mutiny-minded soldiers whoconsidered military service as an eight-hour day job. Therefore, the secondelement that guaranteed security for authority was also lost. This leaves theRevolution with only the original one, popularity, on which to build up itsauthority. This basis was very unreliable. The Revolution succeeded inshattering the old state structure with a single, mighty thrust and this waspossible for only one reason. The normal structural balance of our people wasabolished by the war.Every national body can be divided into three classes. First, there is the bestof mankind who are good because they possess strong civil virtues and areespecially distinguished by courage and take pleasure in self sacrifice. Second,and at the other extreme, are the worst scum of mankind who are bad in the sensethat they exist to indulge in every selfish impulse and vice. Between the twoextremes lies a third class. This is the large, most broad group that exhibitsneither a gleaming heroism nor a mean criminal temper.When a national body experiences a period of distinct rise, it occurs onlythrough the absolute leadership of the extreme best part of the national body.Periods marked by a normal, steady development or by a stable condition existwhen the middle element is dominant and the two extremes maintain an equalbalance that cancels each other out. A period ending in the collapse of anational body will certainly result from the work of the worst elements.It is remarkable to note that the broad mass, the middle group as I call them,makes their presence known only if the two extremes come into conflict.The middle group will then submit to whichever extreme wins. If the best groupdominates, the broad mass will follow them. If the worst group wins, the middlegroup will, at the least, not resist. The intermediate mass will never fight forthemselves.Four and a half years of war---with all its bloody events---disturbed theequilibrium of these three groups. This happened because of the massivesacrifice made by the middle group. This bloodbath almost completely wiped outthe best men. The irreplaceable blood these German heroes shed during these fourand a half years was a horrible loss. There were hundreds of thousands who gaveup their lives. Volunteers were requested in every area: volunteers for thefront, volunteers for patrols, volunteers as spies, volunteers forcommunications, volunteers for construction, volunteers for the Uboats,volunteers for aviation, volunteers for the storm battalions, and so forth,again and again for four-and-ahalf years on thousands of occasions, volunteersand more volunteers. And one saw the same result every time: only the veryyoung, even beardless boys, or the very old men stepped forward.They were the ones filled with passionate love for the Fatherland and theyvolunteered for these duties with great, personal courage and with a strongsense of duty. This was repeated tens and hundreds of thousands of times until,gradually, this part of the human species grew scarcer and scarcer.Those who did not either die or become crippled soon joined their ranks becauseof the wounds they received as a result of the dwindling supply of replacementsoldiers. The most important thing to consider is that in 1914, the whole armywas made up of volunteers who, thanks to the criminal corruption of ourparliamentary donothings, had received no real peacetime training for war andwere handed over to the enemy as defenseless men. The four hundred thousand whofell or were permanently maimed at the battle of Flanders could not be replaced.Their loss was more than just a loss of numbers.The death of these willing volunteers caused the scale's balance to shift. Nowwe had too little weight on the good side and too much weight on the bad side.The hostile, vile, and cowardly elements in this mass of the worst extremebecame dominant. Add to that the fact that not only did the best extreme groupbecome thinned out on the battlefield in the most horrible way for four and ahalf years, but the worst group was protected in the most remarkable way. Forevery volunteer hero who climbed the steps to Valhalla by their holy sacrificeof death, there was a wretched coward who very cautiously turned his back ondeath so he could prove his usefulness in the homeland by taking the place ofthe volunteers now serving in battle.The end of the war presented the following picture. The broad, middle groupappropriately sacrificed its share of blood. The best extreme group sacrificeditself with its typical heroism. The worst extreme was unfortunately preserved,completely intact because it was protected by the most stupid of laws and by thefailure to enforce the Articles of War.This well-preserved scum of our nation created the Revolution. It was able to doso because there was no one left to oppose them. The extreme of the best grouphad ceased to exist. The German Revolution depended on one remaining part of thepopulation. It was not the German people who were guilty of this act of murderagainst their brother like Cain, but the idiot riffraff of worthless desertersand pimps, etc.The man at the front was happy to see an end to the bloody fight so he couldreturn home to his wife and children. He personally had nothing to do with theRevolution itself. He did not like it, and he liked its activists and organizerseven less. In four and a half years of the hardest fighting, he had forgottenthe political party hyenas. Their bickering had become foreign to him.The Revolution was only popular with a small part of the German people. Thosewere the supporters who had chosen a knapsack as the distinguishing sign ofhonorable citizens in this new State (possibly meaning pillagers wanting to filltheir knapsack with spoils). Some misguided people believe that these crooksstarted the Revolution for its own sake, but it was actually because they wantedwhat would result.These Marxist pirates had difficulty maintaining an authority that depended onpopularity alone, and they knew it would not last very long. The young Republicneeded authority immediately and at any cost. Otherwise, after a short period ofchaos, it would suddenly be entangled again with another governmental authoritylinked together out of the last remnants of the extreme good group of ourpeople.Every supporter of the Revolution was very afraid that in the storm of the chaosthey created, their toehold in the position of power would be lost and theywould suddenly be captured by a bold iron fist which would place them on a lowerfooting. This has happened more than once in similar circumstances throughouthistory. The Republic had to consolidate at any cost. Immediately, the shakyfoundation of its weak authority, based in popularity, forced it to again createan organization of power so that it would have a more solid foundation ofauthority.During December 1918 and January-February of 1919, the matadors of theRevolution felt the ground wobbling under their feet. They were looking for menwho would be ready to use force to strengthen their weak position, which wassupported only by the love of their people. The \"anti-military\" Republic neededsoldiers. The first and only support for their government authority, theirpopularity, was rooted in a society of pimps, thieves, burglars, deserters,cowards, etc., and all those whom we must designate as the worst extreme group.Therefore, finding men from this group who were ready to sacrifice their ownlives in the service of the new ideal was Love's Labor Lost; it was impossible.(Love's Labor Lost is the title of a Shakespeare comedy which came from a Greekpoem that says, \"To do good to one's enemies is love's labor lost\". Doing goodto your enemies is futile, and here it is meant as an expression of futility.)The people who made the revolutionary idea a reality were not ready or capableof inviting the existing soldiers to protect them.This group did not want to risk forming a republican government, but wanted tomaintain the disorganization of the existing state so they could indulge intheir own desires. Their call was not for order and establishment of the GermanRepublic, but for the plundering of it.Therefore, the cries for help by the leaders, in their mortal terror, wentunheeded by this group of thugs. The cries instead aroused disgust andbitterness. They saw it as a breach of their leader's loyalty and faith in theirown group of criminals. The leaders' authority was comfortably resting onpopularity, but the group feared that once the leaders gained the strength ofpower, not just popularity, that this new formation of authority would be thebeginning of a battle against those features cherished the most by theRevolution: against their right of theft and the immoral reign of a horde ofthieves, plunderers, and trash, a reign by those who had recently been releasedfrom their prison shackles, in short, the evil mob would lose its control. Nomatter how much the leaders yelled, no one came from their own ranks. The callof \"traitor\" revealed the thoughts from the group that created their popularity.Countless young Germans found themselves ready for the first time to put on theuniform and steel-helmet, shoulder carbines and rifles so they might defend\"Peace and Order\" for the destroyers of their homeland. As volunteers, theyformed volunteer corps and although they hated the Revolution bitterly, theybegan to defend and strengthen this Revolution. They did this with the best ofintentions.The organizer of the Revolution, and the actual puppeteer, was the internationalJew who sized up the situation correctly when he saw the German people were notyet ripe enough to be pulled into the blood swamp of Bolshevism, as happened inRussia. This was due to the closer racial unity of the German intellectuals andthe German laborer. Mass education across all social classes, like what we findin other Western European countries, also played a part in Germany's unity, butsuch education was not present in Russia. In Russia, the intellectuals were noteven of Russian nationality or at least did not have the character of the Slavicrace. This created a thin intellectual layer in Russia at that time which couldbe replaced easily because there was no connecting middle layer to unify theintelligentsia and the masses of the Russian people. The spiritual and moralfiber of the great masses was horribly low.When the revolutionaries succeeded in Russia by provoking the uneducated massesagainst the thin intellectual upper layer, which was entirely foreign to themasses and had no connection with them, in that instant, the fate of Russia wasdecided and the revolution was successful. The Russian illiterate became adefenseless slave of the Jewish dictators. These dictators, however, were cleverenough to call this dictatorship a \"Dictatorship of the People\".In Germany, there was another factor that affected the outcome. The gradualdeterioration of the army is what made it possible for the Revolution to besuccessful in Germany. This deterioration was not caused by the soldiers at thefront. This was the work of the riffraff, that lowest group, that hid from thelight and spent their time either loafing around in home-based militarygarrisons or working in the homeland somewhere because they were \"unfit\" forduty.This home-army was strengthened by tens of thousands of deserters who were ableto turn their backs on the battlefront without risk. (German soldiers did desertin the thousands near the end of the First World War and many surrendered toescape the war.) The real coward fears nothing more than death itself. At thefront, he faced death day after day in a thousand forms. If you want weak,indecisive, or even cowardly fellows to do their duty, then there is only onepossibility. The deserter must realize that his desertion will always result inwhat he is trying to escape. At the front, you may die. If you desert, you mustdie. This severe threat is the only way to halt every attempt to abandon thecolors, and this was the only way that weak individuals and the masses could beprevented from deserting. This is the true meaning and purpose behind theintroduction of the Articles of War which repealed the death penalty.It is a noble idea that the struggle for a people's existence could be fought byrelying solely on the voluntary loyalty born of and preserved by the knowledgethat their actions were a necessity. The voluntary willingness to fulfill a dutyhas always guided the best among men, but never the average man. Therefore, lawslike those against theft are necessary. They were not made for the genuinelyhonest man, but for the weak and unpredictable elements of the population. Bytheir warning to the evildoers, such laws are intended to prevent a situationwhere the honest man is considered stupid and where the advantage is assumed tobe with one who believes it is better to participate in robbery than to stand byemptyhanded or even allow oneself to be robbed. It was a mistake to believe abattle could go on for years and that those time-tested methods, which wereproven over hundreds of years, could be pushed aside when those methods aloneare able to force weak and withdrawn people to do their duty even in mostserious times and in moments which are the greatest test of nerves.The hero who volunteered needed no threats of the death penalty. Those wereneeded for the selfish coward who values his own life more than his country whenhis people need him. This kind of spineless weakling can only be protected frombecoming a victim of his own cowardice by the harshest penalty. It is onlythrough the ruthless application of the death penalty that an unreliable fellowcan be kept at his post when men around him are constantly fighting againstdeath. They often must hold out for weeks in slimy shell craters with the worstpossible food. Threats of prison or even hard labor mean nothing to him. Heknows from experience that prison is a thousand times safer than thebattlefield. In prison, at least, his \"priceless\" life is not threatened.It was a terrible mistake to eliminate the death penalty during a time of Warand to initiate the Articles of War. When they were passed, in 1918, an army ofdeserters erupted from the troops, filling the military prisons that were safelybehind the lines, and many took trains to return home. They helped form thatlarge, criminal organization which suddenly appeared before us after November 7,1918 as the Revolution.The soldiers at the front were really not involved at all. All those at thefront longed for peace, but in this desire for peace, there was a danger to theRevolution. After the Armistice, the German armies began returning home whichforced the worried revolutionaries to ask only one question: \"What will thefront-line troops do when they return? Will the field-gray tolerate what we havedone?\" During those weeks, the Revolution in Germany had to appear moderate, atleast on the outside, otherwise it would face the danger of being suddenlydestroyed by a few German divisions. If, at that time, a single divisioncommander had decided to pull down the Red rag with his loyal division and tostand the Revolution leaders up against the wall, and he was willing to breakdown any possible opposition with trench-mortars and hand-grenades, thisdivision would have grown to an army of sixty divisions in less than four weeks.The puppeteer Jews were more afraid of this than of anything else. In order toavoid this, the Revolution had to present an appearance that made them looksomewhat moderate. It could not be allowed to degenerate into full Bolshevism.It had to imitate \"Peace and Good Order\". This is what was responsible for thenumerous great concessions and the appeal to the old civil officials and to theold army leaders. They were still needed, for the time being at least. Onlyafter the old officials had served their purpose as Turk's Heads and had donetheir duty could the revolutionaries risk giving them the kick they deserved andtake the Republic out of the hands of the old servants of the State and deliverit to the claws of the revolutionary vultures. (Turk's Head is a type ofdecorative knot; here it means the government officials were kept asdecoration.) They hoped to fool old generals and old state officials in this wayand disarm any opposition against them before it started with a disguise ofinnocence and mildness on the new political situation. The facts of how itturned out show how successful this was.The Revolution had not been created by elements who were driven by peace andorder, but elements motivated by riot, theft, and plunder. For these ruffians,the direction the Revolution was developing in did not match their own desires,and it was impossible to explain the tactical reasons in a way that would makethese decisions clear and acceptable to the ruffian crowd.As the power of Social Democratic Party gradually increased, it lost more andmore of its character as a brutal revolutionary party. They never had any othergoal besides creating a revolution and its leaders had no other aim. But whatfinally resulted was just the intention for revolution and a group that was nolonger capable of actually making it happen. A party of ten million members canno longer carry out a Revolution. When a movement reaches this stage, it is nolonger a group from the extreme of the population, but now it contains the broadmass of the middle group, which is nothing more than a burden because they areinactive.Even during the war, the Jews realized the masses were weighing down the partyand that is when the famous split of the Social Democratic Party took place.While the Social Democratic Party, filled with the inactive masses of thepopulation, clung like a dead weight to the national defense forces, the radicalactivist elements were extracted from the party and were formed into strongerattack troops. This formed the Independent Socialist Party and the SpartacistLeague which were the storm troops of revolutionary Marxism. (The SpartacistLeague was a revolutionary Marxist group named after Spartacus, leader of theslave uprising.) They had to prepare the ground for the masses of the SocialDemocratic Party, which had already been in training for decades, so they couldtake their positions. The cowardly privilegedclass was correctly assessed byMarxism and treated like the scum of the earth. The Marxists did not care howthe privilegedclass was treated because they realized the dog-like submissiveobedience of the political structure, which consisted of an old obsoletegeneration, would never be capable of serious opposition anyway.After the Revolution succeeded and the main supports of the old State werebroken, the soldiers returning from the front suddenly appeared like a menacingsphinx and the brakes had to be applied in stopping the natural development ofthe Revolution. (Here, Sphinx means a mysterious person or more specificallythat the intentions of the returning troops were unknown.) The greater part ofthe Social Democratic Party had taken over their newlywon official positions andthe Independent and Spartacist storm battalions were pushed aside. However, thisdid not happen without a battle.The angry ruffian masses were not alone because these activist attack troops ofthe Revolution felt they too had been deceived. They were not satisfied with theresults of the Revolution and they wanted to continue the attack on their own.Their uncontrolled brawling was becoming unpleasant even for those who pulledthe strings of the Revolution. The collapse had just barely taken place when twocamps became clearly defined. One was the party of peace and order and the otherwas the group of bloody terror. What could be more natural than for ourprivilegedclass to immediately move into the camp of peace and order and flytheir banners there? Now, all of a sudden, these disgraceful politicalorganizations act like they might do something.They had already found the ground prepared for them so that they might gain afooting on it. They had reached some level of solidarity with the power whichthey hated, but they feared this power even more. The political Germanprivilegedclass had received the high honor of being able to seat themselves atone table with the three-times-damned Marxist leaders in order to fight theBolshevists.In December, 1918, and January, 1919, the following situation arose: TheRevolution was carried out by a minority of the worst elements, which all theMarxist parties immediately supported. The Revolution then stamped itself sothat it appeared as moderate, which aroused the hostility of the fanaticextremists. The extremists began to throw around hand grenades and to fire offmachine guns, occupying public buildings, and generally threatening the moderateRevolution.In order to put these developments in check, a truce was declared between thesupporters of the new government and the supporters of the old regime so thatthey could fight against the extremists together. This resulted in the enemiesof the Republic setting aside their battle with the Republic so that they couldjoin forces and subdue those who were also enemies of the Republic, but wereenemies for different reasons. This also resulted in avoiding the danger of abattle between the defenders of the old State and those of the new state. Thisfact cannot be emphasized too much. Nine-tenths of the population did not carryout a revolution, seven-tenths of them rejected it, and six-tenths hated it.Only he who understands this chain of events realizes how it is possible forone-tenth of the people to force a revolution.Gradually the Spartacist barricade-fighters began to bleed out one side, whilethe nationalist patriots and idealists began to bleed out the other side as theyfought each other. These two extremes soon wore each other down until the massof the middle group came out victorious. The privilegedclass and Marxism foundthemselves on the ground of common accomplishment and the Republic began toconsolidate. This did not prevent the privilegedclass parties, especially beforeelections, from quoting monarchist ideas for some time afterwards. They wantedto be able to conjure up the spirits of the past and, at the same time, renewthe smaller spirits of their disciples so they could continue to keep theirfollowers in their net.This was not very honest. Secretly, in their hearts, all of them had broken awayfrom the Monarchy a long time ago and the filth of the new state also began tomake its seductive effects felt in the camp of the privilegedclass party. Theordinary privilegedclass politician feels more at home today in the mire ofRepublic corruption than in the clean and decent condition he dimly remembersfrom the past regime.As I already mentioned, after the destruction of the old army, the Revolutionwas forced to create a new agent of power to strengthen its state authority.This agent was only available from the followers of a WorldConcept opposed toits own. Only from them could a new army slowly arise, which limited in numberby the Peace Treaties had to eventually be transformed into a tool that followedthe ideas of the new state.If we ask ourselves how the Revolution could happen, and we disregard themistakes of the old State which caused it and focus on how the people couldactually allow it, we come to this conclusion: 1. It resulted from our ideas ofduty and obedience being paralyzed and 2. It resulted from the passive cowardsin those parties who claimed they supported the state.To this we can add that our ideas of duty and obedience were paralyzed becauseof our entirely non-national education system which always served the interestsof the State and not the nation of people. The result is that no one understandsthe difference between a means and an end. Being aware of one's duty, theperformance of one's duty, and showing obedience are no more ends in themselvesthan the state is an end in itself. Instead, they should be the means tomaintain and protect on this earth a community of spiritually and physicallysimilar beings. When we see the structure of a state collapse and it appears tofall into deep oppression--- thanks to the action of a fewscoundrels---obedience and performance of one's duty to assist these scoundrelsis not a matter of following formal procedures as if everything was normal, itis pure foolish lack of reason to blindly follow some sense of duty in thesecircumstances. On the other hand, refusing obedience and \"performance of one'sduty\" to them would save an entire nation. According to our presentprivilegedclass concept of state, if a military commander receives the orderfrom higher-up state officials telling him to stop shooting even though he isfighting in a war to protect his people, he believes he is justified when heorders his men to stop shooting. To the privilegedclass world, thoughtlessformal obedience is worth more than the life of his own people. According to ourNationalSocialist concept, obedience to the community should come first at suchtimes and not blind obedience to weak superiors. The duty of personalresponsibility to a whole nation should come out during these times.The true meaning of these ideas among our people or in our government has beenlost in favor of a purely inflexible and formal interpretation---a blindobedient following---and that is why the Revolution was successful! To thesecond point I should add that the biggest reason the state-supportingnationalist parties became cowards is because their activist members as well asthe best of their group were lost on the field of battle. Apart from this, ourprivilegedclass parties, which were the only political structures standing onthe ground of the old State, were convinced that they could represent theirviews using solely intellectual means and with intellectual weapons, since onlythe State had the right to use physical force. Not only do we see a graduallydeveloping decadent weakness in such an idea, but the idea itself was absurd ata time when their one political opponent gave up this point of view and openlyemphasized that he would pursue his political ends through force. The moment theprivilegedclass made it clear they had abandoned force and chosen to useintellectual weapons exclusively is when Marxism appeared. Their slogan to fightwith intellectual weapons was nonsense and they would have to pay dearly for itsomeday. Marxism always held the point of view that weapons were to be used ifthey were expedient and success justified the use of arms. The accuracy of thispoint of view was demonstrated in the days from the November 7 to 11, 1918. Atthat time, Marxism did not care at all for parliament or democracy and killedthem both through howling and gun firing criminal gangs. The privilegedclasschatterboxes were defenseless in this moment.After the Revolution, the privilegedclass parties suddenly appeared again underanother name and their brave leaders crept out of their safe dark cellars anddrafty attics. However, none of the representatives from the old partiesremembered the reasons for their old mistakes and they certainly had not learnedanything new. Their political program was just like the old one because they hadmade no adjustments or changes other than to work with the new state. Their trueaim, however, was to participate in the new government and their only weapon wasthe same as before, just words. After the Revolution, the privilegedclassparties constantly collaborated in the most pitiful manner with those whomarched in the streets.When the Law For The Protection Of The Republic came up for a vote, there was nomajority to support it. But the privilegedclass \"statesmen\" were soterror-stricken from the two hundred thousand Marxists and their angrydemonstration in the streets, that they passed the law even though it wasagainst their convictions. They were afraid they would be beaten to a pulp whileleaving the Reichstag if they did not. Unfortunately, because of the passage ofthe law, this did not occur and they walked away un-accosted. So, thedevelopment of the new State ran its course as if there was no nationalisticopposition at all.The only organizations at this time that would have had the courage and strengthto combat Marxism and its stirred-up masses were at first the Free Corpsvolunteers. Later, the Organization for SelfDefense, Citizens' Corps, andfinally, the Traditional Leagues joined in. ( These organizations were militantgroups of mostly ex-soldiers.) The existence of these counter revolutionorganizations failed to change the course of German history because thenationalistic parties were unable to exert any influence over them due to thenationalistic parties lacking any form of threatening authority in the streets.The socalled defense units were unable to exert any political influence becausethey had no political thoughts of any sort and they especially lacked any realpolitical goal.What made Marxism successful was the skilled combination of political will andactivist brutality. What excluded the nationalists from any form of Germandevelopment was their lack of close cooperation between brutal force andingenious political desire. Whatever desire the \"nationalist\" parties may havehad, they had no strength to enforce this desire in the streets. The militantdefense units had all the strength and they were the lords of the street and theState, but they had no political plan and no political goal that their powermight be used to achieve for nationalist Germany. In both cases, it was theclever talk and strength of the Jew which took advantage of the existingsituation and worked to maintain it, further deepening this unhappy Fate.It was the Jew who, very cleverly, used his press to launch the idea that themilitant defense units should have a \"nonpolitical character\". He also cunninglypraised political fights of intellectualism and even demanded that suchstruggles be of an \"inner nature\". Millions of German blockheads now repeatedthis nonsense without the faintest realization that they were actually disarmingthemselves and were surrendering completely to the Jew. There is a naturalreason which explains why they did this: the lack of a great reforming concept.When a group has no great concept, the fighting strength of that group is alsolimited. The willingness of the political right to use the most brutal weaponsdepends on the existence of a fanatic faith, which gives them a conviction thatmakes such weapons necessary to achieve victory for a new revolutionary order ofthings on this earth. A movement that is not fighting for the highest aims andgreatest ideals will never reach for the ultimate weapon.The creation of a new great idea was the secret behind the success of the FrenchRevolution. The Russian Revolution owes its victory to an extraordinary idea.The idea behind Fascism gave it the strength to subject an entire nation, verysuccessfully, to a most positive and comprehensive resurgence. (The Fascismreference is a glowing compliment to Mussolini in Italy even though he is notmentioned by name.) Privilegedclass parties are not capable of this kind ofachievement.Not only did the privilegedclass parties hope to restore the past, but so didthe militant defense units, at least in as much as they concerned themselveswith political aims. The militant defense units contained the spirit of the oldsoldiers and those who had faith in Kyffauser, so they all looked towards thepast fondly. (Kyffauser was an old veterans' organization. Kyffauser is also amountain range in Germany; there is a legend that Emperor Barbarossa sleeps inthe mountain and will reawaken at a time of Germany's greatest need. Thisreference is a snub against those followers of the veterans'group.) Thispolitically blunted the sharpest weapons possessed by the German nation andallowed them to decay in the hands of the new Republic. They were acting withthe best intentions and in good faith, but that does not excuse the foolishnessin their actions.Gradually, Marxism received the necessary power it needed to support itsauthority through force which was available from the now consolidatedReichswehr. (Reichswehr was the German National Defense Force formed as a resultof the Treaty of Versailles which limited the size and strength of themilitary.) It began systematically and logically to eliminate any militantdefense units. They could be eliminated now because they were no longernecessary for the Marxist plans and they might become dangerous later.Individual and particularly bold leaders who ignored the order to disband wereforced to appear in court and placed behind bars. They received what theydeserved because they were to blame for their own Fate.When we first founded the NSDAP, we created a movement whose aim was not themechanical restoration of the past---like the aim of the privilegedclassparties---but whose aim was to replace today's ridiculous mechanical state witha living state for the people. Our young movement knew, from the very beginning,that their idea must be represented intellectually, but the idea must also beprotected and the final accomplishment of this goal must be assured, ifnecessary, even by physical force. The conviction to this new doctrine carriessuch a tremendous significance that no sacrifice is too great if it means we canaccomplish the goal.I have already discussed the motives behind movement that intends to win thehearts of the people and why it is necessary to defend itself using its ownranks against the terror attacks of its opponents. Likewise, it has been longshown by history that a terror which is represented by a WorldConcept can neverbe broken by a formal state authority, but such a terror can only be crushed bya new and different WorldConcept that is championed by those who are equallybold and determined. This fact will always be unpleasant to the officialguardians of the state; however, that does not change the truth of the matter.State authority can guarantee peace and order only when the State's WorldConceptand the WorldConcept of the people agree. Violent elements promoting aWorldConcept , one that differs from the people's, will look like individualcriminal groups and will not be seen as champions of a great idea which isopposed to the views of the state. If this were not the case, and the oppositionheld a WorldConcept that matched the people's WorldConcept , the State can applythe most violent measures for centuries against the terror threatening it, but,in the end, the state will submit because it is unable to defeat the opposingidea.The German State is completely infested by Marxism. The State, in itsseventy-year struggle, has been unable to prevent the victory of thisWorldConcept . On the contrary, in spite of jail sentences, which all totaledtogether are in the thousands of years, and the bloodiest measures which wereinflicted on the defenders of the Marxist WorldConcept , the State has beenforced to almost completely surrender to them. The average privilegedclass stateleader will try to deny this, but, of course, he is unable to convince anyone.On November 9, 1918, the State unconditionally surrendered to Marxism so it willnot suddenly rise up tomorrow and become its conqueror. On the contrary, theprivilegedclass simpletons who occupy Ministers' seats already haphazardlydiscuss how important it is to avoid making any rulings that would be againstthe workers. Of course, when they say the word \"worker\" they mean Marxists. Byidentifying the German worker with Marxism, they are committing perjury in acowardly and misleading manner, and they also want to hide how they crumbled inthe face of the Marxist idea and organization. In view of the fact theprivilegedclass completely surrendered to the present-day State of Marxism, thereal duty falls to our NationalSocialist movement in preparing for the victoryof our idea and taking up its defense against the terror of InternationalMarxism itself, which is still drunk with victory.I have already described how our young movement developed a group to protect ourmeetings out of necessity and how this group gradually assumed the character ofa definite military-style troop with its own organization and structure.Although the structure may externally resemble one of the militant defensegroups, there was actually no similarity with those groups.As I have already mentioned, the German defense organizations had no definitepolitical plan of their own. They were actually only units for selfprotection.They were more or less suitably trained and organized for that task alone. Theyreally represented an illegal complement to the existing legal militaryinstruments of state power. Their similarity to state military volunteer corpswas only due to the nature of their formation and to the unfortunate conditionof the State at that time. You could not say they were free units who wereformed freely and privately so they might fight for their own individual idea;that is simply not accurate. They had no such idea or conviction in spite of thefact that individual leaders and whole groups were opposed to the Republic. Ifwe are to talk about a conviction in the higher sense of a true belief on thelevel of faith, that requires more than recognizing that the current system isflawed. The root of a conviction lays solely in the knowledge of a new order,which one can see in the mind's eye and when one knows it must be achieved underany circumstances, and it is our most important task in life to make this idea areality.What fundamentally distinguished the storm troops of the NationalSocialistmovement at that time from all militant defense groups was that our troops werenot and did not want to be a servant of the existing state, but instead wantedto fight exclusively for a new Germany.At first, this troop simply provided security at meetings. Its first task was tomake it possible to hold meetings, which otherwise would definitely have beenprevented by the opposition. At that time, this troop was trained to attackblindly. However, it did not regard the rubber billy-club as the highest idealas some stupid German nationalists claimed, but these men understood that thehighest ideal can be exterminated if its leader is knocked low by a rubberbilly-club. As history has frequently shown, the most important thinkers havedied as the result of a blow by the most insignificant slave. Our troops did notconsider violence as a goal but wanted to protect the messengers of a spiritualplan from being oppressed by violence. The troop also understood that it was notduty-bound to assume the protection of a State which failed to protect thenation from those threatening to destroy both people and State.After the massacre at the meeting in the Munich Hofbräuhaus, our small securitytroop received the permanent name of Storm Detachment in memory of the heroicacts against the attackers. It is obvious from the name itself that this grouprepresents only one part, a detachment, of the movement. Just as propaganda, thepress, the scientific institutions, and other aspects are merely single parts ofthe larger Party.We could see how important the Storm Troop was not only at this memorablemeeting, but also when we ventured to spread the movement from Munich throughoutthe rest of Germany. As soon as we began to appear dangerous to Marxism, it leftno stone unturned in an effort to thwart our NationalSocialist meetings or, ifthat failed, to forcibly break them up. Of course, the Marxist Partyorganizations of all kinds completely hid anything to do with such attacks fromthe government's representative bodies. The privilegedclass parties, the sameones that were thrashed down by Marxism and did not dare let their speakersappear at certain public places, and in spite of that, those parties show aremarkably stupid satisfaction, which is quite incomprehensible, anytime theyhear that our battles against Marxism took a path that was not in our favor.They were happy that Marxism, which could not be conquered by them and wasovercoming them, was not being defeated by us either. There were stateofficials, police-chiefs, yes, even senators, who, indecently andunscrupulously, chose to pass themselves off to the public as \"nationalist\";however, in all disagreements which we had with Marxists, they gave the Reds themost reprehensible and underhanded assistance. These people were so disgracefulthat, in exchange for the miserable praise of Jewish newspapers, they did nothesitate to persecute the very men whose heroic intervention they should havethanked in part for their own lives; it was these men who prevented theirmutilated corpses from being hanged from light-posts by the Red jackals only afew years ago.These fake-nationalists were such terrible creatures that, on one occasion, theydrove our unforgettable late Chief Pöhner to bluntly express his opinion.(Pöhner is Ernst Pöhner, the Bavarian Chief Of Police who was already mentionedin Volume 1; he died in a car accident in 1925 after his release from servingthree months of a five-year sentence for his part in the 1923 Putsch.) ChiefPöhner was critical in his straightforward manner and hated all such swindlers,as an honorable man should. He said, \"In my whole life, I never wanted to beanything except a German first, and then a public official second, and I neverwant to be confused with those creatures, who are official whores, theyprostitute themselves to whoever their current master may be\".It was especially sad that such people gradually gained power over tens ofthousands of the most honorable and upright servants of the State and slowlyinfected those officials with these creature's own lack of character. Theypersecuted the honest officials with bitter hatred and finally gnawed them outof office while these lying hypocrites represented themselves as \"nationalists\".We can never hope to receive any kind of broad support from such men and whatsupport we have received was only on very rare occasions. Only through thecreation of our own protection could our movement protect our activities and atthe same time attract public attention and achieve a common respect, the kind ofrespect that is only received by one who can defend himself when he is attacked.In the development of this Storm Troop, the guiding idea was to train it to bean incorruptible force that was a zealous representative of theNationalSocialist idea, to provide physical training, and finally, to strengthenits discipline to the highest degree. It would not be anything like the militantdefense organizations of the privilegedclass or any kind of secret organization.The following explains why I intensely struggled against setting up the S. A.Storm Troop of the NSDAP like one of the militant defense units: From a purelypractical point of view, the defense of a people cannot be carried out byprivate units unless they have a great deal of support and assistance from theState. Anyone who believes they can do so has an exaggerated opinion of theirown ability. It is impossible to develop a military-style organization beyond acertain point when you rely on socalled \"voluntary discipline\". Authorityrequires an important support so that it can give orders, which is the abilityto punish, and without that ability, authority is gone. In the fall, and more soin the spring of 1919, it was possible to organize \"volunteer corps\". For atime, this group obeyed like soldiers because they were soldiers who had foughtat the front and they completed the school of the old army. That kind of commonexperience imposed a sense of duty on each individual, at least for a littlewhile.This sense of duty and discipline is entirely lacking in the volunteer militantdefense organizations of today. The larger the organization becomes, the morediscipline weakens and the less that can be demanded from individual members andthe more the whole thing will assume the character of the nonpoliticalassociations of soldiers and veterans. Voluntary training for an army withoutassured, unconditional authority to give orders will never be possible forlarger organizations. Only a few individuals will voluntarily give the kind ofobedience that is necessary for an army to function.Inadequate facilities and supplies create a serious obstacle in the training ofdefense units. The very best, most reliable training must be of prime importanceto such an institution. Eight years have passed since the War and, in that time,not a single class of our youth has been trained. A defense unit certainlycannot expect to rely on existing generations who have already been trained.Using this method, we can calculate with mathematical certainty when the lasttrained member will retire. Even the youngest soldier of 1918 will be too old tofight after twenty years, and that time is quickly approaching.As time passes, every defense unit becomes more and more like the old veteransassociations. An institution that does not call itself an association ofex-soldiers can never rely on this source for members. A defense unit, simplythrough its very name, strives to not only maintain the tradition and solidarityamong former soldiers, but also to develop the defense idea and make it areality by creating a unit that is capable of defense.Forming such a force demands unconditional training of recruits who previouslyhad no military drill instruction and in practice. This is actually impossiblefor a small defense force. One cannot create a soldier with one or two hours oftraining a week. Today, the requirements to turn an individual into a man suitedfor military service have been enormously increased, and a two-year serviceperiod is only sufficient to transform the untrained young man into an educatedsoldier. We have all seen the terrible consequences on the battlefield whenyoung soldiers are not thoroughly trained in military techniques. Units ofvolunteers who, with iron determination and infinite devotion, had been drilledfor fifteen or twenty weeks at the front only became cannon fodder. Only whenthe younger recruits are distributed into the ranks of experienced old soldiersand trained from four to six months can they serve as useful members of aregiment. In this way, they were guided by the \"old ones\" and then graduallygrew into their task.It is discouraging when we compare this with the attempt to raise troops using aone to two hour socalled training session each week where there is no clearpower of command, and where there are limited training means! Such training maywork to freshen up old soldiers, but it can never turn young men into soldiers.Such a procedure is inferior and completely worthless which is shown clearlywhen a socalled volunteer militant defense unit, facing difficulty and despairin the process, tries to train a few thousand well-meaning men in the idea ofdefense, while those who are not so harmonious simply remain untrained. Whilethey try to train these men, the State itself consistently robs millions ofother young people of their natural instincts. They do this throughpacifist-democratic education that poisons their logical patriotic thought andgradually transforms them into a herd of sheep, tolerant of every tyranny andwilling to follow any arbitrary command. How ridiculous in comparison are allthe efforts of the defense units to teach German youth when the State teachesthe opposite.Almost more important is the point of view which made me oppose every attempt touse what we call military training for a volunteer unit. Assuming anorganization succeeded in training a number of Germans to be men capable ofdefense in spite of the previously mentioned difficulties, year after year,including proper instruction in their attitude, physical proficiency, and armstraining, even then the result would have to be absolute zero in the currentState. Based on the way the State acts, it does not want any such defensiveabilities at all. They even hate the idea of defense since it completely opposesthe innermost aim of its leaders who are actively destroying the State.In any case, such training would be worthless under regimes whose actions haveproven they care nothing about the military power of the nation, and who wouldnever be willing to ask this power for assistance, except of course in theextreme case where they need military force to protect their own cancerousexistence. Today, that is how things are. It is ridiculous for an organizationto even attempt to train some ten thousand men in the State's twilight ofdecline when, only a few years before, the State disgracefully abandoned eightand a half million men.It was not that they simply no longer needed the services of these men, but, asa reward for their sacrifices, these soldiers were subjected to general insults.Do these organizations intend to train soldiers to serve as a regiment of aState which disgraced and spat on those who were once the most honorablesoldiers. They ripped their badges of honor from their chests, trampled theirbanners, and degraded their actions in battle.Has this present State ever tried to reestablish the honor of the old army, havethey tried to hold those responsible for their destruction accountable, and havethey brought forward those who freely slandered our troops? Not in the least! Onthe contrary, we can see these destroyers and slanderers enthroned in thehighest state offices. As it was said at Leipzig, \"Right goes with might\". (Thisis a reference to the Battle of Leipzig 1813, Napoleon was defeated and forcedout of Germany by greatly superior numbers of troops.) Today the power in ourRepublic lies in the hands of the same men who once plotted the Revolution, sothere is no reason to increase their power by training a new young army. ThisRevolution is the most dishonorable type of treason and it represents the mostwretched disgrace in all of German history. It is against all reason for them tohave any might.After the Revolution of 1918, any value this State attributed to the militarywas only related to how that strength could reinforce its position, and this isclearly and unmistakably demonstrated by its attitude towards the large militantdefense organizations. They were not unwelcome, as long as they contributed tothe personal defense of those cowardly creatures of the revolution. However, asour people gradually fell farther into ruin, the danger for these creaturesdeclined as well. The existence of the defense units was no longer necessary tosupplement national political strength; therefore, everything was done to disarmthem or even break them up.History reveals that princes show gratitude only in rare instances. But the newprivilegedclass patriot could never, not even once, count on the gratitude ofrevolutionary troublemakers, exploiters of the people, and national traitors.Whenever it was suggested that militant defense forces should be created, Icould never resist posing these questions: Who am I training these young peoplefor, for what purpose are they to be used, and when are they to be called upon?The answer provides the best rule for us to follow. If the present day State didcall upon trained militant defense reserves, it would never be to defend ourinterests in a foreign land. It would always be for the tyrants within thenation who need protection from the general rage of the deceived, betrayed, andsold-out people, which may someday explode.This is why the S. A.Storm Troop of the NSDAP was not assembled as a military organization. It was ameans of education and protection for the NationalSocialist movement and its joblay in an area entirely different from that of the socalled militant defenseunits.The S. A. Storm Troop was not intended to be a secret organization. The purposeof secret organizations can only be illegal activity, which also limits the sizeof these organizations. It is not possible, especially considering how loose thelips of the German people are, to build up a large organization and keep it asecret, and it is even more difficult to conceal its aims at the same time. Anyattempt to form such an organization will be hindered in a thousand ways. Astaff of pimps and similar rabble is at the service of our police officials whowill, for the Judas fee of thirty pieces of silver, betray anything they canfind and invent anything they cannot find to betray. Even the members of theorganization will be unable to observe a rule of silence. Only very small groupscan become a true secret organization and then only through years of sortingthrough members. The small size of such structures would make them useless forthe NationalSocialist movement. What we needed and do need is not a hundred ortwo hundred bold conspirators, but hundreds and hundreds of thousands offanatical fighters for our WorldConcept . This work cannot be done in secretshady gatherings, but in mighty mass public processions. The path we walk cannotbe blazed by the dagger and poison or pistol, but through the capture of thestreets. We have to show Marxism that the future lord of the streets is NationalSocialism, just as it will someday be the lord of the State.There is also a danger with secret organizations that the members willfrequently misunderstand the magnitude of the task. They believe that through asingle murder, the Fate of the nation could be turned around in their favor.Such an opinion does have its historical justification, such as when a nationsuffers under the tyranny of some sort of brilliant oppressor, one who has atowering personality, which guarantees the internal strength of his position andenables him to continue his oppression. In such a case, a man ready for theultimate sacrifice may suddenly spring forth from the crowd to plunge the daggerof death into the heart of the hated individual. Only some petty scoundrel whothinks along the lines of the republic and is filled with self-conscious guiltwill see such a deed as repulsive. It was the greatest poet of freedom among ourpeople who took it upon himself to glorify such an action in his \"Tell\". (Areference to William Tell who, supposedly in 1307, was forced to shoot an appleoff his son's head with a crossbow by the territorial ruler; he assassinated theterritorial ruler later. Tell was a popular figure in Germany; however, thestory's origin is unclear and it is unknown who Hitler thought was the originalpoet, but he was likely referring to Hans Schriber who published a collection ofstories.) In 1919 and 1920, there was a danger that some member of one of thesesecret organizations might seek vengeance against the plunderers of his home,spurred on by the great examples of history and horrified by the unendingmisfortune of his Fatherland, in the belief that, by his deed, he was setting inmotion an end to the misery of his people. Every such attempt was sheer folly.Marxism did not win because of the superior talent and personal importance ofany one individual, but because of the sorry and cowardly neglect of theprivilegedclass world. The most horrible criticism that can be hurled againstour privilegedclass is that the Revolution did not bring forth a single brain ofany distinction, yet, the privilegedclass still gave in and submitted themselvesto it. It is understandable how one would surrender to a Robespierre, a Danton,or a Marat, but to grovel before a scrawny Scheidemann, a fat Mr. Erzberger anda Friedrich Ebert and all the countless other political dwarves---that thoughtis overwhelming.( Mattias Erzberger was one of the officials who accepted the Treaty in 1919 andhe was assassinated in 1921 by two soldiers from a militant organization.)(Maximilien Robespierre, Georges Danton, and Jean-Paul Marat were the three mostimportant figures in the French Revolution of 1789. Marat was also stabbed by asix inch dagger, and this may be the source for Hitler's other stabbingreference. Philipp Scheidemann was the second Chancellor of the Weimar Republic,Matthias Erzberger was a prominent member of the Center Party, and FriedrichEbert was the first president in the Weimar Republic.) There was not a singleintelligent person present that one could have called the talented man of theRevolution and placed in him the misfortune of the Fatherland. They were nothingmore than revolutionary bugs, knapsack Spartacists, one and all. (A reference tothe previous insult about knapsacks, meaning here the Spartacist party or moregenerally Socialists who were plunderers.) To squash one of them was absolutelypointless and, at best, the only consequence was that some other bug, just asfat and just as bloodthirsty stepped into the open position more quickly.In the early years we had to sharply curtail this idea, which was born from andinspired by the truly great happenings of history because it was not suited inthe least to our current age where we had so many little politicians runningaround.The same argument can be applied when we consider the question of disposing withthose who might be called traitors. It is ridiculous and illogical to kill afellow who has betrayed the location of an artillery storage facility to theenemy while, nearby in the highest positions of authority, sit zeros who soldout a whole country. (This reference regards executing informers in Germany whorevealed arms cache locations to the Allies after the First World War; this isnot a reference to betrayal during wartime.) These zeros have the sacrifices oftwo million dead on their conscience and are responsible for millions ofcripples. Yet, at the same time, they remain spiritually calm and carry on theirbusiness of running the republic as usual. To dispose of little traitors issenseless in a State whose government itself frees greater traitors from everypunishment. So, someday it will happen that an honorable idealist, who feels heis acting on behalf of his people, does away with a rogue military traitor, thenhe is held accountable for his actions by bigger national traitors of the firstmagnitude. There is certainly an important question here: Is one to allow atreacherous little creature to be disposed of by a similar creature or by anidealist? In one case, the larger success, the disposing of villainy, isdoubtful and more treachery is sure to follow. In the other case, one littlescoundrel is disposed of and, in the process, the life of the idealist who didthe act is now put at risk through law or retaliation and if the idealist islost, he may not be easily replaced.My position is that one should not hang little thieves while letting the bigones run free. Someday, a German national court of law will have to condemn andexecute ten thousand or so of those organizers and criminals who wereresponsible for the November treason and all the consequences that followed.This would set an example and be a lesson for the petty traitors who revealedarms locations once and for all.Because of these considerations, I forbade any participation in secretorganizations and repeatedly emphasized the need to guard the S. A. Storm Troopitself from giving even the appearance of such an organization. In those years,I kept the National Socialist movement far away from any experiments where thosewho carried out these plans were mostly made up of gloriously idealistic-mindedyoung Germans. They would become the victims of their own deeds and theirsacrifice would not improve the fate of their Fatherland at all.If the S.A. could not be a militant defense organization or a secret society,then these conclusions result: 1. Its training must not be military style, butmust focus on the aims of the Party. In promoting physical health of themembers, the chief emphasis was not to be on military drills, but more onsports. Boxing and Ju-Jitsu have always seemed to me more important than anysort of rifle training, which is much less vigorous. If the German nation isgiven six million athletically-trained bodies, all of which are excited with afanatical love for their country and all of them trained to the highest pitch ofaggressive spirit, then a national state will have the ability to create an armyin less than two years time if necessary. At least it would be possible 2. if abasic army was already at hand which they could be integrated into. But, thesituation today means that this basic army stock can only be supplied by theReichswehr (National Defense military resulting from the Treaty of Versailles )and not from a militant defense league which is mired in its own inadequacy. Thephysical conditioning will make the individual conscious of his own superiorityand give him the confidence that is always found through the awareness of one'sown power. Also, this training will give him the athletic skills which willserve as a weapon for defense of the movement.1. The S.A. uniform is recognizable to everyone. However, in order to preventany confusion of the S.A. with a secret organization, from the very beginning weused the great number of its members to make it clear how it was used by themovement and we maintained that it must be well known to the public. It must notmeet in secret, but must march in the open air. This would absolutely destroyall legends about a \"secret organization\". We had to extinguish any desire themembers may have to participate in small conspiracies; it must, from thebeginning, be completely indoctrinated with the great idea of the movement andbe completely devoted to the task of representing this idea. It must be socompletely trained that from its inception, the horizon of every member would beexpanded and the individual would see his mission not in the disposal of somesmaller or greater rogue, but in his participation in building a newNationalSocialist State of the people. In this way, the struggle against thepresent State was elevated far above the actions of petty revenge and conspiracyto the magnitude of a philosophical war of annihilation against Marxism and itsstructures.2. The formation of the S.A., including the choices for its uniform andequipment, was not modeled after the old army, but decided by its own purpose---they were chosen to meet the needs of the task at hand.These views guided me in 1920 to 1921 as I gradually instilled them into theyoung organization. By midsummer of 1922, we enjoyed the success of having animpressive number of groups consisting of one hundred men each. Then, in thelate autumn of 1922, one after the other of these groups received their specialdistinguishing uniform.There were three events that were supremely important for the furtherdevelopment of the S. A.: 1. The first was the great general demonstrationagainst the Law for the Protection of the Republic, which was held by allpatriotic associations in the late summer of 1922 on the Konigsplatz (King'sPlace, an open square) in Munich. The patriotic associations of Munich at thattime issued a proclamation calling for a protest against the introduction of thelaw through a gigantic demonstration in Munich. Even the NationalSocialistmovement was going to take part in it. The closed ranks of the Party marched insix groups of one hundred each, which were followed by the political sections ofthe party. In the parade itself, two bands marched and fifteen flags werecarried along. When the National Socialists assembled, the great square wasalready half full but there were no flags for any other group. Our arrivalcaused the release of an enormous amount of passion. I myself had the honor ofspeaking as one of the orators before the crowd of about sixty thousand.The success of the demonstration was overwhelming largely because it showed forthe first time that our Munich branch could march on the street in spite of allthe Red threats. The Red republican defense schemers, who tried to terrorize themarching columns, were scattered with bloody heads in only a few minutes by theS.A. Storm Troop. The NationalSocialist movement had demonstrated for the firsttime its determination to claim the right to march on the streets and to wrestlethis monopoly from the hands of the international traitors and enemies of theFatherland. The result of this day was indisputable proof that our psychologicaland organizational ideas about the structure of the S.A. were correct. It wasnow enthusiastically expanded based on this successful principle and in only afew weeks, the number of Munich groups of one hundred was doubled.2. The March to Coburg in October 1922. ( Coburg is a city in Bavaria, whichonly voted to join Bavaria in 1920 and was previously ruled by a duke in thefief of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. It lost its ruler as a result of the Revolution.)A number of \"racialist\" associations intended to hold a \"German Day\" welcomingCoburg. I received an invitation with a note that they wanted me to bring alongsome supporters from my party. I received this request about eleven o'clock inthe morning and it came at a very opportune time. The arrangements had been madewithin an hour. For my supporters, I designated eight hundred men of the S.A.,who were to be transported in fourteen groups by a special train from Munich tothe village that had only recently joined Bavaria. Similar orders were sent tothe NationalSocialist S.A. groups that had been formed in other cities along theroute. It was the first time that a train of this sort traveled in Germany. Ateach place where new S. A. men boarded, the transport attracted great attention.Many had never seen our flags before and they were very impressed.When we assembled at the station in Coburg, a representative of the festivalcommittee for \"German Day\" received us and gave us a signed order which said itwas an \"agreement\" by the local organizations, which meant the Independent Partyand the Communist Party. The agreement said that we would not be allowed toenter the city with our flags waving, we would not be allowed to play music---wehad brought our own band of forty-two men---and we could not march through thestreets in a group or closed ranks. I immediately dismissed these disgracefulconditions and did not hesitate to express to those gentlemen of the festivalcommittee who were present how astonished I was that these kinds of arrangementshad been made and that it was disgraceful they had come to any agreement withthese people. I explained that the S.A. would immediately march in companyformation through the city and it would be to the sound of music with our flagswaving. And that is what happened.There were already thousands of howling, hooting people to receive us at thedepot. \"Murderers\", \"Bandits\", \"Robbers\", \"Criminals\", were some of the petnames that these outstanding founders of the German Republic graciously showeredon us. The young S. A. maintained themselves in perfect order.The squads of one hundred assembled on the square in front of the railwaystation and, at first, ignored the abuse. We were unfamiliar with the citystreets, so the marching procession was directed by a nervous police escort intothe Hofbräuhaus Cellar near the center of the town instead of to our quarters onthe outskirts of Coburg like we had previously arranged. On both sides of ourtroop procession, the noise of the masses constantly increased.The last squad had barely turned into the courtyard of the beer garden whenlarge crowds, making deafening shrieks, attempted to rush after them. To avoid aconfrontation, the police closed the gates. We could not tolerate thissituation, sealed in with everyone hollering, so I told the S. A. tore-assemble.I admonished them briefly for breaking ranks and demanded that the police openthe gates immediately. After a rather long hesitation, they complied.We marched back the way we came to reach our quarters and there we finally hadto face the mob. After they were unable to disturb the squads using shouts andinsults, the representatives of the true socialism, equality, and brotherhoodstarted throwing stones. Our patience was at an end. For ten minutes we attackedfuriously on both sides. Fifteen minutes later, nothing Red was to be seen onthe streets any more.At night, there were more serious attacks. Patrols of the S.A. had found membersof the NationalSocialist Party who had been attacked and mutilated when theywere alone. After that, we quickly took care of our opponents. By the followingmorning, the Red Terror Coburg had suffered under for years had been smashed.With typical Marxist-Jewish style, they passed out falsehood-filled flyers andtried again to rally the members of the International laborers into the streetsby distorting the facts, saying that our bands of murderers had begun a war toexterminate the peaceful workers in Coburg. At one-thirty, the great\"demonstration of the people\" was to take place and, according to the flyers, itwas hoped that tens of thousands of workers from the area would be present. Iwas determined to put an end to this Red Terror once and for all so I had theS.A. assemble at twelve o'clock. The S.A. now numbered nearly fifteen hundred. Imarched with them to the Coburg fortress across the large square where the Reddemonstration was to take place. I wanted to see if they would be so foolish andattempt to assault us again. As we entered the square, there were only a fewhundred present instead of the announced ten thousand. As we approached, theyremained quiet, although some ran away. There were a few Red troops present whocame from outside of the city and, as yet, did not know what to expect from us.Occasionally, they tried to renew hostilities, but any desire to do so wasquickly taken away from them.As we watched during the speeches, we could see that the population, which waspreviously so intimidated, slowly awoke, took courage, and ventured out thistime to greet us with shouts. When we left in the evening and marched backthrough the streets, they broke out in spontaneous loud rejoicing at variousplaces along our route.When we arrived at the train station, we were suddenly told that the workersrefused to run the train for us. At that, I informed a few leaders of the mobthat if this was the case, I would seize any Red big shots I could find and thatmy men would operate the train ourselves. I would also take along a few dozenbrothers of international solidarity in the locomotive, the supply car, and ineach passenger car. I made it very clear to the gentlemen that a trip managed byour own forces would naturally be a very risky journey and that it was quitepossible that we would all break our necks. I let them know it would be apleasure to enter eternity accompanied by the Red gentlemen who advocatedequality and fraternity so highly. After that dissertation, the train left verypunctually and we arrived in Munich, safe and sound, the next morning.For the first time since 1914, the equality of citizens before the law wasrestored in Coburg. Today, some \"ninny\" of a higher official may claim that theState protects the lives of its citizens, but it was not true at that time. Thecitizens had to defend themselves against the representatives of the RepublicState.It was impossible, at first, to see the full significance of this day. Since theS.A. was victorious, they were more selfconfident and had more faith in theirleader's judgment. Also, the people began to take a greater interest in us andmany recognized for the first time that the NationalSocialist movement was aninstitution that probably would one day be used to put the appropriate finishingtouches on this Marxist madness. Only the democratic party groaned, complainingbecause we had not peacefully allowed our skulls to be crushed, but that weinstead dared, in a democratic Republic, to strike back against a brutal attackwith fists and sticks instead of with pacifist songs.The privilegedclass press was half pathetic and half vulgar. Only a few decentpapers welcomed our defeat of the Marxist pirates in at least one city.In Coburg itself, part of the Marxist workers who were simply misled previouslyin their ideals, had been taught by the fists of NationalSocialists that we werealso fighting for ideals. Experience proves that a person only fights forsomething they believe in and love. Without a doubt, the S.A. benefited the mostfrom the events at Coburg. It grew rapidly. On the first Party Day, January 27,1923, nearly six thousand men took part in the dedication of the flag.For the first time, the companies were dressed in their new uniforms. Theexperiences in Coburg demonstrated how essential it was to have a unique uniformfor the S. A. This not only strengthens the morale, but it also helps our men toidentify each other in a dispute which means they can avoid mistakes when itcomes to recognizing comrades. Up to this point, the men simply wore armbands,but now, a uniform-coat and the well-known cap were added.The experiences in Coburg were also significant because it made us determined tosystematically break the Red Terror that prevented meetings of opponents in manyplaces for years, and to ultimately restore the freedom to hold public meetings.From then on, the NationalSocialist battalions assembled in Red strongholds andgradually, throughout Bavaria, one Red citadel after another fell victim to theNazi propaganda. The S.A. began to understand its task better and better and itmoved farther and farther from the character of an aimless and lifeless defensegroup. They had risen, transforming themselves into a living organization thatwas fighting for the establishment of a new German State. This path ofdevelopment lasted until March 1923. Then, an event happened which forced me toalter the course of the movement and to institute some changes.3. The occupation in the Ruhr during the first months of 1923 by the French wasgreatly significant in the development of the S.A. (The French moved into theRuhr when the Weimar Republic failed to pay reparations after the First WorldWar. The area included vital coal, iron, and steel production centers.) Eventoday, it is not possible or in the interests of the nation to not talk or writeabout it publicly. I can only speak of what has been touched on in publicdiscussions already. The occupation of the Ruhr did not come as a completesurprise to any of us. It did, however, give rise to the justified hope thatfrom now on, and once and for all, the cowardly policy of submission would endand the national defense forces would be given a job to do. The S. A. at thattime already numbered in the many thousands of powerful young men and they couldnot help but participate in this national service. In the Spring and Summer of1923, its transformation into a military fighting organization was completed.The later developments in 1923 can be mostly traced back to this transformationand how they effected our movement. (In response to the Ruhr invasion, therewere strikes and sabotage. The economic problems caused massive unemployment,inflation, and near collapse so the strikes were called off. A state ofemergency was declared in late 1923, along with riots and multiple coup attemptsincluding Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch which occurred before Mein Kampf waswritten.) The developments in 1923 are discussed in detail in another section,but I want to state here simply that the transformation of the S.A. at thattime, to assume active resistance against France, would have been harmfulregarding how it affected the movement if our assumptions about why thisrestructuring was needed were flawed. The end of 1923 (The Beer Hall Putsch,which disrupted the party and caused the government to outlaw the Nazi party)may initially appear as an awful event, but when we look at it from a higherpoint of view, we see it was a necessity. With a single blow, the transformationof the S.A. into a military unit was ended. The S.A. was made harmless by thearrogance of the German Government's actions, and this weakening of the S.A. inturn damaged the movement. However, this change opened the possibility for us torebuild one day and where once we were forced to abandon the correct course, wecould now follow a new path.The N.S.D.A.P. was re-founded in 1925. It must set up, develop, and organize thenew S.A. according to the principles originally established. It must return tothose sound principles, and it must again regard its highest duty to be thedevelopment of the S.A. as an instrument of strength in the fight for thephilosophy of the movement. It must not permit the S.A. to sink to the level ofa militant defense unit or secret organization. It must, on the contrary, builda guard force consisting of a hundred thousand men who will support theNationalSocialist Movement and the racialist idea.10. THE MASK OF FEDERALISMIn the Winter of 1919, and more so in the Spring and Summer of 1920, the youngParty was forced to take a position on a question that was greatly significantduring the War. In the first volume, I described briefly the symptoms I sawwhich foretold the threatening German collapse, and I discussed the propagandathat was being spread by the English and French in order to tear open the oldgap between North and South Germany. Back in the Spring of 1915, the firstorganized pamphlet campaign was started which was designed to inflame feelingsagainst Prussia by labeling it as the one and only party who was guilty ofstarting the War. This propaganda system was developed and perfected, little bylittle, until the year 1916, and it was as clever as it was wicked. The effortto prod the South Germans and turn them against the North Germans, using theirlowest level desires, began to bear fruit quickly. The government deserves afirm reprimand as well as the army and especially the Bavarian leaders for theirfailure to act and at least attempt to counter this propaganda. This guilt offailure is inescapable; they should have acted. Because they forgot to do theirduty, they failed to stop this propaganda with the necessary determination. Infact, nothing was done. In various government positions, they did not evenappear to look at this propaganda as a problem.Maybe they were stupid enough to think that this propaganda would somehow buildunity among the German people and bring them closer to national unification, andat the same time, somehow the German State powers would automatically bestrengthened too. Rarely in history has a malicious neglect been moremaliciously avenged. The enemy planned to only weaken Prussia but theirpropaganda struck all of Germany. The consequence was the acceleration of thecollapse which devastated Germany and the individual states themselves.Against one particular city, the manufactured hatred towards Prussia was stirredup the most violently and that was where the revolution against the ancestralRoyal House first broke out. It would be wrong to think this anti-Prussianfeeling was exclusively due to the hostile war propaganda or that those who fellfor it could not be forgiven. The absolutely insane organization of our wartimeeconomy centralized all of the production resources in one area and that onearea not only represented the entire realm, it swindled the Reich, and this wasmostly why anti-Prussian sentiment grew so strong. The normal man on the streetviewed the companies that handled war production as having their headquarters inBerlin--- those profiteers were identical with Berlin---and to him Berlin wassynonymous with Prussia. The organizers of this predatory institution of the warprofiteers, the socalled War Companies, were neither of Berlin nor Prussians andthey were not Germans at all, but this hardly entered the mind of the averageperson at that time. He saw only the gross failure and the constantencroachments of the hateful financial arrangements from these companies, and itwas most pronounced in those who controlled the capital. Of course, hetransferred his entire hatred onto the capital of Berlin and thereby to Prussia.This was especially true because the government did nothing to stop it, butinstead, this blaming of Berlin was quietly welcomed with a sinister smirk.The Jew was clever enough to see that his infamous plunder of the German people,which he organized under the cloak of the War Companies, would raise oppositionfrom the public. As long as this opposition did not threaten his throat, he wasnot afraid of it. To prevent the anger of the rebellious masses from explodingin his own face, there was no better recipe than to let their rage flame up in adifferent direction and, in this way, he could also use it.Let Bavaria go on fighting against Prussia and Prussia against Bavaria. The morethe merrier! The more difficult the battle was between these two only meant themore secure peace was for the Jew. The public's attention was completelydiverted from the international maggot of the nations and they seemed to beforgotten completely. If any enlightened people, and there were many in Bavaria,showed a dangerous tendency to advise caution, to seek insight, or urgerestraint in the embittered struggle, or if it there was any threat that thematter would die down, then the Jew in Berlin would provoke the people in a newway and await its success. All of those who profited from the conflict betweenthe North and the South pounced at every opportunity and blew on the flame untilthe glow sparked to life in a bright fire of revolutionary desire.It was a clever, subtle game that the Jew played. He kept the German peopleconstantly occupied and diverted their attention which allowed him to steal evenmore from them. Then came the Revolution.Up until November of 1918 the average man, especially the narrow-mindedmiddleclass and lower-educated workers, could not yet fully comprehend what wasactually going on or the inevitable consequences of the conflict among theGerman peoples, especially in Bavaria. At least that group which called itself\"nationalist\" should have been able to comprehend it on the day the Revolutionbroke out. The dust from the Revolutionary action hardly had time to settlebefore the leader and organizer declared himself the representative of\"Bavarian\" interests in Bavaria. This international Jew, Kurt Eisner (MarxistPremiere of Bavaria), began to play Bavaria against Prussia. It was obvious thatthis \"valuable gem\", who had constantly wandered around Germany as one of thejournalist rabble, would be the last person called upon as a protector ofBavarian interests and he was completely indifferent whether Bavaria was evenpart of God's wide world.When Kurt Eisner intentionally gave the revolutionary uprising in Bavaria theappearance of a spear point aimed at Prussia, he did not do this from thestandpoint of Bavarian interests, but only as a commissioner of Jewry. He usedthe instincts and dislikes of the Bavarian people in order to more easily breakup Germany. He knew the divided nation would easily become the booty ofBolshevism. His tactics continued to be used even after his death. (Kurt Eisnerwas assassinated in 1919 by a lone assassin not associated with the Nazimovement,Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley. ) Marxism bathed the individual states and theirprinces in Germany in the bloodiest mockery, but then they turned around andsuddenly called themselves an \"independent party\", and they appealed to thosefeelings and instincts among the families of princes and the individual Germanstates.The struggle of the Bavarian Soviet Republic ( the name of the government formedas a result of the Revolution in Bavaria which declared Bavaria as anindependent state) against the advancing liberation troops sent by the Germangovernment was publicized through Marxist propaganda as a \"struggle of Bavarianworkers\" against \"Prussian militarism\". This claim is the only way we canunderstand why the overthrow of the Marxist Republic of Councils in Munich wasso different from other German regions. In Munich, the overthrow of the SovietRepublic did not lead to the masses recovering their senses, but it caused aneven greater bitterness and resentment toward Prussia.The Bolshevist troublemakers understood how to make the defeat of the BavarianSoviet Republic look like it was a \"Prussian military\" victory against the\"anti-Prussian\" minded Bavarian people and they had great results because thecampaign was highly effective. Kurt Eisner did not even have ten thousandfollowers in the Munich legislative elections and the Communist party had lessthan three thousand supporters. However, after the collapse of the BavarianSoviet Republic, both political parties together had risen to approximately onehundred thousand voters.At this time, my personal struggle against the insane provocation of one groupof German people against another began. I don't think I have ever in my lifetaken on a campaign that was more unpopular than my opposition to the harassmentof Prussia at that time. In Munich, the first mass assemblies had already takenplace during the Bavarian Soviet Republic period. The hatred against the rest ofGermany, especially against Prussia, was whipped up to such a boiling point thatit was possible a visitor from North Germany, who made the mistake of attendingsuch a meeting, might be killed. Such demonstrations usually concluded with openinsane shouts, \"Free from Prussia!\", \"Down with Prussia!\", \"War againstPrussia!\" This was a mood, which an \"especially\" brilliant representative ofBavarian sovereign interests in the German Reichstag summed up in the battlecry, \"I would rather die a Bavarian than rot a Prussian!\" You would have toexperience the meetings back then to truly understand what it meant for me to goto a gathering for the first time in the Löwenbräu Cellar in Munich and warnthose attending about this craziness, when I was surrounded by only a handful ofwar comrades who were willing to stand by me. You must remember that the peoplein this crazy mob are the same ones who wandered around as deserters; they werethe ones who shirked responsibility in army bases or hung around at home duringthat time when we were out defending the Fatherland. So you can understand ourfeelings when this irrational mob yelled at us and threatened to kill us. Theseappearances did have some positive benefits. The band of my faithful followerssoon felt strongly bound to me for the first time and swore allegiance to methrough life and death. These battles were repeated, over and over, through thewhole year of 1919, and they seemed to increase in violence after 1920.I remember one meeting especially well. It was in Wagner Hall in Munich. Mygroup, which had grown much larger by then, had to endure very serious fightsthat often ended in the mistreatment of dozens of my followers who were beaten,kicked, and finally thrown out of the halls more dead than alive. The battlethat I started by myself---back when I was supported only by my warcompanions--- was now continued by the young movement as a holy mission.At that time, we were forced to rely almost exclusively on our Bavariansupporters. However, I am proud to be able to say today that we slowly, butsurely, put an end to this mixture of stupidity and treason. I say stupidity andtreason because I cannot give the organizers and instigators credit for beingsimpleminded; however, I am convinced their believers are really good-natured,but stupid followers. I considered and still consider those organizers to betraitors even to this day. They were hired and paid for by France. In the caseof Dorten, history has already passed judgment. (Hans Adam Dorten, attempted anonviolent putsch in the German city of Mainz which was unsuccessful andresulted in an arrest warrant for treason. He took refuge in the French occupiedRhineland, the name for the area on both sides of the Rhine river, and formed apolitical party there supported by the French; however, due to his treasonindictment, the other political parties looked down on the new party.) What madethis movement especially dangerous was the clever way they concealed their realmotives by pushing the federalist intentions to the forefront claiming it wastheir only motive. (Here, federalist means forming a weak national stateauthority to create a union of stronger independent smaller states connected byone central government. This was an important question at the time becausebefore the Revolution of 1918, Germany consisted of 25 independent states andafter the revolution the Weimar republic was a stronger nationally-centralizedgovernment.) It is obvious that the stirring up of hatred against Prussia hasnothing to do with federalism. A federative activity that attempts to dissolveor divide another state in the federation, at best, seems unusual. A genuinefederalist who honestly quotes Bismarck's concept of the Empire could not, inthe same breath, want to separate parts from the Prussian State created by or,at least, perfected by Bismarck or even openly support such separatist efforts.They would have shouted in Munich if a Prussian conservative party had favoredor openly promoted the independence of Franconia (northern part of Bavaria) fromBavaria. One could only feel sorry for the genuine federalist-minded people whodid not see through this reprehensible swindle. They were the first ones whowere deceived. By allowing the federalist idea to be twisted to such an extent,its own supporters were actually digging their own graves. One cannot promote astate-centric federative formation of the Empire if one slanders and insults themost important member of such a state structure, namely Prussia. What made thiseven more unbelievable was that the battle of these socalled federalists wasdirected against a group of people in Prussia who had the least connection withthe November Revolution. The insults and attacks of these federalists were notdirected against the fathers of the Weimar Constitution, who for the most partwere South Germans or Jews. It was directed against the representatives of theold conservative Prussia who were the exact opposite of the Weimar Constitution.It should not be surprising that the champions of this campaign avoidedattacking the Jews, but instead it should reveal the key, the solution to thewhole riddle.Just as before the Revolution, the Jew knew how to divert everyone's attentionfrom his War Companies and from himself and understood how to change theattitude of the masses, especially when it came to directing Bavaria againstPrussia. After the Revolution, he had to somehow cover up his new campaign ofplunder which was now ten times greater. He was successful again when he incitedthe \"nationalist elements\" of Germany against each other by pitting conservativeBavaria against equally conservative Prussia. He did this in the most cunningmanner. While holding the fate of the Empire in his hands, he provoked suchcrude and tactless violations of one against the other that he made the blood ofthe effected people boil. The anger was never against the Jew, but alwaysbetween German brothers. The Bavarian did not see the four million people inBerlin who were hard working, industrious people---he saw only the rotten,decomposed Berlin of the west side! (The west side was predominantly Jewish.)His hate was not directed, however, against this west side of Berlin, butagainst the \"Prussian\" city, which was all Berlin was to him. It was oftenenough to drive one to despair.The Jew's cleverness in diverting public attention from himself can be studiedby looking at examples today. In 1918, it was impossible to speak of anyorganized antiSemitism. I can still recall the difficulties encountered bysimply in mentioning the word \"Jew\". You either received a blank stare orencountered the most violent resistance. Our first attempts to point out to thepeople the real enemy seemed, at that time, to be practically hopeless. Onlyvery slowly did things take a turn for the better. Although the League ofDefense and Offense (an antiSemitic league that was banned in 1922) wasorganized on a faulty plan and was unsuccessful, it still deserved a lot ofcredit for having reopened the Jewish question. In any case, in the winter of1918, something approaching antiSemitism began to take root. For certain, theNationalSocialist movement later brought the Jewish problem to the forefront ina much different manner. It succeeded especially in taking this question out ofthe narrow circle of upper classes and middleclasses and made it into the mainrecurring theme of a great national movement. We had hardly succeeded in sharingthis great uniting idea of how to combat the problem with the German people whenthe Jew struck with a counter attack. He used his old methods. With remarkablespeed, he hurled the burning torch of dispute into the popular movement andsowed the seeds of disagreement there. In raising the Ultramontane Problem andthrough the arguments it caused between Catholicism and Protestantism, thepublic's attention was diverted in order to prevent any organized attack uponJewry.( Ultramontanism is a Catholic religious philosophy giving the Pope massiveauthority. The Ultramontane Problem refers to whether or not the Pope hasauthority as a foreign power to dictate local political or church activity. InGermany, the word is more common and basically identifies the conflict betweenchurch authority and state authority, Ultramontanes are those who support theChurch's authority and independence against the state. The Center Party was alsoknown as the Ultramontane Party, and they were accused of having more loyalty tothe Pope than the nation. To oppose Ultramontanism is to oppose Catholicismaccording to the Church. Protestant Germans who were nationalist accused theCenter Party of placing Papal interests ahead of national interests. Otto vonBismark attempted to impede the power of the Catholic Church and limit theirinfluence.) The men who introduced the Ultramontane Problem among our peoplehave sinned so grievously against it that they will never be able to makerestitution for their transgression. The Jew, however, attained the goal hewanted: Catholics and Protestants carried on a very nice war together while themortal-enemy of Aryan humanity and of the whole Christian world laughed up hissleeve.The Jew kept the public preoccupied for years using the struggle between thosewho wanted independent-state government and central-national government, and heincited them to take sides in this struggle. All of this was happening while theJew was bartering away the freedom of the nation and betraying our Fatherland tointernational high finance. He succeeded again by raising tensions between thetwo German religious denominations and causing them to fight against each otherwhile the foundations of both were being destroyed and undermined by the poisonof the international cosmopolitan Jew.We must remember how much destruction the Jewish bastardization forces on ourpeople every day and realize that this poisoning of the blood can only beremoved from the German people after centuries, that is, if it can ever beremoved at all. We must also come to understand how this racial disintegrationpulls down or even destroys the last Aryan values among our German people. Weare the bearers of civilization, but we see our national strength declining andwe are in danger, at least in our big cities, of becoming like Southern Italy.This infection of our blood, an infection that hundreds of thousands of ourpeople seem to disregard, is carried out by the Jew according to a methodicalplan. According to this plan, these negroid parasites of nations rape ourinnocent young blond girls and destroy something in this world that can never bereplaced. Both Christian denominations are indifferent to this desecration andthey ignore the destruction of a noble and unique spirit given to this world bythe grace of God. The future of the world does not depend on whether theProtestants conquer the Catholics or vice versa, but on whether the Aryan racewill survive or will die out. Yet, the two religious denominations are notfighting against the destroyer of the Aryan race, but they try to destroy eachother instead. It would seem that anyone who cared about the nation would see itas his holy duty, each in his own religious denomination, to make certain theydo not merely discuss the Will of God, but that they actually perform the Willof God and that they do not allow God's Work to be defiled. The Will of God oncegave mankind its form, its soul, and its abilities. Whoever destroys God's workhas declared war on all that God created, war upon the Divine Will.Therefore, every member of his own denomination should take an active role andconsider it his first and holiest duty to oppose anyone whose actions, words, ordeeds step out of the framework of his own church community and tries to pry hisway into the other religious community. Fighting against the little differencesin our current religious denominations will lead to a war of destruction betweenthese two major religions in Germany.We cannot compare conditions here with those in France, Spain, and certainly notItaly ( all predominantly Catholic countries with the second largest group beingnon-religious). One can encourage a battle against those who want to givepolitical power to the clergy or Ultramontanism in all three countries withoutcreating a danger that the French, Spanish, or Italian people would fall apart.In Germany, however, this is impossible because the Protestants would also takepart in the battle. Therefore, in Germany, any defense would immediately looklike an attack of Protestants on Catholicism, while in other countries such adefense of political power would only be carried out by Catholics againstpolitical attacks of their own leaders.What might be tolerated, even if it were considered unjust by members of one'sown religious denomination, is immediately and strongly rejected when the attackcomes from another denomination. This feeling reaches such extremes that peoplewho might see a disagreement within their own religious community as minor willimmediately turn away from that suggested correction and launch a fieryresistance against any outside group that recommends or demands a similarcorrection. They consider it an unjustifiable, inadmissible, even indecentattempts to become involved in their private internal affairs. Even if such anattempt at change is justified, it is not excused or accepted, not even if thehigher right of the nation's interest should be considered first. This isbecause, today, religious feelings are still deeper than all national andpolitical practicality. This does not change even if the two religiousdenominations are driven into a bitter war against each other. This antagonismcould only be changed if the nation is given a future that is so great, thatthis greatness itself would calm the religious arena and result in mutualfellowship.I can, without hesitation, declare that these men who draw the race-centeredmovements into the crisis of religious controversy are worse enemies of mypeople than any international Communist. Converting these Communists is themission of the NationalSocialist movement; however, the person who goes outsideof his own movement and deviates from their real mission, is a person whoseactions are deplorable. It makes no difference whether he is doing thisintentionally or unconsciously; he is fighting for Jewish interests. Today, theJew wants to let the racialist movement use up all its strength and \"drain awayits life blood\" in a religious struggle. It began this crusade as soon as itsensed a danger to the Jew. I emphasize expressly the words \"drain away its lifeblood\" because such a fight is clearly futile and only a man completely ignorantof history could ever think he would solve a question today that has remainedunresolved for centuries, even when great statesmen have been shattered fromtheir efforts to change another movement.The facts speak for themselves. The gentlemen of 1924, who suddenly discoveredthat the supreme mission of the racialist movement was the struggle againstUltramontanism, did not break Ultramontanism but instead shredded the racialistmovement. (This is a reference to Ludendorf who split from the party after thefailed Putsch of 1923.His exit and political/religious activity was a majorembarrassment and caused reverberations in the party.) I must also guard againstsome childish mind within the ranks of our racialist movement who thinks he iscapable of succeeding in that which even a Bismarck could not accomplish. (Areference to Bismark's failed policy of Kulturkampf which attempted to haltUltramontanism in 1871.) It will always be the supreme duty of theadministration of the NationalSocialist movement to sharply oppose every effortthat would place the NationalSocialist movement in the middle of religiousstruggles and to immediately remove from our ranks any propagandist who has sucha purpose. Actually, our movement had succeeded, without exception up to thefall of 1923. (This appears to be a reference to Erich Ludendorff and the BeerHall Putsch.Ludendorf later fell out of favor with Hitler, partly due to Ludendorf'sactivities against Catholicism.) In the ranks of our movement, the most piousProtestant could sit beside the most pious Catholic without any conflict ofconscience with his religious convictions. Both fought a mighty struggle againstthe destroyers of Aryan humanity and this fight taught them to respect and toappreciate each other. At exactly the same time, during these years, themovement fought its sharpest struggle against the Center party. This strugglewas not about religion, but exclusively for national, racial, and economicgoals. We were proven to be in the right by success back then, just as today'selusive success testifies against those \"who know better\".In recent years, the racialists, in their God-forsaken blindness of religioussquabbles, took the fight so far that they were unable to see how insane thebattle was. The Marxist atheist newspapers suddenly became the judge of thereligious faithful. Using the most stupid slogans, they defamed one or the otherand, in that way, kept the fire blazing. Germans have a history, as is oftenshown, of carrying on wars for phantoms and they do not stop until they haveshed every last drop of blood. Because of this extremism, such a slogan's callto battle will be mortally dangerous to our people. This is how our people wereso easily distracted from the real problems threatening their existence. Whilewe tore each other apart in religious squabbles, the rest of the world wasdivided up by the Jew. While the racialist groups argue whether the Ultramontanedanger is greater than the Jewish danger, or vice versa, the Jew destroys theracial foundations of our existence and annihilates our people forever. As faras this type of \"racialist\" fighter is concerned, I can only say to theNationalSocialist movement and to the German people most sincerely, \"Lord, guardus from such friends and then we can easily deal with our enemies\".The dispute between federalism (strong state-level government) and nationalism(strong national-centralized government), which was propagated by the Jews insuch a cunning way during the years 1919-1921, compelled the National Socialistmovement, even though we opposed the entire argument, to clarify its position.Should Germany be a confederation of states or one national-central government?Exactly what do these terms mean? It seems to me that the second question is themore important one. Answering this question will create a basis forunderstanding the whole problem and it will also clarify the matter andreconcile the options in the first question.What is a confederation of states? By a confederacy, we mean a group ofsovereign states which come together of their own free will and, in virtue oftheir sovereignty, create a collective entity. In doing so, they assignselective sovereign rights to the national body that will allow it to safeguardthe existence of the joint union.This theoretical definition does not apply in practice, at least not withoutsome alterations, to any existing confederation of states in the world today. Itapplies the least to the American Union of States. Most of these individualstates never possessed any sovereignty whatsoever. They were gradually broughtinto the framework of the Union as a whole. Therefore, the various states of theAmerican Union constitute, in most instances, smaller or larger territories thatwere formed for technical administrative reasons and their borders werefrequently drawn with a ruler. These states never possessed any previoussovereignty of their own because that would have been impossible. These statesdid not come together to create the Union, but it was the Union that createdthese socalled states. The extensive rights of independence that wererelinquished, or rather rights that were granted, to the different territoriesare in harmony with the whole character of this confederation of states, andwith the vastness of its area and overall size, which is almost as large as acontinent. So, in referring to the states of the American Union, one cannotspeak of their state sovereignty, but only of their constitutionally guaranteedrights, which we could more accurately designate as privileges.Likewise, our definition does not fully and completely apply to Germany. Thereis no doubt that the individual states in Germany existed as selfgoverningstates and these were assembled to form the Empire. The formation of the Empire,however, did not take place as a result of free will or from joint cooperationof the individual states, but it was the result of one state, Prussia, achievingdominance over the others. The difference in the size of the individual Germanstates, when compared to American Union states for example, prevents anycomparison with the formation of those states. The difference in size betweenthe smallest German federal states and the larger ones, or largest of them,shows that their achievements are not equal, just as their contribution tofounding the Empire and the formation of the confederation of states are notequal. As a matter of fact, one cannot speak of most of these states as everhaving enjoyed real sovereignty, unless the word \"sovereignty\" is nothing morethan an official catchword. In reality, both the past and the presentgenerations have eliminated many of these socalled \"sovereign states\", whichitself definitely proves these \"sovereign\" units are frail.It is not our purpose to go into a detailed historical account of the formationof each state, but I will merely point out the fact that their borders were notthe result of racial considerations. These borders are purely a politicalresult, and most of their origins can be traced back into the saddest period ofweakness for the German Empire---a time when our German Fatherland was dividedinto pieces. This inequality was at least partially taken into account by theconstitution of the old Empire. It did not grant the same representation to eachindividual state in the Federal Council, but varied the representation tocorrespond to the size, the actual importance, and the state's contribution tothe construction of the Reich.The sovereign rights given up by the individual states in order to create theEmpire were voluntarily surrendered only in the smallest way. In most cases,these rights were already practically nonexistent, or they had simply been takenaway through Prussia's superior strength. Bismarck, however, was not guided bythe principle of taking away rights just because they could be taken from theindividual states. He demanded them to surrender only those rights that wereessential in creating the Empire. It was a moderate and wise principle becauseit took into consideration their customs and traditions, and it also generated agreat deal of love and enthusiastic cooperation for the Empire. It would be amistake to assume Bismarck's intent was to stop at this point and hope theEmpire's rights were sufficient for all time. Bismarck never had such aconviction. He actually intended to leave intact rights that would be hard toacquire or tasks that would be difficult to accomplish at the present time andto pursue them in the future. He hoped the passage of time would graduallybalance things out. He also hoped that natural pressures, which would resultfrom normal development, would ultimately exert more pressure than any immediateattempt to break the existing resistance of the separate states. This was both ademonstration of and the best proof of his great ability as a statesman. As amatter of fact, the sovereignty of the Empire has continuously increased at theexpense of state sovereignty.Time has fulfilled all of Bismarck's expectations.This loss of state sovereignty was accelerated by the German collapse and thedestruction of the Monarchy. The individual German states exist because ofpurely political reasons and not because of racial reasons; therefore, theimportance of these individual states was obviously going to end as soon as thepolitical Monarchy and its dynasties ceased to exist. The Monarchy andassociated dynasties were the very embodiment of the political spirit whichallowed the existence and development of these states to continue. When a largenumber of these \"state-skeletons\" lost their reason to exist, with the collapseof the Monarchy, they automatically gave up their separate existence and unitedwith other states for purely practical purposes or consented to be absorbed bylarger states. This was the most striking proof of how exceptionally weak theactual sovereignty of these small states were and it also showed how littlevalue their own citizens held for these states.The removal of the Monarchy and its representatives was a hard blow to thefederal-state character of the Empire, but the financial obligations imposed asa result of the \"Peace\" Treaty were an even harder blow. Obviously the stateslost the right to control their own finances to the Reich at the very moment theEmpire was forced to pay-up because of the lost war. This financial obligationcould never be met by making separate treaties with each of the individualstates. Also, when the Reich took control of postal and railway services, thiswas the natural result of the gradual enslavement of our people that was broughtabout by the Peace Treaties. The Reich had to take over more and more sources ofrevenue in order to meet the ever-expanding extortion payments demanded from it.The way the unification was carried out within the Reich was frequently absurd,but the process itself was logical and natural. The political parties and themen who previously failed to do everything in their power to end the warvictoriously were to blame for it. As far as Bavaria is concerned, thosepolitical parties that put their selfish interests first during the war ahead ofthe Reich, were primarily to blame. They had to pay ten times more after the warwas lost than it would have cost if they had just given the Reich the supportneeded to bring home victory. Time avenges all! Heaven's judgment seldom comesso quickly after sinning as it did in this case. The same parties which hadplaced the interest of their own states above the interests of the Reich only afew years before, especially Bavaria, now had to witness the suffocation of theindividual states by the interests of the Reich. They brought these events onthemselves.It is an unbelievable hypocrisy for the representatives of the different statesto complain about the loss of their sovereignty in front of the voting masses,which is the only place our flustered parties direct anything, while at the sametime these very parties tried to out-do each other in pursuing a policy offulfillment---to fulfill the payment terms resulting from the Treaty ofVersailles---when it was clear even then that the consequences of this paymentwould lead to far-reaching internal changes in Germany. Bismarck's Reich wasfree from international financial obligations and did not owe anyone. At thattime, the Reich did not have the heavy and totally unproductive financialobligations that the Dawes Germany of today is subjected to. (Dawes Germanyrefers to Germany under the Dawes Plan, which attempted to collect warreparations.) Even in domestic affairs, Bismarck intentionally limited expensesto a few absolutely necessary costs.Because of this, the Reich was able to operate without financially dominatingthe states, and the Reich could function on the contributions made by theindividual states. It goes without saying that when the states possessed theirown sovereign rights and faced only small financial contributions to the Reich,this made the states very content to be a part of the Reich. It is untrue anddishonest, however, for some to spread the claim that the state'sdissatisfaction in being part of the Reich is due exclusively to their newfinancial obligations to the Reich. No, indeed! The real situation is entirelydifferent. The vanishing joy for the Empire must not be blamed on the loss ofsovereign rights by the states, but it is the result of the miserable way theGerman nation is now represented by its German national government. In spite ofall the Imperial Flag Days and Constitution Festivals, the present Reich has notfound a place in the heart of any group of the people. The Law For TheProtection Of The Republic may be able to frighten people away from voicingtheir outrage at institutions of the Republic, but the current Reich will neverbe able to gain the love of even one single German. The Republic's greatenthusiasm to protect itself from its own citizens by using laws and jails isthe most damning criticism and strongest ridicule of the whole institution.Certain parties are falsely claiming that states are becoming less pleased withbeing part of the Reich because the Reich is infringing on the sovereign rightsof the states. What if the Reich had not expanded its authority? The love of thestates for the Reich would still not have been any better because the totalamounts they would have to pay would remain the same. It would have been worseif the various states were required to individually pay the amount needed by theReich to fulfill the enslaving amounts demanded by the Treaty today and thehatred toward the Reich would be even greater. It would not only be verydifficult to collect the contributions from the states, but they would have tobe obtained through bureaucratic force by the Reich. The Republic has obligateditself to pay the reparations of the Peace Treaties since it does not have thecourage or the intention to break them. Again, the blame rests solely on thoseparties which constantly preach to the voters about the importance ofsovereignty and independence of the states, and then turn around and promote apolicy for the Reich that must result in the end of every last one of thesesocalled \"sovereign rights\".I say, \"must result\" because the present Reich has no other way of shoulderingthe burdens which resulted from a rotten domestic and foreign policy.Even here we see that one nail drives another deeper still. Every new obligationthat the Reich assumes as a result of its criminal mishandling of German foreigninterests creates a stronger blow which falls on the states. This requires agradual elimination, again and again, of all sovereign state rights to avoid thepossibility that they would become germ-cells which might sprout resistance.There is one important difference between the past Reich and the present Reich'spolicies. The old Empire granted freedom to its people and showed strength tothe outside world, while the new Republic displays weakness in foreign affairsand suppresses its citizens at home. In both cases, we can see cause and effect.The powerful national state does not need excessive domestic laws since itscitizens love it and are attached to it. The state that is a slave tointernational interests must resort to compulsory force in order to make itssubjects perform the services it demands. Therefore, it is one of the greatestcrimes of the new Republic to dare and speak of \"free citizens\". This could onlybe said in the old Germany. The present Republic is a slave-colony for thebenefit of foreign countries. It has no citizens, but, at best, subjects. Forthat very reason it does not have a national flag, but only a trademarkintroduced and guarded by official decrees and regulations. This symbol is theGessler's hat of German democracy and it will always remain alien to the heartof our people. (Gessler's hat is a reference to the story of William Tell.Gessler was the local ruler who put his hat on a pole and demanded the citizensbow to it when they passed. William Tell did not bow and was arrested. It isalso a play on the name because Gessler is the name of Otto Gessler, theMinister of the Reichswehr.) This new Republic has thrown the symbols of thepast into the gutter, without any respect for tradition and greatness, but theday will come when the new Republic is astonished to find that its subjects wereonly playacting and honored its own symbols superficially for they meant nothingto the people. The Republic has made itself nothing more than an intermission;it will be a short, unimportant part in German history.In order to save itself, this new Republic must constantly restrict more andmore the sovereign rights of the individual states, not only for financialreasons, but also to maintain control. Since it drains the last drop of ourcitizens' blood through its tactics of financial extortion, it must also takeaway every last one of their rights unless it is prepared to watch as somedaygeneral discontent turns into open revolution.We National Socialists would reverse this trend and create the following basicprinciple: A powerful national Empire that takes care of and protects itscitizens, in the widest sense, through good use of its foreign policy and isable to offer liberty at home without worrying about the stability of the Reich.On the other hand, a powerful national government may intrude on the liberty ofindividuals and the rights of individual states as long as it can assume theresponsibility for these actions without weakening the idea of the Empire. Thisis possible if every citizen sees that these actions are necessary to make hisnation greater.There is no doubt that all the nations in the world deal with certainunification questions when it comes to their internal structure. Germany will beno exception. Today, it is foolish to speak of \"state sovereignty\" because ofthe ridiculous small size of many of these plots. The importance of individualstates diminishes as communications and technical administration advances.Modern communication and modern transportation are constantly reducing theobstacles of distance and size. What was once considered a large state is a meresmall province today. What we consider small states today were once believed tobe as vast as continents. From a technical standpoint, it is easier to govern anation like Germany (which is about the size of Nevada) today than it was togovern the small province of Brandenburg (approximately the size ofMassachusetts) one hundred and twenty years ago. The distance from Munich toBerlin (300 miles or 500 kilometers) has become shorter today than the distancefrom Munich to Starnberg (15 miles or 24 kilometers) was a hundred years ago.Compared with the communication capability that was available one hundred yearsago, the entire territory of the Reich today is smaller than any average Germanstate was at the time of the Napoleonic wars. Anybody who refuses to face theconsequences of how technology has changed the relevance of our country's sizehas failed to march with the times. There have been and always will be peoplewho refuse to admit the obvious, but they cannot slow the \"wheel of history\" andthey can certainly never stop it.We NationalSocialists must not be blind to the consequences of these truths. Wemust not allow ourselves to be caught by the privilegedclass party phrases. Iuse the term \"phrases\" firstly because these parties themselves do not seriouslybelieve in the possibility of carrying out their intentions.Secondly, they are the very ones who are primarily to blame for the presentdevelopments in our country. In Bavaria, the call to stop centralization isnothing but a political maneuver and no one seriously expects it to result inany action. Whenever an opportunity does present itself for these parties topractice what they preach with their phrases, they always fail pitifully. Eachtime the Bavarian State suffered a \"robbery of sovereign rights\" on the part ofthe Reich, it was accepted without any resistance except for some smug barking.But, if any man dared to seriously oppose this crazy system of centralization,the same parties would come forward and ostracize and condemn him as \"someonewho is not in touch with the current State\". They would persecute him until hewas silenced either by being thrown in prison or by illegal suppression of hisfree speech rights. These actions should make the lies of these socalledfederalist circles clear to our followers. They use the federalist state idea inthe same way they use religion. To them, these are merely means to further theirown dirty party interests.Some activities that involve unification may appear to be natural processes,such as the nationalization of transportation services; however, we asNationalSocialists must still oppose such moves in the present Reich if thisaction is used to hide the real motivation behind it, which is to take overresources so that they can be used to feed a disastrous foreign policy ofreparations. The very fact that the Reich of today has assumed control ofrailways, postal service, finances, etc.---not for the higher purpose of servingnational policy, but only to acquire the means to pay for an unlimitedfulfillment policy---this should urge us NationalSocialists to do everythingpossible to hinder and prevent such a policy from taking effect. This includesthe fight against the present centralization of institutions vital to theexistence of our people. Such takeovers have but one objective, and that is togenerate the billions of dollars and pay the other guarantees that were agreedto by our leaders when they submitted to the Treaties, and to hand them over forthe benefit of countries abroad. This is the reason the NationalSocialistmovement must oppose any such attempts.The second reason for opposing a centralization of this sort is because it wouldestablish a dominant domestic power inside a system of government which haspreviously only brought the greatest disaster on the people of the Germannation. The present Jewish-democratic Reich, which has become a real curse tothe German nation, is trying to stop the criticism from those individual statesthat have not fully absorbed the \"spirit of today\" by demoting those independentstates and making them politically and economically insignificant. In contrastto this, we NationalSocialists have every reason to support these individualstates in their opposition of centralization, and with our support we give thema greater chance of succeeding. Our fight against centralization must be for ahigher national German interest. While the Bavarian People's Party works towardtheir own advantage in obtaining \"special privileges\" for the Bavarian State, wemust fight on the same grounds but in the service of a higher national interestdirected against the present November-Democracy.The third reason for our fight against the present centralization is becausemuch of the socalled \"assumption of control by the Reich\" does not result inunification and in no way simplifies administration. Often, this centralizationis only an excuse to take powers away from the sovereignty of the states inorder to transfer assets to the revolutionary parties. Never in German historyhave we seen a more shameless game of favoritism than the one played in thedemocratic Republic. Much of the present craze for centralization comes fromthose parties that once promised to pave the way for the most qualified andtalented men, yet they now only consider filling offices or positions with theirclose supporters. Since the Republic was founded, the Jews have received specialattention when it came to obtaining positions in the economic institutions takenover by the Reich, and with centralization, they now find themselves in thenational administration. First one, then the other have become realms of Jewry.For tactical reasons, this third consideration is especially important. Thisconsideration makes it our duty to thoroughly study each measure on the road tocentralization and, if necessary, to oppose it.Our position must always be to work toward higher national policy goals, and wemust never become tied up in pointless details which support individual staterights merely for the sake of the small state alone. This is necessary so oursupporters do not think that we NationalSocialists are denying the Reich's rightto exercise a higher sovereignty than that of the individual states. We believethis higher right should not and cannot be questioned. To us, the national Reichis just a vessel. What is important is the essential being of the Reich, whichmeans its contents, the nation, and the people. It is clear that all otherinterests must be subordinated to the sovereign interests of the people. Wecannot extend to any individual state a sovereign power or sovereign right whichwould represent the sovereignty of a nation. We currently have a problem withseveral federated states maintaining delegations among themselves at home andsending delegations abroad to foreign nations. This must be stopped and it willbe stopped. As long as individual states send their own ragtag delegations toforeign lands, we cannot be surprised when foreign countries doubt the stabilityof the Reich and act accordingly.The foolishness of maintaining such delegations is even greater because they domore harm than good. If German interests abroad cannot be protected by theambassador of the Reich, they most certainly cannot be considered protected bythe ambassador of a small state whose size and authority is laughable within theframework of the present world order. These little federated states providenothing but an excuse for others to attempt to break up the Reich from withinand without. Efforts that prompt secession are still being welcomed; this istrue for one of the foreign nations in particular. As NationalSocialists, wemust not tolerate it when some senile aristocratic family-tree wants to plantone of its withered branches into new fertile foreign soil in the form of anambassador's post so it may sprout again. Even in the days of the old Empire,our diplomatic representation abroad was so shameful that it is certainly notsomething we want to continue experiencing.In the future, the influence of the individual states will shift to the area ofcultural policy. The monarch who did the most in promoting the importance ofBavaria was not some stubborn antiGerman who watched out for his own group'sinterests, but Ludwig I, a man with a great feeling for art and with the idealof a greater Germany. (Ludwig the First of Bavaria was king until the 1848revolutions.) Since he used the powers of the state primarily for the extensionof Bavaria's cultural position and not for the strengthening of its politicalposition, he has rendered a better and more lasting service than would otherwisehave been possible. By elevating Munich in his day from an unimportantprovincial royal residence to the position of a German metropolis of art, hecreated a spiritual center which, even today, keeps the Franconians (northernBavaria and west-central Germany) attached to this state despite theirdifferences. (Munich was the capital of Bavaria and residence of the ruler.)Suppose Munich had remained what it once was, then the state of Bavaria wouldhave had the same experience as the state of Saxony, the only difference beingthat the Bavarian city of Nuremberg, which is the equivalent of the Saxony cityof Leipzig, would have become a Franconian city instead of Bavarian. It was notthe protesters who cried, \"Down with Prussia\" that made Munich great. The citybecame important through the efforts of the King (Ludwig I), who wanted to givethe German nation a treasure of art that would have to be seen to beappreciated. And that is exactly how it turned out. This also holds an importantlesson for our future. The importance of the individual states will no longerlie in the state's domain of political power. I see them as important racial andcultural centers. Even here, time will balance things out. Modern transportationthrows men together in such a way that slowly, but steadily, the boundaries ofprovinces and states are being blurred, and even the cultural variations whichseparate groups by geography will gradually begin to fade and those groups willbecome more and more uniform.The army definitively must be kept away from all influences of the individualstates. The future NationalSocialist State will not repeat the mistake of thepast and assign a task to the army that it does not and should not have. It isnot the purpose of the German army to be a school for the preservation ofprovincial cultural quirks, but rather a school of mutual understanding thatteaches all Germans to live together. Any element that normally separatesdifferent people in the daily life of a nation should be turned into a unifyingelement by the army. Furthermore, the army should lift each individual young manabove the narrow sphere of his own little part of the country and make himconscious that he is a member of the great German nation. He must learn to lookbeyond the boundaries of his home province and instead see the boundaries of hisFatherland, because the boundaries of his Fatherland are the ones he willsomeday have to protect. It is, therefore, foolishness to let the young Germanbe trained in his home state. It is more useful to show him all of Germanyduring his military service. Today, this is even more necessary since the youngGerman does not travel to broaden his horizons as he once did.In view of this fact, it should be obvious that it is unreasonable to leave theyoung Bavarian in Munich, the Frankonian in Nuremberg, the man of Baden inKarlsruhe, and the man from Wuerttemberg in Stuttgart, etc. (These were thestate's capital cities of the time.) Wouldn't it be more reasonable to show theyoung Bavarian the Rhine and the North Sea, the man from Hamburg the Alps, andshow the East Prussian the mountains of central Germany? Provincial charactermay be preserved in a small troop but not the whole garrison. We may disapproveof every attempt at centralization, but we approve when the army is concerned!On the contrary, even if we do not welcome any general attempt atcentralization, we would be glad to see this particular one made to unify thearmy. With the limited size of the present Reich's army, it would be absurd tomaintain separate groups representing the different states anyway. However, theunification of the Reich's army that has been undertaken shows a course which wemust never abandon, even in the future when the national army will bereinstated.A young, successful idea must avoid every restriction that threatens to paralyzethe power needed to advance the new ideology. National Socialism must claim theright to impose its principles on the entire German nation, without regard tothe former limitations of the federated states, and we must educate the nationso they fully understand our ideas and principles. The NationalSocialist ideamust be just as unrestricted by state boundaries as the churches are unbound bypolitical lines. The NationalSocialist doctrine is not the servant of theindividual state's political interests, but must dominate the German nation as awhole. It must guide the people to a new life and give them a destiny;therefore, it must claim the absolute right to ignore boundaries drawn by pastpolitical forces that we now reject.The more complete the victory of the NationalSocialist doctrine, the greater thefreedom it offers to the individual at home. 11. PROPAGANDA AND ORGANIZATIONThe year 1921 has become important for me and for the Movement in many ways.When I first joined the German Workers Party, I immediately took charge of allpropaganda. I knew this was the most important area at the time. In thebeginning it was not as necessary to rack your brain over the organizationalissues, but it was important to distribute the Movement's idea to a largernumber of people. Propaganda must come before the structural details oforganizing a movement so that we can win over the body of people needed to dothe work of the organization. I have never liked to be too hasty or to be overlyconcerned with book-keeping when it comes to any kind of organization ---theresult is usually a lifeless mechanical thing instead of a living organization.An organization, or a movement, grows naturally through an organic process ofevolution and development. Once ideas have taken hold of a certain number ofmen, they will naturally form their own order, and this build up is what createssomething of great value. Even in this case, we cannot forget about humanweakness, which, at least in the beginning, can cause individuals to resist theinfluence of a superior mind. If an organization is laid out mechanically, thiscreates a real danger that someone appointed as an officer, someone who has notyet been tested or proven himself, someone who may not be qualified at all, willtry to prevent more capable members within the Movement from rising to positionsof power out of jealousy. This kind of damage can be fatal, especially if themovement is still young.For this reason it is best to start off distributing ideas from one centralfigure. Then, as the body of people who learn about the idea grows to anacceptable point, we can search through them and examine them carefully to findleaders. We frequently see that men who at first appear insignificant turn outto be born leaders.However, it would be a serious mistake to view an abundance of theoreticalknowledge as proof of leadership qualities or as a sign of organizational skillwhich are both necessary for a leader. The opposite is usually true. Greattheorists are rarely great organizers. The greatness of a theorist lies in hisability to understand and establish abstract laws that are correct, while theorganizer must primarily be an expert in understanding the human mind. Theleader has to take a man as he is, therefore he must understand him. He canneither overestimate him nor underestimate him, either individually or whenlooking at a group of men. On the contrary he must try to take weakness andanimal-tenacity equally into consideration; the organizer must evaluate allfactors in order to create a structure which is filled with animated, constantpower as if it were a living being. Then the organization will be capable ofembodying an idea and paving the way for its success.It is even more rare to find a great theorist who is also a great leader of men.A leader is much more likely to be an agitator. Those who have a lightertemperament may not like this assertion; however, the truth in it is obvious. Anagitator has to understand human nature if he is able to make the masses absorban idea, even if he only manipulates their emotions. Such emotional manipulationstill makes him better qualified for leadership than the theorist who does notknow how men think or how the world works. To be a leader means having theability to move the masses. The ability to form ideas has nothing to do with theability to lead. In this connection it is quite pointless to argue over which isof greater importance: to conceive human ideals and aims or to make them areality. As it happens so often in life, one would be meaningless without theother. The most beautiful theoretical idea has no purpose and has no valueunless a leader directs the masses towards that idea. On the other hand, therewould be no use for the energy or genius of a leader if the clever theorist didnot establish a goal for mankind to struggle toward. The combination oftheorist, organizer, and leader in one person is the rarest thing to be foundupon this planet; this combination will create a great man.As already said, I focused my attention on propaganda in the early days of theMovement. It was the means to implant the new doctrine in a small nucleus of menwho could be used to form the first elements of an organization. The goals ofpropaganda usually reached well beyond those of the organizer. If a movementintends to tear down one world order and replace it by a new one, then itsleaders must clearly understand the following principles: Each movement mustfirst sift through the body of people that has been attracted and divide theminto two large groups---followers and members. It is the task of propaganda towin followers and it is the task of the organization to win members. A followerunderstands and agrees with the movement's goals; a member is ready to fight forthose goals.A follower is won over to the movement by propaganda. A member is encouraged bythe organization to cooperate personally in the winning of new followers, andfrom those new followers, some may eventually become members. To be a followeronly requires the passive acceptance of an idea. To be a member demands that themember actively represent the idea and defend it. Therefore, out of tenfollowers, we may find only two members. A follower only needs to understand; amember must have the courage to go out and personally represent the newly-foundtruth so he can spread it to others.Most followers will be passive in their participation just like the majority ofmankind, which is inactive and faint-hearted. To be a member means one must havean active mind, which is found only in a small number of men. Therefore,propaganda must constantly work to win over followers who believe in the idea,while organizers work unceasingly to identify and convert the most valuable ofthe followers into members. Propaganda does not need to worry about the value ofeach of the followers it attracts. It is not concerned with their qualities,ability, intellect, or character. It is the task of the organizer to carefullysearch through these masses for those who can actively help to bring themovement victory.The propagandist's job is to compel all of the people to accept a doctrine. Theorganizer's job is to include only those members who will not become an anchorto the further spread of the idea because of their mental attitude. Propagandaattempts to win over the people as a whole to an idea and to prepare them forthe time when this idea will be victorious. The followers who are capable andwilling to fight create the organized elements and they join together in amassive fighting union which constantly struggles toward their goal of victory.The more completely propaganda has worked its magic among all the masses, andthe more the organization which has been built is made exclusive, rigid, andfirm, the more likely the final triumph of an idea becomes. This means that thenumber of followers can never be large enough, but the number of members caneasily be too large.After propaganda has converted the entire population over to an idea, only ahandful of men are needed to finish the job. This shows that propaganda andorganization, that is to say followers and members, have a mutual relationshipof give and take. If the propaganda has worked well, then the organization canbe smaller, so that the number of followers can be larger and the number ofmembers can be smaller. However, if the propaganda is weak, the organizationstructure must be stronger, so in this case the number of followers in amovement remains small, which means a much larger membership is needed assumingthe movement expects any success whatsoever.The first task of propaganda is to win over men who can be used in theorganization; the first task of the organization is to select men who can carryon the propaganda. The second task of propaganda is the destruction of existingconditions so the new doctrine can spread more easily, and the second task ofthe organization is to fight for power. This power will be needed to secure thefinal success of the doctrine.A revolution based on a WorldConcept will only be completely successful if thenew world philosophy is taught to nearly the entire population and later forcedupon everyone if necessary. The organization, which is the movement, however,should only be made up of those members who are necessary to take charge of thenerve centers of the coming nation.In other words, every great world changing movement driven by an idea must firstspread this idea using propaganda. The propaganda creator must constantlyattempt to explain the new idea to others in a very clear way, which can winthem over or at least make them uncertain about their existing convictions.Since the declaration of such doctrine, in the form of propaganda, needs abackbone, the doctrine must be supported by a rigid organization.The members of the organization will be drawn from the number of followers wonover by propaganda. The more intensive the propaganda, the quicker the followerswill grow, and the members in turn will work better which will make theorganization driving it stronger and more energetic.Therefore it becomes the main task of the organizers to see to it that nointernal disagreements lead to an eventual break away of members which wouldweaken the work inside the movement. The organizers must make certain the spiritthat creates a common, determined attack does not die out by constantly makingsure it is rejuvenated and strengthened. This does not mean that the membershiphas to continue growing indefinitely, quite the contrary. Only a limited portionof mankind possesses the energetic and bold qualities a movement needs, so anyorganization that continues to increase its membership indefinitely would oneday become weak and inert. Organizations that continue to grow their membershipbeyond a certain number gradually lose their fighting power. Then they are nolonger able to take the offensive which means they cannot support theirpropaganda, and if they cannot support it, they cannot benefit from it.The greater and more revolutionary an idea is, the more active the membershipbecomes. The revolutionary power of the doctrine spells danger for itsambassador. This danger keeps away the small, cowardly members of the middle orprivilegedclass. Privately they may consider themselves followers, but they fearto confess their beliefs to the public by openly becoming members. This is howthe organization, promoting a truly revolutionary idea, takes in members---onlythe most active of the followers who have been won over by propaganda. Thisprocess of receiving only the most revolutionary membership into the movement,which is a result of natural selection among its followers, guarantees it willactively spread the message in the future and will fight successfully to makethe idea a reality.The greatest danger any movement faces is when the membership grows abnormallyfast after a large success by the movement. All the cowards and petty selfishonlookers will shun a movement when it is engaged in a bitter struggle. However,once the movement has either gained a big success or such a success seemslikely, these people will usually try to join at that time. Thelast-minute-joiner is the reason many movements, which are victorious in abattle before they achieve their final success, or rather before the finalcompletion of the idea is achieved, suddenly retreat. They develop a vague,inner weakness, which forces them to suspend the fight and finally the movementdies. Their first victory drew so many bad, unworthy and particularly rottenelements into the organization, that these unworthy creatures eventuallysuperseded the fighting strength of the movement in an effort to force themovement to serve their own interests. They reduce it to their own level ofpetty heroism and do nothing to achieve final victory for the original idea. Thefanatical goal has been erased from their minds, the fighting strength becomescrippled, or as the privilegedclass world would rightly say in such cases:\"Water has been mixed with the wine\". When this happens, indeed, the trees canno longer grow up to heaven (meaning great things cannot be achieved any longer;the tree has grown as much as it can and decline will follow).Therefore, it is essential that a movement interested in selfpreservation ceaseadding members as soon as it has become successful. From that time on, it shouldexercise the greatest caution before allowing any membership changes and shouldexamine the situation carefully before enlarging its organization. This is theonly way it will be able to keep the nucleus of the movement pure, fresh, andsound. It must also be sure that this nucleus is the only group to lead themovement or decide on the propaganda, and as the center of power, this nucleuswill perform all actions necessary to make its ideals a reality. All importantpositions that have been conquered, as well as the internal leadership itself,must be strictly filled from the main body of the old movement. This has to becontinued until the old principles and doctrines of the Party have become thefoundation and purpose of the new government. Only after this has beenaccomplished can the reins be gradually handed over to the constitution of thisState, and this must be a constitution which is born out of the movement'sspirit. Such a hand-over usually takes place only after a mutual strugglebetween the leaders of the existing movement and those empowered by theconstitution. This struggle occurs because it is not so much a question of humaninsight, as when a leader evaluates those he works with, but it is more aboutthe play and working of powers within the government. Such powers may be clearlyseen in the constitution or organization; however, they cannot be guided by theold leadership forever.All large movements, whether religious or political, owe their tremendoussuccesses to the recognition and use of these principles. Any lasting success isunthinkable if these laws are ignored.As the leader of the party propaganda, I carefully prepared the way for thefuture greatness of the movement and through these radical concepts presented inour propaganda, I have worked to recruit only the best quality people as membersof the organization. The more radical and inciting my propaganda was, the moreit frightened away the weak and timid and prevented them from penetrating theearly nucleus of our organization. They may have remained followers, but theycertainly did not let the public know; in fact they apprehensively concealedtheir allegiance. There were many thousands of people who assured me that theywere totally in agreement with everything in our program, but under nocircumstances could they openly be members! The movement, they said, was soradical that they would be personally subjected to severe criticism and evendanger if they became members. So, the honorable, peaceful citizen could not beblamed if he stood aside at first, even though his heart was in full harmonywith the ideas of the movement. This was fine with me.If we allowed people like these, who lack the spirit of revolution, to join ourParty as members in the early days, then we would be nothing more than a piousbrotherhood because we would no longer be a young movement filled with fightingspirit. The spirited and daring form that I gave our propaganda back thenestablished and guaranteed the radical nature of our movement ever since. Fromthat time onward, only radical people, with a few exceptions, were willing tobecome members. Nevertheless, our propaganda was so strong that, after a shorttime, hundreds of thousands not only agreed in their heart with us, but wishedfor our victory, even though they were personally too timid to make anysacrifices for it and some were too timid to even argue on behalf of it.Up to the middle of 1921, bringing in new members this way was sufficient andthe method was useful to the movement. However, special events during themidsummer of this year, after the success of our propaganda brought the movementinto the public eye, made it clear the organization needed to be updated andadapted to deal with this greater visibility in the community.( This refers to the summer of 1921 when Hitler was away in Berlin giving aspeech and, to counter his growing power in the party, Anton Drexler encouragedmembers to vote to limit Hitler's power in the party. Hitler threatened to leavewhich would split the party. In order to prevent a split, the party agreed tomove Drexler from the position of party chairman and replace him with Hitler,plus, it gave Hitler additional powers. Hitler was then elected as party leaderon July 29, 1921, and this was when he was first called Führer of the party.) Agroup of racialist visionaries attempted to obtain control of the Party with thehelp of the president of the Party (Drexler). This led to the collapse of thislittle conspiracy and, during a general meeting of all members, absoluteauthority over the movement was unanimously placed in my hands. At the sametime, a new rule was approved which delegated the complete responsibility of themovement to the leader, did away with the requirement for committees to makedecisions, and instituted a system that divided work between the committeesinstead, and that has since proven to be the greatest blessing. Since the firstof August, 1921, I have taken over the inner reorganization of the movement andI found a large number of excellent helpers to assist me. I consider itnecessary to mention them and their contributions later in a special appendix.In my effort to make use of the results we gained from our propaganda so wemight improve the organization, I had to do away with many former customs and Ihad to introduce principles that no existing party possessed or would even haveaccepted. From 1919 to 1920, the movement was led by a committee which waselected by the members in special assemblies as described in our rules. Thecommittee consisted of a first and second treasurer, a first and secondsecretary, and the heads were the first and second chairmen. In addition tothat, there was a membership secretary, the chief of propaganda, and severalother committee members. I found it amusing that the movement was led by acommittee, which was the very embodiment of what the movement itself intended tocombat, parliamentarianism. It is obvious the organization was functioning byusing the same principle that represented the system everyone suffered under andthey continue to suffer under today, from the smallest localities, throughdistricts, in the provinces, and the states and all those under the Reich'sparliamentary leadership. It was urgently necessary to change this situation sowe could prevent the movement from being permanently spoiled and becomingincapable of fulfilling its true mission. When the time came, we could notafford to have such a poor foundation for our organization.When the majority voted in favor of something, the result was recorded in thewritten minutes---obviously this represented a miniature parliament.There was no personal responsibility anywhere. The same nonsense and the samefoolishness controlled our small committee that controlled the largerepresentative bodies of the State. Men were elected to serve on this committeeas secretaries, as treasurers, to manage the membership of the organization, forpropaganda, and God knows what else. Yet later, they would all choose a side,for or against each particular question, and then vote on it. For instance, theman who had to look after propaganda voted on a matter that concerned thetreasurer, and the treasurer had to vote on matters that concerned the man wholooked after other organizational matters, who, in turn, voted on a matter thatpurely affected the secretaries, etc.Why is one special man appointed for propaganda if treasurers, secretaries, andmember secretaries, etc., also vote on propaganda issues? This appears just asunreasonable to a normal mind as it would if the supervisors or engineers orother workers from other sections in a big factory decided questions that werenot in any way related to their department. I refused to submit to suchfoolishness and after a very short time, I stopped attending the committeesessions. I prepared my propaganda and that was that. I also did not let somegood-for-nothing interfere with my work, just as I did not concern myself withtheir business. As soon as the acceptance of the new by-laws and my appointmentto the office of first chairman had given me the necessary authority and thecorresponding rights, this foolishness was immediately stopped. The principle ofabsolute responsibility was introduced to replace the committee resolutions.The first chairman is responsible for the entire leadership of the movement. Heassigns tasks to the members of the committee under him and to the other neededworkers. Each one of these men is absolutely responsible for the tasks assignedto him. Each man is accountable to the first chairman, who must make sure thatall members cooperate, or he must establish cooperation by choosing men who canwork together and by establishing general guiding principles. This law ofresponsibility has gradually become routine within the movement, at least as faras the leadership of the Party is concerned. In the little local groups andmaybe even in the provinces and districts, it will take years before theseprinciples are fully established since hesitant characters and good-for-nothingswill fight against responsibility. They will always feel uneasy if they carrythe sole blame for a task. They feel more comfortable if every importantdecision is supported by the majority of a committee. However, I feel it isnecessary to strongly oppose such an attitude. I will not make concessions tofear when it comes to responsibility. Even if it takes a long time before thisgoal is realized, I will ultimately create an understanding among the membersthat leaves no doubt about the duty and ability of a leader, and this will allowonly those who are truly called-forth and chosen to become leaders.At any rate, a movement that intends to fight against the foolishness ofparliamentary institutions must keep itself free from such structures. Only thencan it gain the strength needed for its struggle. In a time when majority-ruleis the master everywhere, a movement that adapts itself to the principle of oneleader who carries all responsibility will someday, with mathematical certainty,overcome the present circumstances and will emerge victorious. This thought ledto a complete reorganization within the movement. Its logical effect alsoresulted in a very strict separation between the financial departments of themovement and the political leadership. This principle was extended to the entirebusiness management of the party. This placed the business section on a soundfooting which was free from political influences so it could concentrate onpurely economic matters.When I joined the original six-man Party in the autumn of 1919, it did not havea business office, any employees, printed forms, or rubber stamps.Nothing printed existed. At first, the committee used a room at an inn on theHerrengasse (or Street of the Lords, a street in Vienna) and later, a cafe onthe Gasteig (the cultural center of Munich). This was an impossible situation.Therefore, soon after I joined, I began looking at several Munich restaurantswhere we could rent a room or another enclosed space for our meetings. In theformer Sterneckerbräu Inn Beer Hall in the valley (a tavern in Munich. The\"Tal\", or valley, is a shopping street in Munich, stretching from \"Isartor\" tothe Old Town Hall. The Sterneckerbräu used to be an inn. In 1933, Hitlerestablished a small Nazi museum in one of its rooms. In modern times, thebuilding houses offices and the interior has been completely renovated.), therewas a small room with a raised ceiling that had previously served the ImperialCounselors of Bavaria as a place for their drinking bouts. It was dark andgloomy and served its former purpose extremely well, but it was not as wellsuited for what we needed now. The only window faced an alley that was sonarrow, even on the brightest summer day, the room remained dark and gloomy.This became our first business office. Since the monthly rent was only fiftymarks, a large sum for us in those days, we were in no position to demand much.We could not even complain when the wooden paneling on the walls that had beenput there for the Imperial Counselors, was torn off before we moved in. Now, theroom really seemed more like a vault than an office.Nevertheless, this represented great progress. Eventually, an electric light wasinstalled, but it took even longer to get a telephone. A table with a fewborrowed chairs was added. Finally, we found an open shelf to use and later, acabinet for food and dishes. Two sideboard cabinets with shelves and drawersthat belonged to the innkeeper served as a storage place for pamphlets, posters,etc.The former leaders only held one weekly committee meeting. This could notpossibly continue in the long run. We needed a full-time, paid party official tomanage our business affairs. This was difficult for us back then. The movementhad very few members at this time, which made it tricky to find a suitable manamong them who could meet all of the movement's demands while requiring verylittle compensation for himself.Finally, after an extended search, the first business manager of the party wasfound in a former comrade of mine, Schüssler. (Rudolf Schüssler served in thesame regiment with Hitler and they worked together in the political departmentof the Bavarian Reichswehr, national defense force, after the war.) At first, heworked daily between 6:00 and 8:00 in the evening at our new office and laterbetween 5:00 and 8:00 in the evening. Finally, he began working every afternoonand a short time later he was working full-time. He did his duty from earlymorning until late at night. He was just as diligent as he was upright andhonest. He was a man who personally did all he could and who was a faithfulsupporter to the movement. Schüssler brought a small Adler typewriter that heowned. (The typewriter was made by Adler Schreibmaschinen of Frankfurt which wasa major typewriter manufacturer. The model was likely an Adler 15. It isinteresting Hitler mentioned the brand, possibly out of national pride over aGerman-built machine.) It was the first machinery of that kind that our movementused. Later, the movement purchased the typewriter by paying throughinstallments. It seemed necessary to have a small safe in order to protect thecard-files and the membership lists from the fingers of thieves. We purchased asafe, though not to deposit any big funds that some might have thought we had atthat time. On the contrary, the movement was extremely poor and I had topersonally help out frequently with my own scant savings.One-and-a-half years later, the business office became too small so we movedinto a new location on Cornelius Street. This was also a tavern, but this timewe had three rooms and not just one room. We also had a large hall. In thosedays, we thought this was a great achievement. We stayed there until November,1923. Earlier, in December, 1920, we had acquired the newspaper VölkischerBeobachter ( the Race Watcher). Its name alone advocated racial ideas and thispaper was to be transformed into a vital part of the N.S.D.A.P. In thebeginning, the paper was published twice weekly. Early in 1923, it became adaily paper. By the end of August, 1923, it was published as a regular,large-format newspaper which is the format it is commonly known for today. Beingan absolute novice in the newspaper business, I frequently had to pay dearly forhard-bought lessons in those early days.It gives a person food for thought if you notice that, in contrast to theenormous number of Jewish newspapers, there is only one importantracialNationalist newspaper. Later, I had the chance to learn first hand whythis was so. Most of the socalled racialist enterprises were not operated in abusinesslike manner. They followed the idea that loyalty is more essential thansuccess. This point of view is entirely false. Loyalty in itself is notsomething that can be seen. It is best expressed through accomplishment. The manwho creates something of actual value to his people reveals how valuable hisloyalty is. Someone who only acts like they are loyal, but does not actually doanything for his people, is harmful to everyone and a liability to those who areloyal.As the name indicates, the Race Watcher newspaper we acquired was called a\"racialNationalist\" mouthpiece and it had all the strengths connected with suchinstitutions, but it also had all the faults and weaknesses. The contents ofthese other newspapers were honorable, but the enterprises were managed in a waythat made it impossible for them to function as a business. They believed thatracialist newspapers had to be supported by racialist donations. They failed torealize that, in spite of competing with other newspapers, they must still besuccessful. It is absolutely indecent for their management to cover up theirnegligence or mistakes using donations from good-intentioned patriots.As soon as I realized how dangerous these conditions were, I made some changes.Luck was with me when it led me to a man who had since offered the movementextremely valuable services, both as business manager of the newspaper and asbusiness manager of the Party. In 1914 at the battlefront, I met the presentgeneral business manager of the Party, Max Amann. At that time, he was mysuperior officer ( Amann was Hitler's sergeant in the war and later head ofEher-Verlag the Nazi printing office). During the four years of the war, I hadevery opportunity to observe the great capabilities and diligence of thisconscientious man I would later work with.In midsummer of 1921, the movement went through a serious crisis ( apparentlyanother reference to the vote to reduce Hitler's power in the party and theresults). I was no longer satisfied with many of the employees and I had anespecially bitter experience with one of them. That was when I accidentally raninto my former comrade from my regiment and, after talking to him for a while, Iasked him to become the business manager of the Party.Amann already had a job with a promising future which made him hesitate atfirst, but he finally agreed. However, he made it clear he would never becomethe ceremonious servant for some incompetent committee; he would recognize onlyone master.The infinite value of our first business manager, who had a strong businessknowledge, brought order and integrity into the departments of the Party.This established a method of operation that was unequaled and certainly couldnot be surpassed by any of the movement's subdivisions. As frequently happens inlife, success often causes envy and ill will. The same had to be expected inthis case and it was tolerated with patience.As early as 1922, we established fixed procedures to strengthen the businessside of the movement. We already had a filing system containing information onall the Party members. The movement was also financially stable. Currentexpenses had to be covered by the current income. When we had unexpected orunusually high income, it was used for special expenses. In spite of the hardtimes, the movement remained practically free of debt, except for a few smallcurrent bills. This allowed the movement to steadily increase its assets. Weworked just like it was a private business. Employees had to distinguishthemselves through success and could not fall back on \"the famous loyalty\". Theconviction of every NationalSocialist is demonstrated by his willingness, hisdiligence, and his ability to do the work that has been given to him by thecommunity of the people. Anyone who does not fulfill his duty cannot brag abouthis loyalty because he has already committed a sin against it.Against many influences, the new business manager of the Party energeticallydefended his position that Party office jobs are not for lazy supporters ormembers who want to sit around and do nothing. A movement that strongly fightsthe corruption of our present State administration must keep its ownorganization clean of such vices.The management of the newspaper hired employees who formerly belonged to theBavarian People's Party. However, their achievements alone proved them to beextremely qualified. The result of this experiment was outstanding for the mostpart. The very fact that the movement honestly and frankly acknowledged realindividual successes did more to quickly and fully win the hearts of theemployees than would have been possible otherwise.Later on, they became good NationalSocialists and they remained loyal. Not onlywere they loyal in what they said, but they proved it by doing conscientious,good, and honest work in the service of the new movement. It goes without sayingthat the well-qualified members of the Party were preferred to non-members ofthe party who were equally well-qualified, but nobody was hired on the basis ofhis membership in the Party alone. The determined manner in which the newbusiness manager stood for these principles and gradually carried them out inspite of all resistance proved later to be a great advantage to the movement.During the difficult time of economic inflation, when tens of thousands ofbusinesses collapsed and thousands of newspapers ceased to exist, it waspossible for the management of the movement to not only continue operating andaccomplish its task, but it continued to build up the Race Watcher Newspapermore and more. During this time is when it took its place among the greatnewspapers.The year 1921 was significant in another respect. In my position as head of theParty, I was successful in gradually liberating the departments of the Partyfrom the criticism and the lectures of so many of the committee members. Thiswas important because their interference made it impossible to attract a reallycompetent man for a task if he knew committee members, who had no abilities,would constantly interfere because they always thought they knew what was bestabout everything. All they really did was create terrible confusion. Usuallythese know-it-alls retired modestly so they could find a new field where theycould practice their skills of control and inspiration. These people wereplagued with an obvious disease which caused them to find an ulterior motivebehind everything and anything. They also seemed to live in a kind of constantpregnancy, always filled with magnificent plans, ideas, projects, andtechniques. Their greatest goal was achieved when they appointed asub-committee, which would have to poke its nose expertly into the work ofothers and control everything. It never seemed to occur to most of thesecommitteehounds that it was offensive and non-National-Socialistic for an idiotto continuously lecture the real experts. Anyhow, I considered it to be my dutyduring these years to protect all assistants who did a good job and carriedheavy responsibilities in the movement against such elements, which gave themthe necessary backing and freedom to make progress in their work.The best way to deal with committees that did nothing or only hatched impossibleideas was to give them a real task. It was humorous to watch as the members ofsuch a group quietly disappeared until they were nowhere to be found. It made methink of our greatest similar institution, the Reichstag. They quickly vanishinto thin air if they have to do a real job instead of just talk, especiallywhen it was a task that each of these chatterer-boxes would be held personallyresponsible for.Even in those days, just as it is done in private business, I always demandedthat we continued searching until the most clearly capable and honest person wasfound to act as an official, administrator, or leader for the movement. He wouldthen be given absolute authority and freedom to act with his subordinates. Onthe other hand, he would also be completely responsible to his superiors. At thesame time, no one was to be given any authority over subordinates unless he wasan expert himself in the field of work he supervised. Over the course of twoyears, I succeeded in establishing my idea and today it is generally accepted inthe movement, at least by those in the higher positions of authority. Thevisible success of this attitude became apparent in 1923. When I came to themovement four years before, not even a rubber stamp could be found. On November9, 1923, when the party was dissolved and its property was confiscated, theassets, including all valuables and the paper, then amounted to over one hundredand seventy thousand gold marks.( After the Beer Hall Putsch the NSDAP was banned by the government and theirassets confiscated. The Mark suffered hyperinflation and was basicallyworthless, however here Hitler specifically says Gold Mark, which is backed bygold, as distinguished from Paper Marks which were subject to inflation. The170,000 Gold Mark value is the equivalent of over sixty kilograms of gold orover 130 pounds of gold.)12. THE UNION QUESTIONIn 1922, the rapid growth of the movement compelled us to more closely defineour position on a question which still had not been fully resolved. In oursearch for techniques that would quickly and easily attract the masses, weconstantly ran into one objection: the working man would never completely belongto us as long as his work-life and economic interests were in the hands of menand union organizations with an opinion that was different from ours. Thisobjection is well founded. It was commonly believed that a worker who wasemployed in a particular field could not survive if he were not a member of thattradeunion. Not only was his job protected, but he could only obtain work if hewere a member of the union. Therefore, the majority of workers were members oftradeunions. These unions fought for higher wages and made wage agreements,which guaranteed the workers a certain income. Obviously all workers in thissituation profited as a result of the fights, and any honest man was bound tohave feelings of guilt if he accepted wages that resulted from the union'sstruggle but withdrew from the battle himself.It was very difficult to discuss these problems with the average privilegedclassemployer. They did not appear to understand and most did not even want tounderstand the financial or the moral side of the question. From the start, theyopposed any effort to organize their workers because they considered it to beagainst their own economic interests. For this reason alone, most of them areunable to form an unbiased opinion, just as in many cases, they fail to see theforest for the trees. Therefore, we must now turn to disinterested parties. Theywill be much more sympathetic toward a situation that is so vital to our presentand future life if they have the smallest degree of good will.In the first volume, I gave my opinion regarding the nature, purpose, andnecessity of trade unions. As long as there is no change in the relationshipbetween employer and employee, either by government decrees, which are usuallyineffective, or by general education, the employee will have no other choice andwill be forced to defend his own interests. The employee will have to take astand, as a participant in economic life, who is equal to the employer. Ifurther emphasized that taking protective measures would be within the interestsof the community if those actions prevented serious social injustices that wouldotherwise harm the entire community. Furthermore, I declared that theseprotective measures would be a necessity as long as there were employers whopersonally had no concern for social duties or for the most elementary humanrights. From all of this, I drew the conclusion that if selfdefense becamenecessary, it would logically have to come from the uniting of all workers intradeunions.My opinion on the subject has not changed since 1922. However, a clear andprecise definition regarding these problems had to be found. We could notcontinue in the satisfaction that we understood the problem. It was necessary todevelop a conclusion that we could put into practice.The following questions had to be answered: 1. Are tradeunions necessary? 2.Should the N.S.D.A.P. take an active part in the tradeunions or direct ourmembers to participate in some other form? 3. What form should aNationalSocialistic tradeunion take? What are our tasks and what are its goals?4. How can we establish such tradeunions? I believe that I have sufficientlyanswered the first question and shown that trade unions are necessary. It is mybelief that, under the present circumstances, we cannot eliminate thetradeunions. They are an important part of the national economic life. Theirsignificance goes beyond socialpolitics and extends into a much larger area ofnational-politics. When people receive the necessities of life as a result oftheir tradeunion movement, and the people are also properly educated about thegoals of the movement, they will be greatly strengthened and the entire nation'spowers of resistance in the struggle for existence will be increased. Thetradeunions are indispensable since they are the building blocks for the futurecouncil of economics and they will be the equivalent of our currentparliamentary groups.The second question can also be easily answered. If the tradeunions areimportant, then it is clear that National Socialism must not only take atheoretical side, but must also take a definite stand that will result inaction. But how? That is a more difficult question.The NationalSocialist movement is working with one goal in mind: TheNationalSocialist National State. Without doubt, all future institutions of thiscoming State must grow out of the movement itself. It would be a great mistaketo think that all of a sudden, with nothing in hand but the possession ofpolitical power, a reorganization could take place without previously building afoundation of men who are already trained in our beliefs and have proven theirloyalty. Even in this case, the spirit that fills the form is more importantthan the outward form itself which can quickly be created mechanically.For instance, a dictatorial type of leadership can be imposed on Stateorganizations, however, it will only survive if it has evolved through stages,from the smallest beginnings and gradually developed itself to maturity. Aftermany years of going through the continuous selection process and facing thetests of the hard realities of life, only then will the leaders needed to carrythis principle into reality be ready. Therefore, we should never think that wecould suddenly pull the constitutional outlines for a new state out of abriefcase and \"introduce\" them through pressure from above. This can beattempted, but the results will either not survive or it will be dead before itis born. This reminds me of the Weimar constitution, which provided the Germanpeople with a new constitution and a new flag that had no connection whatsoeverto the changes our people have endured during the last half century. TheNationalSocialist State must be careful not to try similar experiments. When thetime comes, the National Socialist State can only develop out of an organizationthat has been in existence for a considerable length of time. This organizationmust possess the NationalSocialist spark of life from the beginning so that itcan create a living NationalSocialist State.As I have emphasized, those who will seed the council of economics will comefrom the various bodies that represent the tradeunions. If, however, the futurecouncil representing the work guilds and the Central Economic Council are torepresent a NationalSocialist institution, these important seedmembers must alsobe the agents of a NationalSocialist conviction and carry with them our idea.The institutions created within the movement will then be transferred andincorporated into the State. This transfer must take place because the State isunable to suddenly, as if by magic, produce the needed institutions, and if ittried, they would be nothing more than lifeless formations.When we look at the big-picture, we see that it is necessary for theNationalSocialist to engage in activities related to tradeunions. It must do sofor another reason too. A genuine NationalSocialist education of employers andemployees--- an education that intends to make both of them members of the newpeople's community---will not be accomplished by teaching theories, makingappeals, or giving warnings. It will only be accomplished through a dailystruggle where our members are working among the people. Through this constantstruggle, the movement must educate the various large economic groups and bringthem closer together on the important issues. If this preliminary work is notdone, then the future people's community is just a mere illusion and all hope islost. Only the great WorldConcept ideal that the movement fights for can slowly,but eventually, lead people to create a new order that is seen as firmly unitedinwardly and outwardly. Therefore, the movement must not only accept the idea oftradeunions, but it must provide its large membership with the necessaryeducation for the coming NationalSocialist State by actively participating inthis community.The answer to the third question follows from what we have already discussed.The NationalSocialist tradeunion is not an instrument of class struggle, but aninstrument that represents the different occupations. The NationalSocialistState does not recognize any \"social classes\" and seeks a class-free society.Politically speaking, it recognizes only two groups: \"citizens\" who have fullyequal rights and fully equal obligations, and \"subjects\" who belong to the Statebut have no political rights at all."},{"pageContent":"The NationalSocialists do not see it as the tradeunion's task to bring certainmembers of the people into a union in order to gradually transform them into aclass that would later fight against other groups which were organized in asimilar way. We would never give tradeunions such a mission. But, this wasexactly the task assigned to unions the moment they became a tool in the fightof Marxism. A tradeunion does not automatically mean \"class struggle\", butMarxism has turned it into a tool for its own class struggle. It has createdthis economic weapon which is used by the international world Jew to crush theeconomic foundation of free and independent national states, and it is used tofurther the goals of their own national industries and their national tradedeals, and finally they use it to enslave free nations into the service of theJewish super-state of world-finance. (The Jewish super-state refers to the ideathat Jews exist in all major countries, thereby creating a virtual mass state oftheir own---an extension of the Jewish state within a state idea.) In contrastto this, the NationalSocialist tradeunion must organize groups who participatein the national economic process so that we can increase the safety of thenational economy and strengthen its power. We will take corrective actions byremoving all those abuses that, in the long run, have a destructive influence onthe national community, and those elements that harm the living strength of thepeople's community and of the state, and we will not overlook those elementsthat bring destruction and disaster on the economic structure itself.For the NationalSocialist tradeunions, the worker's strike is not a way todestroy or undermine national production, but instead serves to increase andimprove it by fighting all those antisocial imperfections which interfere witheconomic productivity and harm the existence of the people as a whole.An individual's capacity to contribute stands side by side with his legal andsocial standing in the economic process. This alone shows him how necessary hiscontribution to the community is towards creating his own prosperity. TheNationalSocialist employee must understand that the prosperity of the nationaleconomic structure means his own material prosperity. The NationalSocialistemployer must understand that the happiness and the contentment of his employeesform the foundation for the development of his own economic strength.NationalSocialist employees and employers are both officer and trustee of theentire national community. They are granted a high degree of personal liberty intheir work because experience has shown that when a man is given extensivefreedom, his capacity for work increases greatly, much more than it does bycoercion from above. Lack of freedom prevents the natural process of eliminationfrom occurring which blocks the promotion of the most capable, able, anddiligent people.The NationalSocialist tradeunion sees the worker's strike as a method that can,and probably must, be used as long as there is no NationalSocialistracially-orientated state. When the NationalSocialist State is established,however, it must take over the responsibility for legal protection and eliminatestruggles between the employers and employees. This struggle only decreasesproduction and it is harmful to the community. The Central Economic Council willsettle disputes and it must maintain a functioning national economy wheredefects and errors within the system, which are harmful to the economy, areeliminated. Issues today which are decided through the struggles of millions,will in the future be settled in meetings of the Central Economic Council. Then,employers and employees will not fight against each other in their battle overwages, which only damages their mutual economic interests. They will solve theseproblems together, guided by a higher authority, while constantly consideringthe well-being of the people and the State which will be in glowing letters asit constantly shines down upon their work.The iron principle that the Fatherland comes first and then the Party mustalways apply. The task of the NationalSocialist tradeunion is to educate andprepare everyone to work together and to maintain and protect our people andtheir State. This will be done by each individual according to the abilities,capacities, and powers which are either inherent or taught by the community ofthe nation.The fourth question: \"How can we establish such tradeunions?\" seems moredifficult to answer. Generally, it is easier to organize something new than tofix something old. It is easy to start a new business in a town where thatcertain business does not exist. It is more difficult to start that samebusiness if a similar business already exists in the town. It is even moredifficult if the economy will only support one of the businesses. Survival wouldrequire the new business organizers to not only introduce their own newbusiness, but they must also destroy the older established business so they cancontinue to exist.Creating a NationalSocialist tradeunion is senseless if there are other unionsoperating side by side. Our union must be totally convinced that it alone isnecessary to distribute its WorldConcept ; it must not tolerate other similar orhostile organizations, and it must emphasize its own importance---it isnecessary to the exclusion of all other organizations. There must be no commonarrangements and no compromise with similar organizations. We must maintain theabsolute, sole right to exist.There were only two ways that could lead to such a development: 1. We couldorganize our own tradeunion and then, gradually, fight against the internationalMarxist tradeunions, or 2. We could infiltrate the Marxist tradeunions and tryto indoctrinate them with the new spirit of our movement to transform them intofollowers of our new ideas.The following problems prevented us from taking the first course of action. Ourfinancial troubles were still rather considerable at that time and we had verylittle money at our disposal. The gradually-increasing inflation made thesituation even more difficult in those years. The increasing inflation made itimpossible to say that the tradeunions gave any financial advantage to theirmembers. From the individual worker's point of view, there was no reason to paydues to the tradeunion at all. The already-existing Marxist unions were nearcollapse until millions of marks fell into their lap because of the brilliantRuhr-action of Mr. Cuno. (Wilhelm Cuno was Chancellor of Germany from 1922 to1923. He is known for promoting passive resistance, or non-work at mines etc.,in the occupied territory against the French after they invaded the Ruhr and forcreating hyperinflation in Germany by paying the workers to not work.) Thissocalled national Reich Chancellor may be titled the savior of the Marxisttradeunions.In those days, we could not count on receiving such financial aid. No one hadany incentive to join a new tradeunion which could offer him no advantagesbecause of its own financial weakness. I also had to object strongly to creatinga new organization if it would provide nothing more than a plush job with littlework to brilliant men. The question of personnel played a very important role.At that time, I did not know of a single man I would have trusted to tackle thishuge task. Anyone who could have crushed the Marxist tradeunions in those daysand could have replaced their institution of destructive class war by helpingthe idea of NationalSocialist tradeunions to victory would be a man who belongedto the really great men of our nation.A carved bust of him would have needed to find a place in the Valhalla atRegensburg for the sake of posterity. ( Regensburg is a Bavarian city where theWalhalla Temple is located, which is a hall-of-fame type building in classicRoman style built in 1807 to commemorate great figures of the Germanrace/ethnicity in history. It includes a marble interior with busts of famouspeople.) Unfortunately, I did not know of any head that would have beenappropriate on such a pedestal. We must not be misled by the fact that theinternational tradeunions were run by men of only average intelligence. Thismeans nothing because when their groups were created, there were no otherorganizations in existence. Today, the NationalSocialist movement must fightagainst a gigantic organization that has been in existence for a long time andhas developed itself in every detail. A conqueror must always be a greatergenius than the defender he wishes to defeat. It is possible today to maintainthe fortress of the Marxist tradeunion with the help of ordinary bigwigs, yet itcan only be stormed by the great energy and brilliant capacity of anoverwhelmingly greater man on the other side. If such a great man cannot befound, then it is useless to argue with Fate, and it is even more foolish toforce the issue and charge ahead using men who are poor substitutes forgreatness.Here, we must apply the principle that in life, it is sometimes better to let amatter rest for the time being than to start it only halfway or begin badlybecause of the lack of proper forces. In addition to this, there was anotherconsideration that should not be dismissed. Then and now, I had the firmconviction that it is dangerous to combine a great political world-philosophicalfight with economic matters, particularly in the early stages. This isespecially true with our German people. An economic struggle will immediatelyredirect energy away from the political battle. As soon as the people believethat their new economy will allow them to buy a little house, they will devotethemselves exclusively to this task. Then they have no more time for a politicalbattle against those who plan to someday, one way or another, take away fromthese people the pennies they have saved. Instead of fighting in a politicalbattle for the insight and convictions they have gained, they become totallyabsorbed in their dream of a cottage settlement. In the end, they findthemselves sitting between the chairs. (A reference to a German saying, \"Tryingto sit on all of the chairs and ending up sitting between them\", which actuallymeans \"Torn between conflicting interests\". However, here it more specificallymeans \"Torn between two interests and ending up with nothing\", or \"Not sittingon a chair at all\".) Today, the NationalSocialist movement has just begun itsstruggle. To a large degree, it still has to form and to perfect the image ofits WorldConcept . It must fight with all its energy to make its great ideals areality. Success is only possible if the complete power of its collective beingis, without reservation, used in the service of this battle. Today, we have aclassic example of how a people who have been completely distracted by economicproblems will become paralyzed and lose their fighting strength. The Revolutionof November, 1918 was not caused by tradeunions, but it prevailed in spite ofthem. The German privilegedclass will not fight for the future of Germany in apolitical battle because it believes the future is secured adequately throughbuilding up the economy.We should learn from such experiences because the same thing would happen to usif we focused on economic concerns too strongly. The more we gather the completestrength of our movement together for the political battle, the sooner we cancount on success in all aspects. The more we prematurely take upon ourselves theload of tradeunions, housing problems, etc., the less our cause will advance asa whole. It is true that these objectives are important, but they can only berealized on a large scale once we are in a position to press the public powerinto the service of this idea.Until that time, these problems would only paralyze the movement and the earlierit tries to solve them, the worse the condition would become because theseeconomic distractions would lessen its worldpolitical ambitions. This couldeasily result in the tradeunion interests guiding the political movement insteadof the WorldConcept forcing the tradeunions to march along with it.However, a NationalSocialist tradeunion can only benefit the movement and ourpeople if it has already been influenced by our WorldConcept and national ideasso strongly that there is no danger of it following Marxist ways. If ourNationalSocialist tradeunion saw its mission as merely competing with theMarxist tradeunions, it would be worse than having no tradeunion at all. TheNationalSocialist tradeunion must declare war against the Marxist tradeunion,not only as an organization, but, above all, as an idea. In striking at theMarxist union, our tradeunion must also challenge their promotion of the classstruggle and even the very class idea and set them aside so that we can becomethe guardian of the professional and occupational interests of German citizens.All these points made a clear argument against the organization of our owntradeunions, at least, until an individual suddenly appeared who was obviouslycalled by Fate to solve this very problem.So, there remained only two other possibilities: We could recommend to our ownParty members that they quit the tradeunions or recommend that they remain thereand cause as much damage as possible. Generally, I recommended the secondchoice. We could easily make this recommendation without much difficulty in 1922to 1923. During that time, there were no financial advantages offered by thetradeunions due to the high economic inflation rate. This meant that even thoughour membership was not yet very large---because the movement was so new---oursmall number of members were still able to cause a great deal of damage. TheNationalSocialist believers were the severest critics of the Marxist tradeunionsand, in spite of our small numbers, we still caused a lot of damage within theunions.In those days, I turned down any suggestion that we attempt an experiment thatwas obviously doomed to failure. I would have considered it a crime to takemoney in the form of union-dues from the meager earnings of a worker to supportan institution---our tradeunion---when I was not convinced our union could giveits members some kind of advantage.When a new political party disappears, it is not a disaster, but almost always abenefit, and no one has a right to complain because the contributions of anindividual to a political movement are given without any expectation ofreceiving something in return. But, anyone who pays his dues to a tradeunion hasa right to expect the benefits which have been promised to him. If organizers donot see this responsibility, then the organizers of such a tradeunion are, ifnot swindlers, then at least reckless men who must be held accountable.This is the view that guided our actions in 1922. There were others whoapparently knew better than we did and they organized their own tradeunions.They criticized us for not having one because they saw it as the most obviousproof of our mistaken ideas and limited insight. But it was not long beforethese organizations disappeared. The end result was exactly as we predicted, butwith one difference: in the end, we had not deceived ourselves or anybody else.13. GERMAN ALLIANCE POLICIES AFTER THE WARThe inconsistency and failure to establish sound guiding principles in creatingforeign alliances by the leaders of the Reich not only continued after theRevolution, it became worse. Before the war, a general confusion in politicalideas caused our state foreign affairs leadership to be very poor. Then, afterthe war, it was poor because of a plain lack of honest desire for such a policy.It was obvious the groups that had finally achieved their destructive aims bythe Revolution were not interested in a policy of alliances which would havestrengthened Germany and restored a free German State. Such a development wouldhave contradicted the purpose of the November crime. Not only would it haveinterrupted or even ended the process of making the German economy and workersdependent on other nations, which was the internationalization of Germany, butbeyond that, the political effect within Germany resulting from a battle to makeGermany free from dependence on foreign countries would have had disastrousconsequences later on for the present representatives of the Reich's government.What they feared the most was any effort that would make the Reich independentof foreign countries.Such an effort could eventually be disastrous to those in power who needed tomake the country as dependent on international elements as possible.A revolution within a nation can never occur unless it is preceded by a periodwhere strong national sentiment is built up and the people's patriotic spirit isnationalized to a fevered pitch. Conversely, huge foreign policy successes haverepercussions among the people which can also create patriotic feelings andtherefore have the same result. It has been proven by experience that everybattle for liberty leads to an increase in self-awareness of national spirit,which is an increase in patriotism. This leads the people to be much moresensitive to elements that are antinational or trends that appearanti-patriotic. Such trends or people which are tolerated or even ignored duringpeace times are suddenly met with rejection and resistance in times whennational enthusiasm is stirred up, and this often proves to be fatal to thoseantinational elements. We only have to look back at the widespread spy-scarethat suddenly explodes in the feverish heat of human passions when war breaksout. This kind of patriotic spirit frequently leads to brutal and unjustpersecutions during wartime, even though everyone should see that the danger ofespionage is even greater during the long years of peace, but no one paysattention to it during those relaxed times.The parasites which were washed to the surface by the events of November, withtheir fine instincts alone, have seen in their future the possible destructionof their own criminal existence. If our nation were backed by a wise policy offoreign alliance, it would move the country toward freedom and sovereignty,which would kindle the national passions and this patriotism would result in theend of these parasites. Knowing this, we can now understand why, since 1918, theforeign policy of our \"responsible\" government officials has always failed andwhy the national government constantly and intentionally works against the realinterests of the German nation. At first this appears to have no purpose, butwhen it is studied more closely, we see the logical pursuit of a policy adoptedin the 1918 November Revolution.Admittedly, it is necessary to differentiate between those leaders responsible,or rather, those who \"should have been responsible\" for our national affairs,the average member of our parliament, and the large, stupid flock of our ownpeople who have sheep-like patience.Some know what they want. The others just follow along either knowingly orbecause they are too cowardly to fight ruthlessly against something theyrecognize as harmful. The last group is submissive because of their lack ofunderstanding and their stupidity.Problems regarding foreign policy were considered by some of our followers to beminor as long as the NationalSocialist German Workers' Party was a small andlittle-known society. This is because our movement must, and always hasproclaimed that external national freedom is never given as a gift by heavenlyor earthly powers, but it can only be the fruit that results from inner strengthof the nation. The external battle for liberty will only happen after we removethe cause of our collapse and those who benefit from the nation's destruction.From this standpoint, it is easy to understand why, during the first days of theyoung movement, the questions of foreign policy took second place to the vitalaims for domestic reform.However, as soon as the scope of this little, insignificant club grew andfinally blew up into the importance of a large association, it becameimmediately necessary to outline a program about foreign policy. Standards hadto be established, which were not only in harmony with our WorldConcept , butthey also had to flow from of our way of thinking and expand it into foreignaffairs.The lack of foreign policy training among our people creates an obligation forthe young movement to educate our internal leaders and the large masses so thatthey understand the broad ideas behind our foreign policy aims. This is thefirst step toward carrying out our foreign policy plans which must prepare thenation to regain our people's freedom and to recover real economic sovereigntyfor the Reich.An essential principle must always guide us: Foreign policy is just a means toan end and its purpose is exclusively the improvement of our own nation. It isimpossible to decide any question in the area of foreign policy from anyviewpoint other than this one: Is it now, or will it be in the future,beneficial to our people or will it be harmful to them? This is the onlyquestion that must have any weight in considerations, humanitarian ideals, anddisregarded.making decisions. Party politics, religiousall other viewpoints must be completely Before the war, it was the task ofGerman foreign policy to assure that our people and their children on thisplanet received the food and supplies they needed by opening a path that wouldlead to this goal and win the needed allies who could also provide additionalforces needed in the war. Today's task is the same with one difference: Beforethe war, the aim was the preservation of the ethnic German people through theforces of the independent power of the State which existed at that time, buttoday we must give the people strength by reestablishing an independent statepower. This power is the basis for any practical foreign policy that aims topreserve, foster, and nourish our people in days to come.In other words, the aim of Germany's foreign policy today must be to prepare forregaining freedom tomorrow.To accomplish our goal, we must remember this fundamental principle: The chanceof regaining independence for a people does not depend on unifying a territoryor region, but it depends more on the existence of at least a small part ofthose people, and they must have the necessary freedom and capability to takeover the leadership of the spiritual union of their people and to make thenecessary preparations for a military battle to win their freedom.If one hundred million men together accept the yoke of slavery in order toprevent the breakup of their state territories, that is worse than if thisgovernment and people had been crushed, leaving only a part of them enjoyingfull liberty in a smaller territory. At least this is true if this last grouphas a vision of its holy mission and it constantly proclaims its spiritual andcultural unity with those they are separated from, and it is ready to preparethe weapons needed for a final liberation so they can reunite with theunfortunate oppressed parts of their community.We also must remember that regaining lost territories, which once belonged tothe people of a state, primarily requires regaining political power andindependence for the mother country. In other words, the desire to regain lostterritories must be ruthlessly postponed, and the primary interest of regainingliberty for the main territory of the country must be the only immediate goal.The liberation of oppressed and cut-off splinters of a nation---or of provincesof an empire---cannot be accomplished through a strong desire by the oppressedpopulation or through a heartfelt protest by those who have been left behind; itis accomplished only through the power of the surviving pieces of the sovereignFatherland.Therefore, the first step in regaining lost territories is the intensivedevelopment and the strengthening of that part of the State which remains. Thepeople must be motivated and filled with unwavering resolve so that, when thetime comes, they will use the entirety of the newly-earned power they havecreated to liberate and unify the entire nation! We must ignore the interests ofthe lost territory for it is secondary to the one interest, which is to gain theneeded political power and strength that will be required to correct that whichhas been done by the enemy. Oppressed lands are not brought back into the lap ofa common Reich by fiery protests, but by a mighty sword.It is the responsibility of the national leaders to forge that sword throughtheir foreign policy. The purpose of this foreign policy must be the securing ofweapons and finding allies.Previously, I discussed the halfhearted policy of alliances which was pursuedbefore the war. Of the four possible ways of preserving and feeding our nation,the fourth and least practical was the one chosen. Instead of a sound Europeanterritorial expansion policy, we concentrated on expanding colonies and makingtrade agreements with other countries. What made this even worse was theleadership's way of thinking; they believed these policies would help them avoidany armed conflict. They tried to sit on all the chairs at the same time and theresult was the proverbial fall between the chairs. The First World War was onlythe final bill marked payment-due which was presented to the Reich in testimonyof its ill-conceived foreign policy.Even at that time, the third path would have been the right one: strengtheningthe power on the European continent by winning new territory, which would makesolving colonial problems more practical and easier at a later time. We couldhave only achieved this policy either through an alliance with England orthrough an abnormal strengthening of military power, but that would require usto ignore cultural development for forty to fifty years. Even so, one could havetaken the responsibility for such a plan of military expansion if it werenecessary to assure independence. The cultural importance of a nation is almostalways derived from its political freedom and independence. Independence isrequired in order for great culture to exist or even be established. Nosacrifice is too great if it maintains the political independence of a nation.Whatever is withdrawn from cultural development today, and diverted to anexceptionally strong development of military powers, will later be fully paidback. It is safe to say that after such a concentrated effort toward preservingthe independence of a nation, it is usually offset afterwards as the nationbecomes at ease and relaxed. This relief of pressure generates an astonishingsituation where the previously neglected cultural energies of the nationflourish. The distress of the Persian wars led to the bloom of the PericleanAge, and even in between the Punic wars, the Roman State began to devote itselfto the service of a higher culture. (The Periclean Age, or the Golden Age, is aperiod in ancient Grecian history which began after the end of the Persian Warsin 448 B.C. Pericles was an outstanding personality in politics, philosophy,architecture, sculpture, and literature. The Punic Wars were between Rome andCarthage and were one of the largest wars up to that time in the ancient world.The wars ended in 146 B.C.) It is true that putting all the interests of anation in the background in order to focus on the one task of preparing for acoming war and fighting for the future protection of the State, is a decisionwhich cannot be trusted to a majority of parliamentary fools andgood-for-nothings. The father of Frederick the Great was able to prepare for warby ignoring everything else, but the Jewish brand of fathers participating inour parliamentary foolishness are not able to do what is needed. Because of thisfailure, preparing arms in order to acquire new land in Europe could only bedone in moderation during the prewar days; that is why we could not adviseagainst accepting the help of proper allies.Since they did not like the idea of systematically preparing for war, they quitthinking about acquiring new territory in Europe. By turning to the developmentof colonies and trade policies, they sacrificed any possibility of forming analliance with England, but then, the next logical thing to do would have been toseek support from Russia if we could not ally with England, and that too wasignored. Deserted by all would-be allies except the Hapsburg shysters, wefinally stumbled into the First World War.The character of our present foreign policy shows no evidence of a plan orstandards at all. Before the War, the fourth method was wrongly chosen and thenit was pursued only halfheartedly. After the Revolution, there is no evidencethat any plan was applied to foreign policy no matter how closely we look. Thereis less careful planning today than there was before the War, except possiblyfor the plans attempting to crush the last chance we have to make our nationrise again.A cold, unprejudiced review of the distribution of power in Europe of todayleads to the following conclusions: For the last three hundred years, thehistory of our continent has been decisively influenced by England's attempt, inroundabout ways, to maintain the balance of power among European countries whichensures no one becomes too powerful and she has the necessary protectivecovering for her great world political aims. Since the days of Queen Elizabeth,British diplomacy has traditionally been deliberately aimed at preventing, byany means necessary, the rise of any European country beyond the scope of anestablished balance of power. If necessary, any rising power would be blocked bymilitary force. The path of British diplomacy can be compared to Germany'straditional use of the Prussian army.England used whatever methods were called for by the situation, but the ironwill and the determination to use these methods were always the same.As England's position became more difficult over time and the mutual rivalrygrew over the individual greatness of countries, the more the British governmentfelt it necessary to paralyze the powers in Europe. The political fracture ofthe former North American colonies from England led to an even more concentratedeffort to maintain its support in Europe. After England crushed Spain and theNetherlands as great sea powers, the efforts of the British State wereconcentrated against the rising power of France. (There were four AngloDutchwars but this reference is most likely about Britain's defeat of the Dutch Navyin the Battle of Camperdown, 1797, during the French Revolutionary Wars, and theFrench Navy and Spanish Navy in the Battle of Trafalgar, 1805, during theNapoleonic Wars.) Finally, with the fall of Napoleon I, the danger of adomination from this military power appeared to be definitely broken and thishad been the most dangerous threat to England. The position of Britishstatesmanship changed very slowly before eventually developing a hostileattitude towards Germany. For a time, the German nation's lack of any internalunity presented no obvious threat to England. Also, public opinion, which isinfluenced in a certain direction by government propaganda, is rather slow inchanging attitudes toward the new objective. The sober realization the statesmendeveloped was taken and converted into an emotional sentiment of the people, andthis sentiment is stronger in its effect and does not change over time. Astatesman can redirect his thoughts toward new aims immediately after he hasreached his goal; however, the masses can only be won over as tools of the newidea presented by their leadership through the slow work of propaganda.By 1870-71, England had already taken a definite new position. Unfortunately,Germany did not take advantage of the occasional waverings in England that werecaused by America's growing importance in world economics and Russia'sdevelopment of political power. The failure of Germany to act at this criticaltime allowed the historic tendency of British policy to become more and morefirmly established.England came to regard Germany as a power whose influence in trade and worldpolitics, which resulted from her enormous industrial build-up, was growingfrighteningly fast. The two countries began to contend with each other incertain areas. The conquest of the world by \"peaceful economic expansion\", whichappeared to our statesmen to be the last and greatest word in wisdom, becameBritain's reason to organize resistance against us.This resistance assumed the form of a well-organized attack which was totallyconsistent with their statesmanship because their aims were never maintainingworld-peace, but strengthening British world dominion. England's effort tosecure as allies all the states that could eventually provide militaryassistance was the natural result of her traditional caution in estimating thestrength of her opponent and her own weakness at the time. This cannot be termedas \"unscrupulous\" because the organization for war must not be judged by heroicstandards, but by how efficient it is in reaching the goal. It is not the taskof diplomacy to see that a nation dies heroically, but to make certain itsurvives using any practical means available. Every road that leads toward thatgoal of survival is valid, and failure to follow that path is a criminal neglectof duty.With the Revolution in Germany, the British's worries about a threatening Germanworld domination ended in redemption, and the British felt their fears had beenjustified. However, at that time, England had no interest in seeing Germanycompletely exterminated from the map of Europe. On the contrary, the disastrouscollapse of November, 1918 put British diplomacy face to face with a newsituation that at first had seemed impossible.For four and a half years, the British Empire fought to break an allegedsuperior continental power. All of a sudden, a total collapse occurred thatseemed to wipe out this power entirely. The lack of even the most primitivespirit of selfpreservation became so apparent that within forty-eight hours theEuropean balance of power seemed to have been taken off its hinges. Germany wasdestroyed and France became the strongest political power in Europe.The huge amount of propaganda that was spread during the War, influencing theBritish people to persevere and maintain their ground and at the same timegreatly incited them by stirring up primitive instincts and passions, now becamea lead weight restricting the British statesmen's power to make decisions. TheBritish achieved their war aim when Germany's colonial, economic, and tradepolicies were destroyed, but anything beyond this was harmful to Britishinterests. Only England's enemies would profit by wiping out German power incontinental Europe. In spite of all this, from November of 1918 until late inthe Summer of 1919, the position of British diplomacy was fixed and immovable. Asudden change was not possible because the emotional strength of the masses hadbeen exploited more than ever during the long war, and the temperament of themilitary powers had been established firmly. France had taken the opportunityinto her own hands and was in a position to dictate orders to everyone else.Germany was the only power that might have brought about a change during thosemonths of bargaining and negotiating, but she was in the middle of civil war.Germany announced through her mouthpiece statesmen repeatedly that she was readyto accept each and any dictate imposed on her.If one nation ceases to be an \"active\" ally because its spirit ofselfpreservation disappears, it usually degenerates into a nation of slaves andits country becomes more like a colony. In order to prevent the power of Francefrom becoming too great in Europe, England had no other choice than toparticipate in France's lust for more and more of what they could take.In fact, England failed to achieve her war aim. The rise of a European statebeyond the balance of power among the countries of Europe had not beenprevented, but firmly established.In 1914, Germany, as a military state, was wedged in between two countries---oneof them being equal in military power, the other having greater military power.Then, we faced the superior strength of England on the sea. France and Russiawere the only countries who placed obstacles in Germany's path and excessivelyresisted the development of Germany's expansion. In addition to this, theunfavorable geographic position of the Reich, from a military point of view,created a safety-factor which prevented an excessive increase in our country'spower. The coastline was also unfavorable for military battle with Englandbecause it was small and cramped, but, the battlefront of the interior was wideopen to the other countries.France's position is very different today. From a military standpoint, she isthe greatest power, without any serious rival on the European continent. Herborders in the south near Spain and Italy are protected. She is protectedagainst Germany by the helplessness of our Fatherland. The French coastline runsin a long front parallel to the vital nerve center of the British Empire. Notonly are these British centers potentially important targets for airplanes andlong-range artillery, but most of British trade would be wide open to the dangerof submarines. A submarine war would have disastrous effects because France hasan advantage with the long stretch of the Atlantic coast and the equally longstretches of the French territories bordering on the Mediterranean in Europe andNorth Africa where they have military bases.So, the political result of the battle against Germany's developing power wasthe creation of French dominance on the continent. The military result was theconsolidation of France as the greatest military power on land and theacknowledgment of the American Union as an equally strong sea power.The economic result was the surrender of large areas of British influence totheir former allies. To the same degree that traditional British political aimswanted to see Europe broken apart into smaller units, France strove to breakGermany into smaller parts. England's longterm desire is to prevent the rise ofone continental power to world importance above others. They want to maintain acertain balance of power among the European states because this is what isrequired for British world domination.France has always wanted to prevent Germany from becoming a united power bymaintaining the system of small German states with well-balanced military powersand no central unified leadership, and they want to occupy the left bank of theRhine which is essential in order to secure her dominance in Europe. Theultimate aims of French diplomacy will forever be in opposition to the ultimateaims of British statesmanship.From the previous point of view, anyone who examines the present alternativesfor countries that can ally with Germany must be convinced that the onlypossible connection we can make is with England. Although the results of Britishpolicies during the war have been disastrous for Germany, we must not overlookthe fact that England is no longer interested in completely crushing Germany. Onthe contrary, as the gears of British policy turn in the years ahead, it isbound to aim more and more at inhibiting the endless French desire fordominance. An alliance can never be made by looking at past disagreements, butalliances are made productive by the knowledge gained from past experience. And,experience should have taught us all that alliances with negative goals areinherently weak. The Fate of nations become welded together by the promise ofcommon success in the sense of common gains, mutual conquests, and in short, anexpansion of power for both allies.It is obvious that our people are not accustomed to thinking in terms of foreignpolicy. When our people read current press reports concerning the great\"friendliness toward Germany\" displayed by various foreign statesmen, the peopleassume these individuals have an attitude toward our people that somehowguarantees they will support us politically. This is incredibly foolish and anexample of the unparalleled simplicity of the average small-minded middleclassGerman who dabbles in politics. There is not a single British, American, orItalian statesman who could be called \"pro-German\". As a statesman, everyEnglishman is, of course, an Englishman first; an American is an American first,and no Italian will ever be ready to pursue a policy that is not pro-Italian.Therefore, anyone who expects to build up alliances with foreign nations becausethey feel there is a pro-German attitude among their statesman is either an assor a deceiver. The fates of nations are never linked together by mutual respector even affection, but only because both nations expect to gain somethinguseful. For instance, an English statesman will always pursue policy thatbenefits the English and never one that benefits the Germans. Yet, it ispossible that some particular elements of this pro-English policy are identicalto pro-German interests. This unity may only exist to a certain degree and itmay someday change; however, this is where a statesman will show his masterfulhand. If he wants to carry out plans vital to his own nation, he will, whennecessary, find those partners who must travel the same road in order to promotetheir own interests.Knowing all of this, we can now focus on a result that will benefit us the mostand this can be found in the answers to the following questions. What countriescurrently do not want to see France's military and economic power increase untilit attains absolute domination, which would be the result if the Germaninfluence in Central Europe is eliminated? Based on their current situation andtheir traditional policy up to now, what other countries will see the rise ofFrance as a threat to their own future? One must be perfectly clear about thismatter: France is and remains the unappeasable enemy of the German people.Whoever rules or will reign in the future in France, whether they are Bourbons,Jacobins, bourgeois followers of Napoleon, clerical Republicans, or redBolsheviks, the final aim of their foreign policy will always be to takepossession of the frontier along the Rhine river and to make this river securefor France by breaking up Germany and keeping it broken.England does not desire Germany as a world power, however, France does not wanta Germany at all, as a world power or not. There is a big difference in thesetwo ideas! Today, however, we are not fighting to regain our position as a worldpower because we have to struggle for the very existence of our Fatherland, forour national unity, and for the daily bread of our children. When we look aroundfrom this standpoint in search for European allies, only two countries are leftfor us---England and Italy.England has no desire to see a major power develop in France, whose militaryfist is unrestrained by the rest of Europe, and who can implement a policy whichsooner or later is bound to clash with British interests. England can neverdesire to see France in possession of the huge western European iron and coalmines because that could easily give the French a dangerous economic worldposition. Furthermore, England can never desire a France whose political statuson the continent is so well protected that it can begin expanding French worldpolicy. This will not only become possible by crushing the rest of Europe, butinevitable. If France pursued this policy, the old Zeppelin bombers might bemultiplied a thousand times every night. (Germany attempted to use Zeppelins inthe First World War as bomb and gun platforms, but they proved to be veryvulnerable to gunfire. Only thirteen crafts existed at the start of the war andfive of those were shot down before their offensive use was abandoned.) France'smilitary power presses greatly on the heart of Great Britain's world empire.Italy cannot desire to see the French control of Europe strengthened. Italy'sfuture will always be affected by changes in the territories close to theMediterranean basin. Italy's motive for entering the War was not a desire tomake France more powerful, but it joined the War to give a deathblow to herhated rivals along the Adriatic Sea. Any further increase in France's strengthon the continent will hinder Italy in the future. We would be deceivingourselves if we believed that any kind of kinship which exists among the nationswould eliminate rivalries.A cool and unbiased analysis shows that England and Italy are the two stateswhose own natural interests are the least opposed to the existence of a Germannation and, to a certain degree, their goals are along the same path asGermany's goals.In evaluating our options for an alliance, we must remember three things. Thefirst one lies within ourselves, the other two with England and Italy.Can you imagine any state wanting to be an ally with the Germany of today? Howcan a country wanting to pursue their own aggressive goals possibly ally itselfwith a state whose leadership has for years presented a picture of the mostdeplorable weakness and shown themselves to be pacifist cowards? Who would wantto ally with people whose participation in the Marxist delusion has caused themto blatantly betray the interests of their own people and country? How could anypower that hoped to unite in a fight for joint interests someday, expect toenter into a valuable relationship with a state that apparently lacks allcourage and has no desire to lift even one finger to defend its own life? Willany power that sees an alliance as something more than a treaty to maintain asteady state of decay, like the disastrous former Triple-Alliance, risk its veryexistence by obligating itself to a state that has shown its character bycreeping into a corner in shy submission from those forces outside the countryand shameful oppression of nationalistic virtues at home? Will a world powerrisk an alliance with a state that has lost all greatness since it no longerdeserves it, a government that cannot even boast of respect by its own citizens,or leaders who find no greater admiration in other countries? No, never.A power that has any self-respect and expects more from an alliance than to paycommissions to interest-hungry parliamentarians will not enter any agreementwith the Germany of today; this is something they simply cannot do. After all,our present unfit condition for any alliance is the main and ultimate reason forthe unity of our enemies who are dominating over us. Germany never fights backexcept by a few fiery protests from our parliamentary elite. The rest of theworld has no reason to fight for our protection. As a matter of principle, Godnever liberates cowardly people, no matter what the continued whining of ourpatriotic societies may claim---the fight for freedom is the obligation of thestates themselves. Even those countries that do not directly seek our completedestruction see no other option except to participate in France's lootingexpeditions. They can at least prevent France from gaining all of the spoils byagreeing and participating in the robbery.Secondly, we can see that it would be difficult to change the attitude of themajority of people in former enemy countries. After all, they have beeninfluenced by mass propaganda to think a certain way. It is impossible tocondemn a nation as \"Huns\", \"Robbers\", \"Vandals\", etc., for years and thensuddenly discover the opposite is true and recommend their previous enemy as afuture ally.Even more attention must be paid to a third fact that will be essential infuture European alliances. While it is not in England's interest to crushGermany any further, such a fall greatly interests the Jews of internationalfinance. The difference between the official or rather, the traditional Britishstatesmanship and the leading Jewish financial powers, can be seen clearly bylooking at the different attitudes about British foreign policy. The Jewry offinance wants to see the complete economic destruction of Germany and herabsolute political enslavement. This is contrary to England's welfare interests.The internationalization of our German economic system, by transferring controlof German working strength into the possession of Jewish world finance, can onlybe completed through a state that is politically Bolshevik. However, in orderfor the Marxist shock troops of the international Jewish capitalists to finallybreak the backbone of the German National State, it needs the kind cooperationfrom outside forces.Therefore, they must have France's armies storm the structure of the GermanState and continue to batter it until the Reich falls victim to the Bolsheviksoldiers controlled by the Jew of international world of finance. Today, the Jewis the driving force behind the complete destruction of Germany. Wherever in theworld we read offensive articles about Germany, the Jews have manufactured them.During peacetime, as well as during the war, the Jewish financial and Marxistpress intentionally incited the hatred against Germany until one state afteranother gave up its neutrality and joined the World War coalition, ignoring thereal interests of their people in the process.The thought process of the Jew is clear. The conversion of Germany to aBolshevik State requires the extermination of the nationalistic ethnic Germanintelligent sector and then the exploitation of German workers under the yoke ofJewish world finance. This is just the beginning, then the Jewish strategy forconquering the world will spread further. As it has happened so often inhistory, Germany is again right in the middle of the huge struggle. If ourpeople and our state become victims of these money-obsessed Jewish bloodytyrants, then the whole world will be ensnared by this octopus. If Germanysucceeds in liberating herself from its clutches, the greatest danger facing allthe nations of the world can be considered smashed. We can be certain the Jewswill undermine our efforts as much as possible in order to maintain or increasethe hatred of the world toward Germany. The interests of the nations that arebeing poisoned are hidden from their own eyes so that they are confused by theJewish press and do not realize that they are not acting in their people's realinterests. In general, Jewry will fight in different nations using differentweapons. The Jew chooses the weapon that appears to be the most powerful basedon how the people in that particular nation think and he always chooses theweapons that promise the most success.Our own national body lies severely torn from the standpoint of \"blood\" (meaning the Aryan race is split, and the bloodline is impure). Jewry uses thiscondition to spread a pacifist way of thinking through these \"cosmopolitan\"circles (cosmopolitan means \"world-citizen\" or Jewish) in their battle to gainpower, which comes from their international ideologies. In France, its weapon iseasily recognized and they have evaluated its power correctly, it is thefanatical patriotism of the French. In England, its weapon is the economic andworldpolitical viewpoints. In short, the Jew always employs a method thattargets the way the respective nation thinks. Only after it has achieved acertain overshadowing influence in economic and political power can it throw offthe shackles of such traditional weapons so it may operate unrestricted. This iswhen it reveals its true intentions and the goals it is fighting for. Thedestruction then progresses more and more quickly---it destroys state afterstate, creating the ruins on which the sovereignty of the eternal Jewish Empireis to be established.In England, as well as in Italy, the difference between the views of the old andmore solid statesmanship, and the goals of the Jewish financial world is soobvious and even crude, it jumps out at your eye.Today, only France shows a fundamental agreement between the intentions of thestock exchange, as represented by the Jews, and the desires of the fanaticalpatriotic members of their nation's statesmanship. The fact that both views arealong the same lines constitutes a huge danger for Germany. For this reason,France is and will remain absolutely the worst enemy of Germany. Because of itscorruption by the negro and its agreement with the aims of the Jewish worlddominion, France represents a constantly-lurking danger to the existence of thewhite race in Europe. The heart of Europe has been infected by negro blood onthe Rhine. This corruption matches the sadistic perverse vindictiveness of thisfanaticallypatriotic, arch-enemy of our people; they are just like the icy-coldcalculating Jew who uses this method to begin the bastardization processstarting from the heart of Europe, and through infection by inferior people,they plan to deprive the white race of the foundations for a sovereignexistence.The present actions of France, which sprang from her own desire for vengeanceand were carried out under the leadership of the Jews, is a sin against theexistence of the white man. Someday, their actions will cause all the avengingspirits of a generation, which has recognized the degeneration of a race, to beunleashed on that nation for their sin against mankind.For Germany, however, the danger posed by the French means we have a duty toforget about bad feelings of the past and join hands with those who are alsothreatened as long as they are unwilling to suffer or tolerate France's lust forpower. In the foreseeable future, there will only be two possible allies forGermany: England and Italy.If we bother to look back at Germany's foreign policy after the Revolution, weare shocked by the constant failures of our government. A man who sees theconstant and incomprehensible decline of his government can only drop his headin despair or feel the beginning of an internal desire for a flaming rebellionagainst such a regime. These acts cannot be dismissed as the result of poorunderstanding. The mental Cyclops of our November parties have done things thatwould be inconceivable to anyone who had a working brain. (The Cyclops has oneeye; this reference means the parties are functioning on half a brain.) Theyactually solicited France's favor. (The reference to soliciting France's favorrefers specifically to a parliamentarian named Walther Rathenau, who was TheForeign Minister of Germany at the time and a Jew with some connection to theFreemasons. He met with representatives of French industrialists where he made anumber of agreements in 1922.) Yes, indeed, with touching simplicity only seenin these visionaries, who never seem to learn, they have repeatedly tried tooffer themselves to France. They have bowed to the \"great nation\" and, in everycunning trick of the French executioner, they thought they saw the first signsof France's change of heart. The actual puppeteers behind our politics were notso foolish. For them, the pursuit of France's affection was nothing more than ameans to block every effort that could lead to a sound alliance policy.They were never in the dark about the aims of France and her backers. However,their cool calculation forced them pretend they honestly believed it waspossible to change the Fate of Germany by cuddling up with France, otherwise ourpeople would probably have chosen a different path.It is not easy for us to present England to the rank and file of theNationalist-Socialist movement as a possible future ally. Our Jewish press hasbeen too successful in concentrating hate against England. Many good and stupidGerman gimpel willingly landed on the sticky twig which was specially pruned bythe Jew to capture them. (Gimpel is a German name for the bullfinch, littlebirds, also meaning one who is so extremely foolish they are saintly. The birdsare known for becoming trapped on a species of tree with sticky branches.) Theychatted about \"reviving\" German naval power; they protested against the plunderof our colonies and recommended taking our colonies back. The Jewish scoundrelthen took this information to his tribe in England so they can use it for theirpropaganda. It should by now become clear to even our privilegedclass simpletonsplaying in politics that our fight is not over \"power on the seas\" etc. Evenbefore the war, it was crazy to concentrate the forces of Germany on the seawithout first protecting our position in Europe. In politics today, suchfoolishness is called a crime.It often drives one to despair looking at the way Jewish puppeteers havesuccessfully kept our people preoccupied with unimportant matters and agitatingthem into demonstrations and protests. While they were distracted, Francecarefully removed one piece after the other from the body of our nation,destroying the foundation of our independence.I must mention one particular hobby-horse which the Jew rode with special skillduring those years: South Tyrol. Yes sir, South Tyrol. ( South Tyrol was part ofthe AustrianHungarian Empire and was annexed by Italy at the end of the FirstWorld War including ethnic German areas. Many Germans were angry at the loss ofthe territory; however, Hitler was not as concerned about it and considered thearea unimportant. This annexation by Italy was not part of Wilson's FourteenPoints Plan for the division of territory, but nothing was done to stop it.) Canyou not look at any of the faces of our intellectual fools and see the flame ofutter indignation burning? If I take up this question here, at this point, I doso in order to settle an account with that same lying crowd which counts on theforgetfulness and the stupidity of the masses of our people. This group pretendsthey are upset over South Tyrol's loss, but the feeling of anger when it comesto abuses of the nation is more foreign to these parliamentary rascals than theidea of property rights is foreign to a magpie.I wish to state here and now that I personally was one of those who actuallydefended this territory through my service in the army. The fate of South Tyrolwas decided from early in August, 1914 until November, 1918. I did my share offighting in those years not because I thought South Tyrol should be lost, butbecause I felt that South Tyrol, together with every other German territory,should be preserved as part of the Fatherland.The parliamentary tramps took no part in the fighting. Not this gang of sneakingthieves who spent their time playing party politics instead. On the contrary,while we fought, believing that only victory could preserve South Tyrol for theGerman people, the mouths of these Ephialtes schemed and plotted so long againstthis victory until finally Siegfried yielded to the stab in the back.( Ephialtes was a soldier who betrayed the Spartan army. He is said to have toldthe Persians about the pass of Thermopylae around the mountains, which they usedto attack in the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C., so this reference means atraitor. This reference could also refer to a Greek Ephialtes who made majorgovernment changes, taking power away from some, and was assassinated as aresult, which would mean a big talker who damages the government in thiscontext. This is the second reference to Ephialtes so it is possible Hitlermeant to balance the first mention with a second of a different person as anintellectual joke to see who would understand the second reference or if theywould assume it meant the same as the first reference. Siegfried is a German wayof saying 'the average Joe' or 'John Smith', or a Germanic German; it is thename of a character in Wagner operas but may have been used earlier as an'everyman'.) The possession of South Tyrol by Germany was not guaranteed by thelying and inflammatory speeches from those elegantly-dressed parliamentarians onthe Vienna City Hall Square or in front of the Field Marshalls' Hall in Munich,but only by the battalions fighting at the front. Those who broke up this frontnot only betrayed South Tyrol, but also betrayed all the other Germanterritories. Anyone who believes today that the question of South Tyrol can besolved by protests, speeches, local parades, etc., is either especiallymischievous or a typical German middleclass citizen.It must be completely understood that, at this point, the lost territories willnever be won back by prayers to the dear Lord or by pious hopes in a League ofNations, but only by force of arms. Therefore, there is only one question leftto ask: Who is willing to regain the lost territories by armed force?Personally, as far as I am concerned, I can assure anyone that I have enoughcourage to put myself at the head of a newly-formed parliamentary stormbattalionconsisting of parliamentary chatterboxes and party leaders and their variouscounselors, who can all take part in the victorious conquest for South Tyrol.The Devil knows I would be glad if all of a sudden a shrapnel shell burst overthe heads of these demonstrators in this \"fiery\" protest. I am convinced that ifa fox broke into a henhouse, the cackling could not be any worse and thechickens could not run for safety any faster than what would occur at this\"protest-rally\".The disgraceful part of it all is that these gentlemen know they cannot gainanything by such protests. They know better than anybody else that all theirfuss is harmless and hopeless. They do it only because, naturally, it is easierto chatter about recovering South Tyrol today than it would have been at onetime to fight for its preservation. Everyone does his part: then we sacrificedour blood; today these people sharpen their beaks.It is pleasing to watch those in Vienna, who support the Monarchy system, whentheir comb swells up to express their outrage in their efforts to regain SouthTyrol. Seven years ago, however, the noble and illustrious dynasty, the RoyalHouse of evil---with the lying deceit that they are so proud of---is the veryone that helped the world coalition take, among other things, South Tyrol. Inthose days, these same men were happy to support the policy of their treacherousMonarchy and did not care a bit about South Tyrol or anything else. Today, ofcourse, the battle for these lands has become much easier.Now the battle is fought with \"mental\" weapons. It is much easier to talkoneself hoarse in a \"protest meeting\" expressing righteous anger or to get asore finger writing newspaper articles than it is to blow up bridges during theoccupation of the Ruhr territory. (This is a reference to the saboteurs in theRuhr after the First World War who blew up railroad tracks etc. after the Frenchtook control of the region.) The reason why certain groups recently made thequestion of \"South Tyrol\" the focus of GermanItalian relationships is veryobvious. Jews and supporters of the old Monarchy are deeply interested inpreventing a German alliance policy that might eventually lead to the rebirth ofa free German Fatherland. It is not the love for South Tyrol which prompts allthese fake protests. These calls-to-action do not help the interests of SouthTyrol, they harm them. What drives these people is not the hope of regainingSouth Tyrol, but it is the fear of a possible GermanItalian agreement iftensions between our countries should subside.The general tendency to lie and slander is part of the nature of these groupswho coldly attempt to make themselves appear as if they are filled withimpudence and pride and that their indignation implies we somehow \"betrayed\"South Tyrol. These gentlemen should be told as plainly as possible that, first,South Tyrol was \"betrayed\" by every healthy German who from 1914-1918 could notbe found anywhere at the front or did not offer his services to the Fatherland.And second, South Tyrol was betrayed by everyone who failed to strengthen ournation's endurance so we could finish the war and those who failed to build upthe determination of the people to see this struggle through to the end. Third,South Tyrol was betrayed by all of those who participated in the NovemberRevolution, either by direct action or indirectly by cowardly tolerance of it.Those who allowed it to happen destroyed the only weapon that might have savedSouth Tyrol. In the fourth place, South Tyrol has been betrayed by all thosepolitical parties and their supporters who put their signatures to the treatiesof shame: The Treaty of Versailles and St. Germaine. Yes sir, my \"courageous\"Mr. Word-protester, this is how things are! ( The Treaty of St. Germaine, 1919,between the Allies and the new Republic of Austria made vast territoriesindependent or otherwise took them from Austria and included reparations to bepaid by Austria.) Today, I am guided by the cool reasoning that lost territoriescannot be conquered by the words of our parliamentarians, whose tongues aresharpened by constant babbling, but they can only be conquered by a sharp swordthrough a bloody battle. I do not hesitate to say that the die has now been castand I believe it is impossible to regain South Tyrol through war. I would alsopersonally decline to take such an action because I am convinced that it wouldbe impossible to generate enough passionate national enthusiasm among the Germanpeople to guarantee a victory. On the contrary, I believe that if such blood hasto be sacrificed, it would be a crime to do so for two hundred thousand Germanswhile next door seven million are suffering under a foreign regime and the vitallifeline of the German people has become the playground of hordes of Africannegroes (meaning the occupation of the Ruhr where the French used black races insome areas as troops).If the German nation is to end a condition that threatens to exterminate it fromEurope, it must not fall into the errors of the pre-war period and make enemiesof God and the world. It must, instead, determine who the most dangerous enemyis and strike at him with concentrated force. If sacrifices in other areas mustbe made to achieve this victory, future generations of our people will notcondemn us for it. The more glowing our success, the more they will be able toappreciate the serious distress we are under and the deep concern which leads tosuch a decision.Today, we must be continuously guided by the principle that regaining lostterritories is primarily a question of regaining the lost political independenceand power for the mother country. A wise foreign policy that allows us to formstrong alliances is the first step toward creating a powerful foreign policy forour State. We NationalSocialists must be especially careful not to be taken inby our Jew-led privilegedclass patriots who prefer to battle with words. Ourmovement will be in trouble if it indulges in protest speeches, like they do,instead of preparing to fight! One reason for the ruin of Germany was the\"fantastic\" idea to create a Nibelungenalliance with the corpse of the HapsburgState. Holding onto our enormous feelings of allegiance from the past when itcomes to our foreign policy of today is the best way to definitely prevent ourrise to power.( Nibelungen is a Germanic name from mythology, however, here it appears to becited from Wagner's opera, The Ring of Nibelung, where it means \"dwarf\" as wellas additional details from the opera storyline including how the dwarves hadtheir treasure stolen, or in this reference, a possible meaning is \"forming adwarf-like alliance of no value between the naive Germans with the corpse of theAustrian State\".) I feel compelled to take this opportunity and deal brieflywith objections the previous discussion raises. First, would anyone be willingto enter an alliance with the present Germany in view of her obvious weakness?Second, would it be possible to change the attitudes of enemy nations towardGermany? Third, is the existing influence of Jewry stronger than all reason andgood will, which would make it impossible to follow through on any plans, nomatter how good the intentions? I believe I have already answered the firstquestion sufficiently. It should go without saying that nobody will seek analliance with present Germany. No nation in the world would dare to link itsfate with a State whose government gives no reason for them to have anyconfidence in it. Many of our fellow countrymen may attempt to condone or evenexcuse the acts of the government by pointing out the pitiful mindset of ourpeople, but we must strongly object to this.There is no doubt that for the last six years, the decline in our people'scharacter has been pitiful. Their indifference toward the most importantnational interests has been depressing, and the cowardliness has become so badit frequently cried out to Heaven for relief. However, one must not forget thatin spite of all our troubles, these are the same people who only a few yearsearlier gave the world a wonderful example of the highest human virtues.Beginning in the days of August, 1914 until the huge struggle of nations ended,no people on earth have shown any greater manly courage, any strongerperseverance, any better endurance, or a greater patience than our Germanpeople---our people who have now become equally miserable. However, nobody canclaim that our present shame is an accurate representation of our people'scharacter.What we find today, in us and around us, is only the dreadful, unreasonable, andillogical result from that act of perjury on November 9th, 1918. We can easilyapply the word of the poet when he says evil begets evil. (A theme fromShakespeare's Macbeth and other plays--- evil creates further evil, however,this is not an actual quote.) Yet even in these days, the fundamentally goodelements of our people have not been totally lost. Those qualities are sleepingunderneath the surface and once in a while, like lightning against the darkcurtain of night, virtues flare up that the future Germany will someday rememberas the first signs of an approaching recovery. More than once, thousands andthousands of young Germans have united voluntarily and joyfully, all of themdetermined to once again sacrifice their young lives on the altar of theFatherland as they did in 1914. Even today, millions of men are workingindustriously and diligently as if no revolution had ever brought destruction.The blacksmith is again standing at his anvil, the farmer is at the plow, andthe scholar sits in his study. All of them are working hard in an effort to dotheir duty.The oppression coming from our enemies is no longer met with indifferentlaughter, but now it is met with bitter and worn faces. There is no doubt that agreat change in our attitude has taken place.If all this has not sparked a resurgence of the desire for political power andof the spirit of selfpreservation in our people, then the blame can be placed onthose men who, since 1918, have ruled our people to death. They do not rule bythe call of Heaven, but by their own self-appointment. If anyone disapproves ofthe state of our nation today, he must be asked, \"What has been done to improveit? Is the tiny amount of support received by the people as a result of the fewdecisions our government has made significant enough to deal with the weaknessof our people, or is it just a sign of the government's complete failure tohandle its most precious treasure? What did our government do to restore thenational spirit of proud independence, manly defiance, and wrathful hatred?\" In1919 when the Peace Treaty was forced on the German people, one could haveeasily hoped this tool of unlimited oppression would make the cry for Germanliberty louder. Peace treaties which strike demands upon the people, like lashesfrom a whip, frequently turn out to be the first drumbeat signaling anapproaching rebellion.How easy it would have been to make use of the Treaty of Versailles! It wouldhave been simple to take this tool of endless extortion and shameful humiliationand, with a determined government, turn it into a tool that could be used tostimulate national passions to a fevered pitch! How easy it would have been touse a targeted system of propaganda to turn the indifference of a people intoresentment, and the resentment into flaming rage because of these sadisticcruelties! How easy it would have been to burn every single one of these Treatypoints into the brain and into the heart of our people, over and over, untilfinally, it was branded on sixty million heads of men and women, and thecommonly felt shame and hatred would have become one flaming sea of fire! Out ofits glow an iron will would have emerged and a cry would have come forth, \"Wewant arms again!\" Yes sir, such a peace treaty can very well serve this purpose.The excessive measures it contains, the oppression and the shamelessness of itsdemands---those are the greatest weapons which can be used for propaganda toarouse the dormant spirit and spark the life of a nation.For this to happen, everything from children's books to every last newspaper,every play, every motion picture show, every billboard and every available spacemust be used for this one great mission. In this way, the fear-stricken prayersof our patriotic social clubs, \"Lord, make us free!\" will transform in the mindof even the smallest boy into the burning plea, \"Almighty God, bless our armswhen the day comes; be as just as Thou hast been always; judge now as to whetherwe deserve the freedom or not; Lord, bless our struggle!\" But, every opportunitywas missed and nothing was done. It is no wonder that our nation is not what itshould be or what it could be. How could it possibly be anything else since therest of the world sees us as their attendant who might be a more obedient dogand gratefully lick the master's hand after it has been beaten.There is no doubt that the attitudes of our people do not help our ability toenter into alliances, but our governments are the greatest drawback. Theircorruptness is to blame for the fact that, after eight years of unendingoppression, there is little desire for liberty left.A strong alliance policy depends on our nation receiving the necessary amount ofrespect from other countries. This respect depends on the existence of apowerful government that refuses to be nothing more than a collaborator withforeign states or the caretaker who finds it unpleasant to manage its ownstrength, but instead it should be the voice of the national conscience. If ourpeople had a government that understood this as its mission, six years would nothave passed without the champions of a daring foreign policy for the Reichappearing who could gain the support of a daring people who long for freedom.To the second question regarding the great difficulty in changing the previousenemy nations into friendly allies, we offer the following answer: The generalantiGerman psychosis that wartime propaganda has created in other countries willcontinue to exist until the German Reich can appear as a State again through aclear and visible revival of German Will and a revival of the spirit ofselfpreservation. The State must be able to take its place on the Europeanchessboard and show that it can also play the game with others. Only after thegovernment and the people can guarantee the security that is necessary foralliances will it be possible for one or the other powers, someone who hascommon interests, to consider changing the opinion of their people through theirown propaganda efforts. This, too, will require years of continuous, cleverwork. The very fact that a change in public opinion requires so much time is thereason for undertaking it carefully. No country wants to start these activitiesunless they are confident that such work will be valuable and bear fruit in thefuture. The empty talk of a more or less creative foreign minister is not avalid reason for changing the mental attitude of a nation if they have noguarantee that such an attitude change will be valuable. Otherwise, thisapproach would only divide public opinion. The security that makes futurealliances possible is not created by smooth talking members of the government,but by the visible stability of a government and a corresponding support in theform of public opinion. The faith of our people in this policy will be evenstronger if the government is visibly active in propaganda that supports itswork, and the public opinion is clearly reversed through this effort, which willthen be reflected in the actions of the government.Any nation that is in our position will only be considered fit for allianceswhen government and public opinion jointly and fanatically proclaim theirdetermination to fight for liberty and uphold that determination through action.This will form the foundation that will be later used to change the publicopinion in other states. These states understand the realities of the world anddesire to pursue their own interests which causes them to willingly join handswith a suitable partner and enter into an alliance.There is still another important matter to be considered. It is very difficultto change a certain mental attitude of a nation and the new attitude will not atfirst be understood by many; therefore, it is a crime and foolish to makemistakes that your opponents can use as weapons against you later.It is important to understand that this change will require a certain length oftime before the people fully grasp the intentions of the government. This isbecause the ultimate aims of certain political moves cannot be revealed to thepublic and must be accepted based on the blind confidence of the masses or theintuitive understanding of the more intellectuallydeveloped leading groups. Notmany people possess this clairvoyant visionary political understanding. Since,for political reasons, the motives behind these political actions cannot beexplained, there will always be a portion of the intellectual leaders who willoppose the new trend and they will call it an experiment, because to them thegoals appear vague and they cannot see where these actions are leading. Thismakes the conservatives in the state oppose anything they do not understand.However, it is critically important to remove all potential weapons as soon aspossible from the hands of these people who might disturb a policy that willlead to mutual understanding. This is especially true when the problem resultsfrom purely fantastic ideas dreamed up and chattered about among puffed-uppatriots, would-be politicians, and small town coffeehouse politicians, as inour case. If we look at the situation from a cool, logical standpoint, we seethat any call for a new war fleet or the restoration of our colonies etc. isobviously just silly talk that has no chance of actually happening.In England, these foolish statements are used against us politically. Sometimesby harmless, sometimes by insane political warriors, but either way, they alwaysserve the purposes of our mortal enemies. This is not good for Germany. A manbecomes exhausted battling this threat through his antagonizing demonstrationsagainst God and the rest of the world, and he forgets the first, essentialprinciple to all success: Whatever you do, do it thoroughly. When we howl atfive or ten countries, we cannot concentrate on all the intellectual andphysical forces needed for a shock to the heart of our wicked enemy. Suchhowling sacrifices the chance to strengthen ourselves for the final struggle bysecuring alliances. The NationalSocialist movement has a mission in this area aswell. It must teach our people to disregard insignificant objectives and to keepin mind the greater objective. We must not divide ourselves over unimportantmatters, but remember that today we are fighting for the basic existence of ourpeople and we must strike against the sole enemy that is robbing us of thatexistence.This may hurt us, sometimes bitterly. But we must not abandon all common senseby fighting with the whole world and foolishly yelling at them instead ofconcentrating all our powers against the deadly enemy. In addition, the Germanpeople have no moral right to criticize the rest of the world until thecriminals who sold out and betrayed their own country are brought to justice.There is no holy justification for howling and protesting from far away againstEngland, Italy, etc., when we turn around and allow the scoundrels to continueabout their business who reaped the rewards from the enemy's war propaganda andwho took our weapons away, and who shattered our moral backbone, and who soldthe resulting paralyzed Reich for thirty pieces of silver.The enemy only did what could have been expected. We should learn from hisattitude and actions. Anyone who cannot rise above the situation to see thismust then admit we have to give up any possibility of forming an alliancebecause that chance has definitely been eliminated. If we cannot enter into analliance with England because she robbed us of our colonies, or with Italy sinceshe took South Tyrol, or with Poland or Czechoslovakia for obvious reasons, thatleaves only France, who incidentally stole AlsaceLorraine, which means nobodyelse is left in Europe.There can hardly be any doubts about how an alliance with France would serve theinterests of the German people. When someone does propose this idea, there isonly one question to ask: Is this opinion being expressed by someone who is asimple drip or by cunning crooks out to deceive us? When this suggestion is madeby political leaders, I always choose to believe they are of the cunning crookvariety.Therefore, a shift in the disposition of previously hostile nations may occur iftheir future interests are along the same lines as our own, and if they can seethe domestic power of our State and its determination to defend our existence,only then will we once again appear as a worthwhile ally. This change inattitude can only occur if those who oppose an alliance with our former enemiesare not fed weapons as a result of our clumsiness or even criminal acts on ourside.The answer to the third objection is the most difficult one. Is it conceivablethat the representatives of the true interests of those nations we could form analliance with will be able to carry out their intentions against the will of theJew who is the mortal enemy of free people and nations? Will the powers ofBritish statesmanship, for instance, be able to break the disastrous Jewishinfluence or not? This is a very difficult question because it depends on toomany factors to reach to a conclusive answer. One thing is certain, there is onestate where the present government has firmly established itself and thegovernment exclusively serves the interests of that country to such a degreethat international Jewish groups cannot prevent political necessities---theirinterference has been made impossible.The fight waged by Fascist Italy against the three main arms of Jewry is thebest indication that, indirectly at least, the venomous fangs of this Jewishsuper-state are being pulled out. Some may believe this was unconscious on thepart of Italy, but I do not. Suppression of the secret Freemason Lodges,persecution of the Jewish super-national press, and permanently endinginternational Marxism along with steadily strengthening the fascist state ideawill eventually allow the Italian government to serve the interests of theItalian people more and more without paying any attention to the hissing of theJewish world hydra.The situation in England is more difficult. In this country of \"free democracy\",the Jew dictates his will almost without any limitations today through theindirect means of public opinion. Yet, there is still a constant strugglebetween the representatives of the British State's interests and the advocatesof a Jewish world dictatorship. The contrasting viewpoints became clear for thefirst time after the war when the attitude of the British government toward theJapanese problem conflicted openly with the press. (After the First World War,the U.S. and Japan became growing naval powers and Britain had to choose anally. They chose not to continue an existing alliance with Japan and signed theWashington Naval Treaty of 1922 between Britain, the U.S., Japan, France, andItaly. This decision limited the British Navy size and was hotly debated inBritain for many years afterward.) As soon as the war was over, the oldirritations between America and Japan appeared again. It was impossible for thegreat European powers to remain indifferent to this new threat of war. Even theold ties of kinship cannot prevent England from feeling envy and anxiety when itcomes to the constant growth of the American Union in every area ofinternational, economic, and power politics. It seems as though the one-timecolonial territory---the child of the great mother---is growing up to become anew master in the world. It is easy to understand why England today reviews herold alliances with caution and why British statesmanship anticipates fearfullythe time when the slogan will not be \"England rules the seas\", but will become,\"The seas belong to the Union\".It is much harder to confront the gigantic American State with its enormouswealth of virgin soil than to confront the German Reich wedged in-betweenvarious countries. If the dice were thrown to decide Fate today, England wouldface disaster if she found herself alone. Therefore, she anxiously reaches outfor the yellow fist and all hope is based on an alliance that is irresponsiblefrom a racial standpoint, but which offers the only possibility forstrengthening the British world position against the growing influence of theAmerican continent.Even though they shared the battlefield in Europe, the British government couldnot make up its mind whether or not it should loosen the alliance with theirAsian partner. On this question, the entire Jewish world press suddenly attackedthe possibility of an alliance.How is it possible that the newspapers of a Northcliffe, who were the faithfulshieldbearers in the British battle against the German Empire, suddenly brokeranks and chose a path of their own? (This idea and much of the following aboutAmerica came from carmaker Henry Ford's newspaper, Dearborn Independent. Hitlerwas very interested in Henry Ford's theories. Northcliffe was a title BaronNorthcliffe bestowed on Alfred Harmsworth, a newspaper magnate who was alsocalled Lord Northcliffe. He controlled the Times and other papers and was knownfor influencing propaganda against the Germans in the First World War.) TheBritish did not seek the destruction of Germany; that was a Jewish interest.Today, the destruction of Japan is not in the political interest of England, butit does match the desire of the Jewish leaders and their longing for a Jewishworld-empire. While England over-exerts herself to maintain her position in theworld, the Jew is organizing an attack in order to conquer it.The Jew already sees the present European states as tools in his fist,controlled by either the indirect means of western democracy or in the form ofdirect control through Russian Bolshevism. The old world is not the only onethat he holds in his net. He also threatens the new world with the same fate.The Jews rule the financial powers in the American Union. Each year they becomemore and more the master, controlling the working power of one hundred andtwenty million people. Today, there is one great man, Ford, who has preservedhis independence and is still irritating the Jews. (Later editions of Mein Kampfomitted the name Ford, which referred to carmaker Henry Ford. This reference mayhave been removed at the request of Henry Ford due to social and politicalpressure he received because of his antiSemitism; however, it is more likely itwas removed by order from Hitler because of a public apology Henry Ford made tothe Jews in 1927, which was issued after he was forced to shut down thenewspaper, and in court Ford claimed he had no idea what his antiSemiticnewspaper had been publishing.) With cunning skill, the Jew molds public opinionand forms it into a weapon used in the battle for their own future. The topleaders of Jewry already see the time approaching when their proverbial prophecyof the Old Testament will be fulfilled and they will completely devour thenations of the earth. Yet, if one single independent state remains within thislarge flock of Jewish-controlled colonial territories, which have been strippedof their national qualities, that one state can still ruin all of their work inthe last hour because a Bolshevized world can only exist if it completelyencompasses everything. If just one state preserves its national strength andgreatness---the Jewish ruling world empire, like every tyranny in thisworld---is bound to succumb to the power of the national idea.The Jews have sinned for a thousand years, which has taught them how to adapt.He knows very well that he can undermine European nations and turn them intogeneric race-less bastards, but he can hardly do the same to an Asian nationsuch as Japan. Today, he presents himself like a mime, pretending to be aGerman, or an Englishman, or an American, or a Frenchman, but he cannot create abridge to reach the yellow Asian. Therefore, he must instead try to destroyJapan using other nations in order to rid himself of this dangerous adversarybefore he has taken the last bit of political power into his fist and completedhis tyranny over the helpless masses. He is so nervous over having a Japanesenational state in his Jewish thousand-year empire that he wishes to destroy iteven before establishing his own dictatorship.For this reason, the Jew is today inciting the nations against Japan as he oncedid against Germany. While British statesmanship is trying to build an alliancewith Japan, the BritishJewish press is already fighting against the ally andpreparing their war of annihilation while pretending to fly the flag ofdemocracy and shouting the war slogan, \"Down with Japanese militarism andimperialism!\" The Jew in England has today become defiant. Because of this, thestruggle against this Jewish world menace on Japan will start in England.The NationalSocialist movement has its biggest task to fulfill here. It mustopen the eyes of the people in all foreign nations and show them the true enemyof our world today. Instead of directing our hatred against fellow Aryans, whomwe may be separated from in every way, and with whom we must remember that weare bound together by blood and by a traditional common culture, and thereforewe must expose the mortal-enemy of humanity as the actual cause of all sufferingso that everyone will hate him. But above all, the movement must make sure thedeadly enemy is recognized in our own country and that the fight against himbecomes a flaming symbol that leads to a brighter time. Our actions will thenshow other nations the path to salvation for the struggling mankind of theAryan.May reason be our guide and Will our strength. May the sacred duty that drivesour actions give us perseverance and may our faith remain our supremeprotection. 14. EASTWARD ORIENTATION VS. EASTERN POLITICSI have two reasons that cause me to examine the relationship between Germany andRussia more closely.1. This question could be the most significant matter of German foreign policyin general.2. This question is the touchstone, which will test the ability of the youngNationalSocialist movement to think clearly and act rightly. (A touchstone is ablack stone once used to test the quality of gold or silver by scraping andcomparing the stone to a sample. The reference often means to test forgenuineness, quality, or courage.) I must confess that the second point hascaused me especially great worry. Our movement's supporters do not come fromgroups who are indifferent to politics, but they come from groups with radicalpoints of view. It is only natural that they come to us already burdened withprejudices and possess the narrow understanding held by those groups with whichthey were previously politically and ideologically connected. This does not onlyapply to the man who comes to us from the political left-wing. On the contrary,his previous education in politics may have been subversive; however, it wasbalanced by a natural and healthy instinct which remained within him. Therefore,it was only necessary to replace the influence planted in him previously by astronger and better one. Very often, the healthy instinct and spirit ofselfpreservation that still existed could be transformed into a very good ally.But it is much more difficult to teach clear political thinking to a man if hisprevious education was in fact reasonable and logical, but he sacrificed thelast shred of his natural instinct on the altar of objectivity. [He wants tolook at every argument from both sides, even when the other side is his enemy,even when doing so is contrary to his or his people's interests.] The members ofour socalled intellectuals are the ones who are especially slow when it comes torepresenting their own interests and those of their people in a clear andlogical way. Not only are they weighed down by perverse attitudes and foolishprejudices, but they have lost their natural urge for selfpreservation. TheNationalSocialist movement has to fight hard battles with these people because,in spite of a complete obsession with their fantasy ideas, which makes themincompetent, they believe everything they do is perfect. This conceit makes themlook down on other usually more sound people when they have no reason to do so.They are snooty know-it-alls who actually lack all capacity for reasoning andjudgment, which is critically important in all foreign policy plans and actions.Today, these very groups are starting a dangerous trend by diverting our foreignpolicy from a true representation of the racial interests of our people so thatit can instead serve their ideology and make their \"fantastic\" dream come true.Because of this, I feel it is necessary for me to discuss with my supporters ascompletely and clearly as possible the most important question of foreignpolicy, and that is our relationship with Russia. I will start by making thisgeneral remark: If foreign policy is the guideline for the relations of a nationto the rest of the world, those guidelines must be determined by certain facts.As NationalSocialists, we want to make the following statement about the meaningof foreign policy in a racial state: The foreign policy of a racial state has aduty to protect the existence of the race which forms the state on this planetby creating a natural, strong, and healthy relationship between the number andgrowth of the people and the quality of the soil and the size of the territoryoccupied.A healthy relationship only exists when the nutritional needs of a nation aremet through its own territory and soil. Every other condition, even though itmay last centuries or even thousands of years, is an unhealthy situation and,sooner or later, it will lead to harm or destruction of the nation. Only asufficiently large space on this earth guarantees a nation is free to continueto exist.The amount of land needed for expansion cannot be determined by the presentneeds of the people and it cannot even be determined by the production thatmight be possible based on the number of people. I have already stated in thefirst volume of this work in the chapter titled \"German Policy of AlliancesBefore the War\" that the territory of a state is important to the people as amilitary and political asset, not just a resource to feed the people.( There was actually not a chapter by that name in the first volume though thetopic was discussed.) Even after a people possess territory and soil inproportion to their numbers, it is still necessary to protect the land itselfthrough the vastness of that territory. This safety lies in the generalpolitical power of the state and that power, to a large extent, is determined bythe military value of the geography.Therefore, the German people will be able to defend their future only if theyare a world power. For almost two thousand years, the defense of our nationalinterests has been a matter of world history, if we can call our more or lessfortunate activities in foreign policy a defense. We ourselves have witnessedthe gigantic struggle of the nations during the years 1914 until 1918, which wasonly the struggle of the German nation for its existence on earth, but the eventitself is called the World War. The German people entered this war presumably asa world power. I use the expression presumably because, in reality, we were notready. If in 1914 there had been a different ratio between the square footage ofour territory and the population in Germany, then Germany would have been a realworld power. Apart from all other factors, it would have been possible to endthe war in our favor.It is neither my task nor even my intention to point out the \"If\" in case the\"But\" had not been present. I do, however, feel that it is absolutely necessaryfor us to see conditions as they truly existed, without coloring them, and topoint out their terrible weaknesses, if only to deepen the knowledge so thesituation may be understood within the ranks of the NationalSocialist movement.Today, Germany is not a world power. Even if we could overcome our presentmilitary weakness, we still could not claim this title any more. How muchimportance could there be in a structure on this planet that has such a pitifulproportion between its population and the available area as the present GermanReich? In an age when the earth is gradually being divided among nations, manyof which are so large they almost span entire continents, it is not possible tospeak in terms of a world power when our political motherland is restricted tothe ridiculous area of hardly five hundred thousand square kilometers (193,000square miles, slightly larger than California).From a purely territorial point of view, the area of the German Reich absolutelydisappears when compared to that of the socalled world powers.England does not prove the statement to be incorrect because the British mothercountry is really nothing but the giant capital of the British World Empirewhich possesses almost onefourth of the entire globe. There are other giganticstates like the American Union, Russia, and China. Some of these countries areten times the size of our present German Reich. Even France has to be includedin these states. Not only does she constantly increase and replenish her armyout of the negroid livestock from her enormous Empire, but also, from a racialviewpoint, her infiltration with negro blood is increasing so rapidly that wecould call it the creation of an African state on European soil. The presentcolonial policy of France cannot be compared with the Germany of the past. Ifthe present development of France continues for another three hundred years, thelast bit of French blood will sink into the European-African half-breed state [amulatto state] that is now being formed. It is a huge continuous settlement fromthe Rhine to the Congo and will be populated by a lower race that has beengradually created by continuous bastardization.This was the difference between the French and the old German colonial policy.The former German colonial policy was a halfhearted effort at best, just as waseverything we did. It did not try to enlarge the territory for settlement by theGerman race or try to increase the power of the Reich through the use of blackblood, which would have been a criminal act itself. The African Askari (name forAfrican soldiers serving in European armies) of German East Africa (now calledTanzania) represented a small, hesitant step in that direction. However, theywere only used to defend the colony. No one had ever considered using blacksoldiers on a European battlefield, of course, realistically it was impossibleduring the World War, and it never came up as an option during more favorabletimes. In contrast, the French saw the recruitment of black blood as anotherreason for their colonial activity.So, today we find a number of powers on the earth who have a considerably largerpopulation than Germany and who have greater political support for theirpowerful positions. When we compare the area and population ratio of the GermanReich with other rising world powers, Germany has never seen such unfavorableconditions, not since the beginning of our history two thousand years ago, notuntil today. At that time, we were a young, bold nation entering a world oflarge political structures that were already crumbling and we helped to disposeof one of the last giants, Rome. Today, we find ourselves in a world where largepower states are again developing while our own Reich gradually sinks deeper anddeeper into insignificance.It is necessary for us to coldly and calmly keep this bitter truth in our mind.It is necessary for us to study and compare the area and population of theGerman Empire throughout the centuries with that of other states. I am convincedthat everyone will come to the same alarming conclusion that I have alreadypointed out. Germany is no longer a world power, regardless of whether she isstrong or weak in the military sense.We are no longer in proportion when compared to the other great states of theworld. That is thanks to the disastrous leadership of our nation in matters offoreign policy, thanks to the absolute lack of a clearly-defined foreign policy,and thanks to the loss of all natural instincts and loss of the desire forselfpreservation.If the NationalSocialist movement wants to shine brightly in history and show itis ordained to pursue a great mission for our people, it must fully recognizeand feel deep pain over their situation on this earth. It must take up thefight, with courage and purpose, against the aimlessness and ineptitude that hasguided our foreign policy. Without regard to \"tradition\" or bad pastexperiences, it must find the courage to organize our people and unite theirstrength in a march forward on the road that will lead our people out of theirpresent narrow living area to new territory and new soil. We must liberate themforever from the danger of perishing from the face of this earth, and we mustnot allow them to serve others as slaves.The Nationalist-Socialist movement must attempt to remove the mismatch betweenour population and the size of our territory, the inequality between ourhistoric past and our present weakness. Our land must be seen as the source ofsurvival and the pivotal point of political power. In doing so, the movementmust always keep in mind that we are ambassadors of the highest level ofhumanity on this earth and are bound by a solemn duty. We can meet theserequirements if we work to make the German people race-conscious so they notonly breed dogs, horses, and cats carefully, but they show mercy toward theirown blood.When I call the former German foreign policy aimless and inept, the proof ofthat statement lies in the actual failure of this policy. If our people had beenintellectually inferior or cowardly, the results of their struggle on earthcould not have been worse than what we see today. The developments of the lastdecades before the war must not mislead us on this issue. (Before the FirstWorld War, Germany embarked on an imperialistic policy expanding its colonies inAfrica.) You cannot measure the strength of an empire by comparing that empireto itself; instead you must compare it to other states. This comparisonfurnishes the proof that not only have other states steadily increased in power,but they have ultimately become more powerful. In spite of any apparent rise inGerman power, the road that Germany traveled actually led farther and fartheraway from the other states. Eventually she was left far behind and theincreasing difference was not in our favor.We fell more and more behind, even in our population we continued to fallbehind. Our nation is certainly not surpassed by any other people on earth whenit comes to heroic courage. Considering everything, our people have sacrificedmore of their own blood to secure their existence than any other people onearth. Our failure can only be blamed on the way that courage was used.If we examine the political experiences of our people during the last thousandor more years, review all the countless wars and battles that have passed beforeour eyes, and examine the final results, we must confess that out of this sea ofblood, only three phenomena have appeared that we might identify as the lastingfruits of a foreign policy: 1. The colonization of the Ostmark, which wasaccomplished mainly by the Bavarians of old. (Ostmark means the Eastern March orthe eastern border land.) 2. The conquest and the push into the territory eastof the Elbe. (The Elbe is a major river in Germany that defines the uppereastern third of the country.) 3. The organization of the Brandenburg-Prussianstate by Hohenzollerns, which was a model as a nucleus and the crystallizationof a new empire.( The Hohenzollern or Prussian Royal Dynasty operated the Brandenburg-Prussiaterritory which was formed when the Duchy of Prussia and the Margraviate ofBrandenburg were united in 1618. The name of the territory later became Prussia,and this union ultimately resulted in the formation of the German Empire in1871.) This illustrates something that we should take as a warning for thefuture! The first two great successes of our foreign policy have become the mostlong lasting. Without them, our people would not play any part in the worldtoday. They represent the first and, unfortunately, the only successful attemptto match the increasing population with the available territory and soilquality. It is a tragedy that our German historians have never appreciated thesetwo facts because they represent the greatest importance to future generations.Instead, historians glorified everything else under the sun, including fantasticheroism, and praised the adventures of many battles and wars rather thanrecognize the insignificance most of these events had when we look at the vastdevelopment of the nation.The third great political success was the formation of the Prussian State.Through it, a special idea of state was cultivated and the modern spirit ofselfpreservation was grown through the German army. This Prussian State, and itsnewly-formed ideas about how a state should operate, did away with the beliefthat individual provinces should defend themselves and required the formation ofa national defense force. It is impossible to overemphasize the importance ofthis event. Even with the excessive bleeding of Germany, caused from being tornby the extreme trend toward individualism of states, which caused the Germanpeople to rot, the discipline that was established by the Prussian army allowedGermany to at least recover part of the long-lost ability to organize theprovince states. Other nations may still have a primitive need to group togetherin a flock, but our nation regained its structure as a result of the process ofmilitary training, which was a great accomplishment even if it was in partartificial and not a natural process. The termination of required militaryservice may not be important to dozens of other nations, but was of vitalsignificance to us. If it had not been for the educational influence of militarytraining, ten generations would have been delivered over to the evil effects oftheir disunity, to vice and a corrupt world view, they would be without theability to correct themselves, and then our nation would have lost the lastremaining passion for independent existence on this planet. The German spiritwould then have made its contributions to civilization only in the shadow offoreign nations without anyone knowing where such contributions originated. Wewould have become nothing more than cultural fertilizer until the remainder ofAryan-Nordic blood in us was finally spoiled or wiped out.It is important to note that the significance of these real political successes,which our people gained in their battles over a period of more than a thousandyears, are recognized and appreciated more by our opponents than by us. Eventoday, we rave about a heroism that robbed our nation of millions of its mostnoble members and, in the end, accomplished nothing (meaning the First WorldWar.) It is very important for our present and future that we learn thedifference between the real political successes of our nation and the eventswhere the spilling of national blood gained us nothing.We NationalSocialists must never ever become involved in the empty cheeringpatriotism that is common in the privilegedclass world. It is deadly dangerousto believe the last developments before the war will in any way guide our owncourse. The entire historical period of the nineteenth century does not containa single undertaking that we would be justified in pursuing today. In contrastto the behavior of representatives of that time, we must make the only goal ofall foreign policy once again the expansion of land so that it matches thepopulation. Yes, we can see from the past that we must have two aims for ourpolitical actions: Obtaining new land and soil must be the aim of our foreignpolicy, and the aim of our domestic policy must be the formation of a new,ideologically solid foundation for the interior of the country.I would like to briefly explain my position on whether the demand for territoryand soil appears to be ethically and morally justified. As terrible as it is tohave to justify this argument, it is necessary since even in the socalledrace-conscious circles, all kinds of suave but insincere speakers appear who tryto tell the German people the injustice of 1918 is the justification for theirforeign policy and they only want to recover what was lost. But then, they turnaround and assure the rest of the world that they only want racial brotherhoodand sympathy.Let me anticipate objections and propose the following idea. To demand thefrontiers of 1914 be restored is political foolishness which is so severe itappears criminal. This idea does not consider the fact that the Reich's oldborders were not drawn logically. In reality, the old borders were incompletebecause they did not include all Germans and they were certainly unreasonablewhen we consider the military value of the geography. Those borders did notresult from a carefully-considered political plan, but they were drawn at thespur of the moment during a political struggle that is still not over and somewere even drawn by random chance. It would be equally right, and in many casesmore just, to randomly select any other year in German history and reconstructconditions from that time and use that to justify our foreign policy goals. Thiswould make our privilegedclass world happy. They do not possess a singleconstructive political idea for the future. They only live in the past,actually, they live only in their own recent past because they cannot see beyondtheir own lifetime. Inertia compels them to continue along their current pathand makes them resist any change, which explains why they never go any faster intheir opposition. It is, therefore, obvious the political horizon of thesepeople does not reach beyond the borderlines of 1914. When they proclaim theywant those borders restored, they again repair the crumbling alliance of ouropponents. That is the only thing that explains why the alliance of the victorsis able to maintain itself intact even eight years after a world struggle inwhich nations with the most diverse desires and goals came together to takepart.All these nations profited by Germany's collapse. Their fear of our strengthpushed the greed and the envy that existed between them into the background.They saw the complete dismemberment of our Reich's heritage as the bestprotection against any future uprising. Their troubled conscience and their fearof the strength of our people has proven to be the most durable cement forkeeping the members of this coalition together. We did not disappoint them whenour privilegedclass world set up a political program for Germany that restoredthe boundaries of 1914. Everyone in the alliance of enemies who might think ofpulling out has to jump back in as a partner because he fears that if hewithdraws he will be isolated and the others may turn on him. Then he would nolonger have the protection of the individual allies so he merrily goes back tothe alliance. Every single nation feels threatened and intimidated by thisprivilegedclass slogan.At the same time, their plan is doubly foolish. First, because they lack thestrength to move their idea from the haze of night clubs into reality, andsecond, even if it could happen, the result would be so pitiful that, by God, itwould not be worth the bloodshed of our people again. It is unquestionable thatthe restoration of the borders of 1914 could only be accomplished by bloodshed.Only someone with a childlike naive spirit would think the Versailles Treatycould be changed by a plot or by begging for handouts. Such an attempt wouldrequire the character of a Talleyrand, and we do not have a Talleyrand on ourside. (Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord was an influential French diplomatunder Napoleon I and other rulers. He also established many of the borders ofthe Prussian empire. These borders allowed Prussia to create a powerfulposition, eventually resulting in German unification, and the borders remaineduntil the start of the First World War. Here the reference means Germany doesnot have such a Frenchman who would act in favor of Germany.) Half of ourpoliticians are shrewd individuals lacking any character and who are hostile toour people. The other half are kind, harmless, and agreeable morons.Furthermore, times have changed since the Congress of Vienna. Princes andprincely mistresses no longer bargain and haggle about borderlines of states;now the relentless world Jew fights for domination over the people. No nationcan remove this fist clutching at its throat except by the sword. Only theunited strength of a powerfully concentrated national passion can rebel againstthis international enslavement of the nations. However, such a process is andremains a bloody one.However, if we have a strong conviction that the future of Germany requires thegreatest risk, no matter what the outcome may be, then we must choose a goal,regardless of political considerations, and devote ourselves completely to astruggle that is worthy of our sacrifice.The frontiers of 1914 mean nothing to Germany's future. They offered noprotection in the past and they would give us no strength in the future. Theywill not provide the German people with unity, and they will not meet our foodrequirements. The military value of the old frontiers are not practical orsatisfactory either. They certainly will not improve our present standing amongother world powers, or rather our standing with the real world powers. Thedistance to England is not shortened, the vastness of the American Union is notreached, and France would not experience a substantial decrease in her worldpolitical importance. One thing, however, would be certain. Even if we weresuccessful, any attempt to restore the borderlines of 1914 would lead to furtherbloodshed for our people, but this time it would be to such an extent that noone would be left to make decisions and plan actions necessary to guarantee thelife and the future of the nation. The alternative would be that once Germanywas intoxicated by such an easy success, any further goals would be rejectedsince the \"national honor\" was already restored and, at least for the moment,all attention would focus on the few doors which would open for commercialprogress.In contrast to all this, we, as NationalSocialists, must hold tightly to ourgoals in foreign policy. We must secure the territory and soil that is due forthe German people for their place on this earth. This action is the only onethat could justify bloodshed in the eyes of God and of future Germangenerations. It would be justified before God because we are placed on thisworld to eternally struggle for our daily bread. We are beings who are givennothing and who owe their position as lords of the earth to the ingenuity and tothe courage that they use to fight for and preserve their position. Thissacrifice would be justified in the eyes of future German generations becausethey will know we did not shed the blood of one single citizen without the giftof a thousand others to the future. The securing of territory and soil willjustify the risk of the farmer's sons of today, for the future sons of Germany.Even though statesmen may be persecuted for their decisions today, someday inthe future, the responsible statesmen will be absolved of all bloodshed and ofall guilt for those sacrificed.I must sharply oppose those racialist writers who pretend to think that takingland like this is somehow a \"breach of sacred human rights\", and who oppose itthrough their penmanship, of course such written protests are in keeping withtheir beliefs. You never know who is truly behind such fellows. One thing iscertain; however, the confusion they create is welcomed by the enemies of ourpeople who look upon it most favorably. Their attitude provides a criminal levelof help in the weakening of our people and it removes from within our people thedesire for the one and only possession that can provide the necessities of life.No people on the earth hold even one square meter of territory and soil as theresult of any heavenly wish or higher right. The frontiers of Germany were laiddown by chance and they are only temporary during the current politicalstruggle, likewise, so are the frontiers of other nations. A thoughtless foolmay believe that the earth's surface is unchangeable like granite, but itactually represents only a pause in a slow development involving constantchange, which affects the people living along the boundaries of these lands.Perhaps by tomorrow it may even be destroyed or changed again by the greaterforces of nature.State frontiers are made by men and changed by men. The fact that a nationsuccessfully gains an immense territory does not establish a holy right to keepit for eternity. Gaining this territory only proves the might of the conquerorsand the weakness of those who tolerate them. This strength alone establishes theright to keep the territory. The German people are crowded on an impossiblysmall territory today and facing a pitiful future, however, this situation hasnot been decreed by Fate, and to revolt against it is not an insult to Fate. Ahigher power has not granted more territory to some other nation instead ofGermany, just as no higher power is offended by such an unjust distribution ofterritory. Our ancestors did not receive the land we live on as a present fromHeaven, but they had to risk their lives and fight for it. In the future, wewill not obtain the land and the life it offers for our nation through any actof Heavenly generosity. We will only obtain the land we need through the mightof the victorious sword.We all recognize that a confrontation with France is necessary; however, itwould be pointless if this were the limit of our foreign policy. The onlysensible foreign policy is one that expands our people's living space in Europe.Acquiring colonies is not a solution to this problem. We must gain settlementterritory to enlarge the mother country itself. This will keep new settlers inclose communion with the land of their origin and also guarantee the entirenation experiences the advantages that only come from a large and unitedterritory.The racebased Nationalist Movement must not defend the rights of other nations,but act as the spearhead of its own people's rights. If it does not do that,then it serves no useful purpose. It is not entitled to gripe about the pastbecause then it would be repeating the past. The former German policy mistakenlyfollowed interests of the royal dynasty; however, the future should not beguided by such commonplace sickening sentimentalism. Specifically, we should notact as policemen for the well-known \"poor, small nations\", but instead we shouldact as soldiers guarding the interest of our own people.( This may be an argument against colonization, meaning Germany should not actas policemen in foreign colonies---such colonies require a lot of effort tocontrol---but it is more likely that it is a reference to the idea of joiningthe League of Nations which later resulted from the Treaty of Versailles.)However, we NationalSocialists must go even further. The right to possessterritory and soil can turn into a duty if we see a great nation which suddenlyappears doomed if it does not acquire more territory. This is especially truewhen we are not talking about just any little negro tribe, but about theGermanic mother of all life and the cultural image of the world. Germany willeither be a world power or cease to exist. In order to become a world power, sheneeds the vastness that will give her the importance needed today and providelife to her citizens.So, we NationalSocialists must scratch out the foreign policy practices of theprewar period. We will begin our work where it was left off six hundred yearsago. (A reference to the Old Prussia of the 13th and 14th century when TeutonicKnights conquered regions and brought in ethnic Germans.) We will stop theeternal Germanic migration to the south and west of Europe we have seen in thepast and look toward the land in the east. (Russia and AustriaHungary territory.) We will finally end the colonial and trade policy of pre-war times and moveforward into the land policy of the future.However, when we say territory and soil today in Europe, we can only think aboutRussia and the border-states under her control.Here, Fate seems to have given us a clue. By surrendering Russia to Bolshevism,it deprived the Russian people of that intelligent group responsible forcreating the state and which guaranteed their existence as a state up to thattime. The Russian State did not result from the political abilities of theSlavic race in Russia, but its creation was a wonderful example of thestate-forming ability possessed by the Germanic element that still exists withinan inferior race. Numerous powerful empires on the earth have been created thissame way when inferior races, led by Germanic organizers and masters, have growninto huge states and they continued to exist as long as the racial nucleus ofthe state-forming race survived.For centuries, Russia has fed on this Germanic nucleus of her leading upperclasses. Today, that group is in danger of being exterminated because it hasbeen almost entirely wiped out. The Jew has stepped into their place. It isequally impossible for the Russians to rid themselves of the Jewish yoke ofbondage using their own strength as it is impossible for the Jew to maintain thehuge empire in the long run. The Jew is not an organizer, but an enzyme ofdecomposition. The gigantic empire in the east is ripe for collapse. The end ofJewish domination in Russia will also be the end of the Russian state.We have been selected by Fate to witness this catastrophe and it will be thestrongest confirmation that the national race theory is true and correct.(Hitler worked with anticommunist Russians who assured him Russia was nearcollapse in the mid 1920s. Hitler expected to be invited in to put down arevolution and was not planning an invasion.) The mission of theNationalSocialist movement is to give our people the political insight needed sothey do not see their future aim in the romantic image of a new campaign byAlexander the Great, but they see their future working busily at the German plowfor which the sword will provide the soil.It goes without saying that the Jew has proclaimed his violent opposition to theeastern expansion policy. He can feel, more than anyone else, how these actionswill impact his future. The fact alone that he opposes the plan should convinceall truly nationally-minded men that this new direction is the correct path.Unfortunately, the exact opposite is the case. German national andrace-conscious circles have declared a hostile war against the very idea of aneastern expansion policy and, as always happens, the people listen to the onewho has the most famous name. In order to justify a different policy, which isjust as absurd as it is impossible and very harmful for the German nation, thespirit of Bismarck is summoned. They claim that Bismarck, during his time, hadalways stressed the importance of maintaining a good relationship with Russia.That is correct for the most part. Yet, they completely forget to mention thathe also stressed the importance of a good relationship with Italy. The same Mr.von Bismarck even made an alliance with Italy so he could settle matters withAustria. (Bismarck made a secret alliance with Italy to gain Austrian-controlledland in 1866, which split Austrian forces resulting in the defeat of Austria atthe battle of Königgrätz, the largest battle until that time in history.) Why dothey not continue to promote the Italian policy, too? They will say, \"becausetoday's Italy is not the same Italy from those days\". All right, then, honorablesirs, permit me to raise the objection that the Russia of today is also nolonger the Russia of those days. Bismarck never intended to create a politicalcourse that would become a permanent strategy. He was the master of the momentand would not want to tie himself down like that. The question should not be,\"What did Bismarck do in his days?\" but we should ask, \"What would he do today?\"This question is much easier to answer. His political wisdom would never havepermitted him to unite with any state that is doomed to destruction.Also, Bismarck regarded the German colonial and trade policy with mixed feelingssince his main focus was on uniting and internally strengthening the State hehad created. That was the only reason he welcomed the Russian support, so hecould have a free hand for his work in the west. However, what was useful toGermany then would be harmful to her today.As early as 1920-1921, the young NationalSocialist movement was slowly broughtinto the forefront on the political horizon and was, to some degree, consideredas a German movement for independence. Our Party was approached by various sideswho attempted to establish a relationship between their people and theindependence movements of other countries. This was actually quite similar tothe widely advocated League of \"Oppressed\" Nations proposed at the time whichmainly consisted of representatives from certain Balkan states and those ofEgypt and India. To me, they all seemed like pompous windbags without any actualexperience. There were many Germans, especially among the nationalists, whoallowed themselves to be dazzled by these proud Orientals. They immediatelybelieved any worthless student was a \"representative\" of India or Egypt. Thesefools failed to realize that not only did most of these \"representatives\" haveno support, but they had not been authorized by anyone to decide on any kind oftreaty with anyone.Therefore, the practical result of all relations with these people was zero. Ihave always resisted these kinds of pointless dealings. I not only had betterthings to do with my time than to waste weeks on such fruitless \"discussions\",but even if these representatives had been authorized by their respectivenations, I would have considered the whole thing to be pointless or evenharmful.It was bad enough during peace times that the German alliance policy lacked anyaggressive intentions and ended up as nothing more than a defensive society ofold states, long since retired from world history. The alliances made withAustria and Turkey were not at all satisfactory. While the greatest military andindustrial states of the earth united in an active aggressive League, the restgathered together a few old, weak states and tried to confront an active worldcoalition with this trash that was doomed to destruction from the start. Germanywas bitterly repaid for this foreign policy error.However, this repayment was apparently not bitter enough because it did notprevent those eternal visionaries among us from immediately committing the sameerror again. Their attempt to disarm the almighty victors of the First World Warwith a League of \"Oppressed\" Nations was absurd and ultimately becamedisastrous. It is disastrous because it constantly distracts our nation fromwhat we could do. Instead of accomplishing something fantastic, the nationyields to unproductive hopes and illusions. The Germany of today is like thedrowning person who grasps at every straw. They may otherwise be veryintelligent, but just as soon as a ray of hope can be seen, no matter howelusive, these people immediately run to catch the ghost. No matter whether itis a League of \"Oppressed\" Nations, a real League of Nations, or any other kindof fantastic invention, it will, nevertheless, find many thousands of souls whoare willing to believe.I still remember the childish and incomprehensible hopes that suddenly arose in1920-1921 in nationalist circles that England was supposed to be on the verge ofcollapse in India. Some Asian impostors, or for all I care perhaps even real\"fighters for the independence of India\" who were loitering about in Europe atthe time, had successfully filled the heads of otherwise sensible people withthe mistaken idea that the British World Empire was about to collapse in thevery part of India where she had her central cardinal position. Of course, itnever occurred to them that their own desire had fathered all of their ideas.Nor did they see the paradox of their own hopes. How could they expect that thecollapse of English rule in India would somehow lead to the end of the BritishWorld Empire and British power? They admitted that India was of the greatestimportance to England, so if the Empire was not ended then why would she abandonIndia so easily? The native German prophet may consider this vital question asthe deepest secret known to man, but it is, presumably, known by those who guidethe history of England. It is childish to assume that England does not realizethe value of the Indian Empire to the British World Union. It is anothernegative indicator of our absolute refusal to learn a lesson from the FirstWorld War when we blindly misunderstand the strong Anglo-Saxon determination,and we let ourselves think that England would let India go without doingeverything possible to prevent it. Furthermore, it is proof that Germans do notunderstand the methods used by the British in their penetration andadministration of the Indian Empire. England will only lose India if she fallsprey to racial breakdown through her own administrative machine, something thatis unlikely in India at this time, or if she is conquered by the sword of apowerful enemy. Indian rebels will certainly never successfully conquer her. WeGermans know from experience how difficult it is to conquer England. Apart fromthis, I, as a member of the Germanic race, would prefer to see India underEnglish rule than under the control of any other nation.The hopes for a mythical uprising in Egypt are just as miserable. The promise ofa \"Holy War\" gives a strange, yet pleasant sensation to our German sheeps-headplayers when they think others are now willing to shed their blood for us.(Schafkopf or Sheepshead is a card game common in Bavaria.) Cowardly speculationhas always been the silent father of these hopes. In reality, any such uprisingwould come to a hellish end under the concentrated fire of English machine gunsand the barrage of explosive bombs.It is impossible to successfully attack a powerful state that is firmlydetermined to risk its last drop of blood for the sake of its existence andespecially foolish to launch such an attack with a coalition of cripples. As anationalist who knows how to evaluate humanity based on its racial foundations,I cannot link the fate of my own nation with that of the socalled \"OppressedNations\", which I can see are racially inferior.We must take the very same position today in regard to Russia. At the presenttime, Russia has been stripped of its Germanic ruling layer and therefore cannotbe an ally in the struggle for an independent German nation. From a purelymilitary standpoint, the situation would be disastrous if Germany and Russiashould find themselves in a war against Western Europe, which would likely meana war against the rest of the world. The fighting would not take place onRussian soil but in German territory, and Germany would not be able to receiveany effective support from Russia. The military might of the present GermanReich is so disgraceful and so inadequate that we could not even protect ourborders against Western Europe, including England. Even the German industrialterritory would be exposed to the direct fire from our enemies and we would haveno way to defend it. Another problem is that between Germany and Russia lies thePolish State, which is entirely in French hands. In the event of a war withGermany and Russia both fighting against Western Europe, Russia would first haveto flatten Poland in order to bring the first soldier to the German front lines.In reality, it is not so much a question of soldiers as a question of technicalarmaments. In this respect, the conditions of the First World War would berepeated, except it would be even more terrible. German industry had to supplyour notorious allies so Germany had to bear the burden of producing thetechnical armaments all by herself during the First World War. If we facedcombat together, Russia would likewise be useless when it came to the technicalequipment motorization of the of war. There would be no way we could oppose thegeneralworld, and the ability to mobilize with vehicles will be an overwhelminglydecisive factor in the next war. Germany has remained disgracefully far behindeven in this important field and then she would have to also support Russia outof what little she has. Even today, Russia does not own a single factory inwhich an automobile that actually runs can be manufactured. Combat under theseconditions would be nothing but a massacre. The youth of Germany would bleedmany times more than they did before because the burden of the actual fightingwould lie only on us, as it always does, and the result would be unavoidabledefeat.Even if a miracle should happen and combat under these circumstances did not endwith the utter destruction of Germany, the final result would still mean we hadbeen bled white. Afterwards, Germany would be the same as she was before, and wewould remain surrounded by large military states--- there would have beenabsolutely no change in conditions at all. The objection that a Russian alliancedoes not necessarily mean there will be war is in itself an empty claim and toclaim that the purpose of such an alliance is simply to be prepared in the eventof war is equally useless. No. An alliance that is not ultimately about war isfoolish and worthless. Alliances are made for the purpose of battle. Even thoughthe friction is not apparent when the alliance is formed, war is the fundamentalmotivation and the expected result. Never think that other powers will view suchan alliance differently. Either a German-Russian alliance would take place onlyon paper, in which case it would serve no purpose and have no value for us, orthe words of the treaty would become a visible threat which would warn the restof the world. It is utterly naive to think that England and France would reactby waiting a decade until the German-Russian alliance had enough time tocomplete its technical preparations for war. No, the storm would break out overGermany with lightning speed.Therefore, the formation of a new alliance with Russia would lead in thedirection of a new war and the result would be the end of Germany. Additionally, we must also consider the following.1. The present rulers of Russia have no intention of entering into a genuinealliance or of honoring it if they did. We must not forget that the rulers ofpresent day Russia are bloodstained common criminals. We are dealing with thescum of humanity who used the conditions of a tragic hour to overrun a largestate, kill and root out millions of its leading intellectuals in a wild thirstfor blood, and now, for almost ten years, they have exercised the cruelesttyranny of all times. We must also not forget that these rulers belong to apeople who possess the rare combination of inhuman cruelty and anincomprehensible skill of deception. Today these people, more than ever before,feel called upon to impose their bloody suppression on the whole world. We mustnot forget that the international Jew, who completely dominates Russia today,does not see Germany as an ally, but as a state destined for a similar fate. Youdo not form an alliance with a partner whose only interest is your destruction.Above all, one does not form an alliance with creatures to whom no contract issacred. They do not live on this world as representatives of honor and truth,but as representatives of deceit, pilfering, and robbery. A man who believes hecan enter into a contract with parasites is no different from a tree trying tomake a favorable agreement with mistletoe. (Mistletoe is a parasitic plant thatslows the growth of a tree and sometimes kills it. It was considered as a pestin the 20th century and is also poisonous to many animals.) 2. The danger thatRussia was once subjected to is constantly hanging over Germany. Only aprivilegedclass fool could dream that Bolshevism has been banished. In hisshallow thinking, he does not realize that this is an act of instinct. It is theJewish nation striving for world domination, a phenomenon that is as natural asthe Anglo-Saxon's urge to dominate the world. Just as the Anglo-Saxon pursuesthis course in his own way and fights his battle with his own weapons, so toothe Jew fights with the weapons he knows best. His way is sneaking into nationsand undermining their inner structure. He fights with his weapons of lies andslander, poison and decay, intensifying the battle until he has achieved thebloody extermination of his hated opponent. Russian Bolshevism represents theJew's twentieth century attempt to gain world domination just as they tried bydifferent, though closely related means throughout history. His desire is toodeeply rooted in his nature for him to change.No nation would voluntarily stop following their natural impulse to expand itsown kind or to enhance their power. They are forced to do so by outsidecircumstances or it is the result of old age as they become a victim ofweakness. In the same way, the Jew will not voluntarily relinquish his road toworld dictatorship by simply suppressing his eternal urge. He can only be thrownoff his course of world domination by outside powers or when his efforts expirewith his own death. The weakness of the nations and their demise throughsenility is caused by their surrender of racial blood purity. The Jew guards hisracial purity more than any other nation of the world. So, he continues in hisdisastrous way until another power confronts him and in a huge struggle throwsthis attacker of Heaven back again to Lucifer.Today, Germany is the next great objective of Bolshevism. We will need all thestrength of a young missionary idea to again rescue our nation from theentanglement of the international serpent and to stop the contamination of ourblood. Only then will we be able to protect our nation and prevent the lastcatastrophe from ever again being repeated (meaning the Revolution.) If wepursue this goal, then it would be madness to unite with a power that is ruledby the very enemy who means death to our own future. How can we free our nationfrom the slavery of this poisonous embrace if we willingly walk into it? How canthe German worker come to understand that Bolshevism is a damnable crime againsthumanity when we choose as our allies the very organizations of this evil planand acknowledge it as an equal? How can we condemn a member of the broad massesfor his sympathy toward a world philosophy when the leaders of the State choosethe representatives of that WorldConcept as an ally? The struggle against theJewish effort to convert the world to Bolshevism requires that we clarify ourattitude toward Russia. After all, we cannot drive out Satan by using Beelzebub.If race-aware circles today are enthusiastic over the idea of an alliance withRussia, they need only to look around Germany to realize whose support theyhave. Or do the recent racialists think anything that is recommended by theMarxist international Jewish press is going to be beneficial to the Germannation? Since when do racialists go to battle with a weapon offered by the Jew?Has the Jew become our shieldbearer? There is one main criticism that can bemade against the old German Reich concerning its policy of alliances: It ruinedits relations with everyone because it constantly swayed back and forth in anunsound and weak effort to preserve world peace at all costs. There is also onething it could not be criticized for; it did not maintain a good relationshipwith Russia. I admit that even before the First World War, I already believed itwas a wiser course for Germany to renounce her foolish colonial policy, renounceher commercial and naval fleet, and ally herself with England against Russia.This would have taken Germany from a weak international policy to a definiteEuropean policy of continental territorial conquest.I have not forgotten the constant insolent threats that the former Pan-SlavicRussia dared to make against Germany. (Pan-Slavics are those who wanted toexpand Russia and unite all Slavic people.) I have not forgotten the constantmilitary practice drills that were only intended to provoke Germany. I cannotforget the public attitude in Russia, even before the war, that was filled withhateful attacks against our nation and Reich. And I can never forget how thegreat Russian press was always more favorable toward France than toward us.There could still have been a second path we might have taken before the war. Wemight have relied on Russia in order to direct our attack against England.Today, of course, conditions are different. Even if we had choked down all kindsof bad feelings and been able to side with Russia before the war, we can nolonger do that today. Since the war, the hand of the world clock has moved onand the hour has struck loudly announcing to us the time when the Fate of ournation must be decided in one way or another. The large nations of the world arejoining together and this is our last warning signal to put a stop to all thenonsense, to bring our people back out of the dream world and into harshreality. We need to point the way into a future that will lead the old Reich toblossom into a new era of prosperity.In pursuing this huge and important task, the NationalSocialist movement mustfree itself of all illusions and allow reason to be its sole leader.Ultimately, the catastrophe of 1918 may prove to be an infinite blessing for thefuture of our people. Out of this wreckage, our nation can change the directionof its foreign policy and stabilize its position in the world once it has beenstrengthened by its new WorldConcept at home. Then, it can finally adopt a\"political testament\" like England possesses and that even Russia oncepossessed, and like the one that enabled France over and over again to makecorrect decisions that benefited her.The political testament of the German nation concerning its foreign policy shalland must always contain these following ideas. We must never allow twocontinental powers to form in Europe! We must consider every attempt to organizea second military power on the German borders as an attack against Germany, evenif it is just the formation of a state which could potentially be a strongmilitary power. We must consider it our right and our duty to prevent such astate in every way possible, even if it means using arms to prevent theformation of this kind of state or to break its back if it is already inexistence! We must be certain that the strength of our people is maintained bypreserving the soil of the homeland in Europe and not in colonies. We must neverconsider the Reich to be truly secure until it can guarantee every individualdescendant of our people his own piece of land for centuries to come.We must never forget that the holiest right on this earth is the right to thesoil that one wishes to till oneself, and that the holiest sacrifice is theblood that one sheds for this soil.Before I end these deliberations I must again point out the only possiblealliances for us in Europe today. Previously, regarding the problem of Germanalliances, I named England and Italy as the only two nations in Europe that weshould strive to develop closer relations with and those are the only nationsthat hold a promise of success. I will only briefly touch on the militaryimportance of such an alliance here.The military consequence of such an alliance would be the opposite from analliance with Russia. Most importantly, closer relations with England and Italywill not bring any danger of war. The only power that might be against thealliance, France, would not be in a position to go to war against such analliance. Therefore, the alliance would give Germany a chance to quietly makeall those preparations that would be necessary in order to later settle theaccount with France. The true significance of such a coalition lies in the veryfact that once it is finalized, not only would Germany no longer be exposed tothe possibility of a hostile invasion, but with the enemy alliance itselfbroken, the previous Peace Treaty agreement is automatically dissolved, thusisolating the deadly enemy of our people, France. Even though this success wouldinitially only have a psychological result rather than a physical result, itwould be enough to give Germany today an unimaginable amount of freedom to acton its own. The new European Anglo-German-Italian alliance would be the onemaking the decisions and it would decide what to do, while France would nolonger be in control.Suddenly, Germany would no longer be in such an unfortunate strategic position.This new order would give us a powerful protector on one border and on the otherborder we would be completely guaranteed secure supply-lines for our provisionsand raw materials. What is even more important is that the new coalition wouldbe made up of nations that, in many respects, would compliment each other intheir technical abilities. For the first time, Germany would have allies whowere not leeches sucking on our economy, but instead they could and wouldgreatly contribute to the technical build-up of our armament.There is another final fact that must not be overlooked. In both cases, we aredealing with allies who cannot be compared with Turkey or present Russia. Thecombination of the greatest world powers on earth and our young national statewould create a different balance on European battlefields than we saw with thedecaying national corpses that Germany was allied with in the last war.I have already pointed out the great difficulties we would face from those whoattempted to prevent such a League. However, can anyone say it was easier toform the Entente? What the ingenuity of King Edward VII achieved, which in partwas against the natural interests of certain people [the Jews], here we must andshall also achieve. (Edward VII was King of the United Kingdom until 1910. TheEntente refers to the Entente Cordiale between England and France, which reachedagreements on colonies in Africa and settled ongoing conflicts. It later led tothe Triple Entente between England, France, and Russia.) When we realize theseactions are necessary, it must inspire us to follow a wise self-determinedcourse. This will be possible the moment we become conscious of the impendingneed and choose one single, methodical road to follow instead of continuingalong the aimless path our foreign policy followed in recent decades.The future goal of our foreign policy must not be to favor the east or the west,but rather an eastern expansion policy that will acquire the necessary farmlandfor our German people. For this we need strength, but the deadly enemy of ourpeople, France, is mercilessly choking us and robbing us of our power.Therefore, we must be willing to make every necessary sacrifice if it willresult in the destruction of the French desire for dominance in Europe.Today, every national power that feels France's lust for domination on thecontinent is unbearable---those nations are our natural allies. We must notconsider any road that leads us to the strength we need as being too difficult,nor should we say that giving up any old alliances is unspeakable if the finalresult offers merely the possibility that we could overthrow the fierce hatredof our enemy. We will then leave the smaller scratches to quietly heal over timeafter we have cauterized and closed the biggest wound.Of course, today, we face the destructive barking of our nation's enemies athome. But we NationalSocialists should never be swayed from our course ofproclaiming what is absolutely necessary based on our inherent convictions. Itis true that we must endure the flow of public opinion, which has been misled bythe cunning Jewish exploitation of German thoughtlessness. It is true thatsometimes the waves around us roar with evil fierceness, but those who swim withthe current are more easily overlooked than the one who swims against thecurrent. Today, we are just a rock sticking out of the flowing current. However,in only a few years Fate will elevate us to become a dam which will direct theflow of the current into a new riverbed.Therefore, it is necessary for the NationalSocialist movement to be recognizedand established in the eyes of the rest of the world as the representative of adefinite political idea. Whatever Heaven may have in store for us, let everyoneknow who we are by the caps we wear.As soon as we understand how greatly our intervention is needed in foreignpolicy, that is when this knowledge will make us absolutely determined and thestrength of perseverance will flow through us. This strength will becomeimportant when one of us is under the drumming fire of the hostile pack of dogsknown as the press and he becomes frightened. This is the time he will feel theurge to make concessions here and there so that everyone is not against him, andin this moment he will want to howl with the wolves.15. SELFDEFENSE AS A RIGHTWhen we laid down our arms in November 1918, it established a policy that anyoneshould have seen would gradually lead to complete submission.Similar historical examples show that people who stop fighting without acompelling reason will eventually accept the greatest humiliation and demandsrather than try to change their fate by using force again.This human quality is easily understandable. If at all possible, a wiseconqueror will always impose his demands step by step on the conquered. He cancount on the fact that a nation that has lost its strength of character---whichis true of every nation that voluntarily surrenders---will not see a strongreason to reach for a weapon as each small separate act of oppression is forcedon them, one at a time. The longer such demands are willingly accepted, the lessthe people see them as a reason to resist. When they consider the individualoppression, it seems unimportant when compared to the collective oppressionsagainst them, then they realize they have already tolerated much more andsuffered a much greater misery in silence, so one more makes little difference.The downfall of Carthage is a terrible demonstration of how a people can becomethe victims of a slow execution brought about by their own fault.In his Three Beliefs, Clausewitz emphasizes this thought in a manner like no oneelse could and immortalizes it when he says, \"The stain of cowardly submissioncan never be wiped out. This drop of poison in the blood of a people istransmitted to posterity and will paralyze and undermine the strength of futuregenerations\", and that, on the other hand, \"even the destruction of this freedomafter a bloody and honorable struggle assures the rebirth of a nation; it is theessence of life from which a new tree is sure to take root some time in thefuture\".( Carl Philipp Gottlieb von Clausewitz was a Prussian soldier, historian,military theorist, and author of the book On War about military theory. Thereference here is not from On War but from The Creed of 1812, which was aprogram for German national liberation. It is also known as the Three Statementsof Belief, and in it Clausewitz said \"...a people can value nothing more highlythan the dignity and liberty of its existence; that it must defend these to thelast drop of its blood; that there is no higher duty to fulfill, no higher lawto obey; that the shameful blot of cowardly submission can never be erased; thatthis drop of poison in the blood of a nation is passed on to posterity,crippling and eroding the strength of future generations\".) Of course, a nationthat has lost its honor and character will not care about this doctrine. Whoeverdoes take it to heart can never sink below a certain point. Only he who forgetsor no longer chooses to acknowledge it can be broken down. Therefore, you cannotexpect someone who has willingly surrendered their character and who isresponsible for the submission of his people to suddenly repent and actdifferently than they did before simply because he is confronted by a logicalstatement or even as a result of his own experience. On the contrary, these arethe people who will reject this very idea until either the population has becomeaccustomed to their enslavement or until greater forces come along and takepower from the hands of the current corrupter. In the first situation, thesepeople do not feel miserable like they should because they are often given thejob of overseeing the slaves by the clever conquerors. These people of weakcharacter usually exercise this office without mercy over their own people andit is much worse than any foreign bully who might be put into the same office bythe enemy.Events in Germany since 1918 show that our hope to possibly gain the mercy ofthe victors through voluntary subjugation has unfortunately proven to bedisastrous. This willing submission has caused the wide masses to form a fatalpolitical notion. Here I would like to emphasize the words \"wide masses\" since Ido not believe that all actions and the constant failure to act by our people'sleaders can be credited to the same disastrous mistake.After the war, the direction of our fate changed and it became obvious that itlay in the hands of Jews. You cannot possibly assume that a flawed understandingis the only cause of our misfortune. On the contrary, we must now be convincedthat a conscious intention is destroying our people. As soon as one looks at theproblem from this viewpoint, the obvious insanity in the foreign policypracticed by the leaders of our people becomes clear; it is actually the resultof that highly cunning, ice-cold logic which serves the Jewish thought processand is part of their struggle for world conquest. Knowing this, it is then easyto understand why such a long period of time has elapsed without any improvementin our situation; to the contrary, in this time our state has steadily becomeweaker. This same span of time is comparable to that from 1806 to 1813 but inthat case, the time was sufficient to put the completely broken Prussia backtogether with new energy and a determination to fight.It has been seven years since November, 1918 and they just signed the Treaty ofLocarno! (The Locarno Treaties were seven agreements made at Locarno Switzerlandin October 1925 and signed in London that December. The western borders ofGermany were fixed but the eastern borders were still open to be changed. Germannationalists saw the treaty as an unnecessary loss of land and resources. HereHitler seems to say seven years have passed and Germany is still losing valuableterritory, which is further weakening the country. Losing this territory withits natural resources obviously made it more difficult to pay reparations, too.)Here is the sequence of events that we have experienced. After the disgracefulArmistice was signed, no one had the energy or the courage to suddenly stand upand oppose the oppressive measures inflicted by the enemies, who returned overand over with more demands. The enemy, however, was clever enough not to ask fortoo much at any one time. They always limited their extortion to a level thatthey, and our German leadership, believed would be just enough to bear at themoment so that they did not have to fear a possible explosion of public opinionas a result. The more these individual demands were signed and choked down ourthroats, the less any resistance could be justified. This degradation was justone more extortion, so why would we suddenly do what had not been done so manytimes before, why would we resist? This is the very \"drop of poison\" Clausewitztalks about when he mentions the first deed which lacks integrity, and it isthis deed which is bound to grow until it gradually becomes the worst possibleheritage which hinders every future decision. This lack of character becomes aterrible lead weight that a people cannot shake off and that ultimately pullsthem down to become a race of slaves.In Germany we faced disarmament and enslavement rulings, our political systemwas made helpless, and we suffered economic plunder. All of these alternateduntil they finally produced a moral spirit that somehow could see the Dawes Planas a blessing and mistook the Treaty of Locarno for a success. When viewing thesituation from a higher point of view, we can see that at least one good thinghas come out of this regrettable situation. It has been our good fortune that,although men may have been deceived, Heaven could not be bribed. For us, ourblessing was misery and worry, which have since become the constant companionsof our people and misery is our only true ally. Fate has not chosen to make anexception in this instance---we are judged the same as all others and because ofthis---Fate handed out what we deserved. We may no longer know how to valuehonor, but we have at least learned to value freedom when it comes to bread. Ourpeople have now learned to cry for bread, and some day they will learn to prayfor freedom.The bitter collapse of our people in the years after 1918 was apparent evenbefore it arrived. At that time, anyone who dared to foretell what actually didtake place was later violently persecuted. The leadership of our people was justas miserable as it was conceited. This was especially true when it came toremoving disagreeable and undesirable prophets. At that time, it was likely tohappen, and it is still happening today, that the greatest parliamentarians,those simpleminded straw-heads who actually are members of the glovemaker'sguild and master saddle-makers, that is not to say their profession makes themdunces; it is simply that they have no training or experience in what they aretrying to do, and they were suddenly elevated to the pedestal of a statesman andallowed to rebuke the ordinary mortals from their lofty heights. (Thesaddle-maker remark was directed to Friedrich Ebert, German Chancellor in theWeimar Republic, who was a saddle-maker before turning to politics.) It made nodifference that, after six months of practicing his craftsmanship, such a\"statesman\" is generally revealed to be the most miserable good-fornothingwindbag and he is then showered with scorn and ridicule by the rest of theworld. By this time, he is at his wits' end. He doesn't know what to do next andhas already shown himself to be completely incompetent! That makes no differenceto him. The more these parliamentary statesmen of this Republic lack realaccomplishments, the more furiously they persecute those who expectaccomplishments from them and those who have the audacity to expose theirfailure and predict their future failure. If anyone has cornered one of theseparliamentary gentlemen, and if this tradesman can no longer deny thateverything he has tried to do crumbled, then he finds thousands and thousands ofexcuses for his failures. One thing they will never admit, however, is that theyare the main cause of all the evil themselves.During the winter of 1922-23, everyone should have seen the iron determinationFrance displayed as she continued to pursue her original war aims even afterpeace was declared. (France attempted to obtain more severe concessions in theperiod 1922-1923 before deciding to take military action and occupying the Ruhrin 1923.) No one could believe that during four and a half years of the mostdecisive struggle in her history, France would have risked the meager blood ofher people simply to be compensated evenly for previous damages. Even theAlsaceLorraine territory would not explain the energy driving the French wartactics, not unless their aim was only part of a larger political program forthe future of French foreign policy. This policy goal is the break up of Germanyinto a jumble of small states. That was the real goal this fanatical patriotFrance fought for, but in going after this prize, she actually sold her peopleout as slaves to the international world Jew.This war goal of the French could have been achieved during the First World Warif it had been fought on German soil as they had originally hoped in Paris. Letus suppose that the bloody battles of the First World War had not been fought onthe Somme (Somme is named after the Somme river and is a province in France), inFlanders, in the Artois (a province of northern France), near Warsaw, NishnijNovgorod (Nizhny Novgorod the fourth largest city in Russia), Kowno (the secondlargest city in Lithuania), Riga (capital of Latvia), and wherever else, but hadbeen fought in Germany, on the Ruhr, on the Main, on the Elbe, near Hanover,Leipzig, Nuremberg, etc. Then, you quickly see that Germany's completedestruction would have been at hand. It is very doubtful that our young federalState of States would have endured the same difficult ordeal for four and a halfyears as well as France did. France had been rigidly centralized for centuriesand looked to the indisputable center, Paris, for leadership. The fact that thisgreat struggle between nations took place outside the boundaries of ourFatherland was to the immortal merit of the old army, but it was also thegreatest piece of good fortune the future of Germany could have received. Thoughthe idea sometimes causes me great suffering, it is my unshakable convictionthat if the war were fought on German soil, the German Reich would have longsince ceased to exist, and today nothing but a crowd of Germanic \"states\" wouldremain. This is the only reason why the bloodshed of our friends and brotherswho have died on the battlefield has not been completely in vain.Fortunately for us, it turned out differently! Germany did collapse quickly inNovember, 1918, but when the disaster happened at home, the armies of soldierswere still deep in enemy countries on the front lines. France's main concern atthat time was not breaking up Germany, but how to rid France and Belgium of theGerman armies as quickly as possible. Therefore, the first task of Parispoliticians was to disarm the German armies and to force them as quickly aspossible back into Germany. Only after soldiers were out of their lands couldthey return to work on their original and real war aim. In this effort, however,France had already been paralyzed. For you see, England believed the war hadbeen won the instant the colonial and commercial power had been destroyed, andGermany had been reduced to the rank of a second-class state. Not only didEngland have no interest in destroying the German State completely, but she hadevery reason to see it become a future rival of France in Europe. The Frenchpolicy had to continue during peacetime with stronger determination than whatthe war had started. Now, Clemenceau's declaration that, as far as he wasconcerned, peace was merely a continuation of the war and had a greatersignificance. (Georges Benjamin Clemenceau was a French statesman and journalistwho was the prime minister of France from 1906 to 1909 and again in 1917 to1920.He strongly influenced the Treaty of Versailles. ) The fabric of the Reich wasshaken at every opportunity. In Paris, they hoped that by imposing ever-newreparation costs, disarmament demands and through the economic damage thosecaused, they could gradually loosen the fabric of the Reich's structure. Themore national honor died out in Germany, the sooner economic pressure and ourunending need would cause political destruction. If this policy of politicalcontrol, which trained our people to be submissive, and of economic plunder werepursued for ten or twenty years, it would have ruined even the best state andwould eventually dissolve it. The ultimate war goal of the French would havethen been achieved.Everyone must have recognized this as France's intention long before the winterof 1922-23. (The French occupied the Ruhr on January 11, 1923).Knowing this, there remained only two possibilities. One is that we could hopeto blunt the will of the French with the toughness of the German people. Theother is to finally do what must eventually take place, that is, to turn thehelm of the Reich's ship during some especially drastic situation and ram theenemy. This would mean a struggle for life and death, and the only chance wemight have for life would be if we succeeded in isolating France before thestruggle and isolate her well enough so that this second conflict would not be astruggle of Germany against the world, but a defense of Germany against a Francewhich was constantly disrupting world peace.I must emphasize that I am firmly convinced this clash will eventually come,either in one way or another. I could never be convinced that France's intentiontoward us will change. Their actions are deeply rooted in the French nation'sthoughts of selfpreservation. If I were a Frenchman and if the greatness ofFrance was as dear to me as the greatness of Germany truly is sacred to me, thenI would act no differently from Clemenceau. The French race is gradually dyingout, not only in the number of her people, but especially in regard to her bestracial elements. France can only retain her continued importance in the worldthrough the destruction of Germany. French policy may make a thousand detours,but somewhere at the end, this will always exist as the ultimate goal---it istheir greatest desire and deepest longing. It would be a mistake to think that apurely passive will, seeking to preserve itself, can withstand an active attackfrom an enemy with an equal or stronger will in the long run. The everlastingconflict between Germany and France will never be decided as long as thatconflict is limited to a German defense against French aggression.Century after century, German borders will continue to fall back farther andfarther. If you look at the wandering frontier that defines the German languagefrom the twelfth century up to the present time, you will lose faith in the oldattitude of development because you will see, up to this time, it has caused usso much harm. This must be made clear in Germany so we will no longer allow theGerman nation's will-to-live to degenerate into a mere passive defense, butrather concentrate this will toward an active confrontation with France and useit in a final decisive battle so we can reach the greatest ultimate goals forGermany. Only then will we be able to end the eternal and fruitless strugglebetween Germany and France. Through the destruction of France, Germany canfinally give our people the means to expand. Today, there are eighty millionGermans in Europe! After one hundred years, when there are two hundred and fiftymillion Germans on this continent, this foreign policy will be appreciated muchmore. Our people will not be crowded together like factory coolies working forthe rest of the world, but we will be farmers and workers who use their labor tosupport each other and help their fellow man earn a living. (Coolies is anoffensive term for unskilled Asian workers.) In December, 1922 (just before theRuhr occupation by France), the friction between Germany and France had againreached a dangerous peak.France had her eye on new unprecedented extortions and needed a way to justifythem. Political pressure led the way for this economic plunder and the Frenchbelieved only a violent grip on the nerve center of our entire German livelihoodwould be sufficient to put these unruly people under a heavier yoke of burden.France hoped the occupation of the Ruhr territory would not only break Germany'smoral backbone, but that it would also force us into an economic position wherewe would have to accept even the heaviest obligations, willy-nilly, whether wewanted it or not.It was a matter of bending or breaking. In the beginning Germany bent, only tobreak completely at the end. The occupation of the Ruhr caused Fate to once morereach out to Germany, offering her an opportunity to rise again. What, at first,looked like a terrible misfortune proved on closer examination to be the greatpromise of the possibility to end all of Germany's suffering.The occupation of the Ruhr had, for the first time, deeply alienated Englandfrom France. It was not only British diplomatic circles who entered andmaintained this alliance with their eyes wide open and based their decisions oncold logical calculation who disliked these events, but this occupation alsoestranged large circles among the English people. The English business worldfelt the continental strengthening of France's power the most and they had anobvious resentment. Aside from the fact that France now occupied a militaryposition in Europe that Germany had not enjoyed even before the war, she alsogained economic resources that practically gave France an economic monopoly. Thegreatest iron and coal mines in Europe were now united in the hands of a nationthat, unlike Germany, had looked after her own interests in a decisive andactive manner, and this was a nation that had reminded the world of its militaryability during the Great War, and here again their action caused alarm all overthe world. France's occupation of the Ruhr and the coalmines deprived England ofall her diplomatic success. Now, the industrious and active British diplomacywas no longer the winner, but Marshal Foch and the France he represented was thewinner. (Ferdinand Foch was a French soldier and military theorist who was ageneral during the First World War, then became Supreme Commander of the AlliedArmies. After the end of the war he wanted to impose heavy limits on Germany toprevent them from becoming a world power. He also pushed to prevent Germancontrol along the Rhine River, which goes through the Ruhr area where the Ruhrand Rhine rivers cross.) Italy's relations with France had not been exactly rosysince the end of the war; however, feelings toward Italy now turned intooutright hatred. This was the great historical moment when former allies mightbe future enemies. The fact that this did not happen and that the allies did notsuddenly fight among themselves---like what happened during the second BalkanWar---is due to the fact that Germany had no Enver Pasha, but merely aChancellor Cuno.( The Balkan Wars were two wars involving Bulgaria, Montenegro, Greece andSerbia conquering Ottoman-controlled Macedonia and Albania and much of Thrace in1912 to 1913. After the war, the victors had severe disagreements about how todivide the spoils. Pasha was a high-ranking title in the Ottoman Empire similarto being called an English Lord. Ismail Enver or Enver Pasha was a Turkishmilitary officer and the leader of the Ottoman Empire during the Balkan Wars andThe First World War. Cuno refers to Wilhelm Cuno, Chancellor of Germany from1922 to 1923 who is known for passive resistance to the French invasion of theRuhr area.) The invasion of the Ruhr territory by the French opened up greatpossibilities for Germany's future in terms of our foreign and domesticpolicies. A large number of our people were suddenly cured of the delusion,which was fueled by the lying press that France was the champion of progress andliberty. The Spring of 1923 became just like 1914 when all the dreams that thereexisted an international solidarity between nations were banished from the mindsof our German workers. Suddenly, they were brought back to the world of eternalstruggle. Everywhere, we can see how one being fed upon another and the death ofthe weaker means life for the stronger.When the French carried out their threats and finally began to march into theGerman coal territory, though at first they did so with great caution andhesitation, a decisive hour for Germany had struck. (The French were verycautious about entering the Ruhr Area and feared they might have to retreat ifthey met any resistance at all.) If our nation, at this moment, had changedtheir frame of mind and taken action, then the German Ruhr territory might havebecome for France what Moscow was to Napoleon. (Napoleon suffered severe Frenchlosses in his attempt to take Moscow and when the Russians withdrew leaving thecity open, they ordered the city burned rather than allow the French to take itintact. Napoleon eventually left Moscow when he realized taking it would not endthe war and he had to return to deal with political problems in France.Ultimately the French suffered catastrophic losses and gained nothing.) When theFrench moved into the Ruhr, there were only two possible courses for us to take.The first was that we could submit to this injustice, just as we had before, anddo nothing or, the second option was that with our eye fixed firmly on theterritory of the flaming smelting-furnaces and the smokestacks, we could see animage that would create in the German nation a flaming desire to liberate itselffrom this eternal shame and become willing to take on the horrors of the momentrather than to endure the unending daily horror any longer.A third way can be immortally credited to Chancellor Cuno, then in office, andour German privilegedclass world deserves even more glorious credit for theiradmiration of him and their willingness to endorse his plan. (This refers toChancellor Cuno's plan of passive resistance by paying workers not to work.)Before I discuss that, I would first like to examine the second path as brieflyas possible.When France occupied the Ruhr, she became guilty of a notorious breach of theTreaty of Versailles. At the same time, she placed herself in opposition tothose powers who guaranteed the Treaty, especially England and Italy. Francecould no longer hope that they would continue to support her own selfish raids.This adventure, and that was what it was at the beginning, had to be handled byher and ended satisfactorily by her alone. The German national government hadonly one option, and that was the honorable one. One thing was certain: we couldnot yet actively oppose France using armed force. It is important to realizethat any form of negotiation that is not backed up by force is ridiculous andthe result would be worthless. However, it was equally absurd to take theposition of, \"We are not negotiating\" when we could not actively resist either.But it was unbelievably absurd to negotiate anyway in the end without creating amilitary force in the meantime.This does not mean that it would have been possible to prevent the occupation ofthe Ruhr territory by military means. Only a madman could even recommend such anidea. However, our reaction to this French occupation should have been to doeverything possible to secure the military force that we would need later so wecould strengthen the hands of our negotiators. This would have to be donewithout considering the limitations of the Treaty of Versailles. Besides, Francehad already torn it to shreds. From the very beginning, it was clear thatsomeday, at some conference table, a decision would have to be made about thisFrench occupied territory. It is also important to realize that beforenegotiations start, even the best negotiators could not expect success when theground they stand on and the chair they sit in is not protected by the shieldarm of their nation. A feeble little tailor could never expect to fight withtrained athletes, and equally so a negotiator who has no power backing him hasalways been made to graciously submit to the sword of Brennus on the hostileside of the scale if he had no sword of his own to throw in the oppositebalance. (Brennus refers to the Leader of the Gauls who, in approximately 390B.C., invaded part of Rome and agreed to withdraw in exchange for a ransom. TheRoman capital delivered the gold ransom and as the Gauls were weighing the gold,the Romans complained the weights being used were inaccurate and unfair. Brennusthrew his sword on the weight side of the scale and proclaimed \"Woe to theconquered\". The moral is: the sword settles all disputes.) It was a shame towatch the comedies called negotiations that, ever since 1918, were always heldbefore each new decree was imposed upon us.This degrading spectacle was presented to the whole world, and we were onlyinvited to be mocked so everyone could see us walk up to the conference tablewhere we were told what decision had been made in a long program. The resolutionhad already been previously drawn-up and approved. These negotiations weresupposedly open to discussion, but from the very start the final ruling hadalready been made and it could not be changed. Our negotiators were rarely abovethe most modest intelligence of the average person, which justified too well theinsolent remark of Lloyd George who had said scornfully in regard to the formerGerman Reich Minister, Simon, \"The Germans did not understand how to elect menof intellect as leaders and representatives\". (David Lloyd George was a Britishstatesman and Prime Minister in the last half of the First World War and forfour years afterwards.) However, even a genius would have achieved very littleat these negotiations considering the strong will of the enemies and the pitifulstate of his own nation which was defenseless.In the Spring of 1923, anyone who intended to use the occupation of the Ruhr byFrance as an excuse for the reconstruction of military power would first have tosupply the nation with its spiritual weapons, strengthen its will power, andremove those who destroyed our military for it was our most valuable strength.We failed to crush the head of the Marxist serpent once and for all in 1914 and1915, and in 1918 this was bloodily avenged. In the same way, terrible resultswere certain to follow if we did not take advantage of the opportunity thatpresented itself in the Spring of 1923 to stop the Marxist traitors andmurderers of our nation.The very thought of actual resistance against France was foolishness as long aswar was not declared against those powers that had, from the inside, brokenGerman forces on the battlefield just five years earlier. Only those from theprivilegedclass could entertain the outrageous idea that Marxism might nowsomehow be different from what it was before and that these villainouswant-to-be-leaders in 1918 would suddenly be ready to do what was right for thenation in 1923. In 1918, they had been willing to trample over two million deadjust to step up into various government seats. This hope that former nationaltraitors would suddenly become defenders of German liberty was an incredible andtotally absurd thought! They never even considered protecting Germany! Just as ahyena will not turn loose a carcass, a Marxist will not turn away from hightreason. No one should make the most stupid objection by saying many workers hadonce died for Germany in the war. German workers, yes, but at that time theywere not international Marxists. If in 1914 the German workers had consisted ofdedicated Marxists, then the war would have ended after three weeks.Germany would have collapsed before the first soldier stepped across the border.No, the fact that Germany was still fighting in 1918 was proof that the Marxistdelusion had not yet penetrated the entire national mind. To the same degreethat the German worker and German soldier returned to the hands of the Marxistleaders was the same degree that he was lost to the Fatherland. If at thebeginning and during the war twelve or fifteen thousand of these Hebrewcorrupters of the people would have been put under poisonous gas, like hundredsof thousands of our very best German workers of all classes on the battlefieldhad to endure, then the sacrifice of millions at the front would not have beenin vain.On the contrary, if we could have removed twelve thousand crooks in time, wemight have saved a million valuable Germans for the future. It was a part of the\"art of statesmanship\" demonstrated by the privilegedclass to deliver millionsof our people to a bloody death on the battlefield without batting an eye, butat the same time, they regard ten or twelve thousand traitors, parasites,usurers, and swindlers as sacred national treasures and openly proclaim theirsanctity. It is hard to know what quality is considered greater in thisprivilegedclass world, hardheadedness, weakness, cowardice, or through andthrough ethical corruption. It is truly a class destined by Fate to perish;unfortunately it is dragging the whole nation along with it into the abyss oftears.The very same situation that existed in 1918 stood before us again in 1923.Regardless of what kind of resistance was chosen, the first step was always theelimination of the Marxist poison from the body of our nation. It was myconviction, even at that time, that the first duty of a real National governmentwas to find forces determined to declare a war of destruction against Marxismand to give these forces free reign. It was not the National government's dutyto worship the nonsense of \"peace and order\" at a time when a foreign enemy wasdealing the most destructive blows to the Fatherland and when treason lurkedaround every corner at home. No, a real nationalistic government would havewished for unrest and disorder. Under the confusion, a final settlement with theMarxist mortalenemies of our nation would at last be possible and it wouldfinally happen. The failure to take out this enemy meant any thought ofresistance was pure madness. A settlement of real world-historical importancenever results from the scheme of some secret counsel or from the withered mindof an old state minister. True resolution happens according to the eternal lawsof nature on this earth which is the unending struggle for existence. It isimportant to realize that often, out of the bloodiest civil wars, a robustnational body, which is as hard as steel, springs forth, yet, more than once,artificially maintained conditions of peace have produced a foul stench of decayso strong that it reached up into Heaven.The Fates of nations are not changed with kid gloves. Therefore, the greatestbrutal steps should have been used in 1923 to seize the vipers that were feedingon our national body. Only after this was successful would there be any sense inpreparing for active resistance. At that time, I spoke again and again until Iwas hoarse in an effort to make it clear to the socalled national circles whatwas at stake this time if the mistakes of 1914 and the years following wererepeated. They were bound to result in an end like that of 1918. I have askedthem again and again to let Fate take its course and to give our movement freereign so we could bring a reckoning to Marxism. I preached to deaf ears. Theyall thought they understood the situation better, including the Chief of theDefense Force. Finally, they found themselves in front of the most miserablesubmission of all time.It was then when I became fully aware that the German privilegedclass hadreached the end of its mission and had no reason to complete any task. At thattime, I saw that all these parties were doing nothing more than competing witheach other in their arguments over Marxism, with no true desire to wipe it out.They had long since accepted the idea of the destruction of the Fatherland. Theonly thing that motivated them was their deep concern over whether or not theywould be allowed to participate in the funeral feast. This is the only thingthey are still \"fighting\" for.I openly admit that during this time, I developed the deepest admiration for thegreat man south of the Alps. His passionate love for his people did not permithim to make pacts with Italy's internal enemies, but he struggled in every waypossible to destroy them. The reason why Mussolini will be ranked among thegreat men of this world is his determination not to share Italy with Marxism,but to save his Fatherland from Marxism by sentencing Internationalism todestruction. On the other hand, how pitiful and small our German pygmies ofstatesmen seem in comparison to such a great man. We must choke back disgustwhen these disrespectful, conceited zeros dare to criticize a man who is athousand times greater. It is even more painful to realize this is happening ina country that just fifty years ago called Bismarck its leader.The attitude of the privilegedclass in their willingness to spare Marxism in1923 meant that the fate of any armed resistance in the Ruhr territory hadalready been determined in advance. To fight against France, with a deadly enemyin our own ranks, was foolish. Whatever else was done could only be calledshadowboxing (a reference to the passive resistance campaign in the Ruhr). Itwas nothing more than a staged fight to pacify the nationalistic elements inGermany and to calm the \"boiling anger of the nation's soul\", or rather todeceive it. If they were serious, they would have been forced to recognize thefact that a nation's strength lies primarily in its will and not in its weapons.Before one can conquer foreign enemies, the enemy within must first beannihilated. Otherwise, if victory does not crown the battle on the very firstday, then all is lost. As soon as even the shadow of defeat passes over a nationthat is not free from internal enemies, its resistance will be shattered and theenemy will be the final victor.This could have easily been predicted as early as the Spring of 1923. It isuseless to discuss whether or not there was any chance of a military successagainst France! If our reaction to the French invasion of the Ruhr territory hadresulted only in the destruction of Marxism in Germany, that alone would havebrought us success. A Germany that has been delivered from the deadly enemies ofher existence would possess a strength that no power in the world could everstrangle again. The day that Marxism is totally crushed in Germany will mark thecomplete shattering of her shackles. Never in our history have we been conqueredby the forces of our enemies, but we have only been conquered as a result of ourown faults and by the enemy in our own camp.Since the German government could not pull themselves together at that time andcommit to such a heroic action, their only option was to follow the first road:do nothing and let things take their own course. At this momentous hour,however, Heaven gave the German nation the gift of a \"great\" man, Mr.Cuno. He was not a statesman or politician by profession and he certainly wasnot one by birth, but he represented a sort of political yes-man that could beused for the completion of certain tasks. Otherwise, he was more skilled inbusiness than politics. This politicized merchant was a curse for Germanybecause he regarded politics as an economic undertaking and began to actaccordingly. Mr. Cuno said to himself, \"France occupied the Ruhr territory andwhat is found there? Coal. Therefore, France is occupying the Ruhr territory forits coal!\" Knowing this, what other idea would possibly seem more natural forMr. Cuno than to call for a labor-strike so that the French could no longer takeany coal? At this point, at least according to Mr. Cuno's thinking, they wouldcertainly evacuate the Ruhr territory some day because the enterprise did notprove to be profitable. This was the train of thought of this \"outstandingnational statesman\" who was permitted to speak to \"his people\" in Stuttgart andother places and whom this entire nation blissfully admired so deeply.To hold a strike, the Marxists were needed, since it was primarily the workerswho had to strike. It was necessary to bring the worker into a unified frontwith all the other Germans. In the mind of a privilegedclass statesman, there isno difference between the worker and a Marxist. You should have seen how thesemoldy privilegedclass party-politicians lit up in response to such an inspiredslogan! Cuno was nationalistic and inspired at the same time, and with this planthe privilegedclass finally found what they had been searching for all along!The bridge to Marxism had been revealed to them.Now, it was possible for the nationalistic impostor to extend a respectable handto the international traitor creating a \"German-esque\" face that was shoutingnationalistic phrases. The Marxist grasped that hand immediately. Cuno neededthe Marxist leaders for his \"unified front\" as much as the Marxist leadersneeded Cuno's money. So, both sides benefited. Cuno received his united frontconsisting of national babblers and antinational swindlers, and theinternational swindlers were able to serve their most lofty fighting mission:they were able to destroy national economy and make the government pay them todo it. The idea of saving a nation through a paid general strike was soobviously \"brilliant\", it was a slogan that even the most indifferentgood-fornothing could get behind with great enthusiasm.It is generally known that a nation cannot be liberated through prayers alone.Whether or not it could be liberated by laziness has not yet been proven byhistory. If Mr. Cuno had only demanded two more hours of work from every Germaninstead of calling for a paid strike, then the fraud of this \"united front\"would have revealed itself on the third day. Nations are not liberated by doingnothing, but by sacrifice.This socalled passive resistance could not continue very long. Only a mancompletely ignorant of war tactics could imagine that an occupying army would bedriven out by such absurd means. This was the only reason for starting thiscampaign that cost billions and which essentially aided in the total devaluationof the national currency. (Cuno's labor strikes contributed to thehyperinflation in Germany making the Mark basically worthless.) The French wereable to calmly establish their military bases in the Ruhr territory once theysaw resistance would only be passive. We had already given them the best recipefor bringing a stubborn civilian population back to its senses if its activitiescould have seriously endangered the occupation forces. Nine years ago, did wenot quickly chase the bands of Belgian guerrillas out, making it clear to thecivilian population how serious the consequences would be if their activitiesendangered the German armies? The moment passive resistance in the Ruhrterritory became dangerous to France is the moment the occupying army couldhave, with playful ease, put a gruesome end to this entire childish nonsense inless than a week's time.This question always remains: What do you do when passive resistance finallywears out the patience of an enemy and he begins to fight it with brutal force?Do we continue to resist? If we do, then we must be prepared to suffer the mostsevere and bloody persecutions. The result is the same as if we started anactive resistance, an outright battle. For this reason, every socalled passiveresistance only has value when it is backed up by a determination to continueresistance through open war or covert guerrilla warfare. Generally speaking,every struggle should be evaluated based on its chance of succeeding. Whenever afortress is fiercely attacked by the enemy and overwhelmed, it is forced to giveup its last hope that it might be saved and it has effectively surrendered atthat time. This is especially true when the defender has a certain desire toremain among the living instead of facing the high probability of dying. If thegarrison soldiers of a besieged fortress lose their faith in a possibledeliverance, all strength of resistance would break down at the very sameinstant.Therefore, the final consequences that were bound to result from a successfulpassive resistance at the Ruhr would only matter if they were supported by anactive front line building up behind it. In that case, we could have obtained anendless commitment from our people. If each of these Westphalians had known thattheir Fatherland was building up an army of eighty or one hundred divisions tosupport them, the French would have been walking on thorns. (Westphalia is thegeneral region encompassing the Rhine area, here meaning the people in the Ruhrarea.) You can always find more courageous men who are ready to sacrificethemselves for success than you can find men who wish to sacrifice themselvesfor nothing.This was a classic situation that forced us NationalSocialists to oppose thissocalled nationalist slogan with the sharpest weapons we could. During thesemonths, I was frequently attacked by people whose total nationalist convictionsconsisted of a mixture of stupidity and showy displays intended to enhance theirself image. These were the people who shouted with others because it gave them athrill to suddenly act like a \"nationalist\" without putting themselves at risk.I considered this \"united front\" as the most miserable and most ridiculousdemonstration possible and history has proven me right.As soon as the unions filled their treasuries with Cuno's contributions and thepassive resistance campaign faced the possibility that it might have to changefrom a lazy defensive act to an active offense, the red hyenas instantly brokeaway from the national flock of sheep and returned to what they had been allalong. Without a whimper, Mr. Cuno sneaked back to his ships. Germany had beenenriched by an additional experience and made poorer of a great hope.Up to late midSummer, many officers, and not the worst of the lot, could notaccept that such a shameful development would be allowed to continue.They all hoped that, if not openly, perhaps at least secretly, preparationswould be made to change this bold invasion by France into a turning point inGerman history. Within our own ranks, there were many who placed their trust inthe defense forces of the Reich. This conviction was so strong that itinfluenced the actions and even encouraged the training of countless youngpeople.Back when the dreadful and disgraceful 1918 surrender took place, an intenserevolt flared up in a blaze at the betrayal of our desperate people. Now, aftera fortune of billions had been spent and many thousands of young Germans weresacrificed---who had been foolish enough to take the promises of the Reichleaders seriously---the millions of people suddenly saw their conviction burningbrightly and clearly and they knew that only a radical step could save Germany,the removal of the whole ruling system.Never was the time so ripe and never did it cry so strongly for a solution thanit did at this moment. On one hand, the naked shameless betrayal of theFatherland clearly showed itself. On the other hand, a nation had been deliveredover to death through gradual economic starvation. Since the State had trampledon all laws of good faith, had scorned all the rights of its citizens, hadcheated millions of its most faithful sons out of their sacrifice, and hadrobbed millions of their last penny, it no longer had the right to expectanything but hatred from its subjects. This hatred against the destroyers of thepeople and of the Fatherland was bound to explode. Here, I can refer to thefinal sentence of my last speech at the great trial in the Spring of 1924: \"Thejudges of this State may calmly condemn our actions, yet history, as the goddessof a nobler truth and of a more perfect law, will someday smile as she tears upthis judgment and frees us from all blame and guilt\".History will, however, also call before her tribunal those who are in powertoday, those who trample on justice and law, those who have led our people intosuffering and misery, and those who during the Fatherland's humiliation, placedtheir own interests ahead of the community's life.I will not go into the details that led to, and finally decided, the events ofthe 8th of November, 1923 (The Beer Hall Putsch.) I do not see any point in itbecause I do not think it will benefit the future and, primarily, because it isuseless to tear open wounds that have only begun to heal. Besides, there is nopoint in talking about the guilt of people who, maybe, deep down in theirhearts, cling to their nation with a love equal to mine, but who strayed fromthe path or did not recognize the common road.In view of the great troubles in our Fatherland we all share, I would not wantto offend and thus alienate those who someday in the future will have to form agreat united front made up of all true Germans against the common enemies of ournation. I know the day will come when even those who once were hostile to uswill respect those who died bitterly for the sake of the German nation.I dedicated the first volume of my work to those eighteen fallen heroes whom Iwant to present to the supporters and defenders of our doctrine as the championswho knowingly sacrificed themselves for all of our sakes. Their memory mustbring the man who has become indecisive and weak back to the fulfillment of hisduty. This duty is one they themselves fulfilled in good faith and to the veryend.Along with them, I must include a man who has dedicated his life to theawakening of his and our nation through his words and thoughts and finally, byhis acts: Dietrich Eckart. (Dietrich Eckart was involved in the Beer Hall Putsch but was released fromprison and died soon after due to a heart attack.) AFTERWORDOn November 9, 1923, in the fourth year of its existence, the NationalSocialistGerman Workers Party was dissolved and forbidden throughout the entire Reich.Today in November, 1926, it is free again throughout the entire Reich and isstronger and more solid internally than ever.All persecutions, blasphemies, and slander the movement and its leaders havesuffered could not affect it. The truth of its ideas, the purity of thesupporter's will to sacrifice for it caused it to break free from all restraintsand become stronger than ever.In our present world, filled with parliamentary corruption, if our movementconcentrates more and more on the deepest essence of its struggle, and feelsthat it embodies the pure values of race and personality and, as thatpersonification, it positions itself accordingly, it is bound, with almostmathematical certainty, to be victorious in its battle when the time comes.Germany must also gain her deserved place on this earth if she is organized andled by the same principles.A nation that works to cultivate its best racial elements during this era ofrace-poisoning is bound to someday become the lord of earth. May the supportersof our movement never forget this, especially in those times when they may havemisgivings about the magnitude of the sacrifices they face and when theyquestion the chance of success."}]
