[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"1808 FAUST Johann Wolfgang von Goethe translated by George Madison Priest Goethe, Johann Wolfgang Von (1749-1832) - German poet, writer, and playwright who was a dominant influence in German literature. His primary focus was on the natural evolution of things rather than abstract theories. Faust (1808) A play about the legend of Faust who promises his soul to the destructive spirit Mephistopheles in order to fulfill his desire of encountering life through experiences rather than through the study of Philosophy. DEDICATION Ye wavering forms draw near again as ever When ye long since moved past my clouded eyes. To hold you fast, shall I this time endeavour? Still does my heart that strange illusion prize? Ye crowd on me! ‘Tis well! Your might assever While ye from mist and murk around me rise. As in my youth my heart again is bounding, Thrilled by the magic breath your train surrounding. Ye bring with you glad days and happy faces. Ah, many dear, dear shades arise with you; Like some old tale that Time but half erases, First Love draws near to me and Friendship too. The pain returns, the sad lament retraces Life’s labyrinthine, erring course anew And names the good souls who, by Fortune cheated Of lovely hours, forth from my world have fleeted. They do not hear the melodies I’m singing, The souls to whom my earliest lays I sang; Dispersed that throng who once to me were clinging, The echo’s died away that one time rang. Now midst an unknown crowd my grief is ringing, Their very praise but gives my heart a pang, While those who once my song enjoyed and flattered, If still they live, roam through the wide world scattered. And I am seized with long-unwonted yearning Toward yonder realm of spirits grave and still. My plaintive song’s uncertain tones are turning To harps aeolian murmuring at will. Awe binds me fast; tear upon tear falls burning, My stern heart feels a gentle, tender thrill; What I possess, as if far off I’m seeing, And what has vanished, now comes into being. PRELUDE ON THE STAGE MANAGER. DRAMATIC POET. JESTER. Manager Ye two that have so often stood by me In time of need and tribulation, Come, say: what hope in any German nation For what we undertake have ye? I much desire to give the crowd a pleasure, In chief, because they live and let us live. The posts, the boards are up, and here at leisure The crowd expects a feast in what we’ll give. They’re sitting now with eyebrows raised, Quite calmly there, would gladly be amazed. I know how one can make all minds akin, Yet so embarrassed I have never been. In truth, accustomed to the best they’re not, But they have read a really awful lot. How shall we plan that all be fresh and new And with a meaning, yet attractive too? For I do like to see them crowding, urging, When toward our booth the stream sets in apace And with its powerful, repeated surging Pours through the strait and narrow gate of grace, When still in broad daylight, ere it is four, They fight and push their way up to the wicket And as the famine-stricken at the baker’s door They nearly break their necks to get a ticket. This miracle, upon such varied folk, the poet Alone can work; today, my friend, oh, show it! Poet I beg you, of that motley crowd cease telling At sight of whom the spirit takes to flight! Enveil from me the billowing mass compelling Us to its vortex with resistless might. No, lead me to the tranquil, heavenly dwelling Where only blooms for poets pure delight, Where Love and Friendship give the heart their blessing, With godlike hand creating and progressing. \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0002\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Ah, all that from the bosom’s depths sprang flowing, All that from shy and stammering lips has passed, Sometimes success and sometimes failure knowing, To each wild moment’s power a prey is cast. Oft only after years, in credit growing, Doth it appear in perfect form at last. What gleams is born but for the moment’s pages; The true remains, unlost to after-ages. Jester Could I but hear no more of after-ages! Suppose the thought of them my mind engages, Who’d give the present world its fun? That will it have and ought to have it too. The presence of a gallant chap, revealed to you, I think, is also worth while being shown. Who pleasantly can just himself impart, Is not embittered by the people’s whim; He likes to have a crowd surrounding him, More certainly to stir and thrill each heart. So do be good, show you can set the fashion. Let Fantasy be heard with all her chorus: Sense, Reason, Sentiment, and Passion; Yet mark you well! bring Folly too before us! Manager But, more than all, do let enough occur! Men come to look, to see they most prefer. If, as they gaze, much is reeled off and spun, So that the startled crowd gapes all it can, A multitude you will at once have won; You then will be a much-loved man. You can compel the mass by mass alone; Each in the end will seek out something as his own. Bring much and you’ll bring this or that to everyone And each will leave contented when the play is done. If you will give a piece, give it at once in pieces! Ragout like this your fame increases. Easy it is to stage, as easy to invent. What use is it, a whole to fashion and present? The Public still will pick it all to pieces. Poet You do not feel how bad such handiwork must be, How little that becomes the artist true! I see, neat gentlemanly botchery Is now a sovereign rule with you. Manager Reproof like this leaves me quite unoffended! A man who does his work, effectively intended, Must stick to tools that are the best for it. Reflect! You have a tender wood to split; And those for whom you write, just see! If this one’s driven hither by ennui, Another leaves a banquet sated with its vapours; And- what the very worst will always beMany come fresh from reading magazines and papers. Men haste distraught to us as to the masquerade, And every step but winged by curiosity; The ladies give a treat, all in their best arrayed, And play their part without a fee. Why do you dream in lofty poet-land? Why does a full house make you gay? Observe the patrons near at hand! They are half cold, half coarse are they. One, when the play is over, hopes a game of cards; A wild night on a wench’s breast another chooses. Why then, with such an aim, poor silly bards, Will you torment so much the gracious Muses? Give only more and ever, ever more, I say. Then from the goal you nevermore can stray. Seek to bewilder men- that is my view. But satisfy them? That is hard to do.What is attacking you? Pain or delight? Poet Go hence and seek yourself another slave! What! Shall the poet take that highest right, The Right of Man, that Right which Nature gave, And wantonly for your sake trifle it away? How doth he over every heart hold sway? How doth he every element enslave? Is it not the harmony that from his breast doth start, Then winds the world in turn back in his heart? When Nature forces lengths of thread unending In careless whirling on the spindle round, When all Life’s inharmonic throngs unblending In sullen, harsh confusion sound, Who parts the changeless series of creation, That each, enlivened, moves in rhythmic time? Who summons each to join the general ordination, In consecrated, noble harmonies to chime? Who bids the storm with raging passion lower? The sunset with a solemn meaning glow? Who scatters Springtime’s every lovely flower"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Along the pathway where his love may go? Who twines the verdant leaves, unmeaning, slighted, Into a wreath of honour, meed of every field? Who makes Olympus sure, the gods united? That power of Man the Poet has revealed! Jester Then use these handsome powers as your aid And carry on this poet trade As one a love-adventure carries! By chance one nears, one feels, one tarries! And, bit by bit, one gets into a tangle. Bliss grows, then comes a tiff, a wrangle; One is enrapt, now one sees pain advance, And ere one is aware, it is a real romance! So let us also such a drama give! Just seize upon the full life people live! Each lives it though it’s known to few, And grasp it where you will, there’s interest for you. In motley pictures with a little clarity, Much error and a spark of verity, Thus can the best of drinks be brewed To cheer and edify the multitude. Youth’s fairest bloom collects in expectation Before your play and harks the revelation. Then from your work each tender soul, intent, Absorbs a melancholy nourishment. Then now one thought and now another thought you start; Each sees what he has carried in his heart. As yet they are prepared for weeping and for laughter; They still revere the flight, illusion they adore. A mind once formed finds naught made right thereafter; A growing mind will thank you evermore. Poet Then give me back the time of growing When I myself was growing too, When crowding songs, a fountain flowing, Gushed forth unceasing, ever new; When still the mists my world were veiling, The bud its miracle bespoke; When I the thousand blossoms broke, Profusely through the valleys trailing. Naught, yet enough had I when but a youth, Joy in illusion, yearning toward the truth. Give impulse its unfettered dower, The bliss so deep ‘tis full of pain, The strength of hate, Love’s mighty power, Oh, give me back my youth again! Jester Youth, my good friend, you need most in the fight When enemies come on, hard pressing, When, clinging to your necks so tight, The dearest maidens hang caressing, When, from afar, a wreath entrances, Luring to hard-won goal the runner’s might, When, after madly whirling dances, A man carousing drinks away the night. But on the lyre’s familiar strings To play with grace and spirit ever And sweep with lovely wanderings Toward goals you choose for your endeavour, That is your duty, aged sirs, And we revere you for it no less dearly. Age makes not childish, as one oft avers; It finds us still true children merely. Manager Words have been interchanged enough, Let me at last see action too. While compliments you’re turning- idle stuff! Some useful thing might come to view. Why talk of waiting for the mood? No one who dallies ever will it see. If you pretend you’re poets- good! Command then, poets, poetry! What we’re in need of, that full well you know, We want to sip strong drink, so go And start the brew without delay! Never is done tomorrow what is not done today And one should let no day slip by. With resolution seize the possible straightway By forelock and with quick, courageous trust; Then holding fast you will not let it further fly And you will labour on because you must. Upon our German stage, you are aware, Each tries out what he wishes to display, So in your work for me today Scenes, mechanism you are not to spare. Use both the lights of heaven, great and small; The stars above are yours to squander; Nor water, fire, nor rocky wall, Nor beasts nor birds are lacking yonder. Thus in our narrow house of boards preside And on through all Creation’s circle stride; And wander on, with speed considered well, From Heaven, through the world, to Hell! \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0002\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"PROLOGUE IN HEAVEN The LORD. The HEAVENLY HOSTS. Afterwards MEPHISTOPHELES. The THREE ARCHANGELS come forward. Raphael The Sun intones, in ancient tourney With brother-spheres, a rival song, Fulfilling its predestined journey, With march of thunder moves along. Its aspect gives the angels power, Though none can ever solve its ways; The lofty works beyond us tower, Sublime as on the first of days. Gabriel And swift beyond where knowledge ranges, Earth’s splendour whirls in circling flight; A paradise of brightness changes To awful shuddering depths of night. The sea foams up, widespread and surging Against the rocks’ deep-sunken base, And rock and sea sweep onward, merging In rushing spheres’ eternal race. Michael And rival tempests roar and shatter, From sea to land, from land to sea, And, raging, form a circling fetter Of deep, effective energy. There flames destruction, flashing, searing, Before the crashing thunder’s way; Yet, Lord, Thy angels are revering The gentle progress of Thy day. The Three Its aspect gives the angels power, Since none can solve Thee nor Thy ways; And all Thy works beyond us tower, Sublime as on the first of days. Mephistopheles Since you, O Lord, once more draw near And ask how all is getting on, and you Were ever well content to see me here, You see me also midst your retinue. Forgive, fine speeches I can never make, Though all the circle look on me with scorn; Pathos from me would make your sides with laughter shake, Had you not laughter long ago forsworn. Of suns and worlds I’ve naught to say worth mention. How men torment them claims my whole attention. Earth’s little god retains his same old stamp and ways And is as singular as on the first of days. A little better would he live, poor wight, Had you not given him that gleam of heavenly light. He calls it Reason, only to pollute Its use by being brutaler than any brute. It seems to me, if you’ll allow, Your Grace, He’s like a grasshopper, that long-legged race That’s made to fly and flying spring And in the grass to sing the same old thing. If in the grass he always were reposing! But in each filthy heap he keeps on nosing. The Lord You’ve nothing more to say to me? You come but to complain unendingly? Is never aught right to your mind? Mephistopheles No, Lord! All is still downright bad, I find. Man in his wretched days makes me lament him; I am myself reluctant to torment him. The Lord Do you know Faust? Mephistopheles The Doctor? The Lord Yes, my servant! Mephistopheles He! Forsooth, he serves you most peculiarly. Unearthly are the fool’s drink and his food; The ferment drives him forth afar. Though half aware of his insensate mood, He asks of heaven every fairest star And of the earth each highest zest, And all things near and all things far Can not appease his deeply troubled breast. The Lord Although he serves me now confusedly, I soon shall lead him forth where all is clear. The gardener knows, when verdant grows the tree, That bloom and fruit will deck the coming year. Mephistopheles What will you wager? Him you yet shall lose, If you will give me your permission To lead him gently on the path I choose. The Lord As long as on the earth he shall survive, So long you’ll meet no prohibition. Man errs as long as he doth strive. Mephistopheles My thanks for that, for with the dead I’ve never got Myself entangled of my own volition. I like full, fresh cheeks best of all the lot. I’m not at home when corpses seek my house; I feel about it as a cat does with a mouse. The Lord ‘Tis well! So be it granted you today! Divert this spirit from its primal source And if you can lay hold on him, you may Conduct him downward on your course, And stand abashed when you are forced to say: A good man, though his striving be obscure, Remains aware that there is one right way."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Mephistopheles All right! But long it won’t endure! I have no fear about my bet, be sure! When I attain my aim, do not protest, But let me triumph with a swelling breast. Dust shall he eat, and that with zest, As did the famous snake, my near relation. The Lord In that too you may play your part quite free; Your kind I never did detest. Of all the spirits of negation The wag weighs least of all on me. Mankind’s activity can languish all too easily, A man soon loves unhampered rest; Hence, gladly I give him a comrade such as you, Who stirs and works and must, as devil, do. But ye, real sons of God, lift up your voice, In living, profuse beauty to rejoice! May that which grows, that lives and works forever, Engird you with Love’s gracious bonds, and aught That ever may appear, to float and waver, Make steadfast in enduring thought! Heaven closes, the ARCHANGELS disperse. Mephistopheles [alone] I like to see the Old Man not infrequently, And I forbear to break with Him or be uncivil; It’s very pretty in so great a Lord as He To talk so like a man even with the Devil.

Faust I’ve studied now Philosophy And Jurisprudence, Medicine, And even, alas! Theology All through and through with ardour keen! Here now I stand, poor fool, and see I’m just as wise as formerly. Am called a Master, even Doctor too, And now I’ve nearly ten years through Pulled my students by their noses to and fro And up and down, across, about, And see there’s nothing we can know! That all but burns my heart right out. True, I am more clever than all the vain creatures, The Doctors and Masters, Writers and Preachers; No doubts plague me, nor scruples as well. I’m not afraid of devil or hell. To offset that, all joy is rent from me. I do not imagine I know aught that’s right; I do not imagine I could teach what might Convert and improve humanity. Nor have I gold or things of worth, Or honours, splendours of the earth. No dog could live thus any more! So I have turned to magic lore, To see if through the spirit’s power and speech Perchance full many a secret I may reach, So that no more with bitter sweat I need to talk of what I don’t know yet, So that I may perceive whatever holds The world together in its inmost folds, See all its seeds, its working power, And cease word-threshing from this hour. Oh, that, full moon, thou didst but glow Now for the last time on my woe, Whom I beside this desk so oft Have watched at midnight climb aloft. Then over books and paper here To me, sad friend, thou didst appear! Ah! could I but on mountain height Go onward in thy lovely light, With spirits hover round mountain caves, Weave over meadows thy twilight laves, Discharged of all of Learning’s fumes, anew Bathe me to health in thy healing dew. Woe! am I stuck and forced to dwell Still in this musty, cursed cell? Where even heaven’s dear light strains But dimly through the painted panes! Hemmed in by all this heap of books, Their gnawing worms, amid their dust, While to the arches, in all the nooks, Are smoke-stained papers midst them thrust, Boxes and glasses round me crammed, And instruments in cases hurled, Ancestral stuff around me jammedThat is your world! That’s called a world! And still you question why your heart Is cramped and anxious in your breast? Why each impulse to live has been repressed In you by some vague, unexplained smart? Instead of Nature’s living sphere In which God made mankind, you have alone, In smoke and mould around you here, Beasts’ skeletons and dead men’s bone. Up! Flee! Out into broad and open land! And this book full of mystery, From Nostradamus’ very hand, Is it not ample company? The stars’ course then you’ll understand And Nature, teaching, will expand The power of your soul, as when One spirit to another speaks. ‘Tis vain To think that arid brooding will explain The sacred symbols to your ken. Ye spirits, ye are hovering near; Oh, answer me if ye can hear! He opens the book and perceives the sign of the Macrocosm. What rapture, ah! at once is flowing Through all my senses at the sight of this! I feel a youthful life, its holy bliss, Through nerve and vein run on, new-glowing. Was it a god who wrote these signs that still My inner tumult and that fill My wretched heart with ecstasy? Unveiling with mysterious potency The powers of Nature round about me here? Am I a god? All grows so clear to me! In these pure lineaments I see Creative Nature’s self before my soul appear. Now first I understand what he, the sage, has said: “The world of spirits is not shut away; Thy sense is closed, thy heart is dead!

How heavenly powers ascend, descend, Each unto each the golden vessels giving!"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"On pinions fragrant blessings bringing, From Heaven through Earth all onward winging, Through all the All harmonious ringing!

He turns the book over impatiently and perceives the sign of the EARTH-SPIRIT. How differently upon me works this sign! Thou, Spirit of the Earth, I feel, art nigher. I feel my powers already higher, I glow already as from some new wine. I feel the courage, forth into the world to dare; The woe of earth, the bliss of earth to bear; With storms to battle, brave the lightning’s glare; And in the shipwreck’s crash not to despair! Clouds gather over meThe moon conceals her lightThe lamp fades out! Mists rise- red beams dart forth Around my head- there floats A horror downward from the vault And seizes me! Spirit invoked! near me, I feel, thou art! Unveil thyself! Ha! how it rends my heart! To unknown feeling All my senses burst forth, reeling! I feel my heart is thine and to the uttermost! Thou must!

Faust [turning away]. Appalling apparition! Spirit By potent spell hast drawn me here, Hast long been tugging at my sphere, And now- Faust Oh woe! I can not bear thy vision! Spirit With panting breath thou hast implored this sight, Wouldst hear my voice, my face wouldst see; Thy mighty spirit-plea inclineth me! Here am I!- what a pitiable fright Grips thee, thou Superman! Where is the soul elated? Where is the breast that in its self a world created And bore and fostered it? And that with joyous trembling Expanded as if spirits, us, resembling? Where art thou, Faust, whose voice rang out to me, Who toward me pressed with all thy energy? Is it thou who, by my breath surrounded, In all the deeps of being art confounded? A frightened, fleeing, writhing worm? Faust Am I, O form of flame, to yield to thee in fear? ‘Tis I, I’m Faust, I am thy peer! Spirit In the tides of life, in action’s storm, Up and down I wave, To and fro weave free, Birth and the grave, An infinite sea, A varied weaving, A radiant living, Thus at Time’s humming loom it’s my hand that prepares The robe ever-living the Deity wears. Faust Thou who dost round the wide world wend, Thou busy spirit, how near I feel to thee! Spirit Thou art like the spirit thou canst comprehend, Not me! Vanishes. Faust [collapsing] Not thee! Whom then? I, image of the Godhead! And not even like to thee! Somebody knocks. O death! I know it- ‘tis my famulusThus turns to naught my fairest bliss! That visions in abundance such as this Must be disturbed by that dry prowler thus! WAGNER in dressing-gown and night-cap, a lamp in his hand.FAUST turns round impatiently. Wagner Pardon!

Faust Unless you feel, naught will you ever gain; Unless this feeling pours forth from your soul With native, pleasing vigour to control The hearts of all your hearers, it will be in vain. Pray keep on sitting! Pray collect and glue, From others’ feasts brew some ragout; With tiny heaps of ashes play your game And blow the sparks into a wretched flame! Children and apes will marvel at you ever, If you’ve a palate that can stand the part; But heart to heart you’ll not draw men, no, never, Unless your message issue from your heart. Wagner Yet elocution makes the orator succeed. I feel I am still far behind indeed. Faust Seek for the really honest gain! Don’t be a fool in loudly tinkling dress! Intelligence and good sense will express Themselves with little art and strain. And if in earnest you would say a thing, Is it needful to chase after words? Ah, yes, Your eloquence that is so glittering, In which you twist up gewgaws for mankind, Is unrefreshing as the misty wind, Through withered leaves in autumn whispering. Wagner Ah, God! how long is art! And soon it is we die. Oft when my critical pursuits I ply, I truly grow uneasy both in head and heart. How hard to gain the means whereby A man mounts upward to the source! And ere man’s ended barely half the course, Poor devil! I suppose he has to die. Faust Parchment! Is that the sacred fountain whence alone There springs a draught that thirst for ever quells? Refreshment? It you never will have won If from that soul of yours it never wells. Wagner Excuse me! But it is a great delight To enter in the spirit of the ages and to see How once a sage before us thought and then how we Have brought things on at last to such a splendid height. Faust Oh, yes! Up to the stars afar! My friend, the ages of aforetime are To us a book of seven seals. What you call “spirit of the ages” Is after all the spirit of those sages In which the mirrored age itself reveals. Then, truly, that is oft a sorry sight to see! I vow, men do but glance at it, then run away. A rubbish-bin, a lumber-garret it may be, At best a stilted, mock-heroic play With excellent, didactic maxims humming, Such as in puppets’ mouths are most becoming. Wagner But, ah, the world! the mind and heart of men! Of these we each would fain know something just the same. Faust Yes, “know”! Men call it so, but then Who dares to call the child by its right name? The few who have some part of it descried, Yet fools enough to guard not their full hearts, revealing To riffraff both their insight and their feeling, Men have of old burned at the stake and crucified. I beg you, friend, it’s far into the night, We must break off our converse now. Wagner I’d gladly keep awake for ever if I might Converse with you in such a learned way; Tomorrow, though, our Easter-Sunday holiday, This and that question you’ll allow. I’ve studied zealously, and so I know much now, but all I fain would know. Exit. Faust [alone] How strange a man’s not quitted of all hope, Who on and on to shallow stuff adheres, Whose greedy hands for hidden treasure grope, And who is glad when any worm appears! Dare such a human voice resound Where spirits near me throng around? Yet still I thank you, poorest one Of all the sons of earth, for what you’ve done. Torn loose by you, from that despair I’m freed That nearly drove my senses frantic. That vision, ah! was so gigantic, I could but feel myself a dwarf indeed. I, image of the Godhead, and already one Who thought him near the mirror of the Truth Eternal, Who revelled in the clearness, light supernal, And stripped away the earthly son; I, more than cherub, whose free force Presumed, prophetic, even now to course, Creating, on through Nature’s every vein, To share the life of gods: that!- how must I atone! A voice of thunder swept me back again."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"I may not dare to call myself thy peer! What though I had the might to draw thee near, To hold thee I possessed no might. At that ecstatic moment’s height I felt so small, so great; Thou cruelly didst thrust me back as one Doomed to uncertain human fate. Who will instruct me? And what shall I shun? Shall I that impulse then obey? Alas! the deeds that we have doneOur sufferings too- impede us on life’s way. To what the mind most gloriously conceives, An alien, more, more alien substance cleaves. When to the good of this world we attain, We call the better a delusion vain. Sensations glorious, that gave us life, Grow torpid in the world’s ignoble strife. Though Fantasy with daring flight began And hopeful toward Infinity expanded, She’s now contented in a little span When in Time’s eddy joy on joy’s been stranded. For Worry straightway nestles deep within the heart, There she produces many a secret smart. Recklessly rocking, she disturbs both joy and rest. In new disguises she is always dressed; She may appear as house and land, as child and wife, As fire, as water, poison, knife. What never will happen makes you quail, And what you’ll never lose, always must you bewail. I am not like the gods! Feel it I must. I’m like the worm that burrows through the dust, That in the dust in which it lived and fed, Is crushed and buried by a wanderer’s tread.

Shall I perchance in a thousand volumes read That men have tortured themselves everywhere, And that a happy man was here and there?Why grinnest thou at me, thou hollow skull? Save that thy brain, confused like mine, once sought bright day And in the sombre twilight dull, With lust for truth, went wretchedly astray? Ye instruments, ye surely jeer at me, With handle, wheel and cogs and cylinder. I stood beside the gate, ye were to be the key. True, intricate your ward, but no bolts do ye stir. Inscrutable upon a sunlit day, Her veil will Nature never let you steal, And what she will not to your mind reveal, You will not wrest from her with levers and with screws. You, ancient lumber, that I do not use, You’re only here because you served my father. On you, old scroll, the smoke-stains gather, Since first the lamp on this desk smouldered turbidly. Far better had I spent my little recklessly Than, burdened with that little, here to sweat! All that you have, bequeathed you by your father, Earn it in order to possess it. Things unused often burden and beset; But what the hour brings forth, that can it use and bless it. Why does my gaze grow fixed as if a spell had bound me? That phial there, is it a magnet to my eyes? Why does a lovely light so suddenly surround me As when in woods at night the moonbeam drifts and lies? Thou peerless phial rare, I welcome thee And now I take thee down most reverently. In thee I honour human wit and art. Thou essence, juice of lovely, slum’brous flowers, Thou extract of all deadly, subtle powers, Thy favour to thy Master now impart! I look on thee, and soothed is my distress; I seize on thee, the struggle groweth less. The spirit’s flood-tide ebbs away, away. I’m beckoned out, the open seas to meet, The mirror waters glitter at my feet To other shores allures another day. A fiery chariot floats on airy pinions Hither to me! I feel prepared to flee Along a new path, piercing ether’s vast dominions To other spheres of pure activity. This lofty life, this ecstasy divine! Thou, but a worm, and that deservest thou?

See, only see, how quickly the masses Scatter through gardens and fields remote; How down and across the river passes So many a merry pleasure-boat. And over-laden, almost sinking, The last full wherry moves away. From yonder hill’s far pathways blinking, Flash to us colours of garments gay. Hark! Sounds of village joy arise; Here is the people’s paradise, Contented, great and small shout joyfully: “Here I am Man, here dare it to be!” Wagner Doctor, to walk with you is ever An honour and a profit, though I’d here not care to stray alone- no, neverBecause to all that’s vulgar I’m a foe.

Here let us rest a little from our straying. Here often, wrapped in thought, I sat alone And tortured me with fasting and with praying. In hope full rich, firm in the faith possessed, With tears, sighs, wringing hands, I meant To force the Lord in Heaven to relent And end for us the fearful pest. The crowd’s applause now sounds like scorn to me. Oh, could you but within me read How little, son and father, we Were worthy such a fame and meed! My father was a simple, worthy man, Who over Nature and her every sacred zone, Quite honestly, in his odd plan Mused with a wayward zeal that was his own, Who, with adepts their presence lending, Shut him in that black kitchen where he used, According to receipts unending, To get the contraries together fused. There was a lover bold, a lion red, Who to the lily in a tepid bath was wed. Both, tortured then with flames, a fiery tide, From one bride-chamber to another pass. Thereon appeared, with motley colours pied, The youthful queen within the glass. Here was the medicine; the patients died, And no one questioned: who got well? Thus we with hellish nostrums, here Within these mountains, in this dell, Raged far more fiercely than the pest. I gave the poison unto thousands, ere They pined away; and I must live to hear The shameless murderers praised and blessed. Wagner How can you give yourself to such lament? Does not a good man do his part In practising transmitted art Exactly and with good intent?

Behold how in the evening sunset-glow The green-encircled hamlets glitter. The sun retreats- the day, outlived, is o’erIt hastens hence and lo! a new world is alive! Oh, that from earth no wing can lift me up to soar And after, ever after it to strive! I’d see in that eternal evening beam, Beneath my feet, the world in stillness glowing, Each valley hushed and every height agleam, The silver brook to golden rivers flowing. The mountain wild with all its gorges Would hinder not the godlike course for me; Before astounded eyes already surges, With bays yet warm, the open sea. And yet at last the god seems to be sinking; But new impulse awakes, to light I hasten on, eternal brightness drinking, Before me day, behind me night, Above me heaven, and under me the billow. A lovely dream, the while the glory fades from sight. Alas! To wings that lift the spirit light No earthly wing will ever be a fellow. Yet ‘tis inborn in everyone, each fancies His feeling presses upward and along, When over us lost amid the blue expanses The lark sings down his showering song, When over rough heights of firs and larches The outspread eagles soaring roam, And over lakes and over marshes The crane strives onward toward his home. Wagner I’ve often had capricious, odd hours of my own, Yet such an impulse I have never known. One’s sated soon if on the woods and fields he look; I’ll never envy any bird his wing. How differently the joys of spirit bring Us on from page to page, from book to book! Then winter nights become so sweet and fair, A blessed life warms up our every limb; And ah! if one unrolls a parchment really rare, The whole of Heaven descends on him. Faust By one impulse alone are you impressed. Oh, never learn to know the other! Two souls alas! are dwelling in my breast; And each is fain to leave its brother. The one, fast clinging, to the world adheres With clutching organs, in love’s sturdy lust; The other strongly lifts itself from dust To yonder high, ancestral spheres. Oh, are there spirits hovering near, That ruling weave, twixt earth and heaven are rife, Descend! come from the golden atmosphere And lead me hence to new and varied life! Yea! were a magic mantle only mine, To bear me to strange lands at pleasure, I would not barter it for costliest treasure, Not for the mantle of a king resign. Wagner Oh, call them not, the well-known swarms That streaming spread throughout the murky air; In every quarter they prepare A danger for mankind in a thousand forms, Sharp spirit-fangs press from the north Upon you here with arrow-pointed tongues; And from the east, now parching, they come forth And feast themselves upon your lungs; And when the south wind from the desert drives Those that heap glow on glow upon your brain, The west wind brings the swarm that first revives, Then drowns you and the field and plain. They like to hear, on mischief gaily bent, They like to hearken, for they like to try To fool us, pose as if from Heaven sent, And lisp like angels when they lie. But let us go! The world’s already grey, The air grows chill, the mists of evening fall! ‘Tis now we treasure home the most of allWhy do you stand and stare? What is the trouble? What in the gloaming seizes you in such a way? Faust You see that black dog streaking through the grain and stubble? Wagner I saw him long since; not important did he seem to me. Faust Observe him well! What do you take the beast to be? Wagner Why, just a poodle; in his way he’s worrying In his attempt to find his master’s traces. Faust But do you note how in wide spiral rings he’s hurrying Around us here and ever nearer chases? And if I err not, there’s a trail behind him! Along his path a fiery eddy flies. Wagner Only a plain black poodle do I see. Don’t mind him! I think it’s an illusion of your eyes. Faust He seems in magic nooses to be sweeping Around our feet, a future snare to bind.

It is no spectre here."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"He snarls and doubts, now on his belly see him crawl, He wags his tail, dog-habits all. Faust Come here! And be a friend with us! Wagner It is a beast and, poodle-like, ridiculous. Stand quiet and he’ll sit up too; Speak to him and he’ll scramble up on you; Lose something and he’ll bring it back again, Leap into water for your cane. Faust You’re likely right. I find no trace remaining Of any spirit; it is all mere training. Wagner By any dog, if he but be well trained, Even a wise man’s liking may be gained, Yes, he deserves your favour thoroughly, A clever pupil of students, he. They go into the gateway of the town. STUDY Faust [entering with the poodle]. Meadow and field have I forsaken, That deeps of night from sight enroll; A solemn awe the deeps awaken, Rousing in us the better soul. No wild desires can longer win me, No stormy lust to dare and do; The love of all mankind stirs in me, The love of God is stirred anew. Be quiet, poodle! Don’t make such a riot! Why at the threshold do you sniff the air? Lie down behind the stove in quiet! My best of cushions I will give you there. As on the hillside pathway, leaping And running about, you amused us best, So take now too from me your keeping, But as a welcome, silent guest. Ah, when the friendly lamp is glowing Again within our narrow cell, Through heart and bosom light comes flowing If but the heart knows itself well. Then Reason once again discourses And Hope begins to bloom again; Man yearns to reach life’s flowing sources, Ah! to the Fount of Life attain. Snarl not, you poodle! To the sacred strain That now doth all my soul surround, Is suited not that bestial sound. We know full well that men deride whate’er They do not understand And that before the Good and Fair, Which of is hard for them, they grumble; And will the dog, like them too, snarl and bumble? But ah! I feel already, with a will the best, Contentment wells no longer from my breast. But wherefore must the stream so soon run dry And we again thus thirsting lie? I have experienced this in ample measure. And yet this feeling has its compensation; We learn the supernatural to treasure. Our spirits yearn toward revelation That nowhere glows more fair, more excellent, Than here in the New Testament. To open the fundamental text I’m moved, With honest feeling, once for all, To turn the sacred, blest original Into my German well-beloved. He opens a volume and applies himself to it. ‘Tis written: “In the beginning was the Word!” Here now I’m balked! Who’ll put me in accord? It is impossible, the Word so high to prize, I must translate it otherwise If I am rightly by the Spirit taught. ‘Tis written: In the beginning was the Thought! Consider well that line, the first you see, That your pen may not write too hastily! Is it then Thought that works, creative, hour by hour? Thus should it stand: In the beginning was the Power! Yet even while I write this word, I falter, For something warns me, this too I shall alter. The Spirit’s helping me! I see now what I need And write assured: In the beginning was the Deed! If I’m to share this room with you, Poodle, then leave off howling, Then leave off growling! Such a distracting fellow I can’t view Or suffer to have near me. One of us two, or I or you, Must quit this cell, I fear me. I’m loath your right as guest thus to undo. The door is open, you’ve a passage free. But what is this I now must see! Can that happen naturally? Is it phantom? Is it reality? How long and broad the poodle grows! He rises up in mighty pose, ‘Tis not a dog’s form that he shows! What spectre have I sheltered thus?

MEPHISTOPHELES steps forth from behind the stove while the vapour is vanishing. He is dressed as a travelling scholar. Mephistopheles Wherefore this noise? What does my lord command? Faust So this, then, was the kernel of the brute! A travelling scholar it is? The casus makes me smile. Mephistopheles To you, O learned sir, I proffer my salute! You made me sweat in vigorous style. Faust What is your name? Mephistopheles The question seems but cheap From one who for the Word has such contempt, Who from all outward show is quite exempt And only into beings would delve deep. Faust The being of such gentlemen as you, indeed, In general, from your titles one can read. It shows itself but all too plainly when men dub You Liar or Destroyer or Beelzebub. Well now, who are you then? Mephistopheles Part of that Power which would The Evil ever do, and ever does the Good. Faust A riddle! Say what it implies! Mephistopheles I am the Spirit that denies! And rightly too; for all that doth begin Should rightly to destruction run; ‘Twere better then that nothing were begun. Thus everything that you call Sin, Destruction- in a word, as Evil representThat is my own, real element. Faust You call yourself a part, yet whole you’re standing there. Mephistopheles A modest truth do I declare."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"A man, the microcosmic fool, down in his soul Is wont to think himself a whole, But I’m part of the Part which at the first was all, Part of the Darkness that gave birth to Light, The haughty Light that now with Mother Night Disputes her ancient rank and space withal, And yet ‘twill not succeed, since, strive as strive it may, Fettered to bodies will Light stay. It streams from bodies, it makes bodies fair, A body hinders it upon its way, And so, I hope, it has not long to stay And will with bodies their destruction share. Faust Now I perceive your worthy occupation! You can’t achieve wholesale annihilation And now a retail business you’ve begun. Mephistopheles And truly there by nothing much is done. What stands out as the opposite of Naught- This Something, this your clumsy world- for aught I have already undertaken, It have I done no harm nor shaken With waves and storms, with earthquakes, fiery brand. Calm, after all, remain both sea and land. And that accursed trash, the brood of beasts and men, A way to get at them I’ve never found. How many now I’ve buried in the ground! Yet fresh, new blood forever circulates again. Thus on and on- one could go mad in sheer despair! From earth, from water, and from air A thousand germs evolving start, In dryness, moisture, warmth, and cold! Weren’t it for fire which I withhold, I’d have as mine not one thing set apart. Faust So to that Power never reposing, Creative, healing, you’re opposing Your frigid devil’s fist with might and main. It’s clenched in spite and clenched in vain! Seek something else to undertake, You, Chaos’ odd, fantastic son! Mephistopheles We’ll really ponder on what can be done When my next visits here I make. But may I for the present go away? Faust Why you should ask, I do not see. Though we have only met today, Come as you like and visit me. Here is a window, here a door, for you, Besides a certain chimney-flue. Mephistopheles Let me own up! I cannot go away; A little hindrance bids me stay. The witch’s foot upon your sill I see. Faust The pentagram? That’s in your way? You son of Hell explain to me, If that stays you, how came you in today? And how was such a spirit so betrayed? Mephistopheles Observe it closely! It is not well made; One angle, on the outer side of it, Is just a little open, as you see. Faust That was by accident a lucky hit! And are you then my captive? Can that be? By happy chance the thing’s succeeded! Mephistopheles As he came leaping in, the poodle did not heed it. The matter now seems turned about; The Devil’s in the house and can’t get out. Faust Well, through the window- why not there withdraw? Mephistopheles For devils and for ghosts it is a law: Where they slipped in, there too must they go out. The first is free, the second’s slaves are we. Faust Does Hell itself have its laws then? That’s fine! A compact in that case might be Concluded safely with you gentlemen? Mephistopheles What’s promised, you’ll enjoy with naught subtracted, With naught unduly snipped off or exacted. But that needs more than such a brief consideration And we’ll discuss it soon in further conversation. But now, most earnestly I pray, For this time let me go away. Faust One moment longer do remain; Tell me at last some pleasant news. Mephistopheles Let me go now, I’ll soon be back again; Then you may question as you choose.

The Devil is an egoist And not “for God’s sake!” only will he do What will another’s needs assist. Tell me your terms both plain and clear! Such servants in the house bring danger near. Mephistopheles Here to your service I will bind me; Beck when you will, I will not pause or rest; But in return when yonder you will find me, Then likewise shall you be at my behest. Faust The yonder is to me a trifling matter. Should you this world to ruins shatter, The other then may rise, its place to fill. ‘Tis from this earth my pleasure springs, And this sun shines upon my sufferings; When once I separate me from these things, Let happen then what can and will. And furthermore I’ve no desire to hear Whether in future too men hate and love, And whether too in yonder sphere There is an under or above. Mephistopheles In this mood you can dare to go my ways. Commit yourself; you shall in these next days Behold my arts and with great pleasure too. What no man yet has seen, I’ll give to you. Faust Poor devil! What have you to give? Was any human spirit, struggling to ascend, Such as your sort could ever comprehend? Still, have you food on which no man can live? Have you red gold that runs through, without rest, Quicksilver-like, the hand it’s in? A game at which men never win? A maiden who while on my breast Will with my neighbour ogle and conspire? The joys divine of honour, once possessed, Which vanish like a meteor’s fire? Show me the fruit which, ere it’s plucked, will rot, And trees that every day grow green anew! Mephistopheles Such a commission frights me not; Such treasures I can serve to you. But, my good friend, the time approaches when we could In peace and quiet feast on something good. Faust If ever I lay me on a bed of sloth in peace, That instant let for me existence cease! If ever with lying flattery you can rule me So that contented with myself I stay, If with enjoyment you can fool me, Be that for me the final day! That bet I offer! Mephistopheles Done! Faust Another hand-clasp! There! If to the moment I shall ever say: “Ah, linger on, thou art so fair!” Then may you fetters on me lay, Then will I perish, then and there! Then may the death-bell toll, recalling Then from your service you are free; The clock may stop, the pointer falling, And time itself be past for me! Mephistopheles Consider well, we’ll not forget it. Faust Your perfect right to that I’ll not deny. My action was not rash, I’ll not regret it. As soon as I stagnate, a slave am I, And whether yours or whose, why should I ask? Mephistopheles Then at a Doctor’s-feast this very day I’ll act as servant and fulfil my task. But one thing still: in case of life or death, I pray, Give me a written line or two. Faust What, pedant! Something written do you ask of me? Was neither man nor word of man yet known to you? Is it not enough that this my spoken word Disposes of my days for all eternity? Does not the world rush on, in all its currents stirred, And should a promise have a hold on me? Yet to our hearts we’ve taken this conceit. Who gladly would its hold undo? Blest he whose bosom is with breachless faith replete, No sacrifice will that man ever rue. But any stamped and written parchment sheet Is like a ghost that all men shrink to view. The spoken word dies forthwith in the quill; Leather and wax remain our masters still. What, Evil Spirit, do you want of me? Brass, marble, parchment, paper? Name it then! Am I to write with graver, chisel, pen? I offer you your choice quite free. Mephistopheles How can you talk so heatedly, Exaggerate in such a way? Just any little sheet will do, it’s all the same. With one wee drop of blood you sign your name. Faust If this will satisfy you, then I say:"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Let us agree and put the farce to this odd use. Mephistopheles Blood is a quite peculiar juice. Faust Fear not! This league with you I shall not break! The aim and goal of all my energy Is to fulfil the promise I now make. I’ve puffed myself too high, I see; Only within your ranks do I deserve to be. The Mighty Spirit spurned me with a scoff, And Nature turns herself away from me. The thread of thought is broken off, To me all learning’s long been nauseous. In depths of sensuality Let us our glowing passions still! In magic’s veils impervious Prepared at once be every marvel’s thrill! Come, let us plunge into Time’s rushing dance, Into the roll of Circumstance! There may then pain and joyance, Successes and annoyance, Alternately follow as they can. Only restlessly active is a man! Mephistopheles To you no goal is set, nor measure. If you should like to nibble everything, To snatch up something on the wing, May all agree with you that gives you pleasure! Fall to, I say, and don’t be coy. Faust You hear indeed, I do not speak of joy. Life’s wildering whirl be mine, its painfulest enjoyment, Enamoured hate, and quickening annoyment. My bosom, of all thirst for knowledge cured, Shall close itself henceforth against no woe; Whatever to all mankind is assured, I, in my inmost being, will enjoy and know, Seize with my soul the highest and most deep; Men’s weal and woe upon my bosom heap; And thus this self of mine to all their selves expanded, Like them I too at last be stranded. Mephistopheles Oh, trust me who for many a thousand year Have chewed this crust, it is so hard at best That twixt the cradle and the bier That ancient leaven no man can digest. Trust one like me: this Whole is wrought And fashioned only for a God’s delight! He dwells in an eternal light; Us into darkness He has brought; To you are suited only day and night. Faust Ah, but I will! Mephistopheles Well said and right! And yet I fear there is but one thing wrong; For life is short and art is long. I’d think you’d let yourself be taught. Associate you with a poet; then, in thought, You leave the gentleman full sweep, Upon your honoured head to heap Each good and noble quality: The lion’s mood, The stag’s rapidity, The fiery blood of Italy, The Northman’s hardihood. The secret for it? Let him find How magnanimity and cunning are combined, How with a youth’s hot impulse you may fall In love according to a plan. Might I myself know such a gentleman, Him Mr. Microcosm I would call. Faust What am I if I strive in vain To win the crown of all mankind which, though afar, All senses struggle to obtain? Mephistopheles You at the end are- what you are. Put on your head perukes with a million locks, Put on your feet a pair of ell-high socks, You after all will still be- what you are. Faust I feel that I have made each treasure Of human mind my own in vain, And when at last I sit me down at leisure, No new-born power wells up within my brain. I’m not a hair’s-breadth more in height Nor nearer to the infinite. Mephistopheles My good sir, you observe this matter As men these matters always see; But we must manage that much better Before life’s pleasures from us flee. Your hands and feet too- what the devil!Your head and seed are yours alone! Yet all with which I gaily revel, Is it on that account the less my own? If for six stallions I can pay, Aren’t all their powers added to my store? I am a proper man and dash away As if the legs I had were twenty- four! Quick, then! Let all reflection be, And straight into the world with me!

Mephistopheles You please me greatly by your courtesy! A man like many another one you see. Have you already looked about elsewhere? Student I beg you, take me in your kindly care! I come with every good intention, Fresh blood, and money, though not much to mention. My mother scarcely would permit my going. I’d fain learn here abroad something worth knowing. Mephistopheles Well, now you’re at the proper place. Student Yet, frankly, would I could my steps retrace! Within these walls the lecture hall, I do not like it here at all. It is a space that’s so confined; One sees no green nor any tree, And in the halls with benches lined, Sight, hearing, thought, all go from me. Mephistopheles That only comes with habit, so A child takes not its mother’s breast Quite willingly in the beginning, though Soon nourishes itself with zest. So at the breasts of Wisdom nursed, Each day you’ll lust for them the more athirst. Student I’ll cling about her neck with joy, But say what means thereto I shall employ. Mephistopheles Ere you go on, explain your views. Which is the faculty you choose? Student I’d like right learned to become; what is On earth I’d gladly comprehend, To heaven itself my range extend, Know all of nature and the sciences.

Statutes and laws that we inherit Like an eternal malady Go trailing on from race to race And furtive shift from place to place. To nonsense reason turns, and benefit to worry. Woe unto you that you’re a grandchild, woe! For of the law that was born with us, no! Of that, alas! there never is a query. Student You have increased my own disgust. The youth Whom you instruct is blessed in sooth! I’m now almost inclined to try Theology. Mephistopheles I would not wish to lead you so astray. In what this science teaches, it would be So hard to shun the false, misleading way; So much of hidden poison lies therein, You scarce can tell it from its medicine. ‘Tis best here too that only one be heard And that you swear then by the master’s word. Upon the whole- to words stick fast! Then through a sure gate you’ll at last Enter the templed hall of Certainty. Student Yet in each word some concept there must be. Mephistopheles Quite true! But don’t torment yourself to anxiously; For at the point where concepts fail, At the right time a word is thrust in there. With words we fitly can our foes assail, With words a system we prepare, Words we quite fitly can believe, Nor from a word a mere iota thieve.

A little Paris, one that cultivates its people. Siebel Who are these strangers, do you think? Frosch Leave it to me! Give me a brimming drink And from these chaps I’ll worm the truth As one draws out a young child’s tooth. To me they seem of noble family, So proud and discontented they appear to be.

Why is that fellow’s one foot lame? Mephistopheles We’ll sit with you if you’ll permit the liberty. Instead of some good drink which is not here, We shall enjoy your company’s good cheer. Altmayer A very pampered man you seem to be. Frosch I guess you started late from Rippach on your way. Can you have supped with Master Hans tonight? Mephistopheles We passed him by without a stop today! We spoke with him last time. He’d quite A lot about his cousins to convey, Charged us with greetings to each one. He bows toward FROSCH. Altmayer [in a low tone]. You got it then! He knows! Siebel A cunning fellow, he! Frosch Just wait a bit, I’ll get him on the run. Mephistopheles If I mistake not, didn’t we Hear practised voices sing in chorus? In truth, a song must perfectly Reecho from this vaulted ceiling o’er us! Frosch Are you perchance a virtuoso? Mephistopheles Oh no! The zest is great, ability but so-so. Altmayer Give us a song! Mephistopheles A lot, if that way you incline. Siebel But let it be a brand-new strain!

Mephistopheles In silk and velvet splendid He now was always dressed, By ribbons gay attended, A cross upon his breast.

Woe’s me, if there’s naught better you can find! For now my hope already disappears. Has nature not, has not a noble mind, Discovered somewhere any balm? Mephistopheles My friend, you talk once more as if you’re calm. By natural means you can acquire a youthful look, But it is in another book And is a chapter strange to see. Faust Still I will know it. Mephistopheles Good! To have a remedy Without physician, money, sorcery: Betake yourself into the fields without delay, Begin to dig and hack away, Maintain yourself, your thought and feeling, Within a circle quite confined and fixed; Take nourishment of food that is not mixed; Live with the beasts as beast, nor deem it base To spread the field you reap with your own dung. Be sure, this method’s best in any case, Though eighty years of age, still to be young. Faust I am not used to that; I can’t submit To take the spade in hand and dig and ditch. For me a narrow life is quite unfit. Mephistopheles So then there is no help save from the witch. Faust But why the old beldame? What is your notion? Can you yourself not brew the potion? Mephistopheles That were a lovely pastime on my part! Meanwhile a thousand bridges I could rear. We can’t depend alone on science or on art, The work demands a deal of patience too. A quiet spirit’s busy many a year, For time alone produces potent brew. And all that is a part of it Is wondrous as one must admit! It’s true, the Devil taught her how to do it, And yet the Devil can not brew it. Catching sight of THE BEASTS. How delicate the breed! Just see! That is the maid! The man is he! To THE BEASTS.

Here I have a bottle From which I sometimes wet my throttle, Which has no more the slightest stink; I’ll gladly give a little glass to you. In a low tone. And yet this man, if unprepared he drink, He can not live an hour, as you know too. Mephistopheles He is a friend of mine whom it will profit well; I would bestow your kitchen’s best on him. So draw your circle, speak your spell, Give him a cup full to the brim! THE WITCH with curious gestures draws a circle and places marvellous things in it; meanwhile the glasses begin to ring, the cauldron to sound and make music. Lastly, she brings a large book and places the APES in a circle so as to make them serve as reading-desk and hold the torch. She beckons FAUST to come near her. Faust [to MEPHISTOPHEILES]. What is to come of all this? Say! These frantic gestures and this crazy stuff? This most insipid, fooling play, I’ve known and hated it enough. Mephistopheles Nonsense! She only wants to joke us; I beg you, do not be so stern a man! Physician-like, she has to play some hocus-pocus So that the juice will do you all the good it can. He obliges FAUST to step into the circle. The Witch [begins to declaim, with great emphasis, from the book]. This you must ken! From one make ten, And two let be, Make even three, Then rich you’ll be. Skip o’er the four! From five and six, The Witch’s tricks, Make seven and eight, ‘Tis finished straight; And nine is one, And ten is none, That is the witch’s one-time-one! Faust I think the old hag’s talking in delirium. Mephistopheles Much more of it is still to come. I know it well, thus doth the whole book chime; I’ve squandered over it much time, For perfect contradictions, in the end, Remain mysterious alike for fools and sages. The art is old and new, my friend. It was the way in all the ages, Through Three and One, and One and Three, Error instead of truth to scatter. Thus do men prate and teach untroubledly. With fools who’ll bandy wordy chatter? Men oft believe, if only they hear wordy pother, That there must surely be in it some thought or other. The Witch [goes on]. The lofty power Of Wisdom’s dower From all the world is hidden! Who takes no thought, To him it’s brought, Without a care, unbidden. Faust What nonsense is she chanting here before us? My head’s near splitting from her shrieking. I seem to hear a whole, great chorus, A hundred thousand idiots speaking. Mephistopheles Enough, O Sibyl excellent, enough! Give us your drink, the precious stuff, And fill the goblet quickly to the brim. Since he’s my friend, the drink will not hurt him. A man of numerous degrees, he’s quaffed Already many a goodly draught. THE WITCH with many ceremonies pours the drink into a goblet. As FAUST lifts it to his mouth, a light flame rises. Mephistopheles Quick, down with it! And make an end! Your heart will be delighted by the drink. You are the Devil’s bosom friend, And yet, afraid of fire, you shrink? THE WITCH breaks up the circle. FAUST steps out. Mephistopheles Quick, now, away! You must not rest. The Witch May you enjoy the small gulp’s savour! Mephistopheles [to THE WITCH]. If I can do you any favour, Then on Walpurgis Night make your request. The Witch Here is a song!

Margaret I’m not a lady, am not fair; I can go home without your care. She frees herself and exits. Faust By heaven, but this child is fair! I’ve never seen her equal anywhere! So virtuous, modest, through and through, Yet with a bit of curtness too. Her ruby lips, her cheek’s clear bloom, I’ll not forget till the day of doom!

Faust Hear, you must get that girl for me! Mephistopheles Well, which one, then? Faust She just went by. Mephistopheles That one? She was just coming from her priest, Absolved from every sin, down to the least. Hard by the chair I stole quite nigh. She’s innocent in deed and thought And went to confession all for naught. Over her I have no power. Faust She’s over fourteen years old even so. Mephistopheles My word! You talk like gay Lothario Who covets for himself each lovely flower And fancies, puffed up, there’s no honour, no, Nor favour that he may not cull; But yet that is not always possible. Faust Sir Master Worshipful, I beg you, pause And leave me in peace with all your laws! And this I say- few words are bestUnless that sweet young maiden lays Her head this night upon my breast, At midnight we’ve gone different ways. Mephistopheles Consider well what can and can not be. I’ll need at least some fourteen days But to scent out an opportunity. Faust Had I but seven hours’ rest, no need Of devil would I have, to lead A little creature such as this astray. Mephistopheles You’re talking almost like a Frenchman. Pray Don’t let yourself be vexed beyond due measure. What good is it to reap immediate pleasure? The joy’s not near so great, I say, As if you first prepare the ground With every sort of idle folly, Knead and make ready your pretty dolly, As many Romance tales expound. Faust I’ve appetite without that too. Mephistopheles Now jests aside, no more ado. With that good, lovely child, indeed, I tell you once for all, we can’t use speed. There’s nothing here to take by storm; To strategy we must conform. Faust Get something that the angel owns for me! Oh, lead me to her place of rest! Get me a kerchief from her breast, A garter to my ecstasy! Mephistopheles Now just to prove that I will be Of helpful service in your agony, We’ll lose no moment in delay.

I feel My very inmost being reel! What wouldst thou here? What weights thy heart so sore? O wretched Faust! I know thee now no more. Does magic play about me, sweet and rare? Some force impelled me to enjoy without delay, And now in dreams of love I seem to float away! Are we the sport of every puff of air?

There was in Thule olden A king true till the grave, To whom a beaker golden His dying mistress gave. Naught prized he more, this lover, He drained it at each bout; His eyes with tears brimmed over, As oft he drank it out. And when he came to dying, His towns and his lands he told, Naught else his heir denying Except the beaker of gold. Around him knight and vassal, At a royal feast sat he In his fathers’ lofty castle, The castle by the sea. There the old pleasure-seeker Drank, standing, life’s last glow, Then hurled the sacred beaker Into the waves below. He saw it plunging, drinking, And sinking in the sea, And so his eyes were sinking, Never one drop more drank he. She opens the press to put away her clothes and catches sight of the little jewelcasket. How came this lovely casket in my press? Indeed I turned the lock most certainly. It’s very strange! What’s in it I can’t guess. Someone has brought it as a pledge maybe, And on it Mother loaned a bit. Here on the ribbon hangs a little key, I really think I’ll open it. What is that? God in Heaven!

The woman has a scent that’s fine enough, Forever in her prayer-book she delights to snuff, And smells it out in every single thing If it be sacred or profane; So in those gems she noses till it’s plain That they held little blessing, little good. “My child,” she cried, “to keep unrighteous gain Perturbs the soul, consumes the blood.

Mephistopheles He fabled as he breathed his last, be sure, If I am only half a connoisseur. “I could not gape for pastime,” so he said; “First children, then to get them bread, And bread in all the broadest sense, I swear; Yet never could I eat in peace my share.\" Martha To all my love, fidelity, he gave no thought, Nor to my drudgery by night and day? Mephistopheles Not so; he thought of it most warmly as he ought. He said: “From Malta once I sailed away And ardently for wife and children did I pray. Then Heaven favoured us in gracious measure Because our ship a Turkish vessel caught Which to the mighty Sultan bore a treasure. Then valour was rewarded as was fit, And I received moreover, as one ought, My own well-measured share of it.\" Martha Oh what? Oh where? Perhaps he buried it? Mephistopheles Who knows where the four winds have carried it? A pretty miss adopted him as her dear friend When he, in Naples strange, was circulating; She gave him love and troth so unabating That he felt the results until his blessed end. Martha The scamp! The robber of his children, he! And all that want and all that misery Could not prevent the shameful life he led! Mephistopheles Well, he has paid for it and now he’s dead. If I were now in your place here, I’d mourn for him a well-bred year, Meanwhile be on the lookout for a sweetheart new. Martha Ah, God! Another like the first I knew, I’ll hardly find on earth again! There scarce could be a dearer little fool than mine. Only to roam he was too much inclined, and then He loved those foreign women, also foreign wine, And that accursed dice-throwing. Mephistopheles Now, now, things could have gone and still be going, If he perchance as much in you Had overlooked on his part too. I swear, on terms like these, if you’d agree, I’d ask you to exchange a ring with me. Martha The gentleman is pleased to jest. Mephistopheles [aside]. Now to make off betimes were best!

Ladies, good-by! Margaret Good-by! Martha Oh, quickly let me hear The evidence I’d like to have and save: Where, how, and when my darling died and where his grave. Of order I have always been a friend, And in our Weekly I would like to read his end. Mephistopheles Yes, my good woman, what two witnesses attest Is always known as truth made manifest, And with me I’ve a splendid mate. I tell you, I’ll take him before a magistrate. I’ll bring him here. Martha Oh, do that, do! Mephistopheles And this young lady, will she be here too? A gallant chap! and travelled far has he And shows young ladies every courtesy.

Then you would be a saint indeed! Is it the first time in your life You’ve borne false witness? Well, I wonder! Of God, the world, and what therein is rife, Of man, what stirs within his heart and brain, Have you no definition given with might and main? With brazen brow and dauntless breast?

We have no maid- must cook, sweep, sew, and knit, And early run about and late; And Mother is in all of it So accurate! Not that in spending she must feel confined; We could branch out far more than many do. My father left a pretty property behind, A house outside the town, a little garden too.

The wee thing’s cradle stood at night Beside my bed; it scarcely might Just stir; I was awake; Sometimes I had to give it drink, sometimes to take It in with me, sometimes from bed arise And dandle up and down the room to hush its cries; And at the wash-tub stand at daylight’s break, Then to the marketing and to the hearth attend.

Ending- I dare not say in what fruition! Faust Shame on you! Mephistopheles That’s not to your liking, eh? You have the moral right to cry out “Shame! Before chaste ears one must not name What chaste hearts can’t dispense with, just the same!

Margaret Ah, could I but impress you, Henry dear! The Holy Sacraments you also don’t revere. Faust I do revere them. Margaret But without desire, alas! It’s long since you confessed or went to mass.

He is a knave, I really do think! God forgive me if I’m doing him wrong! Faust Such queer birds there must also be. Margaret I’d not like to live with one like him! If he but comes inside the door, you see Him look always so scoffingly And so half grim. For nothing has he any real sympathy; It’s written on his forehead, one can see That in his sight no soul can be dear. I feel so happy in your arm, So free, so yielding, and so warm, And yet my heart grows stifled whenever he is near. Faust O you foreboding angel, you! Margaret It overcomes me so much too, That when he but only comes our way, I even think I’ve no more love for you, And when he’s there, I nevermore could pray; That eats into my heart; and so you too Must feel, dear Henry, as I do.

Already springtime in the birches stirs, It’s even felt already by the firs; Should not our members also feel effect? Mephistopheles Forsooth, no trace of that can I detect!

How each, quickly moving, passes, And the cliffs that low are bowing, And the rocks, long nose-like masses, How they’re snoring, how they’re blowing! Over stones and grass are flowing Brook and brooklet downward fleeting. Hear I murmuring? Hear I singing? Hear sweets plaints of love entreating, Voices of those blest days ringing? What we’re loving, hopeful yearning! And the echo, like returning Tales of olden times, rousondeth! Hoo-hoo! Shoo-hoo! Nearer soundeth Cry of owlet, jay, and plover! Are they all awake remaining? Salamanders, through the cover, Long-limbed, fat-paunched, are they straining? And the roots, like serpents, winding Out of rock and sand, unbinding, Stretch out fetters strange to scare us, To affright us and ensnare us.

Vapour floats yonder, there is steam up-leaping, Here shines a glow through mist and haze, Then like a slender thread it’s creeping, Then forth it breaks like fountain-sprays. Here for a long way it goes winding Along the vale in a hundred veins And here- a corner crowding, bindingIn sudden isolation wanes.

Faust How through the air the tempest raves! It smites my neck, shock after shock! Mephistopheles You must lay hold on these old ribs of rock; Else it will hurl you down to these abysses’ graves. A mist is making night more dark. How through the woods it crashes! Hark! Scared away, the owls are flying. Hearken! Columns split and quiver In palaces of green undying. The branches sigh and breaking shiver! The tree-trunks’ mighty groaning! The roots are creaking and moaning! In frightfully entangled fall They crash together, one and all, And through the wreck-over-strewn abysses The tempest howls and hisses. Voices over us! Do you hear? Now far off and now more near?

A sturdy sow with mother astride, All witches follow in a tide. A Voice Which way did you come here? A Voice The Ilsenstein way. I peeped in the owl’s nest there today. She made great eyes at me! A Voice Oh, fare on to Hell! Why ride so pell-mell? A Voice Just see how she’s flayed me! The wounds she has made me! Witches [Chorus]. The way is broad, the way is long; What is that mad and crazy throng? The broomstick pokes, the pitchfork thrusts, The infant chokes, the mother busts. Wizards [Half Chorus]. We steal along, like snails’ our pace; All women beat us in the race. If toward Hell we set our pace, By a thousand steps they win the race.

They go to track the flamelets out And think they’re near the treasure. Devil alliterates with Doubt, So I am here with pleasure. Leader of the Orchestra. Frog in leaves and cricket shrill, Cursed dilettants! Perdition! Fly-snout and mosquito-bill, You’re each a fine musician! The Adroit. Sans-souci, we call us so, Gay creatures free from worry; We afoot no more can go, So on our heads we hurry. The Ne’er-Do-Wells. We once sponged many a bite, ‘tis true, God help us! That is done now! We’ve danced our shoes entirely through, On naked soles we run now. Will-o’-the-Wisps. From the marshes we come out, Where we arose from litter; Yet here in dancing roundabout We’re gallants all a-glitter. A Falling Star. From the heights above plunged I, With star- and fire-light o’er me; Crooked now in grass I lie, Who’ll to my feet restore me? The Heavy Ones. Room! more room! All round us too! Thus downward go the grasses. Spirits come and they, it’s true, Are clumsy, heavy masses. Puck. Bloated, enter not the fray, Like elephant-calves about one!

Woe! that no human soul can grasp it, that more than one creature has sunk down into the depths of this misery, that the first one, in writhing, deathly agony, did not atone for the guilt of all the others in the sight of the Eternal Pardoner!

Over the spot where a man was slain, avenging spirits hover and lie in wait for the returning murderer. Faust That too from you? The murder and death of a world be upon you, monster! Lead me to her, I say, and set her free! Mephistopheles I will lead you, and what I can do, hear! Have I all power in Heaven and on earth? The warder’s senses I will becloud; make yourself master of the keys and lead her forth with human hand. I’ll watch! The magic horses are ready, I will carry you away. That I can do.

The guards there at the doorway hold Their halberds crosswise and athwartBut here he is. The Fool is bold! Mephistopheles [kneeling before the throne]. What is accursed and welcomed ever? What’s longed for, ever chased away? What’s always taken into favour? What’s harshly blamed, accused each day? Whom don’t you dare to summon here? Whose name hears gladly every man? What to your throne is drawing near? What’s placed itself beneath your ban? Emperor. Your words you may present spare! The place for riddles is not here; They are these gentlemen’s affair. Solve them yourself! I’d like to hear. My old fool’s gone far, far away, I fear me; Take you his place and come and stand here near me.

But ah! what good to mortal mind is sense, What good to hearts is kindness, hands benevolence, When through the state a fever runs and revels, And evil hatches more and more of evils? Who views the wide realm from this height supreme, To him all seems like an oppressive dream, Where in confusion is confusion reigning And lawlessness by law itself maintaining, A world of error evermore obtaining. This man steals herds, a woman that, Cross, chalice, candlestick from altar; For many years his boastings never falter, His skin intact, his body sound and fat. Now plaintiffs crowd into the hall, The judge, encushioned, lords it over all. Meanwhile in billows, angry, urging, A growing tumult of revolt is surging.

Let one forbid what all men fain expect, He’s put his hand into a hornet’s nest; The empire which they should protect Lies plundered, desolate, and waste. This furious riot no one is restraining, Already half the world’s undone; Outside the realm kings still are reigning, But no one thinks it his concern- not one. Treasurer Who will depend upon allies! The funds they pledged as subsidies, Like leaking pipe-borne water, do not flow. Then, Sire, of these wide states- yours by successionWho now has come into possession? A new lord rules wherever one may go, Insist on living independently; How he keeps house, we must look on and see. Of rights we’ve given up so many, We’re left without a claim to any. And as to parties, of whatever name, There’s been no trust in them of late; They may give praise or they may blame, Indifferent are their love and hate. To rest them well from all their labour Lie hidden Ghibelline and Guelph. Who is there now who’ll help his neighbour? Each has enough to help himself. Barred are the gates where gold is stored, And all men scratch and scrape and hoard, And empty all our coffers stay. Steward. What ills I too must learn to bear! We want each day to save and spare, And more we’re needing every day, And daily do I see new trouble growing. The cooks lack nothing, they’ve no woes; For boars and stags and hares and roes And fowls, geese, ducks, and turkeys too, Allowances-in-kind, sure revenue, They still are not so badly flowing. The flow of wine? That, to be sure, is slowing. Where once in cellars cask on cask was nuzzling, The best of brands and vintages befuzzling, Our noble lords’ eternal guzzling Is draining every last drop out. The City Council’s store must now be opened up. A basin, bowl, is seized as drinking-cup And under the table ends the drinking-bout. Now I’m to pay, give each his wages. The Jew will spare me no outrages, He’ll make advances which for ages Will put our revenues to rout. The swine are no more fatten fed, Pawned is the pillow on the bed, At table we eat bread for which we owe. Emperor [after some reflection, to MEPHISTOPHELES].

Nature is sin, and Mind is devil, They nurture doubt, in doubt they revel, Their hybrid, monstrous progeny. That’s not for us!- Our Emperor’s ancient land Has seen arise two castes alone Who worthily uphold his throne: The saints and knights.

Recall those fearful times when roving bands Poured like a deluge drowning men and lands, How many men, so greatly did they fear, Concealed their dearest treasure there and here. So it was of old when mighty Rome held sway, So it was till yesterday, aye, till today. It all lies buried in the earth, to save it; The earth’s the Emperor’s, and he should have it. Treasurer.

Chaste Luna has her humours whimsical; The strength of Mars, though striking not, threats all; And Jupiter is still the fairest star. Saturn is great, small to our eyes and far; Him as a metal we don’t venerate, Little in worth but heavy in his weight.

I’m skilled in managing such household troubles, And Asmodeus, comrade true, I summon To scatter strife betimes twixt man and woman; Thus I destroy the human race in couples. Tisiphone. Poison, steel- not words maliciousMix I, whet I, for the traitor. Lov’st thou others? Sooner, later, Overwhelms thee ruin vicious. What the sweetest moment offers, Turns perforce to wormwood galling! Here no haggling, pulling, hauling; As one sins, one always suffers. None shall sing about forgiving! To the rocks my cause I’m crying. Echo, hark! “Revenge!” replying. For the unstable, death! not living!

Ye see a mountain pressing through the throng, Its flanks with brilliant housings proudly hung, A head with long tusks, snake-like snout below. A mystery! but soon the key I’ll show. A dainty woman on his neck is sitting And with her wand subjects him to her bidding; Another stands aloft, sublime to see, Girt by a radiance dazzling, blinding me. Beside them chained, two noble women near, Fearful the one, the other blithe of cheer. One longs for freedom and one feels she’s free. Let each declare now who she be. Fear. Lamps and lights and torches smoking Through this turmoil gleam around; Midst these faces, shamming, joking, I, alas, in chains am bound. Hence, ye throngs absurdly merry! I mistrust your grins with right; Every single adversary Presses nearer in this night. Friend turned foe would here bewray me, But his mask I know well. Stay, Yonder’s one who wished to slay me; Now revealed, he slinks away. Through the wide world I would wander, Following every path that led, But destruction threatens yonder, Holds me fast twixt gloom and dread. Hope Hail, beloved sisters, hail! Though today and yesterday Ye have loved this maskers’ play, Yet tomorrow ye’ll unveil. This I know of you quite surely. If beneath the torches’ flaring We can’t find our special pleasure, Yet in days of cheerful leisure, As our will doth bid us purely, Now in groups, now singly faring, We’ll roam over lovely leas, Resting, doing, as we please, In a life no cares assailing, Naught forgoing, never failing. Everywhere as welcome guest Let us enter, calm in mind, Confident that we shall find Somewhere, certainly, the best. Prudence. Two of man’s chief foes, behold them, Fear and Hope, in fetters mated; From this crowd I’ll keep and hold them. Room, make room! Ye’re liberated. I conduct the live colossus, See the burden that it carries, And the steepest pass it crosses, Step by step, and never wearies. But upon the summit of it Yonder goddess with her pinions Broad and agile, seeking profit, Turns to spy all man’s dominions. Girt is she by splendour glorious Shining far along all courses, Victory her name! Victorious Goddess of all active forces. Zoilo-Thersites. Ho, ho! Just right I’ve reached this spot, We’re one and all a wretched lot! And yet the goal I’ve chosen me Is she up there, Dame Victory. She with her snowy wings spread out Thinks she’s an eagle, past all doubt, And wheresoever she may stir, Thinks men and lands belong to her. But when some glorious deed is done, At once I put my armour on. Up with the low, down with the high, The crooked straight, the straight awryThat, only, makes me feel aglow, And on this earth I’ll have it so. Herald. Then take thou that, a master-blow From my good staff, thou wretched hound, Then straightway writhe and twist around!How swift the two-fold dwarfish clump Balls up into a loathsome lump!But see! lump turns to egg- a wonder! Puffs itself up and bursts asunder. Thence comes a pair of twins to earth, Adder and bat- a wondrous birth!

There’s no name I could ascribe thee, But I rather might describe thee. Boy Charioteer. Try it then! Herald I must avow, Firstly, young and fair art thou. A half-grown boy thou art; but women rather Would see thee full-grown altogether. It seems that thou wilt be a fickle wooer, Right from the start a real undoer. Boy Charioteer. That’s well worth hearing! On with thee, Discover now the riddle’s happy key. Herald. Thy flashing ebony eyes, locks black and glowing, More radiant from the jewelled diadem! And what a graceful robe doth stream From shoulder down to buskin flowing, With glittering gaud and purple hem! Now might we flouting “Maiden!” deem thee, Yet, good or ill as it might be, Already maidens would esteem thee. They’d teach thee soon thine A B C. Boy Charioteer. And yonder one, in splendour glowing, Who proudly sits on chariot throne? Herald. A king he seems, of wealth o’erflowing; Happy the man who has his favour won! He has naught more to earn and capture, He swift espies where aught’s amiss, And has in giving more pure rapture Than in possessing and in bliss. Boy Charioteer. To stop with this will not avail; Thou must describe him in far more detail. Herald. There’s no describing Dignity. The healthy, full-moon face I see, The lips so full, the cheeks so blooming Beneath the turban’s beauty looming, The flowing robe he’s richly wearingWhat shall I say of such a bearing? He seems a ruler known to me. Boy Charioteer. Plutus, the god of wealth, is he. Hither he comes in gorgeous trim; Sorely the Emperor longs for him. Herald.

Bragging becomes thee charmingly, But now thine arts, pray, let us see. Boy Charioteer. Here see me snap my fingers. Lo! Around the chariot gleam and glow! And now a necklace of pearls appears! Continuing to snap his fingers in every direction. Here spangled gold for neck and ears And flawless comb and coronet And rings with precious jewels set.

Dream-like he’s scatt’ring gems where all Are snatching in the spacious hall. But what is this? A brand-new juggle! However busily one snatch and struggle, His trouble really does not pay; The gifts take wing and fly away. The pearls are loosened from their band And beetles scrabble in his hand; He shakes them off, the poor biped, And then they hum around his head. Others, instead of solid things, Catch butterflies with flimsy wings. How much he promises, the knave! Glitter of gold was all he gave. Boy Charioteer. Of masks, I note, thou canst proclaim each feature. Beneath the shell to fathom out the nature Is not the herald’s courtly task; A keener eye for that we ask. But feuds I shun, if only in suggestion; To thee, lord, I address my speech and question. Turning to PLUTUS. Didst thou not give me charge supreme Over the four-yoked, whirlwind team? Guide I not happily as thou leadest? Am I not everywhere thou biddest? And on bold pinions did I not for thee Bear off the palm of victory? However oft for thee as I’ve contended, Success was ever my portion; and when now The laurel decorates thy brow, Did not my hand and art entwine and blend it? Plutus. If need be that I testify, then hear it! I say with joy: Thou art spirit of my spirit! Thy deeds are ever after my own will; Rich as I am, thou art richer still. Thy service to reward in fitting measure, The laurel more than all my crowns I treasure. This truth in all men’s hearts I would instill: In thee, dear son, I have much pleasure. Boy Charioteer [to the crowd]. The greatest gifts my hand deals out, Lo! I have scattered roundabout. On this head and on that one too There glows a flamelet that I threw. From one to other head it skips, To this one cleaves, from that one slips; It seldom flares up like a plume, And swiftly beams in transient bloom. Ere many its worth recognize, It burns out mournfully and dies. Women’s Chatter. There on the chariot sits a man Who surely is a charlatan, Hunched up behind, a perfect clown, By thirst and hunger so worn down As naught before, and if ye’d pinch, He has no flesh to feel and flinch. Starveling. Away from me, ye odious crew! Welcome, I know, I never am to you. When hearth and home were women’s zone, As Avaritia I was known.

My deeds in darkness never are concealed; If I but breathe, I am at once revealed. And so, farewell My bliss thou grantest me, But whisper low and I am back with thee. Exit as he came. Plutus. It’s time now to unloose the precious metals. I strike the padlocks with the herald’s rod. The chest flies open! See in brazen kettles A boiling, bubbling up of golden blood. First, ornaments of crowns, chains, rings will follow! Seething, it threatens all to melt and swallow. Alternating Cries from the crowd. See here! and there! how treasures brim! The chest is filling to the rimVessels of gold are grilling there, And coins in rolls are milling there.As if just minted, ducats jump, Oh, how my heart begins to thump!All that I want I see and more!

Ye gayest ones, surround him here, Dance madly, hov’ring round him here, For since he’s solemn and yet kind, Man’s happiness he has in mind. Even beneath the azure, vaulted roof He ever kept slumber far aloof; Yet purling brooks seek him in quest And soft airs cradle him to rest. And when he sleeps at mid of day, No leaflet stirs upon its spray; Health-giving plants with balsam rare Pervade the still and silent air. Then may the nymph in joy not leap And where she stood, she falls asleep.

We must possess ourselves, serene in spirit, And come what may must confidently bear it. Still hast thou shown indeed a valiant soul, But soon a thing most horrible will try it. Stoutly men now and later will deny it. Inscribe it truly in thy protocol. Herald [grasping the staff which PLUTUS keeps in his hand]. The dwarfs lead Pan, the great god, nigher, Quite gently, to the well of fire. It seethes up from the deepest maw, Then down again the flames withdraw, And gloomy gapes the open jaw. The foam and flame roll up again. Complacent doth Great Pan remain, Rejoicing in the wondrous sight, While pearls of foam spurt left and right. How can he in such wizardry confide? He stoops down low to look inside.But now his beard is falling in!Whose can it be, that beardless chin? His hand conceals it from our gaze.- A great mishap is taking place. The beard flies backward, all ablaze, And kindles wreath and head and breast; Turned into sorrow is the jest.To quench the fire they race and run, But free from flames there is not one, And as they slap and beat it too, They only stir up flames anew; In fiery flames entangled, caught, A maskers’ group is burned to naught.

Tomorrow morn will everywhere Proclaim what no one likes to hear. Yet everywhere I’ll hear the cry: “The Emperor suffers agony!” Oh, would that something else were true!

The mimic woods are catching fire, The tongues of flame lick higher, higher, Where netted rafters interlace; A fiery doom threats all the place.

Courtiers I recognized amid the splendour, I seemed a prince over many a salamander. Mephistopheles That are you, Sire, since every element Doth own you absolute to all intent. Obedient have you now proved fire to be. Where waves heave wildest, leap into the sea! The pearl-strewn bottom you will scarcely tread Ere a glorious billowing dome forms overhead. You’ll see there light-green rolling billows swelling, Their edges purple, forming the fairest dwelling Round you, the centre. Wander at your will, The palaces attend you even still. The very walls rejoice in life, in teeming, Arrowy swarming, hither, thither streaming. Sea-wonders push and dart along to win The new soft glow but none may enter in. The dragons, mottled, golden-scaled, are playing; There gapes the shark but you laugh at his baying. Though now the court surrounds you in delight, Still such a throng has never met your sight. Yet long you’re not deprived of forms endearing; The Nereids come curiously nearing Your splendid palace in the cool of ocean, The young with fish-like, shy, and wanton motion, The old ones prudent.

Be near whenever- as is oft the caseI grutch at this poor world of commonplace. Steward [enters in haste]. Ah, Most Serene, in all my life I never Thought I could give you news of such high favour As this which richly blesses me And drives me here almost in ecstasy. Bill upon bill has now been squared, The usurers’ talons have been pared. From hellish worry I am free! In Heaven life can not happier be. Commander-in-Chief [follows in haste]. Arrears are paid as they were due And all the army’s pledged anew; The soldier feels his blood made over. Landlords and wenches are in clover. Emperor.

As certain pledge thereof shall stand Vast buried treasure in the Emperor’s land. Provision has been made that ample treasure, Raised straightway, shall redeem the notes at pleasure.\" Emperor. I sense a crime, a monstrous, cheating lure! Who dared to forge the Emperor’s signature? Is still unpunished such a breach of right? Treasurer.

You can not think how glad the people were. Behold your city, once half-dead, decaying, Now full of life and joy, and swarming, playing! Although your name has blessed the world of yore, So gladly was it never seen before. The alphabet is really now redundant; In this sign each is saved to bliss abundant. Emperor My people take it for good gold, you say? In camp, in court, sufficient as full pay? Although amazed, still I must give assent. Steward. The flight of notes we could nowise prevent; Like lightning notes were scattered on the run. The changers’ shops open wide to everyone; And there all notes are honoured, high and low, With gold and silver- at a discount, though. From there to butcher, baker, tavern hasting, One-half the world seems thinking but of feasting, The other in new raiment struts and crows; The draper cuts the cloth, the tailor sews. In cellars “Long live the Emperor!” is the toasting; There platters clatter, there they’re boiling, roasting. Mephistopheles Who all alone will down the terrace stray Perceives the fairest in superb array; With her proud peacock-fan she hides one eye And looking for a note goes simpering by; More swiftly than through eloquence and wit Love’s richest favour can be gained by it. With purse and scrip one is no longer harried. A notelet in one’s breast is lightly carried; With billets-doux quite snugly will it nestle. The priest bears it devoutly in his missal. The soldier, that he may the faster haste, Lightens the girdle quickly round his waist. Pardon, Your Majesty, if I may seem To mete a lofty work but slight esteem. Faust Treasures in superfluity still sleep Within your borders, buried deep, And lie unused. Thought in its widest measure Gives the most meagre bounds to such a treasure. Imagination in its highest flight, Strain as it may, can’t soar to such a height. Yet spirits, fit to fathom the unsounded, Have boundless confidence in the unbounded. Mephistopheles Nor gold nor pearls are half as handy as Such paper. Then a man knows what he has. There is no need of higgling or exchanging; In love and wine one can at will be ranging. If you want metal, changers are at hand; If lacking there, dig for a while the land. Goblet and chain are auctioned off and sold; Paper redeemed without delay in gold Confounds the doubter who had scoffed and taunted. This men demand, to metals they are wonted. Ready at hand the Emperor’s realm will hold Henceforth enough of paper, jewels, gold. Emperor. Our realm owes you this great prosperity; As is the service, the reward should be. Our empire’s soil be trusted to your care, The worthiest guardians of the treasures there. You know the vast and well-preserved hoard, And when men dig, it’s you must give the word.

The lights are burning dimly in the hall, At once the Court starts forward, one and all. I see them file according to their grades Through distant galleries and long arcades. Now they’re assembling in that ample space, The old Knight’s Hall; yet hardly all find place. The spacious walls with tapestries are rich, While armour decorates each nook and niche. Here is no need, methinks, of magic incantation, Ghosts will come here without an invitation. HALL OF THE KNIGHTS Dim illumination. The EMPEROR and Court have entered. Herald. Mine ancient office of announcing plays Is marred by spirits’ mystic interference; In vain one dares in reasonable ways To fathom their mysterious appearance. The chairs are placed, the seats are ready all; The Emperor is seated just before the wall; Upon the arras there he may with ease behold The glorious battles that men fought of old. Now Emperor and Court are seated here; The benches crowd together in the rear; And lovers in this spirit-hour’s uncanny gloom Have found beside their loved ones lovely room. And so, since all have duly taken places, We’re ready, let the spirits come and face us! Trumpets. Astrologer Now let the drama start without delay. Our Sire commands! Ye walls, give way! Naught hinders now. Here magic doth conspire; The arras rolls away as if by fire. The wall is splitting, turning in the gloom, A deep stage seems to be appearing, A light mysterious to be nearing, And I ascend to the proscenium.

You know the tempo of the stars on high; You’ll understand my whispering masterly. Astrologer By magic might before us doth appear, Massive enough, an ancient temple here. Like Atlas who upheld the sky of old, Columns enough, in rows, you can behold. Well for the weight of stone may they suffice, Since two could bear a mighty edifice. Architect So that’s antique! I can’t say I would praise it; Top-heavy, clumsy, is the way to phrase it. Rude is called noble, awkward great; far more I love slim shafts that boundless soar. High pointed arches lift the soul on high, Such edifices most do edify. Astrologer Receive with reverent awe star-granted hours By magic’s spells enthralled be Reason’s powers, And in its stead, arising far and free, Reign glorious, daring Phantasy! What you desired so boldly, be it now perceived; It is impossible, therefore to be believed. FAUST rises to view on the other side of the proscenium. Astrologer In priestly robe and wreathed, a wonder-man! Who’ll now fulfil what he in faith began, A tripod with him from the depths below. Now from the bowl the incense-perfumes flow. He girds himself, the lofty work to bless; Henceforth there can be nothing but success. Faust [in the grand manner]. In your name, Mothers! ye who have your throne In boundless space, eternally alone, Yet not alone. Around your heads there waver Life’s images, astir, yet lifeless ever.

Now note a mystic masterpiece! For lo! The vaporous clouds make music as they go. Aerial tones bring forth- what can it be? While they proceed, all turns to melody. The columned shaft, the very triglyph, rings; Yea, I believe that all the temple sings. The mist is sinking; from the filmy haze A handsome youth steps forth with measured pace.

Faust What! “Rape?” Fellow, am I for naught here? This key do I not hold it in my hand, I whom through stormy solitudes it brought here, Through waves of horror to this solid land?

As he raises the curtain and looks back, FAUST is seen stretched out on an old-fashioned bed]. Lie there, poor wretch! seduced, unwise, Scarce to be rescued from Love’s chain! Whom Helena doth paralyze, His reason he’ll not soon regain. Looking around him. I look around and through the glimmer Unchanged, uninjured all appears; Methinks the coloured window-panes are dimmer, The cobwebs have increased with years. The ink is dry, the paper brown and sere, Yet all is in its place, in very fact; Even the pen’s still lying here Which Faust used when he signed the pact. Aye, deeper in the pen is lurking still A trace of blood I lured him on to spill. To find a relic so unique as this Would be some great collector’s highest bliss. From its old hook the old fur coat’s half falling, Those merry jests of mine recalling Which once I taught that lad as truth, Which still may nourish his ingenuous youth. Rough, fur-warm cloak, encased in you, A great desire comes on me truly To show off as a proud professor newly, As men think they’ve a perfect right to do. The learned know how to attain that level; It is an art long since lost by the Devil. He shakes the fur coat which he has taken down. Crickets, beetles, and moths fly out. Chorus of Insects. Hail! welcome thy coming, Thou patron of yore! We’re flying and humming And know thee once more. All singly, in quiet, Didst plant us, and lo! In thousands, O Father, We dance to and fro. The rogue in the bosom Is deeply concealed; The insects in fur coats Are sooner revealed. Mephistopheles With what surprising joy this youthful brood I view! Aye, only sow, you’ll harvest when the time is due. I’ll give the old fur coat a second clout; Still here and there another flutters out. Up and about, ye darlings, helter-skelter, And quickly in a thousand nooks seek shelter: Where ancient pasteboard boxes stand, In yellowed parchment here at hand, Where dusty shards of old pots lie, In yonder death’s-head’s hollow eye. Amid such trash and mouldering life Crickets and crotchets must be rife. He slips into the fur coat. Come, cloak my shoulders as of yore, Head of the house as heretofore. Yet boots it little so to name me; Where are the people to acclaim me? He pulls the bell which gives out a shrill, penetrating sound, making the halls tremble and the doors fly open. Famulus [tottering down the long, dark corridor]. What a clanging! What a quaking! Stairs are rocking, walls are shaking! Through the windows’ motley quiver I see summer lightning shiver. Over me cracks the ancient flooring, Down come lime and rubbish pouring; And the door, securely bolted, Magic power has open jolted. There! How terrible! A giant Stands in Faust’s old fur, defiant!

Well, at least one can be hoping That no more in mould unfitting Men alive, yet dead, are sitting, Pining, rotting, mortifying, And of living still be dying.

But today what am I learning! Many years ago, a yearning Freshman, I came hither, fluttering, Anxious and abashed and stuttering. Here I trusted long-beards’ tattle, Edified me on their prattle. Into heavy, dry tomes reaching, What they knew they lied in teaching, Taught without themselves believing, Me, themselves, of life bereaving. What! there in the cell off yonder, Dimly-lit, one sits asunder! Stranger still, as I draw nearer, Sits he there, the brown fur-wearer, As I left him, piece for piece, Still in that old shaggy fleece! Subtle then he seemed to be, Not yet understood by me, But today ‘twill not avail him. Up and on now to assail him!

Mephistopheles If, unadulterate, one says to youth What does not please the callow brood- the truth! And later after many a tide They learn it painfully on their own hide, Each fancies then it came from his own head; “The Master was a fool!” is what is said. Bachelor of Arts. Or rogue perhaps! What teacher has the grace To tell the truth directly to our face? To simple children each knows what to say, Add or subtract, now grave, now wise and gay.

I wonder Could I find refuge with you people yonder? Bachelor of Arts It is presumption that men old and hoar Seek to be something when they are no more. Man’s life lives in his blood and where, forsooth, Does blood so stir as in the veins of youth? Ah, that is living blood, with vigour rife, Creating newer life from its own life. There all is stirring, there is something done, The weak fall out, the capable press on. While half the world we’ve brought beneath our sway, What have you done? Thought, nodded, dreamed away, Considered plan on plan- and nothing won. It’s certain! Age is but an ague cold, Chill with its fancies of distress and dread. Once a man’s thirty, he’s already old, He is indeed as good as dead. ‘Twere best to kill him right away. Mephistopheles The Devil, here, has nothing more to say. Bachelor of Arts Unless I will it, no devil can there be. Mephistopheles [aside] The Devil, though, will trip you presently. Bachelor of Arts This is youth’s noblest message and most fit! The world was not till I created it. ‘Twas I that led the sun up from the sea; The moon began its changeful course with me. The day put on rich garments, me to meet; The earth grew green and blossomed, me to greet. At my behest in that primeval night The stars unveiled their splendour to my sight.

LABORATORY In the style of the Middle Ages; scattered, clumsy apparatus for fantastic purposes Wagner [at the furnace] The bell resounds with fearful clangour, The sooty walls thrill its vibration. No longer can remain uncertain My great, most earnest expectation. Darkness is lifting like a curtain. Within the phial’s inmost chamber It’s glowing like a living ember, Yea, like a glorious carbuncle, gleaming And flashing, through the darkness streaming. A clear white light comes into view! Oh, may it not escape once more!Ah, God! what’s rattling at the door? Mephistopheles [entering] Welcome! I mean it well with you. Wagner [anxiously] Welcome in this auspicious hour! Softly. Don’t speak or even breathe, though, I implore! Achieved is soon a glorious undertaking. Mephistopheles [more softly] What is it, then? Wagner [more softly] A man is in the making! Mephistopheles A man? And, pray, what lovesick pair Have you shut in the chimney-flue? Wagner May God forbid! Begetting, as men used to do, Both vain and senseless we declare. The tender point whence life used to begin, The gracious outward urgence from within, To take and give, to have its likeness known, Near and remote alike to make its ownAll that has lost its former dignity. Whereas delighted with it still the beast may be, A man with his great gifts must henceforth win A higher, even higher origin. Turning toward the furnace. It flashes, see! Now truly we may hold That if from substances a hundredfold, Through mixture- for on mixture all dependsMan’s substance gently be consolidated, In an alembic sealed and segregated, And properly be cohobated, In quiet and success the labour ends. Turning toward the furnace again. ‘Twill be! The mass is working clearer, Conviction gathers, truer, nearer. What men as Nature’s mysteries would hold, All that to test by reason we make bold, And what she once was wont to organize, That we bid now to crystallize. Mephistopheles Whoever lives long learns full many things; By naught in this world can he ever be surprised. I’ve seen already in my wanderings Many a mortal who was crystallized. Wagner [hitherto constantly attentive to the phial]. It rises, flashes, gathers on; A moment, and the deed is done. A great design at first seems mad; but we Henceforth will laugh at chance in procreation, And such a brain that is to think transcendently Will be a thinker’s own creation. Looking at the phial rapturously. The glass resounds with lovely might; It dims, it clears; life must begin to be. A dainty figure greets my sight; A pretty manikin I see. What more do we or does the world want now? The mystery’s within our reach. Come, hearken to this sound, and listen how It turns to voice, it turns to speech. Homunculus [in the phial, to WAGNER]. Well, Daddy! how are you? It was no jest. Come, press me tenderly upon your breast, But not too hard, for fear the glass might shatter. That is the property of matter: For what is natural the All has place; What’s artificial needs restricted space. To MEPHISTOPHELES. How now, Sir Cousin, rogue, are you here too?

Fain would I gird me for the work straightway; You are adroit and can curtail my way. Wagner But one word more! I’m shamed that answers fail me, When with their problems young and old assail me. For instance: no one’s grasped how, each with either, Body and soul can fit so well together, Hold fast as if not to be separated, Yet each by other daily vexed and hated. And then- Mephistopheles Stop? I would rather ask if he Can say why man and wife so ill agree? This point, my friend, will nevermore be clear. The little chap wants work to do and it is here.

The side door opens and FAUST is seen stretched out on the couch. Homunculus [astonished]. Significant! The phial slips out of WAGNER’S hands, hovers above FAUST and illumines him. ‘With beauty girt!- Clear waters moving In a dense grove and women who undress; Fairest of forms!- The picture is improving. But one outshines the rest in loveliness, From noblest heroes, nay, from gods, descended. In the translucent pool her foot she laves; The living flame of her sweet form is blended With th’ cooling, clinging crystal of the waves. But what a noise of pinions swiftly dashing, And in the pool what swishing, splashing! The maidens flee abashed, but she, the queen, With calm composure gazes on the scene. With pleasure proud and womanly she sees The swan-prince nestle fondly at her knees, Importunate, yet tame. He grows more daring. But swiftly upward floats a vapour pale And covers with its closely woven veil A scene most lovely and beyond comparing. Mephistopheles How many tales you can relate! Small as you are, in fancies you are great. I can see naught- Homunculus Of course. You from the North, In ages dark and drear brought forth, In all the murk of knighthood and of papistry, How could your vision, then, be clear and free? Only in gloom are you at home. Looking around. Bemouldered stone-work, dingy, horrid, With pointed arches low and florid! If this man wakes, there’ll be new things to dread; At once upon the spot he will lie dead. Prophetic dreams of wood and springs beguile him, Of swans and naked beauties. Here, In such a place, how could he reconcile him, Which I, the most adaptable, scarce bear? Now off with him! Mephistopheles Whither I’ll hear with pleasure. Homunculus Command the warrior to the fight, Lead forth the maid to tread a measure; Then all is fitting, all is right. Just now- my memory brings to lightIs Classical Walpurgis Night. For him could be no happier event Than to be taken to his element. Mephistopheles Of that I’ve never chanced to hear. Homunculus How would it come, pray, to your ear? Only romantic ghosts are known to you; A ghost that’s genuine must be classic too. Mephistopheles But whither, then, are we to travel? Tell me! Your antique cronies now repel me. Homunculus Satan, northwest is where you’re wont to play, But to the southeast we will sail today.

Erichtho To this night’s awful festival, as oft before, I stride in view, Erichtho, I the gloomy one, Not so atrocious as the tiresome poet-crew Calumniate me to excess... They never end In praise and censure... Even now the vale appears Far, over-whitened with the billows of gray tents, Spectres of that most dire and most appalling night. How oft it has recurred already! Evermore It will recur forever... No one grants the realm Unto another, none to him who through his might Has won and rules it. For each one who knows not how To rule his own, his inborn self, is all too fain To rule his neighbour’s will, as prompts his own proud mind... Here was a great example fought even to the end: How violence opposes greater violence, How freedom’s lovely, thousand-blossomed wreath is rent, And the stiff laurel bends around the ruler’s head.

In truth, not fully orbed, yet radiant bright, the moon Is rising, spreading gentle splendour everywhere; The tents’ illusion vanishes, the lights burn blue. But lo! above my head what sudden meteor!

There all things may a goat’s-foot dare. Mephistopheles You’ll stay here and I’ll find you here again? Sphinxes Yes! Go and mingle with the airy train. We long ago are wont, from Egypt coming here, To sit enthroned to the thousandth year. Respect to our position you must pay. Thus rule we lunar, rule we solar day. At the pyramids our station, We look on the doom of races, War and peace and inundation, With eternal changeless faces. BY THE LOWER PENEUS PENEUS surrounded by waters and nymphs. Peneus Wake and stir, ye whispering bushes, Softly breathe, ye reeds and rushes, Rustle, willows by the river, Lisp, ye poplar sprays a-quiver, To my interrupted dream!... Fearful, stirring breezes wake me And mysterious tremors shake me From my rippling, restful stream. Faust [stepping to the edge of the river]. If I dare such fancies harbour, Deep within the tangled arbour Of these twigs and bushes noises Sounded as of human voices. Wave doth seem a very chatter, Zephyr sounds a jesting patter. Nymphs [to FAUST]. Ah, best were it for thee To lie here, reviving In coolness thy members Worn out by their striving, The rest thus enjoying That from thee doth flee; We’ll rustle, we’ll murmur, We’ll whisper to thee. Faust I am awake! Oh, let them stay me, Those peerless forms, and let them sway me As mine eye sees them in its quest. What thrills run through my every member! Do I but dream? Do I remember? Ah, once before was I so blessed. A cooling stream is softly gliding, Amid the trembling copse half hiding; It scarcely murmurs in its flow. From every side, clear and delighting, A hundred streamlets are uniting To fill a bath-like pool below. The fair young limbs of women trouble The liquid mirror, showing double, And double so the eye’s delight! Bathing with joy, each other aiding, Now boldly swimming, shyly wading, Ending in screams and water- fight. These should content me, here with pleasure My sight should be restored at leisure; Yet toward yonder leafy screen My vision ever further presses; The verdant wealth of those recesses Surely enveils the lofty queen. Strange and marvellous! Swans are swimming From the inlets, hither skimming In their stately majesty, Calmly floating, sweetly loving, Heads and beaks uplifted moving In proud self-complacency. But among them one seems peerless, In his self-love proud and fearless; Through the throng he sails apace, Swells his plumage like a pillow, He, a billow breasting billow, Speeds on to the sacred place... The others to and fro, together, Swim with unruffled, radiant feather, Or soon in stirring, splendid fray Seek to divert each timid beauty Away from any thought of duty To save herself if save she may. Nymphs Sisters, hearken, lend a hearing At the river’s verdant shore; If I err not, more and more Sounds of horse’s hoofs are nearing. Would I knew who in swift flight Brings a message to this night! Faust I believe the earth’s resounding To a steed that’s hither bounding. Turn there, my glance! A most auspicious chance, Can it be hither faring? O marvel past comparing! A rider’s trotting on toward me. Spirited, strong, he seems to be; Borne on a snow-white steed he’s nearing...

You’re standing on the shore And I will bear you through the stream with pleasure. Faust [mounting] Whither you will, I’ll thank you evermore... The noble pedagogue, so great in name, Who reared full many a hero, to his fame, The troop of Argonauts, renowned in story, And all who built the poets’ world of glory. Chiron Let us not talk of that. As mentor, none, Not Pallas’ self, is venerated. For, after all, in their own way men carry on As if they never had been educated. Faust The doctor who can name each plant, who knows All roots, even that which deepest grows, Who soothes the wounded, makes the sick man whole, You I embrace with all my might and soul. Chiron If at my side a hero felt the smart, I knew the aid and counsel to be tendered! But in the end all of my art To parsons and herb-women was surrendered. Faust Upon a true, great man I gaze! Who will not hear a word of praise, Modestly strives to shut his ears And acts as had he many peers. Chiron You are well-skilled, I see, in idle patter, Princes and common folk alike to flatter. Faust At least confess that you have seen The greatest men that in your time have been. You’ve with the noblest vied in earnest strife And like a demigod have lived your life. Of all the figures of heroic mould Whom as the ablest did you hold? Chiron Among the Argonauts, superb procession! Each one was worthy after his own fashion, And by the special power that he possessed, Could do what lay beyond the rest. Castor and Pollux ever did prevail Where youthful bloom and beauty turned the scale. In swift resolve and act for others’ good The sons of Boreas proved their hardihood. Reflective, strong and shrewd, in council wise, Thus Jason ruled, a joy to women’s eyes. Then Orpheus, gentle, still, and contemplating, But, when he smote the lyre, all subjugating; Keen- sighted Lynceus who by day and dark Past reef and shallow steered the sacred bark. Danger is tested best by banded brothers: When one achieves, then praise him all the others. Faust I beg, of Hercules I would be learning! Chiron. Oh, woe! Awaken not my yearning!... Phoebus I ne’er had seen, nor yet Seen Ares, Hermes, as they’re called, in fine, When my enraptured vision met A form that all men call divine. A king by birth as was no other, A youth most glorious to view, A subject to his elder brother And to the loveliest women too. His like will Gaea bring forth never Nor Hebe lead to Heaven again; Songs struggle in a vain endeavour, Men torture marble all in vain. Faust Though men may strive in stone and story, Never has he appeared in all his glory. You now have spoken of the fairest man; Tell of the fairest woman all you can! Chiron What! Woman’s beauty? That is not worth telling, Too oft a rigid image do we see; I praise alone a being welling With love of life and gaiety. Self-blest is beauty, cold and listless, ‘Tis winsomeness that makes resistless, Like that of Helena whom once I bore. Faust You bore her? Chiron. Aye, upon this back. Faust Was I not crazed enough before? And here to sit! Such bliss I do not lack! Chiron She also grasped me by the hair, Seizing it just as you are doing now. Faust I’m losing all my senses! Tell me how, Whence, whither? Ah, you really did her bear? She only is my whole desire! Chiron Easy it is to tell what you require.

How charming was she! young, the joy of age! Faust Just ten years old! Chiron The doctors of philology Have fooled you like themselves, I see. Peculiar is it with a mythologic dame; The poet brings her, as he needs, to fame; She never grows adult and never old, Always of appetizing mould, Ravished when young, still wooed long past her prime.

Now, as it haps, good fortune meets you here, Since for some moments every year I’m wont to Manto to repair Who, Aesculapius’ child, in silent prayer Implores her father, for his honour’s gain, To throw some light in the physicians’ brain That from rash slaughter may their hands refrain. I love her most of all the guild of sybils, Gentle and kind, nor prone to shifty quibbles. If but a while you stay, her art secure By powerful roots will work your perfect cure.

Faust Say, whither have you in this gruesome night Borne me through pebbly waters in our flight? Chiron Here Rome and Greece each bearded each in fight, Olympus on the left, Peneus on the right. The greatest realm that ever was lost in sand; The monarch flees, the conquering burghers stand. Look up! Here stands, significantly near, The eternal temple in the moonlight clear.

Manto I wait here, time encircles me. And this man? Chiron Him hath this ill-fated night Caught in its whirl and brought here to your sight.

Whenas (the primal sires surveying, Chaos and Night) I saw my honour lost, I, with the Titans joined in playing, Hurled Ossa, Pelion too, as balls are tossed. Thus we raged on in youthful passion Till vexed and weary at the last Both mountains we, in wanton fashion, Like twin peaks on Parnassus cast... Apollo gladly lingers yonder There in the muses’ blest retreat. For Jove himself and for his bolts of thunder I heaved on high his lofty seat. Thus I, by strainings superhuman, Pushed from the depths to upper air, And dwellers glad I loudly summon New life henceforth with me to share. Sphinxes Surely one would call primeval What so burg-like looms today, But we saw the earth give way To the straining, vast upheaval.

After the great you never have aspired But hermit-like have lived retired; If you can wont yourself to sovereignty, Then crowned as king I’ll have you be. Homunculus What says my Thales? Thales That I won’t advise. With little people little deeds arise; Among the great, the little man grows great. See there! The cranes, the swarthy cloud, They menace the excited crowd And they would menace thus the king. With beaks sharp-pointed, talons fierce, The little ones they tear and pierce; Already doom comes thundering. Herons had suffered impious slaughter, Standing about the tranquil water. But from that rain of murd’rous engines Has sprung a blessed, bloody vengeance; It stirs the rage of brotherhood And lust for pygmies’ impious blood. Shield, helmet, spear- how profit these? What use to dwarfs the heron feather? How ant and dactyl hide together! The host now wavers, breaks, and flees. Anaxagoras [after a pause, solemnly].

Linger thou on thy height, Lovely Luna, stay thy light, That the night may not vanish Nor the day may us banish. Thales [on the shore, to HOMUNCULUS]. To ancient Nereus I would lead the way; We’re not far distant from his cave today, But hard and stubborn is his pate, Contrary, sour, old reprobate. Nothing of mortal humankind Is ever to that grumbler’s mind. The future, though, is known to him, Wherefore men hold him in esteem And honour him where he holds sway. Kind has he been to many a one. Homunculus Let’s try it then and see. Come on! My glass and flame not cost me straightway. Nereus Are they men’s voices that my ear has heard? How quick with wrath my inmost heart is stirred! These creatures would be gods by sheer endeavour, Yet damned to be like their own selves forever.

Thales Yet people trust you, greybeard, ocean seer; You are the Sage; oh, drive us not from here! Gaze on this flame, like to a man, indeed; Your counsel only will it hear and heed. Nereus Counsel! With men has counsel once availed? Vain are shrewd warnings to a fast-closed ear. Oft as their deeds proved, men have grimly failed; Self-willed are they still as they always were. How I warned Paris with a father’s trust Before another’s wife ensnared his lust! Upon the Grecian shore he stood up bold, And what I saw in spirit I foretold: The reeking air above, a ruddy glow, Rafters ablaze, murder and death below: Troy’s Judgment Day, held fast in noble rhyme, A horror famous to the end of time. Reckless he laughed at all that I could tell; He followed his own lust and Ilion fellA giant corpse, stark when its torments ceased, To Pindus’ eagles a right welcome feast. Ulysses too! Told I not him erewhiles Of Cyclops’ horrors and of Circe’s wiles? His dallying, his comrades’ thoughtless vein, And what not all- but did it bring him gain? Till, late enough, a favouring billow bore The long-tossed wanderer to a friendly shore. Thales. Of course such action gives a wise man pain; Still, if he’s kind, he’ll try it once again. An ounce of thanks will in its bliss outweigh, Yes, tons of thanklessness for many a day. And nothing trifling to implore have we: The boy here wisely wants to come to be. Nereus Don’t spoil my rarest mood, I pray! Far other things await me here today: My daughters all I’ve summoned here to me, The Dorides, the Graces of the Sea. Olympus not, nor yet your soil, can bear A form that is so dainty and so fair. From dragons of the sea, all in most winsome motion, They leap on Neptune’s coursers; in the ocean, Their element, so tenderly at home They seem to float upon the very foam. On Venus’ radiant, pearly chariot drawn, Comes Galatea, lovely as the dawn. Since Cypris turned from us her face, She reigns in Paphos in the goddess’ place. And so, long since, the gracious one doth own, As heiress, templed town and chariot-throne. Away! It spoils a father’s hour of pleasure, Harshness of tongue or hate of heart to treasure. Away to Proteus! Ask that wondrous elf: How one can come to be and change one’s self. He goes off toward the sea. Thales We have gained nothing by this stay. Though one finds Proteus, straight he melts away; And if he stops for you, he’ll say at last Things that confuse you, make you stand aghast.

HELENA enters with a CHORUS of captive Trojan women. Helena I, much admired and upbraided Helena Come from the strand where we but now have disembarked, Still giddy from the restless rocking of the waves Which with Poseidon’s favour and the strength of Eurus bore Us on their high reluctant backs from Phrygia’s plain Returning to our native bays and fatherland. There on the shore with all his bravest warriors King Menelaus knows the joy of safe return. But thou, O lofty dwelling, bid me welcome now, Thou whom, when he came home again from Pallas’ hill, My father Tyndareus built near the slope and then Adorned supremely, more than all of Sparta’s homes, The while, as sisters do, with Clytemnestra IWith Castor, Pollux too- grew up in happy play. And ye, wings of the brazen portal, you I hail! Yet wider once ye opened to greet a welcome guest When Menelaus, one from many singled out, Shone as a radiant bridegroom there before my gaze. Open thy wings again that I the king’s behest May faithfully fulfil as doth become the wife. Let me go in and everything remain behind That hitherto hath stormed about me, threatening doom. For since, by care untroubled, I departed hence For Cytherea’s fane, as sacred duty bade, And there a robber seized me, he, the Phrygian, Since then has happened much that mankind far and wide So fain relate but not so fain is heard by him Of whom the waxing legend hath a fable spun. Chorus. O lady glorious, do not disdain Honoured possession of highest estate! For to thee alone is the greatest boon given: The fame of beauty transcending all else. The hero’s name resounds ere he comes, Hence proudly he strides, Yet bows at once the stubbornest man At the throne of Beauty, the all-conquering. Helena Enough! I’ve sailed together with my consort here And now before him to his city am I sent; But what intent he harbours, that I can not guess. Do I come here as wife? do I come here as queen? Come I as victim for the prince’s bitter pain And for the adverse fate the Greeks endured so long? Conquered I am but whether captive I know not! For truly the immortal gods ambiguously Ordained my fame and fate, attendants dubious For Beauty’s person; and on this very threshold now They stand in gloomy threatening presence at my side. For rarely did my husband cast a glance at me There in the hollow ship, nor spake he heartening word. As if he brooded mischief, facing me he sat. But now when drawing near Eurotas’ deep-bayed shore The foremost ships scarce touched their beaks against the land In greeting, he spake as if by Zeus himself inspired: “Here will my warriors in due order disembark; I’ll muster them drawn up along the ocean-strand, But thou, proceed, go up Eurotas’ holy stream Along its fruit-abounding shore, and ever on, Guiding the coursers on the moist, bejewelled mead, Until what time thou comest to the beauteous plain Where Lacedeamon once a wide and fruitful field, By solemn mountains close-engirdled, has been built. Then enter in the lofty-towered, princely house And muster me the maids whom there I left behind, And with them summon too the wise old stewardess. \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0002\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Let her display before thee all the treasure-hoard, Just as my father left it and what I myself Since then have added to the pile in war and peace.

Helena Thereafter followed further mandate from my lord: “Now when thou hast reviewed in order everything, Then take as many tripods as thou thinkst to need And vessels manifold which for the sacrifice The priest desires when he performs the sacred rite, The cauldrons and the bowls, the round and shallow plate; The purest water from the holy fountain be At hand in ewers high, and ready keep dry wood As well, that rapidly accepts and feeds the flame; And be not wanting finally a sharpened knife. But to thy care alone I now resign the rest.\" So spake he, urging me be gone, but not a thing That breathes with life did he, the orderer, appoint Which he, to honour the Olympians, wishes slain. Dubious it is, but further worry I dismiss, And let all be committed to the lofty gods Who evermore fulfil as seemeth good to them; Men may esteem it evil or esteem it good, But we who are but mortals must accept and bear. Ere now full oft the sacrificing priest has raised The heavy axe to consecrate the earth-bowed beast And yet he could not finish it, for he was checked By nearing foes or by an intervening god. Chorus. Thou canst not imagine what will come next; Queen, we beg, enter and be Of good cheer. Evil and good still come Unexpected to mortals; Though foretold, we credit it not. Truly, did Troy burn; truly, we saw Death before us, shamefullest death; And are we not here Joined with thee, serving gladly, Seeing the dazzling sun in the heavens, Also thee, the earth’s fairest, Gracious to us happy ones? Helena Be it as it may! What may impend, me it beseems That I at once ascend into the royal house, The long-renounced, much yearned-for, well-nigh forfeited, Which stands again before mine eyes, I know not how. My feet do not with so much spirit bear me up The high steps I sped over lightly as a child. Exit. Chorus. Cast now, O sisters, ye Captives who mourn your fate, All your sorrows far from you; Share in our mistress’ joy, Share ye in Helena’s joy, Who to her father’s hearth and house -True, with tardily homeward-turned But with so much the firmer footDraweth joyfully nearer.

But no! I have retreated hither to the light And ye’ll not drive me further, Powers, be who ye may!

Leader of the CHORUS Disclose, O noble lady, to thy serving-maids, To us who aid and honour thee, what has occurred. Helena What I have seen, ye too with your own eyes shall see Unless old Night indeed has forthwith swallowed up Her creature in the fearful depths of her dark womb. But yet that ye may know, I’ll tell it you in words. When through the sombre courtyard of the royal house I stepped with reverence, my nearest task in mind, I marvelled at the drear and silent corridors. No sound of busy going to and fro fell on Mine ear, no diligent swift hasting met my gaze. Before me there appeared no maid, no stewardess, They who are wont to greet each stranger as a friend, But when I now drew near to the bosom of the hearth, Beside the tepid glimmering embers there I saw What huge, veiled form! a woman seated on the ground, Not like to one asleep but one far lost in thought. With sharp, commanding words I summon her to work, Supposing her the stewardess whom there perhaps My husband prudently had stationed ere he left; But in her mantle’s folds she still sits motionless; And only at my threat her right arm doth she move, As if from hearth and hall she’d motion me away. Angry I turn from her and forthwith hasten on Toward the steps on which aloft the thalamos Rises adorned, the treasure-chamber near thereto; But swiftly now the monster starts up from the floor, Imperiously it bars the way to me and shows Its haggard height, its hollow eyes bedimmed with blood, A form so strange, such as confuses eye and mind. Yet to the winds I speak, for all in vain do words Essay to build up forms as if they could create. There see herself! She even ventures forth to light! Here we are master till the lord and monarch comes. The grisly births of night doth Phoebus, Beauty’s friend, Drive far away to caverns or he binds them fast. PHORKYAS appears on the sill between the door-posts. Chorus. Much have I lived through, although my tresses In youthful fashion flow round my temples! Many the horrors that I have witnessed, Woe of dire warfare, Ilion’s night When it fell. Through the beclouded, dust-raising tumult, Warriors crowding, I heard th’ Immortals Terribly shouting, I heard the brazen Accents of Strife that clanged through the field Rampart-ward. Ah, still standing were Ilion’s Ramparts then, but the glowing flames Soon from neighbour to neighbour ran, Hence and thence spreading out With the gust itself had made Over the city in darkness. Fleeing I saw through smoke and glow And the fluttering tongues of flame Ghastly presences, wrathful gods, Wondrous forms, great as giants, Striding on through sinister Vapours illumined by fire. Saw I this or was it my Mind that, anguish-torn, bodied forth Such made confusion? I’ll never say That it was, but yet that I See with mine eyes this horrid thing, Certainly this I do know; I could indeed lay hold on it, But that fear is restraining me, From the perilous keeps me. Which one of Phorkys’ Daughters, then, art thou? For to that family Thee would I liken. Art thou perchance of those born hoary, With but one eye and but one tooth, Sharing them alternately, Art thou one of the Graiae? Darest thou, monster, Here beside beauty Under the eye of great Phoebus to show thee? Come, only step forth, notwithstanding, For the hideous sees he not, As his holy eye has not Yet alighted on shadow. But a sorrowful adverse fate Us poor mortals doth force, alas!

You find I now, ye wantons, here from foreign lands, Your insolence outpouring, like a flight of cranes Proceeding high overhead with hoarse and shrilling screams, A drawn-out cloud that earthward sends its croaking tones, Which lure the quiet wanderer to lift his gaze And look at them; but they fly onward on their way, He goes on his, and so with us too will it be. Who are ye then, that round the high house of the king Like Maenads wild or like Bacchantes dare to rave? Who are ye then to meet the house’s stewardess With howling as a pack of dogs howls at the moon? Dream ye ‘tis hidden from me of what race ye are, Thou callow, war-begotten, slaughter-nurtured brood? Man-crazy, thou, seducing as thou art seduced, Wasting the strength of warrior and of burgher too. To see you in your crowd, a swarm of locusts seems To have swooped down, hiding the verdant harvest- field. Devourers, ye, of others’ toil! Ye parasites, Destroyers, in the bud, of all prosperity, Thou ravished merchandise, bartered and marketed! Helena Who in the presence of the mistress chides the maids, Doth boldly overstep the mistress’ household right; For her alone ‘tis to praise the laudable As it is hers to punish what there is to blame. And I am well contented with the service that They rendered when the lofty power of Ilion Beleaguered stood and fell and lay, and not the less When on our erring course the grievous, changeful woe We bore, where commonly each thinks but of himself. Here also I expect the like from this blithe throng; Not what the slave is, asks the lord, but how he serves. Therefore be silent, grin and jeer at them no more. Hast thou the palace of the king kept well till now, In place of mistress, to thy credit shall it stand; But now that she has come in person, step thou back Lest punishment be thine, not merited reward. Phorkyas To threaten her domestics doth remain the right The which the heaven-blest ruler’s lofty consort earned Indeed through many a year of prudent governance. Since thou, now recognized, dost tread thine ancient place Anew and once again as mistress and as Queen, Lay hold upon the reins long-slackened, govern now, Take in thy keep the treasure, all of us thereto. But first of all protect me now, the older one, Against this crowd that by thy swan-like beauty are Only a meanly-winged lot of cackling geese.

Phorkyas Then speak of Scylla, thine own flesh’s kith and kin! The Second Chorister. There’s many a monstrous shoot on thine ancestral tree. Phorkyas Away to Orcus! There seek out thy kindred tribe! The Third Chorister. They who dwell there, in sooth, are far too young for thee. Phorkyas Go to Tiresias the Old, make love to him! The Fourth Chorister. Great-great-granddaughter to thee was Orion’s nurse. Phorkyas Harpies, I fancy, fed thee up on filthiness. The Fifth Chorister. With what dost nourish thou such cherished meagreness? Phorkyas ‘Tis not with blood for which thou all too lustful art! The Sixth Chorister Greedy for corpses, thou, a loathsome corpse thyself!

Ye have in wrath unmannerly Evoked the dreadful figures of unhallowed forms Which crowd around me till I feel me torn away To Orcus in despite of these my native fields. Is it memory? Was it delusion seized on me? Was I all that? and am? shall I in future be The phantom horrible of town-destroying men? The maidens shudder, but the eldest, thou, I see, Dost stand unmoved. Speak to me then some word of sense! Phorkyas Who many years of fortune manifold recalls, To him divinest favour seems at last a dream. But thou, so highly favoured, past all bound and aim, Sawst midst the living only men inflamed by love, Quick kindled to each kind of boldest enterprise. Thus Thescus, roused by greed, laid hands upon thee first, A man of glorious form, as strong as Heracles. Helena He bore me off, a ten-year-old and slender And shut me in Aphidnus’ tower in Attica. Phorkyas But then by Castor and by Pollux soon released, Thou wert engirt by chosen heroes courting thee. Helena Yet most my secret favour- as I own with joyPatroclus, won; he was Pelides’ counterpart. Phorkyas Thy father wedded thee to Menclaus, though, The bold sea-rover and sustainer of his house. Helena To him he gave his daughter, gave the kingdom’s sway, And from our marriage union sprang Hermione. Phorkyas But whilst afar he wrested heritage in Crete, To thee, left solitary, came too fair a guest. Helena Wherefore recall that time of semi-widowhood? And hideous ruin that sprang out of it for me? Phorkyas That voyage for me too, a free-born maid of Crete, Brought hateful capture, brought me lasting slavery. Helena At once he did install thee here as stewardess, Entrusting much, castle and treasure boldly won. Phorkyas Which thou forsookst, turning to Ilion’s tower-girt town, Lured by the joys of love, the inexhaustible. Helena Remind me not of joyance! An infinity Of all too bitter woe perfused by breast and brain. Phorkyas Yet men say thou appeardst a phantom duplicate, In Ilion beheld, in Egypt too wert seen. Helena Confuse not wholly my distraught and clouded mind. Here even, who I am indeed, I do not know. Phorkyas And, then, they say: from out the hollow realm of shades Achilles, fired by passion, joined himself to thee! Who earlier loved thee spite of all decrees of fate.

Anxious, watching, we stand here, When, how, where will it break forth, Lurking monster, Lurking deeply with malice so great? Well, then, instead of word freighted with comfort, Lethe-sprinkling, most mild, friendly and fair, Stirrest thou up more of the past’s worst ills Than of the good we suffered, And thou darken’st at once Both the present moment’s sheen And the future’s Kindly glimmering light of hope.

Like forms grown rigid are ye standing there, Fearing to quit the life to which ye have no claim. Men likewise- all of them are phantoms just as yeRenounce not willingly the glorious shining sun. Yet no one begs them free or saves them from the end. All know it well, and nevertheless it pleases few. Enough, ye all are lost! So quickly to the work! PHORKYAS claps her hands; thereupon masked dwarfish figures appear at the door who execute at once and with alacrity the commands which PHORKYAS utters. Hither, thou swarthy, roly-poly, goblin throng, Trundle along, there’s harm to do here as one will. The altar, golden-horned, bring forth and give it place, And let the glittering axe lie on the silver rim; Fill all the water-jugs that one can wash away The black gore’s horrible, polluting blemishment. Spread out the carpet sumptuously here in the dust That so the victim may kneel down in royal wise And in it wrapped at once, although with severed head, May still be sepulchred with fitting dignity. Leader of the CHORUS. The Queen, absorbed in thought, is standing at one side, The maidens wither like to new-mown meadow grass; Methinks that I, the eldest, by sacred duty bound, Should speak a word with thee, thou primal eldest one. Thou art experienced, wise, seem’st well disposed to us, Although this brainless troop, misjudging, struck at thee. Say, then, what rescue thou mayst know as possible. Phorkyas ‘Tis easy said! Upon the queen alone it rests If she will save herself, you adjuncts too with her. Determination’s needful and the speediest. Chorus Most revered of all the Parcae, wisest of the sibyls, thou, Hold the golden shears wide open, then proclaim us life and health; For we feel our precious limbs already swinging, swaying, dangling Undelightfully, for they in dancing rather would delight them, Resting then on lover’s breast.

Phorkyas Have ye the patience silently to hear my whole, Long-drawn-out discourse? It involves tales manifold. Chorus Patience enough! The while we listen we still live. Phorkyas If one remains at home and noble treasure guards And knows how to cement the lofty dwelling’s walls And to secure the roof against the pressing rain, It will go well with him all his long days of life; But he who over his threshold’s sacred limits steps With light and fleeting foot in buoyant wantonness, Will find indeed on his return the ancient place But all things changed about, if they’re not quite destroyed. Helena Whereto the like of such familiar sayings here? Thou wouldst narrate, so stir not up what gives offence! Phorkyas It is historical, by no means a reproach. A corsair, Menelaus steered from bay to bay; The shores and islands all he skirted as a foe, Returning with the spoils that in his house abound. Besieging Ilion, he then passed ten long years; How many on the voyage home I do not know. But how stand matters here with the exalted house Of Tyndareus? How stand they roundabout the realm? Helena So thoroughly incarnate in thee is abuse That not a lip of thine can stir without rebuke? Phorkyas Full many years forsaken stood the valleyed hills Which northward back of Sparta rise into the sky, Taygetus in the rear whence as a merry brook Eurotas tumbles down and then along our vale By reed-beds broadly flowing nourishes your swans. Remote and still in mountain-vale a valiant race Has settled, pressing hither from Cimmerian night, And piled a towering stronghold insurmountable. From there they pester land and people as they please. Helena Could they accomplish this? It seems impossible. Phorkyas They had the time, perhaps ‘twas nearly twenty years. Helena Is one the lord? and are they many robbers? leagued? Phorkyas They are not robbers and yet one of them is lord. I blame him not and though he persecuted me. Well could he all have taken but contented him With few things which he called not tribute but free gifts. Helena How does he look? Phorkyas Not ill! I like his looks full well. He is a man who’s cheery, bold, of well-built form, A man of sense such as are few among the Greeks. Men brand these people as barbarians, yet methinks Not one so cruel, not so like a cannibal As many a hero proved himself at Ilion. His greatness I respect, I’d trust myself to him. His castle too! With your own eyes ye should see that! It is quite different from the clumsy masonry Which your forefathers loosely piled up heedlessly, Cyclopean like the Cyclops, hurling undressed stone, One on the other. There, contrariwise, ah, there! The work is level, plumb, according to a rule. Gaze at it from outside! It strives aloft toward heaven, All rigid, all well-joined, and mirror-smooth like steel! To climb there- why, the very thought slides down! And inside are great courts and roomy spaces girt By structures roundabout of every kind and use. There ye see arches, archlets, pillars, pillarets, Balconies, galleries for gazing out and in, And scutcheons. Chorus What are scutcheons? Phorkyas Ajax used to bear A coiling serpent on his shield, as ye have seen. The Seven against Thebes, each one upon his shield, A pictured emblem bore, rich in significance. One saw there moon and stars in heaven’s nocturnal field, A goddess, hero, ladder, swords, and torches too, And all that fiercely threats good towns with violence. Such emblems are borne also by our hero-band, Aglow with colour, heritage from primal sires. There ye see lions, eagles, also claw and beak, Then horns of buffaloes, wings, roses, peacocks’ tails, Bars also, gold and black and silver, blue and red. \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0002\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"The like of these hangs there in halls, row after row, In long, unending halls, wide as the world is wide.

Waiting for the bliss of morning, Spying eastward its first glows, Lo! the sun, without a warning, Wondrous in the south arose. Thither did it draw my glances Off from gorge and mountain-cone, Off from earth’s and heaven’s expanses, Her to see, the Only One. Piercing sight to me is given As to lynx on highest tree, Yet I had to struggle, even As from dream’s obscurity. Could I the delusion banish? Ramparts? tower? or bolted gate? Vapours rise and vapours vanish, Such a goddess comes in state! Eye and bosom I turned to her, Drinking in her gentle light; Beauty, blinding all that view her, Blinded my poor senses quite.

We crowded on, stormed on apace, Masters were we from place to place; Where for the day I held control Tomorrow another robbed and stole. We looked- and hurried was the look; The fairest woman one man took, And one the steer both firm and strong, And every horse must come along, But I delighted to espy The things most rare to human eye, And what another man possessed, For me was dried-up grass at best Upon the trail of treasures bright, I followed only my keen sight; At every pocket I peeped in, Transparent was each box and bin.

Already all is hers that in its depths The castle hides; to offer her aught special Is useless. Go, pile treasure upon treasure In order fit. Set up the stately show Of splendour yet unseen!

Confirm me as co-regent of thy realm Whose bounds are limitless; win for thyself Adorer, servant, guardian, all in one. Helena Manifold marvels do I see and hear. Amazement strikes me, I would fain ask much, But first I’d ask to know why that man’s speech Sounded so new and strange, strange and yet friendly. It seems that one tone makes way for another, And hath a word grown friendly to the ear, Another woos caressingly the first. Faust If thou art pleased with this our people’s speech, Oh, surely then its song will ravish thee, Fill ears and mind alike with deep content. But best it were to practise it straightway, Alternate speech allures it, calls it forth. Helena Then tell me how to learn such lovely speech. Faust It’s easy, quite, if from the heart it come.

This land, the land of lands, forever May it be blessed to every race, Won for my Queen’s enduring favour. It early gazed upon her face, When from the shell she burst and gleaming Rose mid Eurotas’ reedy sighs, On mother, brother, sister beaming With light that overcame the eyes. This land presents its choicest flower To thee, it turns to thee alone; From all the world which owns thy power, Oh, choose thy fatherland, thine own! And even if the jagged peak uprearing Doth on its back the sun’s cold arrow bear, We see a green tinge on the rock appearing; The wild goat nibbling crops his scanty fare. Springs leap and plunging brooks unite in revel; Already gorges, slopes, and meads are green. Upon a hundred hillsides’ broken level The moving, fleecy herds spread out are seen. With measured step, divided, steady, Horned beasts draw near the dizzy ledge’s fall, But shelter for them all is ever ready In hundred caves arched in the rocky wall. Pan shields them there, enlivening nymphs are dwelling In bosky chasms’ moist, refreshened lee, And, yearningly toward higher regions swelling, Aloft crowds branch-abounding tree on tree. Primeval woods! The mighty oak is standing With branch on branch crooked wilfully and bowed; The gentle maple, with sweet juice expanding, Shoots cleanly upward, playing with its load. And in that silent realm of shadows Warm mother’s milk for child and lambkin wells; Fruit is not far, the ripe food of the meadows, And honey from the hollowed tree distils. Here comfort is the birthright of a nation, Both cheek and lips express serenity, Each is immortal in his age and station, Healthy they live and happily.

Enticed to dwelling in this blessed harbour, Hast fled into the brightest destiny! Now let our thrones become an arbour, Arcadian be our bliss and free!

Phorkyas Separated From the world, they summoned me, me only, to their quiet service. Highly honoured I stood near them, yet, as doth beseem the trusted, Looking around for something else. So I turned me hither, thither, Seeking roots and barks and mosses, skilled in all things efficacious, And so they remained alone. Chorus. Truly thou dost speak as if within there were vast world-wide spaces, Forest, lakes and brooks and meadow; what a fairy tale dost spin! Phorkyas. To be sure, ye inexperienced! Those are depths no one hath fathomed: Hall on hall and court on court which musingly I followed through. But there echoes all at once a laughter through the spacious caverns I look thither, lo! a boy who from the woman’s lap is leaping To the man, and from the father to the mother; the caressing, Dandling, pranks of foolish fondness, cries of fun, and shouts of pleasure Deafen me alternately. Naked, without wings, a genius, faun-like but with nothing bestial, On the firm ground he is leaping, yet the ground, in turn reacting, Speeds him up to airy heights, and in the second or the third leap Doth he touch the lofty arch. Anxious calls the mother: “Leap! and leap again, and at thy pleasure, But beware of flying: flight unfettered is denied to thee.\" And thus warns the faithful father: “In the earth lies power elastic That impels thee upward, only with your toe-tips touch the surface And at once thou wilt be strengthened like Antaeus, son of earth.\" And so on these rocky masses he goes skipping from one cornice To the other and around, as leaps a ball when it is struck. All at once, though, in the crevice of a rugged gorge he’s vanished, And he now seems lost to us. The mother wails, the father comforts, Anxiously I shrug my shoulders. But again now what a vision! Are there treasures lying hid there? Garments striped with broidered blossoms He has donned becomingly. From his arms are tassels waving, round his bosom flutter ribbons, In his hands the golden lyre; completely like a little Phoebus, He steps boldly to the brink, then to the precipice. We marvel And the parents in their rapture clasp each other, heart to heart, For around his head what splendour! It is hard to say what glitters, Is it gold-work or the flame of some transcendent spirit-power? And he moves and gestures even now though but a boy, proclaiming Him the future master of all beauty, through whose every member Melodies eternal stir; and thus ye too will hearken to him, And will see him thus, with wonder ye have never felt before. Chorus Call’st thou a wonder this, Thou Crete-begotten? Hast to poetical speech Pregnant with thought not listened? Never yet hast heard Ionia’s, Never hast listened to Hellas’ Vast store of tales ancestral Celebrating gods and heroes? All that may happen now While we are living Reechoes gloomily Grandeur of days ancestral; Nor can thy narration equal That which a lovely fiction, More credible than truth is, Sang of him, the son of Maia. Him a delicate babe but strong, Nurseling, scarce more than born yet, Straight has the nurses’ chattering flock, Full of unreasoning fancy, Wrapped in the purest swaddling-fleece, Bound fast in fine, costly wrappings, But now the strong, though dainty rogue Draws forth his delicate limbs, Firm, elastic, and supple, Craftily thence, the purple shell, Which so grievously bound him, Leaving quietly in its place, Like the perfected butterfly Which from the cramping chrysalis Deftly slips with unfolding wings, Through the sunlit, radiant ether Boldly, wantonly fluttering. So too did he, the agilest, That to thieves and to tricksters And all seekers of gain he’d be Ever a favouring genius. This straightway he makes manifest Through most clever devices. Swift the trident of ocean’s lord Steals he, and slyly from Ares’ self Steals the sword from the scabbard, Arrow and bow from Phoebus too, Also the tongs from Hephaestus, Even from Zeus the father’s bolt Would have had, but was frightened by fire. Eros too he overcomes In a leg-tripping wrestling match, And when Cypris caresses him, steals From her bosom the girdle."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"A charming, purely melodious music of stringed instruments resounds from the cave.

Keen thy sight, the world discerning, Feeling for each heart-throb known, For fair women’s passion yearning, And a song thy very own. But thy tamelessness engaged thee In a net without a flaw, And in headlong strife enraged thee Against custom, against law; But at last an aim transcendent Gave thy noble courage weight, Thou wouldst win a fame resplendentBut success was not thy fate. Who succeeds?- A dismal query, Shunned by Fate who gives no heed, When, on days ill-starred and dreary, Silently the people bleed. But new songs afresh create them, Deeply bowed lament no more: Earth again will generate them As it ever did of yore. Complete pause. The music ceases. Helena [to FAUST] Alas, an ancient truth is verified in me: That bliss and beauty never lastingly unite. The bond of life is rent no less than that of love; Bewailing both, I say with sorrow: Fare thee well! And cast myself once more, once only, in thine arms. Receive, Persephone, receive the boy and me. She embraces FAUST, she herself vanishes, robe and veil remain in his arms. Phorkyas [to FAUST]. Hold fast what now alone is left to thee! Let not the garment go. Already demons Are twitching at its skirts and they would like To snatch it to the lower world. Hold fast! It is no more the goddess whom thou lost, But godlike is it. Make use of the high And priceless boon, and rising soar aloft. Swift over all things common will it bear thee Away through ether while thou can’st endure. We’ll meet again, far, far away from here. HELENA’S garments dissolve into clouds, surround FAUST, lift him in the air, and move away with him. Phorkyas [picks Up EUPHORION’S robe, mantle, and lyre from the ground, steps forward to the proscenium, lifts up the mementoes, and speaks]. A lucky find, although belated! The flame, in truth, is dissipated, Yet for the world I’ve no distress. Here is enough to start the poet And swell his tribe with jealousness; And talent? Though I can’t bestow it, I can at least bestow the dress. She sits down in the proscenium at the foot of a column. Panthalis Now hasten, maidens! From the sorcery we’re free, From the mad tyranny of the Thessalian hag, Freed from the wildering, jangling tones that dazed us all, The car confounding and still worse the inner sense. Hence, down to Hades! where our Queen has hastened on, With solemn steps descending. Let her footsteps be Directly followed by the steps of faithful maids. Her shall we find beside the throne of the Inscrutable. Chorus. Everywhere indeed do queens ever like to be, And in Hades too do they stand supreme; Proudly with their peers are they allied, With Persephone most intimate. We, however, in the background Of deep, asphodelian meadows, With far-reaching poplars And unfruitful willows joined, What diversion shall we have there? Bat-like to squeak and twitter In whispers undelighting, spectral. Panthalis Who hath not won a name nor wills a noble deed, Belongs but to the elements, so fare thy way! Hotly I wish to join my Queen. Not merit alone, Faithfulness too preserves our personality. Exit. All Back to the light of day are we now restored, Truly persons no more. We feel it, we know it too, But to Hades we go back never; For ever-living Nature lays Claim to us spirits, We to her lay claim that is valid. A Part of the CHORUS."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"In these thousand branches’ quivering whisper, in their murmuring swaying, Toying gently, we’ll entice up from the roots the vital currents To the twigs; and now with leafage, now with blooms in great profusion We’ll adorn the fluttering tresses freely for an airy growth. Falls the fruit, at once will gather life-enjoying herds and people, Quickly coming, briskly crowding, for the picking, for the tasting; They will all bow down around us as before primeval gods. Another Part. In the smooth, far-gleaming mirror by these rocky walls we’ll nestle, Moving in the gentle wavelets to and fro, caressingly. To each sound we’ll hearken, list to songs of birds and reedy fluting. Be it Pan’s own fearful voice, a ready answer is at hand. Doth it murmur, we too murmur; thunders it, we roll our thunders Overwhelming, doubly crashing, threefold, tenfold echoing back. A Third Part. Sisters, we more nimble, we will hasten with the brooklets onward, For those yonder distant, richly- mantled mountain ranges charm us. Ever downward, ever deeper, while meandering we’ll water Now the meadow, now the pasture, then the garden round the house, It is marked by slender cypress tree-tops soaring into ether Over landscape, winding shore-line, and the mirror of the stream. A Fourth Part. Roam ye others where it please you; we’ll engirdle, we will ripple, Round the thickly planted hillside where the trellised vines grow green; There the grower of the vine in anguish ponders hour- and day-long How uncertain is the promise of devoted industry. Now with hoe and now with shovel, now with hilling, pruning, tying, Unto all the gods he prayeth, to the sun-god best of all. Pampered Bacchus frets himself but little for his faithful servant, Rests in bowers, lolls in caverns, prattling with the youngest faun. What he ever needed for his half-intoxicated dreaming, He has always near at hand in wineskins, pitchers, divers vessels Right and left in cool recesses for eternal ages stored. But if all the gods together, Helios the most important, Fanning, moistening, warming, glowing, filled with grape-vine’s horn of plenty, Where the quiet vintner laboured, there new life will soon be stirring, With a rustling in each trellis and a rush from stock to stock. Baskets creak and buckets clatter, tubs groan on the bearer’s back; To the great vat all are going, to the treaders’ vigorous dance; And thus is the sacred plenty of the pure-born, juicy berries Rudely trodden, foaming, spurting, crushed to an unsightly mass. Now the ear is pierced by brazen clash of cymbals and of timbrels, For the veil of mystery hath Dionysus cast aside; He comes forth with goat-foot satyrs, whirling goat-foot satyresses; And amid them brays, untamed and shrill, Silenus’ long-eared beast. Naught is spared! For cloven hoofs are trampling down all decent custom; For the senses whirling stagger, horribly the ear is stunned. For the cup the drunken fumble, over-full are heads and bellies. Careful still is this and that-one, but he heightens thus the tumult, For to garner this year’s juices, they drain swiftly the old skin. The curtain falls, PHORKYAS in the proscenium rises to a gigantic height, descends from the cothurni, casts aside mask and veil, and appears as MEPHISTOPHELES in order, as far as may be necessary, to comment on the piece by way of epilogue. ACT IV A HIGH MOUNTAIN RANGE Bold jagged rocky peaks. A cloud approaches, pauses as it touches a peak, and sinks down on a projecting ledge. It divides. Faust [steps forth] Looking to deepest solitudes beneath my feet I walk in thoughtfulness along this summit’s verge, Relinquishing my chariot of clouds that bore Me gently over land and sea through smiling days.

On sun-illumined pillows gloriously reclinesOf giant size, in truth- a godlike woman’s form. I see it! Like to Juno, Leda, Helena, It floats in lovely majesty before my sight. Alas! It’s shifting! Formless, broad, and towering, It resteth in the east like distant ice-clad peaks, And, dazzling, mirrors swift days’ great significance. Yet round me floats a light and tender misty wreath, Around my breast and brow, cheering, caressing, cool. Now it mounts high and higher, lightly, lingering. It draws together.- Doth a rapturing form deceive Mine eyes, youth’s first, long-unenjoyed and highest bliss? The earliest, deepest treasures of my heart break forth; The dawn of love, so light of wing, it typifies, The swiftly-felt, the first scarce comprehended glance, Outshining every other treasure, if held fast. Like beauty of the soul the lovely form becomes More fair, dissolving not, but through the ether soars And draws the best of all my being on and on. A seven-league boot comes thumping forward. Another soon follows. MEPHISTOPHELES steps out of them. The boots stride on hastily. Mephistopheles That I call striding briskly ended! Rut say, what kind of whim is this? Why midst such horrors here descended, By ghastly yawning precipice? I know them well but not in this high station, For such things really were Hell’s own foundation. Faust Of foolish tales you’ve always had a store And now begin to deal them out once more. Mephistopheles [seriously]. When God the Lord- I know well the occasionBanned us from air into the deeps profound, Where, glowing from earth’s centre all around, Eternal fire waxed hottest past all bound, We found us midst too great illumination In a most crowded, irksome situation. The devils, every one, began a coughing, Above, below, at every vent-hole puffing; Hell was with sulphur- fumes so much inflated And such a gas therefrom was generated, That very soon the earth’s flat crust- no wonder!Thick as it was, was forced to burst asunder. So now we have a different situation; What’s now a peak was once a deep foundation. On this men base the doctrines that they boast, Turning the lowest into uppermost. Thus from that slavish hot cave did we fare To an excessive lording in free air, An open secret but one well concealed And to the common crowd but late revealed. (ephes. 6. 12.) Faust To me a mountain-mass stays nobly dumb, I ask not wherefore nor from whence it come. When Nature in herself her own self founded, The globe of earth she formed and neatly rounded, In summits and in gorges took delight, Ranged rock on rock and mountain height on height; The hills in easy slopes she downward moulded, Till gently into valleys they unfolded. There all is verdant growth and for her gladness She has no need of such convulsive madness. Mephistopheles That’s what you say! To you it seems quite clear But he knows better who beheld it near. I was at hand when still below was surging The deep abyss, when streamed a fiery tide, When Moloch’s hammer rock on rock was forging And scattering mountain-ruins far and wide. Earth still abounds in ponderous strange masses. Such power in hurling who can well explain? As wise men know, their reason it surpasses. The rock lies evermore where it has lain. We’ve racked our brains, to our disgrace, in vain. Only the faithful common people know And let none shake them in their story: (Their wisdom ripened long ago) It is a miracle, and Satan gets the glory. My pilgrim on his crutch of faith limps on To Devil’s Bridge, to Devil’s Stone. Faust There is indeed remarkable attraction In seeing a devil’s view of Nature’s action. Mephistopheles Be Nature what she will! What do I care? Honour’s at stake! Satan himself was there! We are real people, great things we attain. Violence, tumult, nonsense! See, the sign is plain!-"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"But- to say something now that’s wholly clearHas nothing pleased you in our upper sphere? You have surveyed a boundless territory, The kingdoms of the world and all their glory; (Matt. 4) Still- with that discontented airDid you not lust for something anywhere? Faust I did! A great work lured me on. Divine it! Mephistopheles That can soon be done. I’d seek some city, at its heart A horrid city victuals-mart, Tortuous alleys, pointed gables, Beets, kale, and onions on the tables; Meat-stalls where blue flies take life easy, Feasting on roasts well-done and greasy; There you will always surely find Stench and activity combined. Then ample squares, broad streets between, Where one can stalk with lordly mien, And lastly, where no town-gates bar, The suburbs boundless, stretching far. There I’d enjoy the rolling, The noisy hither and thither bowling, Eternal running hither and thither Of scattered ants that swarm together. And whether driving, whether riding, The centre of them all abiding, Honoured by thousands would be I. Faust With that I cannot be contended! One likes to see the people multiply And in their way live comfortably, Even develop, learn therebyAnd yet, in fine, rebels are thus augmented. Mephistopheles Then, swelling with self-conscious pride I’d raise A pleasure-castle in a pleasant place. Hill, level, meadow, field, and forest glade Into a splendid garden I’d have made, Before green walls of verdure, velvet meadows, And measured paths and art-directed shadows, Cascading falls among the rocks designed, And fountain- sprays of every kind, One rising proud and stately in the middle, While at the sides a thousand spraylets spurt and piddle. And then I’d build, for loveliest women meet, Sung villas, each an intimate retreat. I’d pass there endless time in joyous mood, Blessed by the dearest social solitude. “Women,” I say, for here, as everywhere, I think in plurals of the ladies fair. Faust Sardanapalus! Vile and new, I swear! Mephistopheles Who could divine toward what you would aspire? It must have been sublimely bold, in truth, Toward the moon you’d soar and ever nigher; Did you mad quest allure you there forsooth? Faust By no means! For this earthly sphere Affords a place for great deeds ever. Astounding things shall happen here, I feel the strength for bold endeavour. Mephistopheles So you’d earn glory? One can see You’ve been in heroines’ company. Faust Lordship, possession, are my aim and thought! The deed is everything, the glory naught. Mephistopheles Yet poets will come forward all the same To blazon to the later world your fame, Through folly more fools to inflame. Faust Of all this naught is known to you. How should you know what men will woo? Your bitter, sharp, and hostile mood, How does it know what men count good? Mephistopheles So be it with you then as best it pleases! Confide to me the range of your caprices. Faust Mine eye was drawn out toward the open ocean That swelled aloft, self-towering and vaulting, And then drew back its billows in commotion, The broad expanse of level shore assaulting. And that irked me, as always insolence Irks the free soul who prizes every right, Whose blood, stirred up to passionate vehemence, Is fired with feelings of a harsh despite. I thought it chance and gazed more sharply at the main. The billows paused and then rolled back again, Withdrawing from the goal so proudly won. The hour returns, again the game’s begun. Mephistopheles [to the spectators]. There’s nothing new in that for me to know; I knew it a hundred thousand years ago. Faust [continuing passionately]. It steals along, in countless channels flowing, Fruitless itself and fruitlessness bestowing; It swells and grows and rolls and spreads its reign Over the loathsome, desolate domain.

So plan on plan flashed swiftly through my brain: “Win for thyself great joy, a costly store: Push back the lordly ocean from the shore; Limit the bounds of that vast, watery deep And force it, far away, within itself to keep.\" Thus step by step I knew I could explain it. This is my wish, now dare to help me gain it! Drums and martial music at the rear of the spectators, at a distance, on the right hand. Mephistopheles How easy! Do you hear the drums afar? Faust What, war again? The wise man likes not war. Mephistopheles Be it war or peace! From every circumstance The wise man tries to draw himself some profit. One watches, notes each favouring chance. Now is the moment, Faustus, make use of it! Faust Spare me such riddle-mongering, my friend! Be brief, explain, what is it you intend? Mephistopheles As I came here, it was not hid from me, Our Emperor suffers great anxiety; You know him well. The while that we amused him And with illusive show of wealth abused him, He thought the whole world could be had for pay. For when a youth, the throne fell to his sway And wrongly he concluded at his leisure Two things one could quite well combine- Which would be most desirable and fineTo rule and also take one’s pleasure. Faust A great mistake. Whoever would command, Must in commanding feel his greatest blessing. A lofty purpose must his breast expand, But what he wills must be beyond all guessing. What he to his most faithful whispereth: It’s done! Amazed, all subjects hold their breath. Thus always will he have the most exalted place, The worthiest, he! Enjoyment doth debase. Mephistopheles Not such is he! Enjoy? how didn’t he? Meanwhile the realm was rent by anarchy, Where great and small warred criss-cross with each other And brother drove from home or slaughtered brother, Castle with castle, town with town in feud, Guild against noble, all in fiercest mood. Chapters and flocks against their bishops rose. If men but saw each other, they were foes. In churches murder, homicide; outside each gate Each merchant, traveller, waits the self-same fate. Boldness in all grew to no mean extent. To live meant self-defence!- Well, now, that went. Faust It went, it staggered, fell, and up it jumped, Fell over itself, and in a heap it plumped. Mephistopheles And such conditions no one dared to blame; Some standing each could, each would, claim. As peer of any has the least man passed, But for the best, things grew too mad at last. The capable arose then in their might And said: “Who gives us peace is lord by right; The Emperor cannot, will not- let us choose A new one, one who will infuse New life into the realm he safeguards duly, Where peace and justice govern truly The world he strengthens and renews.\" Faust That sound like priestcraft. Mephistopheles Priests they were, be sure. Their own well-nourished paunch they made secure. More than all others were they implicated. The riot grew, riot was consecrated. Our Emperor, to whom we gave delight, Is drawing near, perhaps for his last fight. Faust I pity him, so kind and frank was he. Mephistopheles While there is life, there’s hope. Come, let us see.

Dazzling magical Hollow show! Mephistopheles Nay, stratagem to win the fight! Just fix your gaze upon a lofty height And only think of your high aim. If we preserve the Emperor’s throne and land, Then you can kneel and justly claim In feudal right a boundless strand. Faust Much have you ere now carried through; Come then and win a battle too.

Lack of war-counsel I have long since traced, Hence a war-council I have straightway based On primal mountains’ primal human might; Blest he who can its elements unite.

In war such ground’s a longed-for acquisition: Not steep the hills, yet not for easy faring, To is propitious, to the foe ensnaring. Half hidden on the billowy field are we; They will not venture here with cavalry. Emperor. I can but praise, and hope the best; Now arm and heart can meet the test.

Emperor Yonder they come, false kinsmen, one and other, Even as they styled me Uncle, Cousin, Brother, Who’ve more and more presumed, all ties have sundered, The sceptre of its might, the throne’s respect have plundered, Then, in their feuds, the realm have devastated And now rebel against me, federated.

May he have been well blessed! First Scout Fortune fair on us has waited. Through our bold and crafty skill Here and there we penetrated; But the news we bring is ill. Many are pure homage swearing, They and many a soldier true; But they plead, for not appearing, Inner ferment, danger too. Emperor Through selfishness one learns self-preservation, Not honour, thanks, affection, obligation. Do you not think, when your accounts fall due, Your neighbour’s burning house will burn up you? Generalissimo The second comes, but slowly down he clambers; The weary man trembles in all his members. Second Scout Wild confusion we detected First of all, were highly cheered; Then at once and unexpected, A new emperor appeared. And in fore-determined manner Through the plain the rabble sweep; His perfidious unfurled banner They all follow- they are sheep. Emperor A rival emperor I esteem a gain, Now know myself an emperor not in vain. As soldier only did I armour don, Now for a higher aim is it put on. At every feast, though brilliant it might be And naught seemed lacking, danger lacked to me. When ring-sports you advised- whatever your intentMy heart beat high, I breathed the tournament. And had you not from war dissuaded me, Renowned for bright heroic deeds I’d be. What self-reliance did I feel, what fortitude! When mirrored in that realm of fire I stood! The element leapt toward me, infuriate, ‘Twas only semblance, yet a semblance great. I dreamed confusedly of victory and fame, Now I’ll retrieve my fault and expiate my shame. The heralds are despatched to challenge the rival emperor to single combat. FAUST in armour, with half-closed visor. The THREE MIGHTY MEN armed and clothed as above. Faust We come and hope that we are welcome here; Foresight avails even when no need is near. You know the mountain-people think and pore, Well-studied in all rock’s and nature’s lore. The spirits, long since vanished from the plain, Of rocky heights are more than ever fain. Silent they work through devious crevasses In rich metallic fumes of noble gases. On sundering, testing, blending, they are bent, Their only impulse, something to invent. With the light touch of spiritual power They build transparent figures, hour by hour; The crystal then in its eternal silence glasses What in the upper world above them passes. Emperor I’ve heard it and believe that it may be; Yet, gallant man, say: what is that to me? Faust The Norcian necromant, of Sabine race, Your faithful, worthy servant, sends me in his place. What fate once threatened him, so monstrous, dire! The fagots crackled, leapt the tongues of fire; Dry billets, lattice-like, were round about him fixed, With pitch and bars of sulphur intermixed. Rescue through devil, man, or god was vain. Your Majesty it was who burst the fiery chain! It was in Rome. Still of most grateful mood, He pays heed to your path with deep solicitude.

But still most highly welcome must the good man be If to our aid he comes with energy Some morning hour when many dangers wait, And doubtful hang the balances of Fate. But here at this hour’s critical demand Take not the willing sword in your strong hand; Honour the hour when many thousands stride To fight against me or upon my side. Self is the man! Who asks a throne and crown Must in himself be worthy such renown. The spectre who against us has arisen, Himself as Emperor, Lord of our lands, doth christen, Our army’s Duke, our nobles’ feudal Lord, he must With mine own hand into the realm of death be thrust! Faust Though it be done to end the noble undertaking, You do not well, your head thus to be staking. Is not your helm with plume and crest bedecked? The head which fires our zeal it doth protect. Without the head what could the limbs avail? For if it’s drowsy, all droop down and fail; If it is hurt, at once all have a wound, Arise afresh, if quickly it grows sound. To give its laws effect, swift is the arm, It lifts the shield to guard the skull from harm. Instantly doth the sword its duty know, Parries with vigour and returns the blow. The active foot shares in the other’s weal As on the slain man’s neck it plants its heel. Emperor Such is my wrath, him thus I fain would treat, Make his proud head a footstool for my feet. Heralds [come back]. Little honour, little glory Met us yonder at our coming; At our noble, valiant story Laughed they as a vapid mumming: “Vanished is your Emperor yonder, But an echo through the vale; If on him we are to ponder, ‘There was once’- so runs the tale.\" Faust As your best men have wished, it doth betide; Both staunch and true they’re standing at your side. There comes the foe, your troops impatient wait. Order attack, the hour is fortunate. Emperor Here I surrender the supreme command. To the GENERALISSIMO. So be your duty, Prince, in your own hand.

Fight-hard [steps forward]. Who shows his face to me turns not away Till both his cheek- and jawbones get a mangling, Who turns his back, limp on his nape straightway Are neck and head and scalp right grimly dangling.

There, in the daylight, swaying, clear, Uplifted into mid-air spaces And mirrored in especial hazes, One sees a vision strange appear: There cities hover backward, onward, There gardens waver up- and downward, As form on form breaks through the air.

Don’t worry much, but be, with understanding, At first entreating, then commanding. Exeunt the ravens. All takes place as prescribed. Mephistopheles Before the foe there falls a thick, dark curtain! Their step and tread become uncertain! Everywhere flitting scintillations, Sudden and blinding illuminations. That’s fine, methinks, and has succeeded. But now a sound of terror’s needed. Faust The hollow armour from the vaulted chambers Revives in open air in all its members; There it’s been rattling, clattering all around, A wondrous-strange, discordant sound.

With our own bodyguards in honour due protecting, The people’s envoys we’re imperially expecting; Glad messages are coming in from every side, In happy loyalty the realm is pacified. Though in our fight, in truth, we’ve been by magic aided, For our own selves alone we fought- so be it stated. To combatants, we know, chance often works some good: From heaven falls a stone, upon the foe rains blood, From caves may echo strains, great wonders radiating, Lifting our hearts on high, the foeman’s palpitating. Doomed to eternal scorn, the vanquished bit the sod; The victor, while he boasts, exalts the favouring God. Without command, this thanks all men unite in bringing: “We praise Thee, God our Lord,” a million throats are singing. It rarely happed before, but now in highest praise On my own grateful breast I turn my pious gaze. A young and merry prince may give his days to pleasure, But lie will learn in time the moment’s fitting measure. Wherefore I choose for counsel wholly to consort With you four worthy men in realm and house and court. To the FIRST PRINCE. You, Prince, achieved the host’s well-ordered disposition, Then, when the crisis came, moved it with bold precision. Be active now in peace, just as the times suggest; Arch-Marshal you I dub and with the sword invest. Arch-Marshal Your army, tasked till now to keep the civil order, When it has made your throne secure along the border, Then at your festive throngs we’ll ask it as our care In wide ancestral halls the banquet to prepare. The bright sword I will bear before you, hold beside you, Your Majesty Supreme, ever to guard and guide you. Emperor [to the SECOND] Who as a gallant man doth show a pleasing grace, Shall be Arch- Chamberlain, no easy task and place. The master you shall be of those of household station, Whose quarrels make their service oft a sore vexation. You as a model to be honoured I install To show how one can please the lord and court and all. Arch-Chamberlain. To further what his lord intends brings one to favour:"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"To help the best men on, to harm even bad ones never, Be frank and free from guile, reserved without deceit! If you, Sire, read my heart, then is my joy complete. But may my fancy now on to the banquet hasten? When you go to the board, I’ll hand the golden basin; I’ll hold your rings for you that so on gala days Your hands may be refreshed as I am by your gaze. Emperor To think about a feast, too grave I’m feeling, truly; Yet be it! Festal moods promote glad actions duly. To the THIRD. I choose you as Arch-Steward. Henceforth you shall guard The game-preserves, the manor-farm, and poultry-yard. Give me a choice of favourite foods at every season As each month brings them forth, prepared with care and reason. Arch-Steward Strict fasting be my highest duty, dearest wish, Until I’ve placed before you some delighting dish. The kitchen servants all shall be with me united; What’s far will be brought near, the season expedited. True, far-fetched early things with which the board is graced, Do not attract you. Plain and hearty fare you’d taste. Emperor [to the FOURTH] Since here to feasts the talk is evermore diverted. As cupbearer to me, young hero, be converted. Arch-Cupbearer, take care that every cave of mine Be stored most plentifully with the best of wine. Be temperate yourself, let not a gay occasion Lead you to yield yourself to happy chance’s suasion. Arch-Cupbearer. The young themselves, my prince, when trust in them is shown, Before one is aware, stand forth as men full-grown. So I at that high feast shall duly take my station And to your sideboard’s pomp add noblest decoration, Rare, gorgeous vessels, gold and silver, all set up. Beforehand, though, I’ll choose for you the loveliest cup: Of clear Venetian glass wherein delight lies waiting, Enhancing wine’s good taste but never inebriating. On such a wondrous prize men oft too much depend, But you, most noble Sire, your temperance doth defend. Emperor What I’ve designed for you in this most solemn hour, You’ve heard with confidence because I speak with power. The Emperor’s word is great and makes each gift secure, Yet needs his noble script to make the matter sure; It needs his signature. And in due form to make it, Here comes the fitting man this fitting hour to take it. The ARCHBISHOP-ARCH-CHANCELLOR enters. Emperor If in the keystone doth a vaulted arch confide, Then is it built securely against time and tide. You see the princes four! We have but just now noted How next the state of house and court might be promoted. Now what the realm contains, in all its breadth enclosed, Shall be with weight and power upon you five imposed. In lands you shall outshine all other men and orders, So of your property I’ll now extend the borders Out of the lands once left to that disloyal band. To you who’re true I grant full many a lovely land, With this the lofty right to widen these possessions, As chance occurs, by barter, purchases, successions, To practise undisturbed- be this secured to youWhatever sovereign rights, as landlords, are your due. As judges it’s for you to make the last decisions, And these shall suffer no appeals and no revisions. Then imposts, interest, tributes, rents, safe-conduct, toll, Dues from the mines, salt-works, and mints, yours is the whole, For that my gratitude be fully demonstrated, Nearest to Majesty you have I elevated. Archbishop In deepest gratitude to you we all unite, You make us strong and firm and strengthen your own might. Emperor Yet honour to you five I’ll give in fuller measure. I still live for my realm, to live is still my pleasure; Ancestral chains, however, draw men’s gaze from hours Of swift endeavour to the doom that always lowers. \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0002\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"In time I too shall part from all whom I hold dear; Then you must choose the man who shall succeed me here.

Arch-Chancellor With pride at heart, yet humbly, as each mien convinces, Here stand, before you bowed, the first of earthly princes. As long as loyal blood through our full veins doth thrill, We are the body which obeys your lightest will. Emperor So, to conclude: what we’ve ordained and manifested, For all the years to come be it written and attested. As lords, in truth, you’ve your possessions wholly free, But on condition that they never parcelled be. What you receive from us, however you expand it, Shall to the eldest son be undivided handed. Arch-Chancellor At once I’ll put on parchment in most joyous mood This statute weighty for the realm’s and for our good; Engrossment, seal- thus shall the chancery invest it, Your sacred signature, the lord’s, will then attest it. Emperor Thus I dismiss you so that each of you now may With tranquil mind reflect upon-the glorious day. The secular PRINCES withdraw. The Archbishop [remains and speaks with feeling]. The Chancellor went away, the Bishop stays before you; A warning spirit bids him straightway to implore you. With deep concern for you his father’s-heart doth quake. Emperor In this glad hour what makes you apprehensive? Speak! Archbishop With what a bitter pang I find that in this hour Your consecrated head’s in league with Satan’s power. True- as it seems- you’re on the throne, secured by right, But woe! in the Lord God’s, in Father Pope’s despite. Which when the Pontiff learns, swift judgment he’ll deliver, His holy bolt will crush your sinful realm forever. He has not yet forgot- the day that you were crowned, A solemn time- you had the sorcerer unbound. And from your crown, where Christian honour hung suspended, The ray of pardon first on that damned head descended. But smite your breast, and straightway from your wicked gain Give back a moderate mite unto the holy fane; That broad and hilly space where your tent stood erected, Where by an evil spirits’-league you were protected, Where to the Prince of Lies you lent attentive ear, Devote the land to holy use in pious fear, With hill and forest dense, as far as they’re extending, With heights all clad in green, rich luscious pasture lending, Clear lakes alive with fish, uncounted brooks that flow Swiftly and serpent-like and plunging as they go, Then the broad vale itself with mead and lea and hollow. Thus is remorse expressed, and pardon soon will follow. Emperor My horror of this grievous fault is so profound The borders of the land yourself shall measure round. Archbishop First, where one so has sinned, the spot, so desecrated, Be to the Most High’s service straightway dedicated. My spirit sees the massive walls mount swiftly higher; The morning sun’s first rays already light the choir; The growing edifice a cross’s form is taking; The nave grows long and high, believers’ joy awaking; Through solemn portals they stream in with ardent zeal, While over hill and dale resounds the bell’s first peal. It sounds from lofty towers aspiring up to Heaven. Now comes the penitent to whom new life is given. The consecration day- oh, may it soon be sent!Your presence then will be the highest ornament. Emperor Let this great work be done, a pious proclamation That God the Lord I praise and seek my expiation. Enough! I feel my soul already mounting high. Archbishop As Chancellor I’ll conclude the last formality. Emperor. Produce a formal deed to show that I resign it To Holy Mother Church, and I will gladly sign it.

The people will haul these, thus from the pulpit taught; The Church doth bless a man who serving her has wrought. Exit. Emperor Great is the sin and heavy that I’ve loaded on me; These tiresome sorcerers- sore damage have they done me. Archbishop [returning again, with a very low obeisance]. Pardon, O Sire, you gave that most notorious man The empire’s coast; but he’ll be smitten by the ban Unless due penance to the Holy Church you tender And there tithe, interest, gifts, and revenues surrender.

It’s the old place, and still standing Is the hut that sheltered me When the storm-tossed billow, stranding, Hurled me duneward from the sea! And my hosts? I fain would greet them, Helpful folk, a valiant pair, But today I’ll scarcely meet them; Aged in those days they were. Pious they, in God believing! Shall I knock or raise my voice? Hail! if you, a guest receiving, Still in kindly deeds rejoice. Baucis [a little woman, very old]. Stranger dear! Hush, hush! You’re breaking My good husband’s peaceful rest. Sleeping long gives the brief waking Of an old man active zest. Wanderer Tell me, mother, is it you really, Here to take the thanks of one Whose young life you saved so freely, You and your good spouse alone? Are you Baucis who devoutly My half-dying lips restored? The husband enters. You Philemon who so stoutly Wrested from the wave my hoard? ‘Twas your hurried flames ascending, ‘Twas your silver-chiming bell, Brought to me a happy ending Of adventure dread and fell. Let me step forth that I may there Gaze upon the boundless sea; Let me kneel and let me pray there, Sore my heart oppresses me. He strides forward on the dune. Philemon [to BAUCIS] Hasten, pray, and set the table Where the garden blooms serene. Let him run, be dazed, unable To believe what he’ll have seen. Standing beside the WANDERER. Where fierce billows did maltreat you, Where waves, wildly foaming, rolled, There a garden now doth greet you, Fair as Paradise of old. Older grown, I was not able To give help as once of yore; As my limbs grew more unstable, Far the waves drew from the shore. Wise lords’ menials, bold and daring, Dug the trenches, dammed the sea, Ocean’s ancient rights not sparing, Lords, instead of it, to be. See green meadows far extending, Garden, woodland, field, and town.Come, enjoy the meal attending, For the sun will soon go down.Sails are gliding far out yonder, Nightly to ports they fare.

Faust [starting up] Accursed bell! Base clangour sending, It wounds like spiteful shot from slings; Before mine eyes my realm’s unending, Yet at my back vexation stings. The envious bell is aye recalling: From blemish is my realm not free! The lindens, brown hut, church half-falling, Not one of these belongs to me.

Hail to our patron, Hail, our Lord! They disembark; the goods are brought ashore. Mephistopheles We’ve proved ourselves as it behooves, Pleased if our patron but approves. With but two ships we sailed away, With twenty we’re in port today, The great things we have done- how great, That can be seen well from our freight. The free sea sets the spirit free. Who’ll stop to think when he’s at sea! What helps is suddenness of grip. You catch a fish, you catch a ship, And when you’re once the lord of three, You hook the fourth one easily; Then is the fifth in sorry plight, You have the Power and so the Right.

That is the burden hard to bear. Wise one, to you I must declare it. It gives my heart sting after sting; It is impossible to bear it, And yet I’m shamed to say the thing. The old folks there should make concession, I’d have the lindens for my throne; The few trees there, not my possession, Spoil me the world I call my own. There I would fain, for world-wide gazing From branch to branch a scaffold raising, Open to view the course I’ve run, That I might see all I have done, View at one glance, before me brought, The masterpiece of human thought, Which made a fact shrewd wisdom’s plan And won broad dwelling- place for man. Thus suffer we the sorest rack, Midst riches feeling what we lack. The chime, the scent of linden-bloom, Close round me as with church and tomb. The power of my all-conquered will Breaks down before that sandy hill. How shall I ever free my spirit? The bell rings and I rage to hear it! Mephistopheles Of course! Some paramount distress Must gall your life to bitterness. Who doubts it? To each noble ear That jangle seems a hostile fleer.

I gaze at the far, I look at the near, The moon and the star, The wood and the deer. In all things around me Is grace without end, And as they astound me, Myself I commend. Thou fortunate vision, Thou mayest have seen Whatever there may be, Yet fair hath it been. Pause. But not only to delight me Am I stationed here on high; What a gruesome sight, to fright me, Threatens from the dark world nigh! Flashing sparkles I see gushing Through the lindens’ twofold night; Ever stronger rages, rushing, Fanned by draughts, a glowing light. Ah! inside the cabin’s flaming, Though moss-grown and damp it stand; Speedy succour is it claiming And no rescue is at hand. Ah, those good old folk whom duty Once made careful of the fire, Now of smoke become the booty! What a misadventure dire! Flames are flaring, now they wave them Through the black, moss-covered shell; Could the good folk only save them From that furious burning hell! Brilliant tongues of flame are flashing, Through the leaves and branches lashing; Withered boughs that flare up, burning, Swiftly glow, plunge from the tree. Must ye eyes- such things discerningMust I, so far-sighted be? Down the little chapel crashes, Burdened under branches’ fall. Winding upward, pointed flashes Seize upon the tree-tops tall. To their roots the trunks, ignited, Hollow, purple-red, glow on. Long pause. Song. Gone what once the eye delighted, With the centuries is gone. Faust [on the balcony, facing the dunes]. What song hear I of lamentation? Too late, the word or tone to heed. My warder wails, and deep vexation Stirs me for this impulsive deed. Yet though the lindens, grown so thickly, Now half-charred trunks, defile the place, An outlook-point is builded quickly, Where I can gaze through endless space. Thence too I’ll see the new-made dwelling Which for that aged pair I’ll raise, Who, of my kind forbearance telling, Will there enjoy their latter days. Mephistopheles and The Three [below]. Here we’re coming at full trot, But pardon us! well went it not. We rapped on it, we chapped on it, And still not opened was a slit; We rattled on, we pounded more, Till down there lay the rotten door. We called, a loud and threatening call, But found no hearing there at all. As in such case has oft occurred, They would not, so they had not heard. We tarried not long thereabout; Swift, as you bade, we cleared them out. The couple suffered scarce a jot; From fright they fell dead on the spot. A stranger, hid there, made a show Of fight but he was soon laid low. But in the brief and furious fray, From embers that around us lay, The straw caught fire. It’s blazing free, A funeral pyre for all the three. Faust To my commands then deaf were ye? Exchange I meant, not robbery. This unconsidered, savage blow, I curse it! Share the curse and go!

Who hath so badly decked the hall? Not chairs, not table, any! Lemurs Chorus. ‘Twas loaned for a short interval; The creditors are so many. Mephistopheles The body lies, and ere the spirit flee, I’ll quickly show the blood-writ scroll; But they’ve so many means- alas for me!To cheat the Devil out of many a soul. If one pursues the old way, one’s resisted, And to the new we do not feel commended; I could of old have done it unattended, But now I have to be assisted. In all things, wretched is our plight! Transmitted custom, ancient rightNaught’s to be trusted now as in the past. The soul once with its last breath left its house; I watched my prey, and like the swiftest mouse, Snap! in my firm-shut claws I held it fast. Now it delays, won’t quit the dismal place, The wretched corpse’s house so nauseating; The elements, each other hating, Will finally expel it in disgrace. And though for days I fret till I am weary, When? how? and where? that is the tiresome query. In power swift and strong Old Death’s played out; Even the whether long has been in doubt. With lust I’ve often watched the rigid members‘Twas but a sham; they moved: life stirred the embers. Gestures of conjuration like those of a fantastic fugleman. Lords of the straight, lords of the crooked horn, Come quick! in double time! and show your fettle, You of old diabolic cut and metal, And with you let the maw of Hell be borne. True, many maws hath Hell, in short, To use as due to rank and dignity; But henceforth in this final sport Not so particular shall we be. The horrible maw of Hell opens up on the left. Tusks yawn; and from the vaulted gorge profound The furious, fiery torrents flow, And at the rear, in seething vapours wound, I see the flaming city in eternal glow. Up to the very teeth the crimson billow dashes, The damned, in hope of help, swim into view; But now the huge hyena bites and gnashes, And their hot course the agonized renew. Much more is left to spy in corners there, In narrowest space horrors supreme! You do well, sinners to affright and scare, But they’ll think it a lie and sham and dream. To the fat devils with short, straight horns. You fat-paunched rogues with cheeks like hell-fire burning, You glow so fattened by Hell’s sulphur and its steam; What necks, so thick-set, short, and never turning! Watch here below for phosphorescent gleam: That’s the wee soul, Psyche with fluttering wing; Don’t pluck the wings, ‘twere else a nasty worm. I’ll stamp my seal upon the beastly thing, Then off with it in whirling-fiery-storm. These lower regions, watch them duly, You bladders- that’s the duty you’ve to show; If it was pleased to live there, truly, That we do not so accurately know. It feels at home in navels, there’s no doubt; So heed my words, for there it may pop out. To the lean devils with long, crooked horns. You clowns, huge fuglemen, bashaws, Clutch at the air- no respite take or give; Stretch out your arms, show your sharp claws, That you may catch the fluttering fugitive. In its old home bad surely is its plight; Genius is quick to soar, so too will be this sprite. Glory, from above, on the right. A Heavenly Host. Heavenly kindred, Envoys unhind’red, Follow in flight: Sinners forgiving, Making dust living! Bring while ye’re swaying, Lingering, staying, To all things living A trace of delight. Mephistopheles Discords I hear, a most disgusting humming That with unwelcome light comes from above; It is that boyish-girlish bungling strumming That sanctimonious tastes are prone to love. You know how we in deep depraved hours Planned the destruction of the human race; The shamefullest we planned with all our powers In their devotion finds a perfect place. The canting tribe, they come in foppish fettle! Many they’ve snatched away before our eyes; With our own weapons are they giving battle; They’re devils too, though in disguise."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"If you lose here, in endless shame you’ll sink; On to the grave and hold fast by the brink!

You are so fair I’d truly like to kiss you; To say you come just right, I scarcely err.
