In over 50 years of ministry, I have encountered many good books on theology. Who Is This God? surpasses those and is an excellent work for seekers, agnostics, and those who are not quite sure what they believe. It is excellent for those who want to know about the study in a practical, real way. - Dr. Clifford E. Clark, International Missions Director and Conference Speaker I have just completed your excellent and informative book, Who Is This God? Our Sunday School class was beginning a course on this very subject and I held off starting your book until the class started the course. I felt that if I read your book as we went through the class I could at least appear to be more informed on the subject than I normally would haveóand I was. It was obvious that you put a great deal of research into your ideas and the fruit of that research was apparent in the final product. I hope your book is doing well because it is well written and well documented. - David W. Davis, Attorney at Law Thank you for your insightful, thought provoking study Who is This God? The book answers many questions about God and His creation and stimulates its reader to spiritual self-examination. I consider Who is This God? a valuable resource of biblical truth. - Mary Bales, Secretary What a great book. Too often, the Body of Christ over-spiritualizes and complicates things. It is so refreshing to see a book that takes the message and breaks it down in a relevant fashion. I have found in my communication that the more practical my message is the greater the response. Jesus is so practical. He used illustrations and spoke in a very real way. This book goes right in that same direction. - Rev. Eastman Curtis, Senior Pastor, Destiny Church Thanks for the gracious comments. - The Authors"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" iv "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" v Table of Contents 1.

Thought Who is this God? Good question! Think about it. What are you talking about How does the supernatural relate to people? Do you have curiosity and many questions about the supernatural? Do most books on the topics get too deep or too far out? Is there really a Creator or did the universe just happen? What are angels? Since the beginning of history, these questions have been the topics of theology and mythology. Would you believe that the term God provokes some kind of thought in every person? Whether the person is atheist, agnostic, or believer, he or she has a reaction. Wait a second. What are those descriptions? Many people do not even know where they fit in the spectrum of atheist to believer. An atheist is one who denies the existence of God. An agnostic is one who does not know if there is a God, and is not sure it can be known. A believer is convinced that there is a living God. "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"2 Who Is This God?  Durham The challenge of most studies in theology is there are many terms, ideas, and concepts. These generally are not used in common, practical communications and language. Our objective is to take the ideas from the religious realm, then transfer the thoughts to the thinking of everyday relationships. That may seem like a tall order for a topic that is often relegated to seminaries and monasteries. After all, if there is a God, then that knowledge should be available to everyone. This work is intended for a very broad audience. It is a comprehensive interaction for the general audience inquisitive about other world issues. In addition, it provides a broad framework and has adequate detail for serious students. Moreover, the treatise is a comprehensive foundation for collegiate and seminarian studies. Culture Our discussion will be based on the traditions of Christians and Jews. The customs of these two cultural groups have impacted to some extent numerous other societies. Their practices represent a large part of the world religions. The principles are the predominant philosophy and foundation of Western civilization. Much of these traditions are brought to us through ancient writings. These manuscripts vary in style and language, but all unfold historical data and values. First, we need a little information about the growth of these cultures and the associated languages. There are three basic language groups or cultures. The Western civilization is primarily based on the Indo- European, sometimes called Japhetic, language group. The Near and Middle East is primarily based on the Semitic language family. The deep African and Eastern societies are heavily dependent on the Hamitic language classification. The relationship between the various languages will be discussed in detail in later chapters. The oldest, most popular religious writings are in Hebrew, the language of the Jewish people. The tongue is in the Semitic family."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 Background 3 This primary manuscript of the Jewish people has come to other cultures as the Old Testament of the Bible. The compilation by various writers dates back to approximately 1500 BC and the works were completed about 400 BC. In this literary masterpiece, only one short treatise, Daniel, was in another original language, Aramaic. The next document also comes from the Jewish way of life, but it was written primarily in Greek. The anthology was penned during the height of the Roman Empire. While Latin was the government language, Greek was the educational and cultural language of the day. The Greek language is in the Indo-European group. This work has come to other cultures as the New Testament of the Bible. The compilation by various writers was completed during approximately 60 years of the first century AD. To keep from being repetitive and to provide more variety in reading, synonyms will often be used for the names of the Old and New Testaments. Alternative words for testament are covenant, record, writings, scripture, tribute, treatise, and anthology. The choice is somewhat dependent on the use of the reference. Outside effect These two combined records have provided the fundamental structure for a major part of the religions and cultures of the world. Many other groups, philosophies, and organizations have developed their own books from these references. For example, the Islamic (Moslem) writings heavily refer to events and people recorded in those earlier seminal works. The writings by Mohammed were developed in Arabic about the seventh century. Another reference work was developed for the Mormons. Joseph Smith compiled it in English during the nineteenth century. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"4 Who Is This God?  Durham Although these peripheral writings will not be discussed, they do illustrate the broad influence of the Old and New Anthologies of early Jewish traditions. Language The foundations of our Western thinking are these two primary documents, the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. To get some correlations of concepts, it will be necessary to refer to the original Hebrew and Greek words. These are particularly beneficial for the English audience, since our language is very dynamic. With every living dialect, there are changes with time and usage. American English has changed substantially since the common King James dialect of 1611 AD. ëThyí is no longer ëyourí way of speaking. A more recent example is the word sophisticate. For all history prior to a generation ago, it meant to render worthless by admixture or to adulterate. The word, just by repeated usage, has come to be associated with having acquired worldly knowledge or refinement. Dr. James Strong compiled perhaps the most exhaustive correlation of Hebrew and Greek to English. The concordance, assembled in 1894, makes a study of every word in the original manuscripts. The same word in the original was often translated in multiple ways. This was common to give a slightly different shade of meaning. To keep track of the original words, Strong arranged them alphabetically. He then assigned a simple, but ingenious, number to each word. By tracking the numbers, it is possible to know the original word without being a linguistic scholar. Strongís numbers are shown in parenthesis, when referring to the original language. This will aid the student in verifying the linguistic translation. "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 Background 5 Translation When referring to the original writings, the words can be illustrated in three ways: original spelling, phonetic spelling, and conceptual meaning. Each has its merits in certain situations. All will be used in this treatise. Original spelling with the original letters is the most technically accurate, but difficult to comprehend. Phonetic spelling with modern letters is great for speaking. Conceptual meaning is the best source for comprehension. By convention of the language, words that refer to names of specific people and locations are capitalized. Therefore, ëgodí refers to any being with special attributes. In contrast, ëGodí refers to the identity of the specific god of the Jewish and Christian religions. This similar practice of capitalization will be used for other names and references of God. There is one other note of language differences. Many languages do not have articles such as ëaí and ëtheí to designate a specific item. English uses modifiers ëaí or ëaní to refer to any item. English uses ëtheí to identify a specific item of the same type. For example, ëaí book is any book, while ëtheí book identifies a specific book from a collection. In languages without modifiers, it would simply be book. Since the articles can be used to differentiate any item from a unique item, they appear in some ways to be related to the rules of capitalization. However, capitalization is used for a name while articles are used to distinguish which items. When crossing between languages, there are three practices. Literal translation uses word substitutes that are as exact as possible. Conceptual translation uses ideas that are similar, but words that relate to the culture. Transliteration creates a new word in the language. It is similar in form, spelling, and sound to the original. Let us start with an example of referring back to the original languages. Consider the English word theology. The term is a transliteration of two Greek words theos and logos . Theos is translated god or deity, while logos is translated study. Hence,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"6 Who Is This God?  Durham theology is the study of a god or deity. It is apparent with only a little imagination, that the words are very similar. Who is on first Any study should start at the beginning. Look at the ancient Hebrew writing called the Old Testament. The first book is named Genesis, which means the beginning. The first verse asserts the foundations of the manuscript. In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. - Genesis 1:1 What does this say and mean? What is the first prepositional phrase? When was that in relation to time? Who was there? Who was there before time? What action happened at time zero? What was the result of the action? That single statement at the beginning of the Old Anthology is the summary of theology. One of the challenges of theology is to describe concepts and ideas that no one has seen. As an example, try to describe in words any person you know. Can you do it adequately that a stranger would be able to identify them? The problem of adequate definition is compounded when many of the topics are abstract. Nevertheless, it is incumbent that individuals have some working knowledge of these ideas. This includes the relationship between God and man. That is the purpose of our writing. By necessity, the discussion must be described in personal terms, which include our knowledge, understanding, and wisdom. Guiding principles In the investigation of such a fantastic topic, a few focal points will provide guidance. The following passages will give you a brief"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 Background 7 glimpse of the subjects and topics about which you will be learning. These are just a peek at the spectrum of ideas across history. An early military general, Joshua, was going through challenges. He had just taken command of a huge group of itinerant people in a desert of the Middle East. He recorded a promise to those that studied these principles. This word of the law shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have great success. - Joshua 1:8 Several hundred years later, the country was consolidated by a single regent. Under King David, the nation was at its height of political power. David was noted as a military genius, lover of women, and great poet. It is recorded that he was a man after Godís own heart, because of his respect for the Almighty. In one of his numerous songs, he recalled the power of that relationship in just a few words. The old word bless can also be rendered as praise or exalt. Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: - Psalm 103:1-2 Many years later, an ancient Hebrew author, Jeremiah, was very distressed. He was known as the weeping prophet. He was delivering his vision during the last years of his nationís existence. The time was just before his country was overrun and exiled by a foreign government. He gave a concise view of the power of Deity. Ah Lord God! Behold, you have made the heaven and the earth, by your great power and outstretched arm. There is nothing too hard for you. - Jeremiah 32:17 Hundreds of years afterward, during the time of the Roman Empire, many nations were conquered. However, they were allowed to"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"8 Who Is This God?  Durham maintain their government and culture. This was in exchange for providing taxes and services to the Roman league of nations. During that era, new religious teaching arose from a most unusual Jewish scholar, Jesus of Nazareth. The last living member of this teacherís personal cadre of apostles was John. John wrote an intriguing description by his personal knowledge about this educator who has had more impact on culture than any other man in history. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was GodÖ And the Word was made flesh and dwelled among us. - John 1:1 & 14a These passages are so descriptive of the topics to be researched. With that foundation, we are on to a phenomenal venture. Review Consider the following questions. 1. Where do you fit as an atheist, agnostic, or believer? 2. Which language was used for the earlier writings of the Old Testament? 3. The Western culture gets much of its thought process from which language? 4. In the 1611 AD English dialect, what is the word for your? 5. When referring to words in an original language, what are three ways to illustrate the word? 6. When translating from an original language, what are three practices for getting the meaning? "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 2 ICON, IMAGE, & LIKENESS Thought A 7 year-old boyís meaning of Bible: Basic Information Before Leaving Earth Back to basics The oldest recorded history that is still in common use is the Hebrew book called Genesis. This one work of art covers all the truth that is expanded in other books. The book is the foundation of all Apologetics for the Judeo-Christian religions. Only a brief word study of the first sentence gives a complete overview of theology. The one sentence declaration illustrates the vast spectrum of topics that are embodied in the entire manuscript. The time record of the book of Genesis covers almost half of all human recorded history. There is always room for debate when estimating archaeological dates. Nevertheless, an early theologian, Ussher, calculated the first recorded date. It was estimated at 4004 BC. The record of Genesis ends with the Exodus, which occurred about 1500 BC. Where did we come from? How did we get here? Are we just animals? Some argue the Bible is not a scientific document and therefore could not possibly answer these questions. That is only partially true. "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"10 Who Is This God?  Durham Science by definition is the recording of observable, repeatable facts. However, neither creation nor human history is repeatable. Nevertheless, we can describe processes from the past based on information we gather. The record is very accurate when all data are observed. It has proved to be the longest lived, accepted, recorded history on the planet. The first statement is a succinct declaration about origins. In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. - Genesis 1:1 The oldest and most revered reference declares God as the Creator. It establishes God was before time, in the beginning. Man is an icon What is God like? We can only know by observing his likeness. However, what is his likeness? We begin to find clues in the beginning book of human history and theology. An icon is an image or representation. We find the assertion that man as an icon or image is like the Creator. That should not be a great surprise. The imagery is declared then immediately reaffirmed. And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. - Genesis 1:26 - 27 There are at least two observations from this encounter. First, mankind is a likeness of God. Second, as part of that image, mankind has dominion and control over the entire earth and all the critters on the earth. Dominion means command, dominance, power,"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 Icon, Image, & Likeness 11 and authority. In other words, the earth and the animals belong to man for his use. The earth and all that is in it are for service and profit. Nevertheless, it should not be abused. It is the height of arrogance to think that man has the ability to ultimately destroy the earth or even a significant part. On the other extreme, it is simplistic to think that we are just a part of the earth and the animals are the same level and have as much rights as humans. The principle was reaffirmed by the ancient King David millennia later. You made him to have dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet: - Psalm 8:6 If the Creator made everything, then he has authority over all he made. Since man is like him, that power was explicitly transferred. Think about it. You have authority over all things to which you apply your mind. Like who There is much consternation among students about exactly what this likeness means. At the time of creation, mankind was created perfect, in the image of the Creator. Since a perfect Creator can only perform perfection, then the created human must be perfect initially. The Creation account explicitly declares that man, and angels, were originally created excellent. And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold it was very good. - Genesis 1:31 What is the implication of this logical observation? If there is imperfection, it necessarily came later because of some action by the created beings. "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"12 Who Is This God?  Durham Beyond the implication that man was made in the image of God, this account provides many opportunities for discussion. First, the word for God is a plural form, but has singular application. It is used in a singular context with a singular verb. Second, God said ëusí. This clearly indicates there is a multiplicity. In this multiplicity, there are three different identities cataloged in the creation account. First, God is acknowledged as the creator in the very first statement. Next, the Spirit of God hovered over the fluid morass in the second sentence. Finally, Yehovah God was embodied with the days of creation summarized in the next chapter of the book. Most researchers throughout history have regarded this image to indicate a trinity. The term trinity is never used in any of the recorded passages of the Old or New Testaments. The concept is after the Greek term trias and Latin trinitas, which means simply a set of three things that form a unit. The equivalent non-religious word is triad. Science accord My background is a scientist, engineer, researcher, author, technology entrepreneur, commercial pilot, university professor, and seminary dean. This experience creates other fields of study for correlations to theology. From years of research and education, a very simple principle has been observed. This has been reported in scientific literature. The basis of technical research is called the Triad Principle. Any item that can be uniquely identified can be further described by three members. - MOD Universally in the physical sciences, we find this is a fundamental law. As a result, all uniquely defined, complete equations have three components. "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 Icon, Image, & Likeness 13 Based on the triad principle of science, we can know or predict many things numerically. If anything is uniquely identified, then it is one item. A complete description of the one item would have three members. When comparing aspects of the three members, two will appear to be very similar. In contrast, the third will seem perpendicular or very different. God is in the details Pulling from previous math classes and learning of prime numbers, this one series of numbers has unique characteristics. They are not divisible by any other number. The sequence is 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and continuing. Other than 2, all prime numbers are necessarily odd. In relation, numbers that correlate to the Creator deity are always represented by the prime numbers. For example, unique items are represented by the number one. Each item has three members. The number seven represents completeness, such as the days of a week. Other numbers tend to be associated with particular items. For example, six is often associated with human characteristics. Twelve is associated with leaders, such as the founding fathers of the Jewish culture and Arab culture, as well as the New Testament apostles. Forty is concerned with growth to a new level, such as the period of reign for the first kings, David and Solomon. Pattern of analysis The principle of three members for one item is universal in physical science. Numerous illustrations, statements, and inferences indicate this idea. If the model is consistently correct through trials or experiments, then the hypothesis is valid. The result is a theory that describes a principle or law. "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"14 Who Is This God?  Durham An example of this triad principle is seen through scientists performing extensive analysis into the states of water. Ice is the form that is solid and has fixed dimensions. Liquid is the common state at normal temperatures and can be controlled in an open container. Vapor is the gaseous state that is invisible, and fills any space, but is still very much water. In all states, the chemical molecule is still two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. This is just one example of having three members of one item. Time is another very intriguing concept. It is the measurement of a sequence of events. Some measurements are fixed. Some include time to give rate or speed. Others include a second time multiplier to give acceleration. The three times combined represent a triad. The solution of this relationship explains the decay of every natural system. In a later chapter, we will see how this has shown up in life expectancy. There are an infinite number of illustrations of triads in nature. In all cases, the observation is only one item. However, it has three different members that describe various conditions of the one article. The strongest evidence in the materials we are studying is the numerous illustrations of the trinity concept throughout the canon. The model of a three-member relationship will be used as the pattern of analysis for our study of theology. This provides a foundation and a framework for each category of items we investigate. Away we go on the most fundamental, but encompassing adventure affecting mankind. What a fascinating topic. Review 1. What is an icon? 2. What is a triad? 3. What is the difference in a triad and trinity? 4 How many illustrations of a triad can you think of in nature?"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 3 CAN YOU COUNT TO THREE? Thought Steps to effective teaching Learn - Do - Teach Pattern The triad principle simply means any unique item will have three members existing simultaneously and inseparably. As conditions change, one may appear to dominate. Nevertheless, all still exist. The model has worked in the past and continues to be appropriate for every idea modern science has researched. Humans are made, as we discussed previously, in the image of God. Then, if we determine the pattern of man, we have indications into the pattern of God. Using the term indications does not imply that man is equivalent, only that he is modeled after a particular form. It is generally recognized in philosophy and theology studies that man responds in three ways, as a triad or trinity. The ideas and concepts used to describe these responses vary greatly, depending on the area of study. In philosophy, psychology, and physiology areas, the factors are called by technical, but common terms - emotional, physical, and mental. The identical elements were called by different terms 400 years ago. The 1611 AD manner of speaking was preserved in the most"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"16 Who Is This God?  Durham common English biblical translation. The rendition is called the Authorized Version or King James Version. Since this style has been used for so many years, the dialect has taken on religious overtones. Check the original language In many cases, words have become religious to the point that they are difficult to comprehend. Often, they have lost their basis in common language. The human factors are a prime example. The corresponding ideas in the older dialect are listed below. Soul = Emotional Body = Physical Spirit = Mental The Greek and Hebrew value of the words can be readily established from numerous manuscripts. The form may vary slightly depending on the usage in the sentence. Nevertheless, the common root is widely known. The phonetic forms of the Greek words are commonly identified and used. Psyche (5590) = Emotional Soma (4983) = Physical Pneuma (4151) = Mental The Hebrew roots are also well known. Nephesh (5315) = Emotional Basar (1320) = Physical Ruwach (7307) = Mental It should be noted that language reflects the culture and thought processes. In Greek philosophy, the three components could be discretely isolated into three individual entities. However, in Hebrew philosophy, the three identifiable factors were inseparable. The structure demanded there be a body to surround the soul and be a residence for the spirit. "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 Can you Count to Three? 17 The Western thought process has much of its foundations in Greek culture, while the Eastern process is more closely allied with Hebrew thinking. This issue of thought processes involving discrete versus inseparable is the starting point of many theological discussions which end up being called mysteries. They are enigmas primarily because of a difference in logic approach. Retranslate Some very conservative lecturers may disagree with the premise that the words correspond. Take the Greek root words through current translation software. This will yield the present day value of the words. The current translation explanation corresponds precisely with the technical terms listed previously. A reference used in most translations is the Septuagint . This Greek rendition of the Hebrew scripture was initially released about 250 BC. The original translation was done by 70 Jewish scholars. This led to the name, which is derived from the Latin for the word seventy. Hence, it is often represented by the Roman numerals for seventy, LXX. The first version was the Torah. Various later iterations have somewhat clouded the original work. Nephesh (5315) , the Hebrew root word for emotional, occurs 753 times in the ancient texts. The Septuagint renders the expression into the Greek articulation psyche (5590) about 600 times. The Authorized Version uses 28 different words to translate the idea into English. Of that number, 475 times it is portrayed as soul. Another 117 times it is life. Other renderings embrace person, heart, creature, will, desire, and appetite, among other things. It is interesting that soul has religious connotations while psyche has just the opposite in current usage. Dr. Spiro Zodhiates has an excellent comment on understanding the word. ìMore than 400 times nephesh is translated as soul in English. This is unfortunate, because many people today are then forced to think of this noun in a metaphysical, theological sense.î "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"18 Who Is This God?  Durham The Hebrew word ruwach (7307) has been variously translated as mind, wind, and spirit. In one instance, it is rendered as in the cool. Refer to Genesis 3 where God was in the cool (ruwach, 7307) of the day. The original ancient writings were composed in the vernacular language of the day. The manuscript was intended for everyday use, not necessarily as a religious essay. With that concept in mind, we will refer to the three relationships of a person in the current language usage. Even the technical concepts have various shades of meaning. The nuances of a particular idea depend on the application. Some of the more common thoughts are associated with each factor. Emotional: appetite, will, feelings, desires, drive, and dreams Physical: action, response, and body motion Mental: attitude, intellect, decision, logic, or reason Location, location, location Each of the perspectives correlates with a particular location relative to the body. Emotional is an internal characteristic that may not be apparent to others. Physical is the external appearance that others can see. Mental is the air or atmosphere that relates to a person and that is perceived on a different plane. It is reflected in the idea of sensing what someone is thinking. Awareness of the factors is detected by the senses. Physical is represented by the five senses - touch, taste, see, smell, and hear. Emotional is called the sixth sense, sometimes referred to as intuition. It is a feeling about the rectitude of a situation. Mental may be the seventh sense. It is an air or sensation of completeness and wellness or the counterpoint. Any one item, by definition, is a unique representation. Furthermore, there are many items.

As a result, there are myriad ways to describe any complex system made of unique items. Mind over matter The brain is the mechanism that controls all the actions and factors of the body. The leading university level anatomy text by Gray segregates the brain into a complete suite of seven sections. The subdivisions are named from the spinal cord to the top. These are medulla oblongata, pons, cerebellum, midbrain, thalamus, hypothalamus, and cerebrum. The segments are grouped into three areas, the hindbrain, midbrain, and forebrain, respectively. The hindbrain and midbrain coordinate the autonomous and reflex activity of the body. The functions include posture, muscle tone, and life functions. The cerebrum is the top of the forebrain. It is the seat of learning, logic, and reasoning. The back parts of the forebrain control the physiological response of the autonomous nervous system. Related activity is the biological clock and sexual behavior. Emotions are largely controlled by the limbic system. Primary limbic components are parts of the thalamus, hypothalamus, and deep recesses of the forebrain. The limbic system contains a pleasure center and a punishment center. When that body part is stimulated, there is an emotional feeling. The sensation may include hunger, pain, sexual desire, anger, and fear. In turn, coordinated physiological responses are initiated in the limbic system. The results may be increased heart rate, panting, blushing, or sweating. The physiological reaction has caused emotions to be associated with the internal organs. In some circles, emotions are called the soul. This is also variously referred to as having a heart or guts."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"20 Who Is This God?  Durham Word pictures So, how does all this fit together? A diagram is beneficial. The standard model for a control system is shown. The diagram can be explained in just a few lines. A stimulus causes an emotion to move forward. The emotion promotes a physical response. The mental state of mind analyzes the response and feedback controls the emotion. The control may be positive reinforcement, which causes the physical to grow. On the other hand, it may be a negative signal, which causes the physical effect to diminish to nothing. When restated in 1611 AD dialect, the analysis sounds more religious.

We have just researched a model of how a man functions. Since man is in the image of the Creator, we have indications about his characteristics. We can conclude that one facet of God is the triad relationship. He has a will or emotional identity. He can take on a body or physical person in time. He is a Spirit or intellectual member. All these exist simultaneously and are inseparable. We talk with the Creator by our prayer thoughts. His Spirit in turn influences our spirit through the mind. Our mental faculties then control our heart or emotions. Have you ever had a very close relationship with someone? You can sense their attitudes and what they are thinking. This is a similar principle. This science discussion has three (obviously) key objectives. First, the triad model is valid for subsequent analyses of each topic we will address. Second, the concept is very comprehensible and can be explained in everyday terms, as well as religious. Third, this illustrates the Bible is applicable to all areas of our life, including the sciences. Is it not fascinating that the Creator made man in his image?

In addition to the mental or spirit world, the emotions can also dramatically influence situations. For example, an emotionally angry person creates a strong feeling to avoid. A little history Our objective is to minimize religious terminology and to present Who Is This God? in current vernacular. Therefore, this section may be skipped with no loss of understanding. It is only provided to give a complete framework for the treatise. The study and understanding of God has gone through a variety of interpretations throughout history. These have been heavily influenced by the culture of the time. Immediately after the completion of the writings of the New Testament, the interpretation was based on a relationship experience that served a function. As heresy began to develop, dogma was established to give rules of practice. Theophilus of Antioch first applied the Greek term trias . The Latin trinitas was first used by Tertullian, a lawyer and presbyter in Carthage, before 220 AD. Tertullian taught the Son and Spirit are part of the one being of substance with the Father. His writings challenged the heresy of modalism or Sabellianism, which teaches that the Father, Son and Spirit are sequentially the same, and the Son did not exist before the incarnation. Modalism was a distorted effort to preserve monotheism and to combat tritheism. The result is similar to a variation of Unitarian, which teaches there is only God, and Jesus is not God. About 318 AD, Arius of Alexandria claimed that the Father was the only God and that the Father created the Son and the Son created the"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 Can you Count to Three? 23 Holy Spirit. As such, each was a separate being. To put down this Arian heresy was the stimulus for Constantine the emperor to call the ecumenical council of Nicea in 325 AD. The result was the Nicean Creed, which affirmed the divinity of the Son and Holy Spirit, but left intact the concept of separate beings. Athanasius of Alexander participated in the Nicean Council. His writings during the next 50 years furthered the idea of the Godhead of three distinct individual persons who were all divine. Although heavily influenced by the Greek understanding, this dogma became the orthodox teaching of the Catholic Church. The Athanasian Creed was developed some years later and it seems to show influence of St. Augustineís writing. The positions of Catholic, Protestant, and Independent churches can be traced to one of the various teachings of the first four centuries after the completion of the Scripture. Over a century ago, the classical trinity of orthodox Christianity was concisely stated in the abstract of principles of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary (Art. III). ìGod is revealed to us as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, each with distinct personal attributes, but without division of nature, essence, or being.î With the acrimony associated with any religious teaching that may vary in some form from a perceived convention, any writer is subject to being labeled. That is unfortunate, since the earliest teachings were very much about relational understanding. Although our theology is very obviously conservative Trinitarian, our approach is to make the concepts relatable to anyone. This necessarily can only be accomplished from a classical research analysis and going back to the source of first century practices that preceded religious dogma. Specifically, we have found the word ëpersoní to be sometimes confusing for many people, since it can imply three separate mortals. This is particularly a problem when working with people from Eastern cultures. That is not surprising since three individuals"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"24 Who Is This God?  Durham is primarily a Greek concept, which strives to isolate discrete components. In contrast, the Eastern cultures see any such relationships as inseparable. We have worked with people from over 35 countries and found that one word is a stumbling point to meaningful dialogue about the God of the universe. It just does not translate well. Moreover, the word is used only two times in the Authorized Version to refer to God. In both instances, it is a New Testament discussion of the physical person, Jesus. Therefore, we will be judicious in our discussions to maintain accuracy, but will dispense with that particular term. Numerous alternatives are illustrated throughout the canon. The legal scholar Paul in correspondence to Corinth provides a better example in a rather lengthy discourse. The introduction follows. For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ. - I Corinthians 12:12 The body is a unit, tho ugh it is made up of many parts; and though all its parts are many, they form one body. So it is with Christ. - I Corinthians 12:12 NIV Review 1. Describe a circumstance when you have entered an area and had a strong feeling about the situation. 2.

In varied circumstances, a person may relate in a way that is primarily emotional, physical, or intellectual. God is revealed and relates in a similar fashion. A majority of one, God The foundations are critical to any research. As such, we will return to the very first sentence in the anthology. The very first Hebrew word used to identify God is Elohiym (430) . In the beginning, God (Elohiym) created the heaven and the earth. - Genesis 1:1 The word is probably best translated almighty. It is used 2606 times in the Hebraic Old Testament. As noted earlier, this word has a"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"26 Who Is This God?  Durham plural form but it is used with singular verbs. That construction is compatible with the idea of three members of one God. As no other word, this single term is recognized to define the Creator. The concept is the essence of all that is superior to mankind. Essence is another word used to describe the emotions or soul. That feature is the internal or inherent characteristic of an individual will. Hovering, Spirit The next Semitic word associated with God is ruwach (7306) . ÖAnd the Spirit (Ruwach) of God moved upon the face of the waters. - Genesis 1:2 The word occurs 378 times. Of those, 232 times it was translated Spirit in the Authorized Version accounting. In other frequent usage, it was translated wind in 92 cases. In 27 instances, it was rendered breath. In another place, it was called cool. The air describes a situation that is unconstrained by physical description. When you enter a room, a certain air is associated with your first sensation. That air, atmosphere, or ambiance you sense is embodied in the concept of the word spirit. The characteristic is around an entity. That feature is associated with the mental faculties. What is proper, Yehovah The third word associated with God during the creation account is Yehovah (3068) . Öin the day that the LORD (Yehovah) God made the earth and the heavens. - Genesis 2:4 "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 Name That God 27 This is the proper name of the Creator. In ancient writings, some legalists considered the word too sacred to write or speak directly. It was applied euphemistically with only the four letters, without any vowel pointing. That construct is called a tetragrammaton. The letters are variously transliterated into English as YHWH or JHVH . When vowels are applied to the tetragrammaton, we obtain Yahweh or Jehovah. These are exactly equivalent, representing only a slight difference in translation of pronunciation. In different languages, the letters ëYí and ëJí may convert interchangeably because of articulation. Similarly, ëUí, ëVí, or ëWí may be exchanged. In other tongues, ëIí and ëJí are equivalent. Dr. Strong used a blend of letters that appears to be a better rendering, Yehovah (3068) . When the Hebrew was translated into English in 1611, the editors opted to follow the ancient practices. Therefore, they did not use any indication this was a proper name. They simply translated the word as LORD, a four-letter symbolism. The entire word was capitalized to differentiate it from another word meaning the title Lord. This tradition has been carried over to many of the newer versions and revisions, even though it is an inadequate translation. That choice is unfortunate on several accounts. First, when hearing, it is impossible to tell which concept of LORD (Yehovah) or Lord (Sir) is used. This makes it impossible to identify whether the word is a name or a title. As we progress in the investigation of Who Is This God?, we will find it desirable to make that distinction. A name is very personal, while a title is stilted and generic. To assist in clarity of understanding during speaking discussions, we will use the transliterated term Yehovah . The word was applied 6519 times, far more than any other term or combination for the Deity. It is obvious that it is intended to be used. The very idea of a proper name indicates a personal God who is accessible to mankind. The feature of this name is associated with the physical person of God. "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"28 Who Is This God?  Durham What was that sir, Lord An additional title that is linked to the Creator is Adonay (136) . And Abram said, Lord (Adonay) GOD (Yehovah) , what will you give me, seeing I go childless, - Genesis 15:2 The address was applied 434 times in the original manuscript. The title is closely associated with nobility or a peerage. The term was brought into the English Bible by the British culture during the seventeenth century. That environment was heavily steeped in regal traditions. Hence, Lord was a very elegant title representing a proprietor, master, gentry, or other prestigious rank. The title did not imply slavery on the part of the person using it. British citizens could not be treated as slaves or serfs since the thirteenth century. It is more common to address a lord by the title Sir accompanied by his name. Lord is the title or rank. Sir is the personal address. The above reference for Lord God could be accurately rendered Sir Yehovah . This construction brings the relationship more intimate and current. Note here a problem that is created with the translation practices. In their desire to avoid using Yehovah , the translators typically used the LORD construct. However, when used with Adonay (Lord), they were forced to stick in still another word. Therefore, God (Elohiym) was substituted for Yehovah to avoid using LORD. Otherwise, for consistency, the translation would have been Lord LORD. This choice of word usage ultimately destroys any personal comprehension of Yehovah in the message. The title lord is also associated with a husband. This usage is consistent since it indicates protector and provider. Shortly after the above reference to Lord, Sarah used the same term for Abraham, her spouse. "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 Name That God 29 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? - Genesis 18:2 What is in a name We can learn a great deal by observing the traditions of a name. Shem is an excellent example. Shem is the Hebrew translation for name. As one of Noahís three sons, he was a survivor of the universal flood that virtually destroyed the planet. Moreover, he is the ancestor of all Semitic people. As such, his moniker could reasonably be expected to represent all names in that culture. Adam is another fascinating example. Adam is the Hebrew noun for mankind and ruddy. As the first person, it is expected that his name would come to represent the entire human race. A later chapter will deal with the genealogy of the early human family, including these two gentlemen. Associations Different perspectives of the supreme deity are associated with various situations. Look at the first six chapters of Genesis to find the pattern for forms of the name used throughout history. God (Elohiym) is when the supreme entity is implied and elevated away from humans. LORD (Yehovah) is personal when there is discussion with a human. Lord (Adonay) is used frequently in negotiations of a family or business type situation. God (Elohiym) is primarily presented during the creation account. Yehovah God is predominant with Adam and Eve. Yehovah then becomes the leading representation. It appears that the proper or individual name became more common when the people accepted a personal relationship.

Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high (elyon) God (El) . - Genesis 14:8 This compound emphasizes the supremacy of the Creator above all other gods.

He was a priest and received tithes from Abraham. He is affirmed to be without father or mother. Tradition indicates he was Shem, a flood survivor and the father of the Semitic people. His heritage is discussed extensively in another chapter. Much later in time, the person of Jesus was called a priest after the order of Melchizedek. El Shaddai (7706) is Almighty God (410) . And when Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD (Yehovah) appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty (Shaddai, 7706) God (El, 410) ; walk before me, - Genesis 17:1 Shaddai probably is related to mountain, hence the mighty concept. Some scholars relate it to covenant keeping. The idea was used when the covenant with Abraham was reiterated.

Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel (6005) . - Isaiah 7:14 Immanuel is a transliteration of the Hebrew that literally is ëin man Godí. The term is a combination that simply announces that God is with us. The anticipation revealed that God would come in a physical person as a man. This foresight was satisfied with the extraordinary birth of the man Jesus. As stated in the prediction, the mother would be a virgin. In combination with specific declarations by the tax collector, Matthew, virgin asserts no sexual contact. Then how was the child fathered? The name Immanuel explains that the father was God.

This quality, trait, characteristic, or feature describes something. Attributes of deity are described by ideals. The attributes of the Creator are most obvious when related to common concepts. Various writers have listed many attributes. Seldom do the lists match. They seem to reflect the preferences of the author. For a God that creates, there should be a consistent pattern. Rather than memorize terms, we propose to look at a more structured understanding. The attributes are separated into categories of philosophy, science, and personality. Each category has three individual components. These components are common concepts within each of the fields of study. By definition, God is greater than all things. Therefore, when proper concepts are extended to their logical conclusion, they describe one of the attributes of the Creator."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"38 Who Is This God?  Durham  PHILOSOPHY Philosophy category Philosophy covers all learning outside of technical precepts and practical arts. It includes all university training except medicine, law, and theology. At its core are logic, aesthetics, ethics, and metaphysics with reference to validity and limits. Mathematics is the philosophy of using symbols and numbers to represent real objects and values. We will not discuss calculations or equations. Rather we will look at the symbols and concepts. The symbols allow very complex concepts to be described concisely. Philosophy is constrained by three points. There is a starting point, base, or origin; an ending point, extreme, or limit; and the value point, reference, or measure. The logical conclusion of each of these points is an attribute of the Creator. Perfect The base or starting point is perfection, by definition. Starting with less than perfection would necessarily include starting with error. The word derives from the Latin perfectus . Perfect literally means excellent, finished, complete, or precise. The logical extension of perfection is law or structure. Therefore, the base or starting attribute of the Creator is perfect and becomes law. The law of the LORD (Yehovah) is perfectÖ - Psalms 19:7 All natural laws come from perfection. A law is simply a statement of how something works. It is not an explanation of the consequences. Laws have consequences, which lead to stability. Natural laws have perfect results. If you violate a law, you will have consequences."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Chapter 6 Attributes Are the Ultimate 39 Consequences are not the law, but the rejection of the law or rule. The results may vary, but the consequences are always the same. If you violate the law of gravity, consequently you will hit the ground. It may be tripping, or it may be falling from a building. A person is not condemned to fall. Nevertheless, if he rejects the natural law, he will pay. This attribute lets God be perfect in love. Consequently, when a person rejects that love, he will pay with eternal separation. He is not arbitrarily condemned to separation. It is a choice. As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD (Yehovah) is flawless. - Psalms 18:30 NIV Be you therefore perfect (excellent), even as your Father, which is in heaven, is perfect (excellent). - Matthew 5:48 The last passage was declared by the God-man, Jesus. Father asserts that God is our progenitor. We are here because of him and his creative acts. Is it possible for a person to be perfect? Can a person pursue excellence? Unique The value of a point is unique. Unique implies exceptional, single, exclusive, set apart, or distinctive. Therefore, the reference or measurement attribute of the Creator is exceptional or unique. In religious terms, this is often called holy. Our goal is to keep concepts applicable for every person in every day life. Therefore, our objective is to be like God, which is to be exceptional. ÖBe holy (exceptional), because I am holy (exceptional). - Leviticus 11:45, I Peter 1:16"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"40 Who Is This God?

Infinite implies exceeding, vast, immense, forever or everything. Other explanations are extending beyond, lying beyond, or greater than any limit. The word meaning is so expansive, that it is very difficult to define with strictly positive concepts. In fact, the word itself derives from the Latin in + finitus . This literally means not finite or measurable. The logical extension of infinite is beyond measure. Therefore, the extreme attribute of the Creator is best stated as infinite. In traditional religious terms, this is often called omnipotent. That term carries the idea of all power. Humans are not encouraged to be infinite or all powerful, since this logically is not possible. Great is our Lord (Yehovah) , and of great power: his understanding is infinite. - Psalms 147:5 Öwith God all things are possible. - Matthew 19:26 Ah Lord God (Yehovah) ! behold, you have made the heaven and the earth by your great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for you: - Jeremiah 32:17 "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Chapter 6 Attributes Are the Ultimate 41 Fun with numbers The topic of philosophy lends itself so beautifully to numbers and symbols applications. By no stretch of the imagination, will this be a mathematical analysis. Perfect (excellent) is the base or starting point, represented by the number zero (0). This value is the lower limit or foundation of numbers. The symbol is very symmetrical, with no abrupt direction changes. Alone, it has no value. However, as a placeholder, zero makes other numbers an order of magnitude greater. One becomes ten, ten becomes one hundred, all because of the zero. Unique (exceptional) is the reference or value point, obviously represented by the number one (1). Any value can be obtained by adding enough ones together. It is the most powerful of all numbers. Infinite (exceeding) is the extreme or ending point, represented by a very unusual symbol ( ∞ ). The symbol is the upper limit of numbers. This symbol is without beginning or end. Regardless of direction of travel along the path, you will ultimately end up at the same place. It continues forever. SCIENCE Science category The next attribute category is science. Science simply means knowing. Science is observing repeatable events, then developing an explanation. If the events are not repeatable and observable, the study is a hypothesis or conjecture. All physical science can be defined by three measurements - matter, time, and space. Each of these also is three faceted. The logical conclusion of these measurements is the attribute of the Creator. "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"42 Who Is This God?  Durham  Stable Matter is the stuff that the five senses can detect. Matter is the item that gives characteristics. The three unique characteristics of matter are mass, charge, and magnetism. Matter implies things exist. Stable is unchanging, consistent, steady, or firm. If something exists in all conditions, the logical conclusion is it must be stable. Therefore, the matter attribute of the Creator is stable. In religious terms, this is often called immutable. That is a very long synonym for stable. ...with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. - James 1:17 The next reference precedes a discussion of giving tithes and offerings instead of robbing God. For I am the LORD (Yehovah) , I change not; - Malachi 3:6 We are directed to have this stable attribute. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. - James 1:7 Perpetual Time is the measurement of a sequence of events. There are three characterizations of time. Some measurements are independent of time. Some include time. Others include a second time multiplier. Time implies a definite interval or period when things happen. If something exists during all the time characterizations, the logical conclusion is it must be perpetual. Therefore, the time attribute of the Creator is that he is perpetual."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Chapter 6 Attributes Are the Ultimate 43 In religious terms, this is often called eternal or everlasting. Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever you had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God. - Psalms 90:2 I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet doneÖ - Isaiah 46:10 Öa perpetual incense before the LORD (Yehovah) throughout your generations. - Exodus 30:8 Any physical item is constrained to exist in time. Since God supercedes time, he is not constrained to a physical body. Nevertheless, he can move into time and take on the physical form. Everywhere Space is the measurement by distance. Space is often rendered as heaven in the ancient Hebrew and Greek manuscripts. There are three types of space measurement. The most common is three-dimensional space that gives volume to matter. The second is the force distance measurement that creates energy. The third is the motion measurement that gives direction and creates fields. Three-dimensional space has three regions. The closest is the area we occupy and the air we breathe. Next is the region of birds, airplanes, and weather. Outer space is the region of celestial bodies such as the moon, sun, and stars. In metaphysical context, space includes three realms. The natural realm is the abode of humans. The supernatural realm is the place of the spirit world. The ultra-natural realm is the space of God that cannot be penetrated."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"44 Who Is This God?  Durham  Space implies a definite region where things happen. If something is simultaneously located in all regions, then it is ubiquitous or everywhere. Therefore, the space attribute of the Creator is everywhere. In religious terms, this attribute is often called omnipresent. If I ascend up into heaven, you are there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, you are there. If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; Even there shall your hand lead me, and your right hand shall hold me. - Psalms 139:8-10 But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built? - I Kings 8:27 Do not I fill heaven and earth? says the LORD (Yehovah) . - Jeremiah 23:24 PERSONALITY Personality category The next attribute category is personality or behavior. Personality is the image of humans that is like the Creator. An earlier discussion, investigated image concepts extensively. This discussion will simply determine the attribute that relates to each factor. Personality is defined by three relationships - emotional, physical, and mental. The logical extent of these behavioral traits is the attribute of the Creator. Absolute Emotion is variously related to will, appetite, feelings, desires, drive, and conscious dreams. It is the most intimate of the personality features."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Chapter 6 Attributes Are the Ultimate 45 Emotion implies there is a will or desire for something. The logical conclusion is that it must be absolute will. Therefore, the emotional attribute of the Creator is absolute. In religious terms, this is often called sovereign. That is an excellent term, since it is regal with the authority of a king. However, even a monarchís authority is restricted compared to absolute power. As is obvious, emotions including will are one of the aspects given to mankind. How does the absolute will of God interact with the free will of humans? In his absolute will, he has allocated certain decisions to people. A personís will is simply to take advantage of or to reject natural laws. The rejection of the laws, as we discussed earlier, has consequences. We do not have willpower to change natural laws. Natural laws are the result of the perfect attribute, and we are not perfect in this life. Within our allotted freedom, we are allowed to make our choices, even if they are detrimental. This is obvious in the following reference. The Lord isÖnot willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. - II Peter 3:9 The will of God is most substantiated in his creation and control of natural order. But our God is in the heavens: he has done whatsoever he has pleased. - Psalms 115:3 Of his own will he produced us with the word of truth, - James 1:18 You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for you have created all things, and for your pleasure they are and were created."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"46 Who Is This God?

Physical implies a body for some activity. If there is a body, the logical extent is it must be self-sufficient. Therefore, the physical attribute of the Creator is self-sufficient. In religious terms, this is often called self-existent. For from him, and through him, and to him are all things. - Romans 11:36 For as the Father has life in himself; so has he given to the Son to have life in himself; - John 5:26 And he is before all things, and by him all things consist (stay together). - Colossians 1:17 All-knowing Mental includes attitude, intellect, decision, logic, or reason.

Rather than memorize terms, we have used a structured approach. Separate the attributes into categories of philosophy, science, and personality. Each category has three individual components. These components are common concepts in each of the fields of study. The supreme or extreme depiction for the components is the deified attribute. In philosophy, we can be excellent and exceptional; but we have bounds so we are finite. In personality, we have the emotional, physical, and mental relationships, but less than the extent of the Creator. In science, we exist in matter, space, and time. So we can be stable, however, we are excluded from perpetual and everywhere. Review Identify the following relationships associated with attributes. 1.

Character is how a person behaves when no one is looking. If a culture is going to survive, society has certain expectations and requirements of its citizens. Some features are universal, such as the protection of life. Others are preferences, such as hairstyle. Character is the trait that promotes equitable treatment of every person, regardless of station. The behavior of a person is determined by the nature of his dealings. He has three responses - personal, interpersonal, and deity. Personal is with himself, interpersonal is with others, and deity is with the higher power. Alternately, the relationships are respectively called internal, horizontal or external, and vertical.

Durham Where from The list of character traits that are generally accepted is actually quite limited. In the Judeo-Christian ethical structure, these are identified in the historical and religious teachings. One brief and one comprehensive list have survived over two thousand years. That is a strong commendation of the value of the qualities. Both lists are referred to as the fruit of the Spirit. Fruit is one of the products of a live organism. Fruit carries all the characteristics of the parent in the seed. Therefore, the character of God can be inferred from the compilation of both the short and comprehensive lists of the fruit of the Spirit. For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, righteousness, and truth. - Ephesians 5:9 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control: against such there is no law. - Galatians 5:22-23 NIV Each character trait will be investigated individually. Some of these expressions are from language usage seldom seen in every day communication, because of the age of the writings. As we discussed, the original language is Greek and was translated into archaic English 400 years ago. To aid in comprehension, terms that are more familiar are associated with the ideas. The synonyms are used strictly to improve understanding. In no way are they intended to diminish the strength of the original concepts.

A person may embrace the trait within himself, such as being moral. Alternately, he or she may extend it to other people, such as treating others well. Moreover, other people will observe it in you. In some circles, theology and religion are regarded as a private matter. That is impossible. What you think, feel, and act impacts others. Theology is very much about relationships. There are terms for each of the traits that are personalized. Many authors use the internalized idea for the traits. However, we want to focus on the application for you and me. Therefore, the shade of meaning used for each trait will be the one that others observe in you. Remember these are the character of God. Therefore, they are the highest of values. The short list is investigated first. For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, righteousness, and truth. - Ephesians 5:9 Virtue Goodness (agathosune, 19) is one of two classes of goodness - passive and active. This is the energized or active goodness. The other class will be discussed in the next chapter. The idea is only translated goodness on four occasions. Alternative interpretations are virtue, worthwhile, well doing, and benefit. Virtue is an excellent word, but in some circles has come to be primarily associated with chastity. Worthwhile has broader application and acceptance in current usage. The relationship is horizontal or with other people, since it is how others are treated.

The term is seldom applied to humans and is often dropped from application discussions. To most people it is associated primarily with deity. In many cases, it is rendered just, right, freed, judgment, and justification. Morality, honesty, justice, equity, fairness, impartiality, and lawfulness are renderings that are more familiar. The relationship is internal or focused on you personally. Righteous (1343) are you, O LORD (Yehovah) , and upright are your judgments. - Psalm 119:37 Perhaps one of the most profitable promises in the entire manuscript is based on pursuing the moral trait. Jesus himself declared it. But seek you first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness (1343) ; and all these things shall be added unto you. - Matthew 6:33 Integrity Truth (alethia, 225) has come to mean just the blunt facts. The word is variously translated as indeed, verity, surely, grinding, and very. Truth is a legal term that can be used to distort intentions and reality.

Integrity involves the facts, but tempered with judgment. It carries with it the idea of truth in concert with intentions. My wife has a very personal illustration of integrity.

Integrity is illustrated in both the Old and the New Covenant. God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent. Has he said, and shall he not do it?

Compassion (agape, 26) is emotional concern for others with a desire to give or help them. Erotic (eros) is physical, intimate, sexual attraction of one person for another. This form of love is only used in the Old Testament, so it does not have a Greek number. Friendship (phileo, 5368) is the mental appreciation for something, but lacks commitment. The greatest compassion is shown in the most well known verse on the planet. For God so loved (26) the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. - John 3:16 The erotic love has no reference in the New Record. However, erotic stamina is declared in an older passage. This is from an equivalent Hebrew word (ohab, 159) . The passion of a one-night stand is in no way similar to the compassion of an enduring relationship. Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves (ohab, 159) . - Proverbs 7:17 The more casual friendship lacks the physical or emotional intimacy. In many cases, this concept is related to the word like. The first passage could easily have the word like substituted for love.

Well done, you good and faithful servant: you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter you into the joy (5479) of your lord. - Matthew 25:21 Grace (charis, 5485) is derived from the word chara and literally means joy, favor, gratitude, thanks, or pleasure. The idea is shown in a term applied to debts. A grace period is an extension, which is granted as a favor, to allow payment of the bill. And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for you have found favor (5485) with God. - Luke 1:30 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace (5485) of God was upon him. - Luke 2:40 For if you love them which love you, what thank (5485) have you? - Luke 6:31 Charisma (charisma, 5486) is an obvious extension that is always a gift. The present day connotation is personal magnetic charm, appeal, or favor. This is a logical expectation since a person with tempered joy does have great appeal.

Joy is a personal, internal attitude. Grace is favor from another. Charisma is favor expressed toward another. Therefore, complete joy begins internally. In addition, we want grace from others.

The term is sometimes rendered as rest or quietness. An English word that is very similar to the Greek is serene. The idea is to be internally at peace and to project calm to others.

This is passive or benign good. That simply means there is no action associated with the idea. It is usefulness or excellence. Other options are mellow. Various passages have used kindness, goodness, gentleness, good, easy, better, and gracious for this idea. By comparison, excellence is goodness to the highest degree. Behold therefore the goodness (5544) and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness: otherwise you also shall be cut off. - Romans 11:22 That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness (5544) toward us through Christ Jesus. - Ephesians 2:7 Virtue Goodness (agathosune, 19) is the other of two classes of goodness - passive and active.

Synonymous concepts include credence, conviction, reliance, constancy, and fidelity. Confidence is the one word that best describes the entire range of meanings. Confidence is the mental assurance that something is true. Since confidence or faith is a fruit of the spirit, we know it is a rational characteristic. The idea is often associated with belief. Confidence is more of an attitude based on logical arguments. Belief seems to be more emotion derived from strong desire. Both are necessary for success. Confidence creates an atmosphere of control. In contrast, belief creates the desire to make it happen.

In fact, gentlemanliness is the one word that best describes the entire suite of character traits. How would you describe gentleman? Control Temperance (egkrateia, 1466) is simply self-control or moderation. The word fell out of use in the earlier part of the 1900ís. It was closely associated with the control of alcoholic use.

Control is one of those fascinating concepts that cross all boundaries. It is used to describe personal actions, relationships, financial situations, and mechanical devices. Whether in psychology, philosophy, or physics, control is crucial. In every circumstance, control simply means to apply feedback or constraint to a stimulus or input so that a desired response or output is obtained. The model developed earlier demonstrates control. Paul, a legal expert during the first century, described the object of control in a letter to the people at Philippi. Moderation is a related thought. Let your moderation be known unto all men. - Philippians 4:5 Examples vary widely. A person, who is a control freak, must dominate every situation. A ship has a rudder to control direction.

Durham LEGAL Legal Concepts Legal concepts are not a separate category of attributes or character. These are actually parts of the other attributes and of character. Notice that the perfect attribute was the basis for all law. So a precise location for judicial characteristics would be a sub category under perfect. Nevertheless, many authors present the ideas as independent traits. For that reason, we will discuss certain distinctions from a legal perspective. As with any item that can be uniquely defined, there are three components. The judicial values are mercy, justice, and freedom. The alternate values we have seen are compassion, morality, and perfect relating to the law. All of these are internal or emotional facets. Under the law, justice implies there are consequences. Mercy implies there is favorable treatment, which mitigates some of the consequences. Freedom implies making choices that concur with natural law and eliminates any consequences of concern. Mercy Mercy (eleos, 1656) is a result of compassion applied in a legal setting. So mercy could equally be included as a component of the compassion character trait. Mercy is always a fortunate circumstance for the recipient. The English word eleemosynary, which means charity, comes from the Greek origin (eleos, 1656) . Mercy is referenced 276 times throughout the manuscript. Obviously, this is an important concept. So then it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy (1656) . - Romans 9:15 +LEGAL+ mercy justice freedom"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 More Character 63 But God, who is rich in mercy (1656) , for his great love wherewith he loved usÖ - Ephesians 2:4 Justice Just (dikaios, 1342) is translated from the exact same word as righteous.

As I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just (1342) ; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which has sent me. - John 5:30 Freedom Free (eleutheroo, 1659) is perhaps one of the more emotional words in language. Note it is derived from the same root word as mercy (1656) . Free is almost always stated with negation of an undesirable situation. It means unconstrained, unlimited, independent, and uncontrolled. There is one positive word that can be used - choice. Perfect before law, means the law has no consequences to you. Therefore, you are free. However, freedom must be closely guarded. When the dream or will for freedom has been shattered, choice stops. Being free (nadiyb, 5081) was as strong a desire under the Old Covenant as it is today.

Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Joy, compassion, and calmÖ Is it not intriguing that with understanding the few basic character traits, we can relate to anyone? Can you imagine a person with all these positive attitudes - virtue, morality, and integrity? Think about a person with all the expanded traits: compassion, charisma, and calm; patience, kindness, and virtue; confidence, gentlemanliness, and control. What would you call that person? Do you want to be that way? These are all positive attitudes that are available. Every character trait that is associated with God is also directed toward humans.

In the beginning, GodÖ - Genesis 1:1 In an equally concise way, the new document gives a dramatic declaration of Jesus. A record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ the son of David, the son of Abraham: - Matthew 1:1 One record describes creation. The other record describes a birth. The first transcript gives two identifiers for God during the creation account as well as introducing the Spirit. First, God is declared the Creator in the very first statement. Next, the Spirit of God hovered over the fluid morass in the second sentence. Finally, Yehovah God was given as his personal name during the days of creation. The later transcript gives two identifiers for Jesus during the genealogy account. It also introduces the Spirit. First, Christ is declared the anointed in the first statement. Next, the Spirit of God hovered over Mary before the birth. Finally, Jesus was his personal name in the family tree. What is the proper name, Jesus Throughout most of history, names have had a meaning. A name is often derived from a location or a dramatic event. "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"68 Who Is This God?  Durham The genealogy we are researching is for an individual named Jesus. This is a Greek version of a Hebrew name, Joshua. The connotation of his handle is described below. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus (2424) , because he will save his people from their sins. - Matthew 1:21 In simplest terms, Joshua and Jesus can be stated as Jehovah (Yehovah) is salvation. The personal names are a direct correlation to Yehovah , the name of God. The proper name is representative of a man as the physical person of God. As a further affirmation relating to the Almighty, before his birth the youngster was given another appellation. In the Greek record, he was called Immanuel (1694) , which is also spelled Emmanuel. Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel (1694) , which being interpreted is, God (2316) with us. - Matthew 1:23 A transliteration from the Hebrew gives the identical name, Immanuel (6005) . Our earlier study included the Hebrew names of deity. We remember that El was an abbreviation for God (Elohiym) . The complete translation of Immanuel is included with the name, God with us. The Greek translation for God is theos (2316) . That word is used 1343 times in the New Testament. Therefore it is safe to say that it is not restricted to an Old Testament concept. This event was forecast about 742 years before it occurred. An ancient Hebrew prognosticator was confident enough to record the prediction. Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel (6005) . - Isaiah 7:14 "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Chapter 9 In the Name of Jesus 69 Notice the similarity between the forecast and the history. The statements are virtually identical in content. The differences are only in the translatorsí arrangement of the words. Anointed, Christ Matthewís genealogy is for Jesus Christ (5547) , the son of David. What is Christ? Is that a family name? Christ is an English transliteration from a Greek adjective christos . Christen has the same root. It means to name or dedicate by ceremony. In the Old Record, a Hebrew term was used similarly to mean anointed or covered over with oil. The phrase was applied primarily to the priests. They were separated, set apart, or made special by ceremonially placing oil on parts of their anatomy, such as the ear and toe. Therefore, it is apparent that the adjective Christ is related to worship and deity. Christ is related to the emotional will of God. The equivalent word is Messiah from the Hebrew Mashiyach (4822) . That word was translated anointed on 37 occasions and Messiah on only two. Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah (4822) the Prince shall be seven weeks, and sixty-two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times. And after sixty- two weeks shall Messiah (4822) be cut off, but not for himself: - Daniel 9:25-26 Only Daniel, a scion of a royal Hebrew family, who wrote in Aramaic has the word transliterated as Messiah. Daniel had tremendous integrity and focus on the Almighty. From his communications with the Most High, Daniel had the ability to"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"70 Who Is This God?  Durham interpret dreams and visions. This unique person rose to tremendous political power. The Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar, overthrew the government of Danielís country. Nevertheless, Daniel became Prime Minister under Nebuchadnezzar. He continued in the post under Belshazzar, a son of Nebuchadnezzar. That kingdom was consolidated under the rule of the Medes and the Persians. Daniel continued to prosper under Darius, the son of Ahasuerus, the Median king over Chaldea. He even maintained the position under Cyrus, king of Persia. Can you imagine what kind of person Daniel must have been? He was taken into captivity as a young man. Then he became a Prime Minister under at least four foreign governments. His record keeping and writing undoubtedly was impeccable. A hovering, Spirit The birth of the child Jesus was extraordinary in every sense of the word. To establish the inimitable relationship, an extended portion of Matthewís report in the New Record is registered. This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit. Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly. But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins. All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Chapter 9 In the Name of Jesus 71 The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel which means, God with us. - Matthew 1:18-23 NIV Who were the mother and father of Jesus? His ancestors are considered in a later chapter. Here we will only deal with his parents. As stated in the prediction by Isaiah, the mother would be a virgin. In combination with specific declarations by the tax collector, Matthew, virgin asserts no sexual contact. Mary had not come together with her fiancÈ Joseph. Then how was the child fathered? The name Immanuel explains that the Father was God. The public official further enlightens that the particular member involved with conception was the Spirit. Jesus declared he was the Son of God on multiple occasions. In one instance, he said that he and the Father were the same. That is in complete concert with the realization that God and every being in his image is a trinity. I and my Father (3962) are one. - John 10:30 The Greek derivative for father is pater (3962) . Of the 419 times it is used in the New Testament, it refers to Deity procreator 268 times. The person Jesus had a physical, human mother. His father was God through the work of the Spirit. In ancient mythology, this combination was called a demigod. Jesus was completely God through the lineage of his father. He was completely man through the lineage of his mother. This unique relationship has only been documented one time throughout the history of mankind. Because of this special bond, Jesus has had more impact on the human race than any other person. "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"72 Who Is This God?  Durham A title, Lord In addition to a proper name and an adjective of worship, Jesus took on a title. He was frequently called Lord. Since he did not object to the label, it is obvious that he accepted and approved it. Jesusí cousin John first applied the designation. John was the son of Elizabeth, who was a cousin of Mary, the mother of Jesus. And behold, your cousin Elizabeth... - Luke 1:36 John was an itinerate evangelist. Because of his message, he was called the Baptizer or Baptist. He was an orator in the countryside that challenged people to repent and turn to God. His attire was animal skin and he ate honey and wildlife from the land. When Jesus was ready to go public, John proclaimed the message. A voice of one calling in the desert, Prepare the way for the Lord (2962) , make straight paths for him. - Matthew 3:1 NIV Lord is from the Greek kurios (2962) . It is used 748 times and was translated lord, master, or sir. A full house Jesus is the proper name given to the young boy by his parents. Lord is the title bestowed because of his role as a teacher. Christ describes the office or job he holds as the anointed Messiah. The appropriate combination is Lord Jesus, the Christ. In many cases the comma is dropped so the office appears as part of the name. A corresponding example can be found in many illustrations in current life. My name given by my parents is Marcus Durham. In our culture, we use two or more names. The second is the family name. My title is Doctor because of my education. My office or job is Professor at the University. Another office is President of our"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Chapter 9 In the Name of Jesus 73 companies. Hence, the combination is Doctor Marcus Durham, Professor, or Doctor Marcus Durham, President. There is no implication that I am at the level of the Lord Jesus. This is simply an illustration of the relationship between the different terms. After John proclaimed who Jesus was, John baptized him. When he was coming from the water, the complete trinity was revealed simultaneously. And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. - Matthew 3:16 The man Jesus was physically on the earth. The spirit was in the air and floated like a dove. The Creator, God the Father, spoke from heaven with emotion. This is a very limited circumstance where the trinity of God is apparent at the same time. Although not apparent to the five senses, all three members are mentioned together as Jesus was leaving the planet in Matthew 28. There is another recorded instance where the three are observed simultaneously. A corresponding encounter is reported at the end of time in Revelation 22. I Am After leaving John, Jesusí spirit led him into the remote regions of the country. There he faced all possible temptations, tests, and trials. Because of his unique position, the ultimate adversary personally challenged him. He was tried on three different fronts. He was challenged mentally and responded with an intellectual argument speaking words. Word in this case is from the Greek rhema (4487), which is a spoken word"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"74 Who Is This God?  Durham or sentence. The Greek logos (3056) is also translated word but it means study or knowledge. It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word (rhema, 4487) that proceeds out of the mouth of God. - Mathew 4:4 He was challenged with physical health and responded with a direct command about teasing. It is written again, You shall not tempt the Lord your God. - Mathew 4:7 He was challenged emotionally with power and responded that he already had everything you could want. Worship, as we have seen earlier, is related to the adjective Christ. Get you hence, Satan: for it is written, You shall worship (proskuneo, 4352) the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve. - Mathew 4:10 Jesus himself made the most direct affirmation of his deity and his regal position. He asserted he was Lord and God. This point was immediately prior to the public being aware of him. He had been a carpenter and was now prepared to be the conscience of people, a nation, and the world. Your commission At the conclusion of his time on this planet, Jesus reaffirmed his power. He declared the trinity relationship as his final act. Therefore, he knew it was important to understand the concept. All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

Amen. - Matthew 28:18-20 This picture of baptism mirrors the event in Jesusí immersion. The three members of God are succinctly stated. The Father is the Creator God. The Son is the physical person Yehovah on the earth. The Spirit is in the air that continues to dominate during the present time. In addition, Jesus established his power as the one complete God. He transferred the full authority to those who follow his teaching. Do you live as if you have that authority? Do you teach others they can have the power to do all things through Yehovah? I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. - Philippians 4:13 A composite picture The man Jesus had tremendous impact on the world or culture of his day. Because of his creative nature, he had impact on the founding of the world or planet. In his comforting position, he continues to influence the most powerful thoughts of the world and people today. It was not until he had left the earth that anyone realized really who he was. He led a cadre of twelve interns, called apostles, who personally studied with him for three years. Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax-collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus; Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. - Matthew 10:1 "},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"76 Who Is This God?

With the exit of Jesus, all but one of these eventually continued in the work established by him. It was some weeks later that Peter, the fisherman, businessman, and theologian, put it all together. He gave the first account of the complete recognition of who Jesus was. So if God gave them the same gift as he gave us, who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could oppose God? - Acts 11:17 NIV From this point forward, the apostles and the writers of inspired letters used the label Lord Jesus Christ. For the two thousand years of history since that time, the brand has continued to be revered. That name is a summation of everything you can know about Who Is This God ? The final curtain The last book of the anthology of Christian religion is called the Revelation or the Apocalypse. The name implies there are things to be uncovered, unveiled, or revealed. The first comment in the book begins with the anointed man Jesus. It affirms that God has communicated with him. Then it avers that the information is for those who serve with Jesus. The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to show unto his servants... - Revelation 1:1 What a powerful observation. It goes on to proclaim a blessing, favor, or prosperity. The encouragement is to those that read or hear the words and do the things written in it. The final chapter comes to a close. In the final scenes, it reveals the trinity relationship of God. The three components of the name of Jesus are also noted. In verse 16, Jesus is talking. In verse 17, the Spirit is influencing. In verse 18, God is emotionally warning.

One other passage summarizes the power that is associated with it. There is a special beauty of this affirmation.

Seed is an old euphemism for offspring or progeny. In each case, the promise is that a descendent will overcome some circumstance. These are all culminated in the birth of the Messiah. The first promise starts at the Garden of Eden. Six of the prophecies are in the book of beginnings, Genesis. The seventh is the crowning event; it is the promise for the son of David, the King. Two forecasts have to do with prophecy of the birth. Then the ultimate prediction was for the final regent of the universe. At the Garden of Eden, the relationship between humans and the enemy serpent was defined. The offspring of the woman was to eventually be the Messiah.

"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 Genealogy 101 - Pre-deluge 99 The first account is the book of Adam in Genesis 5. This is the record of the first mortal man with his fallibility. The second account is the book of Jesus Christ in Matthew 1. It is the record of immortal man and his perfection. Because there is so much of human tradition to cover, it will be broken into three chapters. This chapter is primarily involved with establishing the common lineage of all mankind up to the deluge. The next chapter will address the human family up to the separation into language groups. The succeeding chapter will address the Semitic language group with focus on the king line. The initial heritage is documented in Genesis 5. The book is a record of the history following Adam. It is not a detailed account of his origins. Nevertheless, there is a nugget overview of the genesis of Adam. God created man in the likeness of God. Male and female were created. God blessed them and called his name Adam. This is from the Hebrew word for mankind or ruddy (adam, 120) . Adam was the very first recorded human. What about ages The ages given in the traditional translation have been critically analyzed. Critics often treat the extended times as myth or legend. However, other archaeological records give exceedingly long life to kings during the same era. The Weld-Blundell Prism contains a very detailed list of monarchs including eight antediluvian kings who reigned over lower Sumeria. These Mesopotamian kings had a rule very similar to the period of the Noah timing. The lifetime of the Genesis patriarchs seems very compatible with contemporary extra-biblical records. There appears to be a correspondence between these Sumerian rulers and the patriarchs that preceded the deluge. The average lifetime is even shorter after the flood, just as in the Genesis account. "},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"100 Who Is This God?  Durham Regardless of the timing, it is apparent that people lived for a very extended time before the deluge. One theory is called the ìCanopyî or ìGreenhouseî effect. This proposes that the earth was covered with a water vapor canopy. The vapor shielded the earth from ultraviolet rays and other space phenomenon. The canopy provided a climatic controlled environment, which aided phenomenal growth. The shell burst to provide part of the floodwaters. After the flood, the lifetime began to decay until a steady state value of 70 years was reached during the time of David. Ussher in time A second criticism challenges using the sum of the ages to arrive at elapsed time. Ussher, an early theologian, used this method to establish Adam near an estimated 4004 BC. The primary argument pitched against this dating is the use of the word begat. Some argue the word can be used for an immediate offspring as well as for grandchildren. This seems to be a tedious argument. I Chronicles 1 gives a similar list to that given in Genesis. There are a few name differences. However, they are not sufficient to disregard the sequence in both accounts. The discussion must also consider the Matthew 1 account. The pattern of 14 generations between major events is well established in verse 17. So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations. - Matthew 1:17 No practices should be built on these calculations. Nevertheless, the pattern is intriguing enough to lend credence to the completeness of the genealogy.

No other document has that credibility. The spitting image What do people look like? Seth looked like his dad. That is not surprising. And AdamÖbegat a son in his own likeness, after his image; - Genesis 5:3 But consider the declaration about his dad in the sentence just prior to this observation. The same comment is made. Adam looked like God. Period. What does God look like? People! ÖGod created man, in the likeness of God created he him. - Genesis 5:1 This is radical theology to some. Arguments that are more esoteric have God as some ethereal creature. That rendition is used since God is superior to all created beings. There is no argument about that fact. Nevertheless, the record is clear that people look just like God. A theophany is a representation of God in human form. There are several records of an encounter with a theophany throughout the Old Testament. Every account clearly illustrates the human likeness. For whom the bell tolls Adam lived and he died.

He had the potential for immortality. But he chose instant gratification and mind-expanding experiences. The fallibility of his body was passed to his progeny. The finality of the experience is shown for the remaining characters in the play of life. Each was born, gave birth to children, lived a long life, and died. As we investigate the history, not all descendants are discussed. Only those that are significant to the line of the Messiah are maintained. This is, in reality, the book of the forefathers of Jesus Christ. A notable exception There are three notable exceptions to the life cycle, Enoch, Elijah, and Moses. Enoch walked with God. Enoch was the seventh generation from the creation in the line of Seth. This corresponded with Lamech I, the son of Methushael in the family of Cain, one of Adamís other sons. And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him. - Genesis 5:24 What a contrast between Enoch and Lamech I. Lamech I was patently evil. According to his own account, he deserved a greater magnitude of punishment than what Cain received. Enoch lived a normal, mortal life just like others. He was born, fathered children, and lived for a total of 365 years. However, he was different. He walked with God. He did not die but simply walked into the next life. This only happened explicitly to one other person, Elijah. Compare the record in the chronicles of the kings.

He may have simply walked on across, since he was seen at the Mount of Transfiguration. Contrast Deuteronomy 34:6 with Matthew 17:3. So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.

He was the seventh patriarch in the family line. The number seven is associated with completeness or perfection. Then Enoch would represent perfect of mankind. This is fascinating considering his ancestry. The numerics also indicate his life was a watershed event. The Hall of Fame in the ancient chronicles is described in Hebrews 11. This record gives a more detailed account of the character of Enoch. By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God. - Hebrews 11:5 He was translated, which means he did not see death.

Perhaps, but it would not be in the same way. Nevertheless, we can definitely have a pleasing relationship according to the next stanza. Without faith, it is impossible to please him: for he that comes to God must believe that he is, and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. - Hebrews 11:6 Ancient of ancients Methuselah was the son of Enoch. All the days of Methuselah were 969 years. His dad was not around as long as some other parents. In contrast, according to the record, Methuselah lived to be older than any other person. Nevertheless, he too died the way of Adam. His name literally means when he is dead, it shall be sent. This is a promise of God that he would hold off the flood and judgment as long as Methuselah lived. He outlived his father and his son. He lived 782 years after his son Lamech II was born. All the days of Lamech II were 777. Lamech II was a son of Methuselah and the father of Noah. Obviously, he was in the surviving, more moral line of people before the deluge. Is there a reason that Lamech II lived the unusual span of years that he did? First, the number of years is interesting. He lived for three sevens or 777 years. If seven represents perfection, and three represents the trinity, then Lamech IIís years are phenomenal. The end of his life is the culmination of a dispensation of Godís relationship with mortals. Preparation for a new beginning We find that Lamech II lived 595 years after his son Noah was born. Methuselah lived 5 years longer than his son Lamech II.

Tradition tells that it started raining on the day he died. His name was most appropriate. The human race began with Adam. After the Garden episode, there was another beginning with different insights in a different world. Noah had constructed a vessel before the deluge. The boat was to carry the third beginning of the human race with all the living, just people. To give a complete new start, the vessel also contained two samples of each type animal, and seven of each species that was suitable for food. Therefore, it was necessary for all the past to be left behind. Lamech II died five years before the flood. Methuselah died immediately before the deluge began. Therefore, the complete family was in the Ark. What an exciting, complete plan! Noahís name translates he shall comfort us. Lamech II attributed his personal toil or work with the curse on the ground. Noah was seen as a release from the struggle. It was revealed to Lamech II that Noah would be part of a great change. Noahís family was the only moral people on the earth at this time. An ancient history record, the chronicles of Jasher, is referenced in Joshua and II Samuel. Jasher 5:15 identifies Noahís wife as Naamah. Noah fathered three sons, Japheth, Ham, and Shem. Then Noah took the three daughters of Eliakim, son of Methuselah, for wives for his sons (Jasher 5:35). These were cousins of the young men. Shemís bride was Sedeqetelebab. Noahís three sons followed in the fatherís religion, tradition, and work. These would be the start of a new life, a new race, a new civilization. The tolerance and grace of a perfect Creator is revealed again. We cannot foresee what is coming.

His principles were based on the true, moral precepts of the Creator. Noah trained his progeny to walk in the right way. They followed his values even during the time there was evil all around.

And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat (780) . - Genesis 8:4 The same word Ararat (780) is also translated as Armenia (780) .

They met the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers and traveled down toward the Persian Gulf. The rivers provided direction, an easy path, water, food, and protection. Without outside influences, this was a reasonable progress for the tribe. Historically, the Tigris and Euphrates valley has been considered the cradle of civilization. Traditional archaeology has traced the roots of all the major cultures to this region. This correlates well with the Genesis account. The boat landing is at the top of the Fertile Crescent.

There, the crescent intercepts the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"108 Who Is This God?  Durham rivers. These then extend across ancient Babylon to the Persian Gulf. The family traveled and settled in the plain of Shinar, located in modern Iraq. Apparently, Noah in time made his home on the gulf coast at Fara, according to the tradition of Josephus. The deposits from the river deltas have filled in the upper end of the gulf. Therefore, the settlements are now about 200 miles inland. After the flood, all the earth was populated from Noahís sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Rather than race, perhaps the easiest way to categorize people groups is by language. From this family came the major language groups. This is obvious if the name of the descendants is allocated to the countries the people founded. People lived for almost 1000 years. Their childbearing age was hundreds of years. Therefore, in a very few generations, a large number of people would result. Why the tree Why would this family list be given in such detail? The early genealogy is common for all the descendants on the planet. After the time of the separation of the land and languages, only one family is carried through. This is the royal family of the Messiah. The list is uniquely accurate and complete. There is no parallel in other histories. Those generally are restricted to a report about only their culture. This record gives the relationship of all cultures. Other histories begin with a mythological story. This record is about a family that has been preserved through time.

The name of the city has become associated with confusion after the separation of the languages. Human government Noahís grandson Nimrod was premier of the city of Babel according to Genesis 10. The Septuagint , the traditional Greek translation of the Hebrew Torah , called him a giant. He evidently carried dominant genes from the people described in Genesis 6. The account also says he challenged God. That rebellion was part of the Babel debacle. Mythology has fables about giants that built mountains to challenge the gods. The gods then came and blew away the monuments. Mythology is stories that were often based on facts but were altered by various telling of the tales. Nimrod was regarded as a mighty hunter. This is significant since the term had not been used up to this time. Various writers have attempted to infer the significance of the word hunter (tsayid, 6718) . In addition to its traditional meaning, it is often used for one who preys on another. It can range from murder to only oppression. History shows that most kingdoms are established and maintained by the abuse of people. The beginning of his kingdom is the first reference to human government. Before this time, a patriarch who maintained family values and integrity managed the clans or tribes. Establishment of a city kingdom removed the family responsibility and authority. A new common authority, the king, replaced family structure. Archaeology and history Numerous ancient historians and tablets record the events of the tower of Babel.

The Targums of Jonathan ben Uzziel and Targums of Jerusalem declare the tower was for idolatrous worship. Nebuchadnezzar restored and beautified the tower, and it was dedicated to the sun god, Bel. It is unnecessary to use secular events to verify the Scriptural accounts. However, critics often try to discredit the religious record as unscientific or myths. When archaeology and other recorded history have related accounts, it can be used as correlation. Notice the etymology between the godís name and the name of the city. Bel was also the god of fertility and sexual expression. His worship often involved licentious acts. A later chapter will deal with him and other false gods. Because of their impious religious practices, the city fell into ruins. The clans separated into different regions. According to tradition, the patriarch Noah for some time lived at Fara. It is located in the delta between the Tigris and Euphrates. Noah is also linked with Fo Hi (Fu Hsi) or Yao, the first emperor of China, as well as the patriarch of other societies. People were scattered from the city of Babel. However, the site was not abandoned. A latter group rebuilt the area to the south as Babylon. Babylon then progressed to become one of the long-term world empires. Present day Baghdad on the Tigris River is only 50 miles away from ancient Babylon.

Shem, Ham, and Japheth Linguists divide languages into three major classifications - Semitic, Hamitic, and Japhetic. The language groups correspond to the descendants of Noah and the areas they settled. The Semitic languages are primarily located in southwestern Asia in the area of the Middle East. These include Assyrian, Aramaic, Hebrew, and Arabic. The Hamitic languages are located in Africa and East Asia. These include Coptic, ancient Libyan, modern Berber, and Cushitic of east Africa.

Other authorities have made different judgments for a few names and locations. Nevertheless, the variations are not adequate to create fundamental changes in understanding.

These cannot be considered derivatives since the accounts predate Judeo-Christian contact and often have contrary ethics. As would be expected, the migration of the East is less well-known in Western history. The common names to Western culture are based on the Greek, but these were sometimes distorted. The monikers were spelled and pronounced differently in their respective tongues and changed when translated. The original groups were people who had direct contact with each other. Note also that after the first generation, the names are actually tribes rather than individuals. For example, words ending in ite are a people group and words ending in im indicate plurals.

One location for part of the Japhetic tribe was the isles of the Gentiles. The location has caused some conjecture. Certain authors think it refers to the various nations. Others think it may actually refer to islands. Particularly it is sometimes assumed to refer to the British Isles and the isles of the Mediterranean. The Japhetic people were explorers, conquerors, and developers. Part of the tribe eventually established a long history in Iran and the India sub-continent.

This group remained in the area in which the family had settled. The other two groups traveled. However, part of the Hamitic family stayed nearby in the region. These became intertwined with part of the Semitic family. The relationship between Shem and Semitic is simply a different pronunciation in northern and southern Hebrew. The only difference in the two spellings is a single dot that differentiates the letters sin and shin . Shem was the great grandfather of Eber. Eber means the other side or across. It may refer to those beyond the river Euphrates or the archaeology site Habiru. His name was used to identify the language of the Hebrews.

Again, the language group can be categorized by the later derivatives. Many scholars argue that the original, common language was Chaldean and similar to Hebrew. Although that cannot be verified, it is a reasonable expectation. The Hebrew language was maintained in use until the demise of the nation of Israel and the dispersion of the people about 150 AD, under the Roman Empire. The language was fast becoming a dead language. It was only maintained in written form and by merging with other tongues such as Chaldean and Yiddish, which is a mix of Hebrew with German. As various empires took over the Middle East, their languages were used in the region. Eliezer Ben-Yehuda resurrected Hebrew in the early twentieth century. It was restored to common use when the nation of Israel was reestablished in 1948. Table 5: Shem Countries Son 2 3 4 5 Area Elam Sushan, E.

All for one and one for all It is fascinating that modern linguistics organize language structures in three major categories. These even use the name of the sons of Noah. The structure of languages gives further credence to the accuracy of the chronicle. These languages and family relationships divide all the people of the earth from a common start. The beauty and order of languages should provoke an appreciation of the human condition. The sounds of a foreign language appear as incoherent noise. However, the mother tongue is music to the ear of a listener. Cacophony (disharmony) to one is elegant order to another. The hand of an overriding power is so readily apparent in language. The order and recognition of a shared thread points to a common beginning. The Hebrew journal is the most rational explanation for this phenomenal characteristic. Pangaea Peleg, a great-great grandson, was born during the lifetime of Noah. His name simply means to divide. The chronicles affirm that during his days the earth was divided. It is generally claimed that comment refers to the separation of the language groups at Babel.

It also explains why similar records of civilization are around the world. These include stories, myths, religious practices, and ancient architecture. Compare the Inca culture of South America with the Egyptian culture of the Nile. These are very similar and appear to be almost contemporary. Is there a complementary possibility? There is general agreement among scientists that all the landmass of the earth was once connected. This super continent was called Pangaea. Then the earth began shifting and separating in a process called plate tectonics. The earth plates moving further apart would explain some historical phenomenon. The Middle East is the intersection of some of the most active tectonic regions of the earth. In other areas, the present rate of motion for the North Atlantic is at 1.25 inches per year. The East Pacific region is moving at 7î per year. These rates are not constant, but indicate the dynamic nature of the Earthís crust. Others contend the separation of Pangaea would have occurred much earlier. This could have been a result of the inundation of the continent. However, the name description appears unique and the circumstances of a global migration tend to fit a later severance of the landmass. Time and again Dates of archaeological events are subject to substantial conjecture. These are generally based on the type of pottery or other implements found during excavations. If a written record is found with the implements, it may be correlated to a similar event in another culture. This circuitous method leaves considerable room for variations in time. Besides, societies seldom record events associated with other cultures, unless it is a victory over them. An era or age is used to describe the archaeological layers.

There were metal implements used by the Cain civilization prior to the flood. However, different clans that live during the same time would obviously not have the same lifestyle and tools. All these variations add to the confusion of establishing dates. Equally professional archaeologists and anthropologists will set dates several hundreds of years apart. The earliest verifiable dates are approximately 2000 BC in every major culture. Any dates prior to this time are selected based on the biases of the numerologist. Another point of confusion is the length of time recorded in various translations. For example, the Greek Septuagint uses somewhat different numbers for the years of Shemís descendants. Because of the divergence, no theology should be built on the dates. Nevertheless, they can provide insight into the sequence of events. The relationships between people can also be discerned. Conscientious theologians and archaeologists either explain away the time accounts or accept them as factual. An independent council developed the longest surviving English translation, the Authorized Version. The King authorized and provided for the council. These gentlemen of dissimilar heritage came to agreement. The consensus was based on the evaluation of numerous earlier records. The process gives as much credibility to the translation as can be reasonably expected. This is not to discredit other good works with different genealogical times. The ages of the early patriarchs are shown in Table 7. The year of the world origin is Anno Mundi (AM) from Latin. The year of birth is calculated from this start of time. The beginning is based on the initiation of Adam. The age of the father at the birth of his succeeding son is recorded. The age at demise is also reported. The year of his demise is calculated from the initial era. All these data are based on the Authorized Version. A tabulation of the date of birth is also represented in BC.

Durham in time either way would only shift some dates by about 600 years. That actually is quite close for such tentative data. All calendars have some variations, since there have been many adjustments over the eons. In addition, virtually all calendars are based on either the solar cycle, the lunar or Metonic cycle of the Greeks, or the Roman indiction or tax cycle. The solar cycle is 28 years, the Metonic cycle is 19 years, and the Roman indiction is 15 years. Therefore, correlations are tedious at best. If there were no changes, the cyclic convergence of these would be (28 x 19 x 15) = 7980 years. A French mathematician Joseph Justus Scaliger developed the Julian period and correlated the cycles to have an initial time of Anno Mundi at 4713 BC. With all the variations, this is definitely within range of Ussherís dates. Coming of age A very interesting pattern is noted in the ages of the patriarchs. Prior to the deluge, all people lived about the same length of time. At the inundation, the life expectancy was cut in half. There is another slice in half after the separation of the people. The next reduction by half was before the time of Moses, when the span became 120 years. Before the deluge, this was set as the projected life expectancy of the human race. There is no apparent reason that people cannot live to this age. Then the LORD said, my Spirit will not contend with man forever, for he is mortal; his days will be a hundred and twenty years. - Genesis 6:3 NIV Nevertheless, life expectancy continued to deteriorate to the steady value of about seventy years. The condition had been reached before 1000 BC, when the king recorded his observation.

The result is additional indication that the sequence of dates has validity. Mythology and Melchizadek Noah had no children after the flood. He was 600 years old when the deluge began and was 601 years old when the waters dried up. History asserts he lived 350 years after the flood. The elapsed time to each new generation is given as well as the total life span of the patriarch. And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.

Notice he came out of the flood and he outlived the next nine generations, with the exception of Eber. That would make him appear immortal. Another brother, Japheth, became a god in the history and mythology of many Europeans. His name was slightly different in the various cultures, but close inspection shows the trend. The Romans called him Jove or Japater, which transliterates to Jupiter. To the Greeks, he was Iapheth. In two India societies, he was Prajapaty and Jyapeti. To the Turks he was Yafith. In Israel, he was Joffa. To the Saxons he was Iafeth. The third brother, Ham, became a god of the African culture.

After the separation of the people, language began to change. Diverse cultures developed and various religious influences infiltrated the lifestyles. A single language family is the focus of the remainder of the preserved writ. This is not surprising. If people were isolated and used different languages, it would be impractical to expect a common history. The recorded history is that of the Hebrew language family.

One of the amazing observations is that all the major progenitors were very fallible. Numerous had sexual infidelities. That caused substantial problems for them and their families. Nevertheless, the perfect man came from this line. Another phenomenon is related to the Middle Eastern culture. In that environment, the first-born son inherits the family fortune and title. However, the Messianic line did not always remain in the first- born line. The first four generations from Abraham were not from the oldest son.

His heirs were Abram, Nahor, and Haran. The family of these guys forms the keystone of the remainder of the Genesis annals. From Genesis the story goes on to the King. Haran predeceased his father. Nevertheless, a city- state was named for Haran. He had a daughter Milcah who married his brother Nahor. He also had a son Lot, who would become a central player in the family of Abram. Abramís wife was Sarai. There is affirmation she was the daughter of his father, but not his mother. And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. - Genesis 20:12 Josephus, the ancient secular historian, further affirms she was the sister of Milcah and Lot. This would still fit the language of Genesis. Hence, she was a half-sister or more likely the niece of Abram. Sarai, a most notable lady, was barren until she was 90 years old. Terah began a migration from Ur of Chaldea up the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers toward Canaan. He took Abram, Abramís wife Sarai, and his grandson Lot. Notwithstanding, the journey came to a halt in Haran (Padanaram) where Terah died. A new dispensation Using the dates given in the common English chronicle, Abram was born 292 years after the flood.

In a similar vein, his spouseís name was changed from Sarai to Sarah. With Abraham, the dispensation of relations to the Almighty changed from the flood mentality of Noah. Abraham continued the migration into Canaan that his father had started. There he built an altar to God. He was given a promise of inheritance for that country. His migration continued on to Egypt. He allowed the king to take Sarah to be one of his wives. The relationship was never consummated because of numerous conflicts. Regardless of the peccadillo between his wife and the king of that country, he became a man of tremendous wealth. Abraham took his wife and nephew Lot back to Canaan. He became a huge rancher with a large staff. Nevertheless, he did not have an heir. At eighty-six years old, he felt he might have to leave his empire to a servant. In an agreement with his wife, he fathered a child with a young maid Hagar from the Ham lineage. This first-born son was Ishmael. When he was 99 and Sarah was 89, they were promised a son by a theophany, a physical manifestation of God. In the next year, a young son, Isaac, was born. He received the promise of the fatherís inheritance in land and the Messianic line. Conflict developed between the two boys. Sarah forced Abraham to send Hagar and her son away from the home. However, we find later that they did not travel far. Ishmael married and fathered 12 sons. These became the fathers of major segments of Arabic culture. Their claim to the inheritance of the land of their father, Abraham, is based on the first-born rights. This conflict continues to this day in the Middle East.

Abraham was buried in the cave of Machpelah that he had bought for his wife Sarah. His first- born son, Ishmael, and the son of his inheritance, Isaac, took care of the final rest for their father. Isaac Abraham sent an emissary to his homeland to obtain a wife for his son Isaac. He found Rebecca, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahorís son, whom Milcah bore unto him. From our earlier observation, Rebecca was a cousin of Isaac. Like his father, Isaac allowed the same peccadillo between his wife and the king. Nevertheless, the marriage was protected. Rebecca had twins, Esau and Jacob. Esau, the oldest, sacrificed his inheritance to his brother for a bowl of soup. When he recovered his senses, he was very angry. To add insult to injury, Jacob stole the family blessing from his father through trickery. In the culture, the oldest son would inherit the major portion of the family fortune. He would become the new patriarch of the family business. This inheritance was called the birthright. In addition, the father would proclaim a blessing on the sons. This blessing was his vision of the potential of the progeny. It was a verbal proclamation for the success of the heir.

Therefore, Isaac sent him to his motherís brother Laban. Jacob fell in love with Labanís younger daughter Rachael. He worked for 7 years to earn her hand in marriage.

After some time, his oldest son Er married Tamar. Unfortunately, Er was killed while still a young man. In the ancient tradition, a brother was obligated to marry the widow. The offspring of the union would be allocated to the deceased brother. Judah promised that his young son, Shelah, would marry Tamar when he was mature. In the interim, Tamar returned to her fatherís house. When the young man was grown, Judah did not keep his promise. In the process of time, Judahís wife had passed from this life.

In contrast to his grandfather and father, Rehoboam lost the major portion of the kingdom. He retained only the tribe of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin in the southern kingdom. The remaining 10 tribes formed the northern confederacy called Israel. That nation installed a new king, Jeroboam. Most of the kings in both countries were unremarkable. One thing to note is the names are spelled differently in various accounts. The next generations after Rehoboam were Abia, then, Asa, then Josophat. He was followed by Joram. There the northern and southern kingdoms experienced a marriage between the children of the regents. A particularly vile king of Israel, Ahab, had a very evil queen, Jezebel. Her name declares she was a priestess of the false god, Baíal or Bel. Their daughter Athaliah was married to King Joram of Judah. This created a very traditional alliance between kingdoms.

The daughter married Jehoiakin, in the royal line. Together they had several children including a son, Salthiel. Salthiel was married, but demised before childbirth. According to custom, a brother was to take the childless widow. He would then"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"138 Who Is This God?  Durham bring up children for the departed. Hence, Salthielís half-brother, Pediah apparently married his widow. With this, the line of Jehoikim ended as forecast. However, the title of the kingship was legitimately passed on as if it were Salthielís. Hence, the royal line of David was actually perpetuated through the bloodline. This is important to the Messiah. His natural manhood came through the bloodline. Therefore, the actual relationship to King David was intact. Zerubbabel was the descendent from this rather contorted merging of the lines. He also had a brother, Shimei. Zerubbabel is listed as the son of Salthiel in the royal line. He is also listed as the grandson of Neri in the bloodline. Both are legally correct. His name is in bold on both lists. Zerrubabbel fathered two sons and a daughter, Shelomith. She married Rhesa. From that point, the family tree carries his name. Royal line to Joseph This royal line never resided on the throne. It persisted through a series of not notable names. These were Abiud, Eliakim, Azor, Sadoc, Achim, Eliud, Eleazer, Matthan, and Jacob. The culmination was with Joseph, the husband of Mary. Jesus was Josephís legal son. Hence, he was entitled to the inheritance of the crown of King David. Throughout his adult ministry, he was frequently referred to by the epithet, Son of David.

They were followed by Amos, Mattathia, Joseph, Janna, Melchi, Levi, Matthat, and Heli. Heli or Eli was apparently the father of Mary. In the early records the name of women were seldom used, but rather the name of the husband was recorded. That is not unlike ladies today taking on the family name of the husband. Jesus received his natural bloodline through his mother Mary. The annals have traced his ancestry back to Adam. Another moniker that Jesus accepted in his ministry was the Son of Man.

These changes are often called dispensations. These are used to categorize the history of mankind and his relation to the Creator. A brief review of the periods of human understanding is in order. 1.

In the Hebrew philosophy, the identities are not isolated. God, just as man, always has all three emotional, physical, and mental relationships involved. It is just that in our Western, Greek type rationale, we tend to categorize and isolate. Therefore, one characteristic appears stronger in some relationships. Hence during different eras of human history, one tends to dominate. "},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"142 Who Is This God?  Durham The first research was on the emotional will that is called God. In the analysis of that relationship, we looked at the names, attributes, and character traits. The emotional will was the predominant interaction between God and man during the Old Testament. The second inquiry was into the physical person realizable with the senses. In the analysis, we looked at the names, ministry, and genealogy of Jesus, who formed the pivotal event of history. Traditional Western calendars were realigned to use the physical realization of God as the starting point. The duration of the physical identity was predominantly active for only 33 years. The third study of God has moved into prominence and has remained there for two millennia. The mental faculty is the primary avenue to activity between God and man at this time. Always there From the beginning of creation to the end of the chronicles, the Spirit is involved. And the Spirit (ruwach, 7307) of God moved upon the face of the waters. - Genesis 1:2 This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to marry to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit (pneuma, 4151) . - Matthew 1:18 NIV And the Spirit (pneuma, 4151) and the bride say, Come. And let him that hears say, Come. And let him that is thirsty come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. - Revelation 22:17 These references illustrate the range of activity of the Spirit.

These writings occurred over a very long period, approximately 1500 years. The scribes came from different backgrounds, educations, and cultures. Regardless of the diversity of the authors, all the documents reflect the same principles. The practices of the writers were many, but the principles were consistent. This reliability is because of the unifying intellectual influence of the Spirit. That is the reason the document has lasted through over two thousand years. Protector When researching the Spirit of God, we find there are many actions. In analyzing these verbs, it appears that one noun best expresses the spectrum of ideas.

Positive attitude There are many spirits, but only one Holy Spirit. In a later chapter, we will investigate various spirits in depth. For now, we will only look at the division between the Holy Spirit and malevolent spirits. All good things come from God. Therefore, evil or bad things are from the adversary. Faith is the key to positive expectation. The major negative spirits are fear and doubt. These prevent people from accomplishing their potential. Therefore, a positive attitude is from the Holy Spirit. Likewise, a negative attitude is under the influence of evil spirits.

The negative restriction does not expel but it is an opposition to the Spirit. This is an action of going against the natural laws established by the Almighty. In some usages, this going against is called sin. By this deed, the person accepts the consequences when he violates the way the system was designed. Control model The standard model for a control system illustrates the impact of a positive or negative mental, spirit state. A stimulus causes an emotion to move forward. The emotion promotes a physical response. The mental process analyzes the response and feedback controls the emotion. The control may be positive reinforcement, which causes the physical response to grow. Or it may be a negative signal, which causes the physical reaction to deteriorate. stimulus +/- physical mental emotional"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"146 Who Is This God?  Durham The emotion or will is the only element necessary during the birth of a response. As the system matures, the emotion has less influence. It is the mental feedback that multiplies growth by repetitive addition. When a person is controlled by the spirit, he has a positive attitude or feedback. That causes positive growth. When a person grieves the spirit, he has a negative attitude or feedback that causes destruction. As we have seen, a person has a choice under the natural laws governing human behavior. He can choose to make the positive decision, and have the rewards. Or he can choose to take the negative, and suffer the consequences. He is not forced into a decision. That freedom of choice is one of the greatest capacities given to mankind. Change of control There is a moment that a person concedes that Lord Jesus, the Christ is the ultimate guide, master, and teacher. It is in either this life or the next. In this life, the person is then under the influence of the Holy Spirit. This is referred to as receiving the Spirit. It does not necessarily mean being under the complete control of the intellect of God. As that feedback from the Almighty becomes more positive, people grow and they become filled with the Spirit. The positive feedback implies there is a positive assent to Godís control. If one rejects that influence, he quenches then grieves the Spirit. The relinquishing of influence to the Spirit of God is called conversion or change of control. The influence of the Spirit is very personal.

It means born in a physical sense and in a positive mental sense. The word baptism has caused much consternation among students of theology. It is a transliteration of the Greek word baptizo (907) . The early English translators did not have a similar concept, so they brought over the word intact. Dr. Strong gave various shades of meaning to the original word translated as baptism: (1) to dip repeatedly, to immerse, to submerge (of vessels sunk), (2) to cleanse by dipping or submerging, to wash, to make clean with water, to wash oneís self, bathe, (3) to overwhelm.

In older English, these were called body, soul, and spirit. Similarly, the ultimate trinity is realized as Jesus the man, God the Almighty, and the Holy Spirit. Now we will further investigate the creative act. During the process, we found that space or heavens (shamayim, 8064) and earth (erets, 776) were created. On the earth, there is a variety of life (chay, 2416) . The visible forms are plant life (siyach, 7880) , animal life (nephesh, 5315) , and human life. Only the later is in communication with the Creator God.

It is the very ordinary word for messenger or minister. The Hebrew term is used 214 times while the Greek is used 186 times in the Anthology. The word spirit is often used interchangeably with angel. The Hebrew word spirit (ruwach, 7307) occurs 378 times while the Greek spirit (pneuma, 4151) appears 385 times. Realms Where is the location of these nonphysical beings? A realm is the sphere or domain where someone resides. We propose to break the universe into three realms - natural, supernatural, and ultranatural. The natural realm is the domicile of physical humans. The supernatural realm is the abode of the spirit arena. The ultranatural realm is the place of the Creator, God of the universe. The critical thing to realize is all the realms exist in and overlay the same space. However there is a barrier between the realms that is one-directional. Beings in a lower realm cannot move up. They are restricted in their sphere of influence. However, higher realm occupants can move down. By this understanding, mankind cannot have contact with the higher realms using the natural senses. However, the residents of the supernatural realm can be involved with things of the natural. This premise keeps an untouchable arena for the Creator that no spirit or physical being can penetrate. However, since God is a Spirit, he does have a place in the supernatural. "},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"152 Who Is This God?

"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Chapter 15 Angels - Spirits of Another Kind 153 The medieval theologians had nine categories; Dr. Billy Graham had ten. The traditional hierarchy of angels is ranked from lowest to highest into the following orders: angels, archangels, principalities, powers, virtues, dominions, thrones, cherubim, and seraphim. Dr. Graham changed the middle five to the six principalities, authorities, powers, thrones, might, and dominion. Other writers combine the middle group to rulers and powers with the powers being the army for the rulers. From our analysis, these could be restructured reasonably. Since the order is not specifically spelled out in one place, the categories are somewhat conjecture. By no stretch of the imagination, do we presume to have a unique insight. However, with present research, there seems to be an alternative match. The hosts fit into three branches ñ personal, relations, and service. These functions have the same triad relationships that we have observed throughout the Holy Writ. Personal is an internal characteristic involving only one individual. Relations are an external or horizontal quality that engages multiple people. Deity service is the vertical feature that entails interaction with Almighty Yehovah. Each of the branches has chiefs with the majority as troops. Archangels and angels are in the personal system that interacts with human spirits. Rulers and powers comprise the relations component. Cherubim and seraphim are in service to God. The rank within each branch would not necessarily translate to another division. For example, a military general has little influence in a judgeís civilian court.

An angel or spirit appears to be associated with every relations position of leadership and influence. There are angels for coaches, supervisors, and every political position. This listing is simply to identify that the whole earth has order and structure. It also illustrates that everything we humans do is tied back to angelic or spirit influence. Daniel, a prime minister under four kings, records one dramatic example. It illustrates that angels are intricately involved in government affairs. It also shows the power that is exercised when we request help from God. Daniel, since the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to them.

From Danielís encounter, we find there are both helpful and restrictive princes. Notice that Michael is one of the chief princes. Obviously there are other chiefs in the host of angels.

This appears to be the highest order or class. They have that special association and power from having the confidence of the highest official, God. These are similar to executive staff and guards. The singular cherub is used on 30 occasions and the plural cherubim are utilized in 65 instances. In current English the plural is often cherubs. Cherubim guarded the entrance to the Garden of Eden until the deluge destroyed the site.

Unusual beings are described on other occasions. Because of their features, they seem to fit in the deity service classification. It is not very clear whether they are cherub or seraph. However, the only incidence of seraphim is at the throne in the account by Isaiah. Therefore, these other images are likely cherubim. An ancient prophet about 2500 years ago described a vision of things to come in the future.

Personal branch In the personal branch that interacts with humans, there are only two titles, angel and archangel. Most of the spirits tend to fit into this multitude. The word angel is used 201 times and the plural is employed 94 times. In fact, the group is often called the host. But even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a slanderous accusation against him, but said, The Lord rebuke you! - Jude 9 NIV The next way to identify angels is by names of what they do. Numerous picturesque identities are applied to these most unusual creatures. Some of these are ministering spirits, watchers, sons of God, chariots of God, holy ones, and miracles. Other designations are associated with astronomical bodies. These names are heavenly bodies and morning stars. Named ones All the angelic beings apparently have names.

The third is Lucifer, which appears to refer to a guardian cherub. This would have placed him in the very presence with the ear and confidence of the Almighty. It appears that he was similar to a Chief of Staff. This position effectively has the power of his boss. The guardian was created to have the highest authority in the cherub organization. However, his pride and desire for power led him to revolt. At that point, he lost the rights to his name. Deuterocanonical In some circles, another angel has a name.

The word derivative means fallen one. They were called heroes; another term is Titans. The entire concept of supermen can be traced to this account. It appears much of Greek, Roman, and Norse mythology was derived from this report. The time frame of the verse is just prior to the deluge of Noah. It was the conflict over these unnatural beings that brought on the flood and the resulting destruction of the contaminated race of humans. Note the reference also alludes to another event afterwards. The second time the word Nephilim is used is to describe the sons of Anak.

For you have made him but little lower than God (Elohiym, 430) , and crowned him with glory and honor. You made him to have dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet: - Psalm 8:5-6 ASV Regardless of their remarkable status, they wanted more. In the supernatural realm they had a spirit abode (oiketerion, 3613) . Without a physical body, they could not experience many things. In that region, they could not participate in sexual activity. However, when they saw the beautiful earth women, they opted to take them on. Furthermore, by also having the supernatural realm power, they would appear to the mortals as gods.

In addition to the obvious context, there is precedent for this assertion. Daniel records an event regarding the prince of Persia. This also refers to Michael as a prince. It is apparent this is a euphemism for angels. But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia. - Daniel 10:13 There are several intriguing ideas observed in the declaration recorded by Isaiah.

The Hebrew term (sheol, 7585) is used 65 times in the Old Testimony. Sheol is variously called the underworld, grave, hell, or pit. The Greek term (gehenna, 1067) is used 12 times in the New Record. This was the valley of Hinnom, below Jerusalem. It was the garbage pit where filth and dead animals were burned in a continuous fire. Another Greek term (hades, 86) is used 11 times as the equivalent of sheol. Hades was another name for Pluto the god of the lower regions. The location is also associated with Orcus or the nether world. That is a dark and dismal place in the very depths of the earth. The site is the common abode of disembodied spirits and the wicked. A similar place exists in the religion and mythology of virtually every culture. Since creation was completed before the revolt, it appears this location was part of creation. But why would such a place exist in a perfectly created world? The description matches our present scientific understanding of the makeup of the earthís core.

He was the most intelligent and beautiful creature in the realm. One of his dominions was the king of Tyre. This is very similar to the earlier discussion about the king of Babylon and the prince of Persia. Son of man, take up a lament concerning the king of Tyre and say to him: This is what the Sovereign LORD says: You were the model of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone adorned you: ruby, topaz and emerald, chrysolite, onyx and jasper, sapphire, turquoise and beryl. Your settings and mountings were made of gold; on the day you were created, they were prepared. You were anointed as a guardian cherub, for so I ordained you. You were on the holy mount of God; you walked among the fiery stones. You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created till wickedness was found in you. Through your widespread trade you were filled with violence, and you sinned.

Since this entity was in Eden, this obviously is not the physical king of Tyre, but the one that controlled him. The discourse clearly declares that he was created perfect. After he revolted at Eden, his name was changed. The Hebrew term Satan (7854) means adversary. The Greek word diablos (1228) means slanderer and is translated into English as devil. Another Greek word daimon (1142) is the basis for the English demon and is translated devils. Beelzebub (954) , the prince of the devils, is from the Aramaic meaning lord of the flies (fliers). Abaddon (3) was the Hebrew angel of the bottomless pit in Revelation 9:11. In Greek that name was Apollyon (3) . The angel of light became the power of darkness. Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: - Colossians 1:12 Because the angels were rebels from their first realm, they were bound to the one of their choice.

And the angels, which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day. - Jude 6 Chains under darkness indicates they do not have light. Everlasting indicates they do not have a chance to change their ways and return. This is very unlike humans, who can change their allegiance and receive forgiveness.

Although one-third of the angels became demon spirits, two-thirds remained loyal and in the service of the Almighty. The guys in the white hats are twice as numerous.

We will use the Babylonian and Greek gods as an illustration. There are similar stories and structures in virtually every culture. These tales in many ways have likeness to the Holy Writ. The pattern typically falls into a familiar structure. There is a supreme god, but he is not usually the creator. Multiple other deities are associated with nature or parts of life.

There is no redeemer to salvage the mortals into a perfect afterlife. By distorting the reality of the oldest, commonly used record, focus is placed on false deities. This keeps the worshippers in bondage to the fiends. The story of the other gods is oppressive. Unfortunately, many Christians have made the Creator harsh and oppressive. That is not the case when the Spirit is the controlling influence in your life. The Judeo-Christian view of God is the only version that promotes joy, peace, and success. Early time The first challenge came before the Garden of Eden, in the halls of the ancients. The Creator had made a group of beings variously called angels or spirits. Since one third of the Trinity is the Spirit, it is reasonable to expect entities in the spirit realm. These were introduced in the previous chapter. One-third of the angels revolted to set-up an adversarial kingdom where they could be gods on earth. The other two-thirds remained as loyal envoys of the Almighty. This chapter will address two different aspects of the evil empire. First, there are angels who became demons. Because of their super natural power they actually appear as gods to human beings. The second group of players is men who let the malevolent spirits control their thought process. The most visible of these angels were from the relations branch. By this process, the men have the power and influence of the fiends. Their extra natural influence installs some of these men as apparent gods.

What manner of person is this The sons of God saw the daughters of men. Who were the sons of God? Several possibilities can be argued. In the last chapter, we found they are the angels. Some versions of the Septuagint contain the word angels for sons of God. This ancient Greek translation provides a good correlation to use with our English versions. There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown. - Genesis 6:4 There were giants in the earth. Consider next the word that is translated giant. This is the Hebrew word nephilim (5303) . The Septuagint also translates this word as giants. Nevertheless, some scholars prefer to consider these as fierce warriors or heroes. There is considerable basis for this. The end of the verse refers to them as mighty and men of renown. In addition, hero is a concept applied to some of the gods of mythology. However, the root of the word nephilim commonly means fallen one. Our culture tends to dismiss angels and spirits as things from another era or residing in another world. The argument goes, no one has seen an angel or can prove they exist, so they are probably not real. Many things invisible do exist and have profound influence.

It is appropriate to refer to this inexplicable being by the commonly recognizable name of God. The idea of giants is not unique. The concept of supernatural men marrying beautiful mortal women was common in ancient mythology. The demigods resulting from the union carried both the power of the gods and the body of humans. However, the intermarriage resulted in a corruption of both lineages. The resulting offspring were mutants. Regardless of the heritage of the men, they were evil and developed a very evil society. Greek and Roman titans closely parallel the description presented. Since mythology is usually based in some historical fact, it seems the scripture account has further secular correlation. Some would argue that the Genesis account derives from the mythology of the time. The better-documented indications are that mythology was based on the same events. The Genesis account was recorded by the court-trained historian, Moses. History by necessity is written after the fact based on the best evidence available. Mythology tended to be a more oral tradition and as such, it was easily modified with each telling. Nimrod One of the first individuals that became a god was Nimrod. Nimrod, who was emperor of Babel in Chaldea, was also called Ninus, founder of Ninevah in Assyria. Cush was the father of Nimrod, who grew to be a mighty warrior on the earth. He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; that is why it is said, Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the LORD. The first centers of his kingdom were Babylon, Erech, Akkad and Calneh, in Shinar. From that land he went to Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah and Resen, which is between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city. - Genesis 10:8-12 NIV"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"172 Who Is This God?

Is it not interesting that a mortal man was knowingly made a god by his constituents? Mardukís deity was represented in as many as 50 different god names. The deity was called Bel in Babylon, Baal in Canaan, and Cronus in Greek. Notice the etymology of the word between the godís name Bel and the name of the city Baíbel. He was also the god of fertility and sexual expression. His worship often involved licentious acts. Other manifestations included the tradition as Melkarth/Hercules. In extrabiblical accounts, his wife was Semiramis, the great mysterious queen of Assyria. When deified she was called Astarte or Ishtar, the queen of heaven. Semiramis had a son Tammuz. The religious cult of a mother and son became Isis and Osiris of Egypt. The Greeks called them Venus and Adonis. The Latin culture brings them to this day as the queen of heaven and son. Egypt Many of the ancient Egyptian religious practices have parallels in the Babylonian religions. The Egyptian worship customs have been attributed to Nimrodís grandmother, who was the wife of Ham. By a few sources, she was called Zeptah or Egyptus. In ancient language structure, Egyptus is an unusual spelling for a female person. The eldest son of Ham and Zeptah was Pharaoh, who established the first government in the Nile country. Both Egyptian and Babylonian religions have a common basis.

The Greek titans Greek mythology is the most developed that has influence in the Western culture. The first of the gods was Chaos, the great void or primordial lump within the universe. Chaos can refer to the creation, the flood, Ham, or Noah. A great-grandson of Chaos correlates to Nimrod, who was a grandson of Ham. Therefore, it is likely Chaos refers to the flood era principals. "},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"174 Who Is This God?  Durham Chaos had three offspring without a mate. These were Eros (sexual desire), Gaia (mother earth), and Tarturus (the lowest region of the world). Tarturus is below Hades, the place for the dead. The foundation of the Greek legends is Gaia, mother earth. Everything that was came from her. Without a mate, she gave birth to her first- born Uranus (sky), Ourea (mountains) and Pontus (sea). Her son Uranus became her husband and fathered many races. The most notable ethnic group was the godlike giants called titans. The titans were six sons and six daughters of Uranus and Gaia. The twelve titans were the embodiment of the forces of nature. Each son married one of his sisters. The youngest titan, Cronus (harvest), with Rhea (mother of gods) birthed the six Olympian gods. Cronus is the Greek name for the Babylonian god that was King Nimrod. The Olympians included three goddesses and three gods. Demeter was goddess of earth and fertility, while Hera was queen goddess of marriage and birth. Hestia was the virgin goddess of the hearth fire. Hades, Poseidon and Zeus became the rulers of the Olympian universe. The next titan, Iapetus (Japeth), and Themis (justice) produced Atlas, Menoetius, Prometheus and Epimetheus. Themis is the image of a blindfolded woman holding a pair of scales and a cornucopia. She has oracle powers and by her nephew Zeus, she is the mother of the Horae and the Moirae. This goddess is the symbol of the American legal system. Two sets of titans were less notorious. Oceanus (ocean) and Tethys (fertile ocean) had over 3000 offspring such as rivers and springs. Hyperion (before the sun) and Theia procreated Helios (sun), Eos (dawn) and Selene (moon). Another titan, Crius married Mnemosyne (memory). She became mother of the nine Muses by Zeus, her nephew.

Other offspring were the Erinyes, the spirits of punishment. At the request of Gaia (mother earth), Cronus castrated his father Uranus. The Gigantes (monstrous giants) were conceived when his potent blood fell to mother earth. Cronus cast the genitals over his shoulder into the sea. The resulting foam was the birthplace of Aphrodite and nymphs - spirits of nature. The Greek Olympians Zeus led the revolt against his grandfather, Uranus, and the dynasty of his uncles, the titans. When he defeated the titans, he banished them to Tartarus, the lowest region in earth. Once Zeus had total control, he and his Olympian brothers divided the universe. Zeus gained the heavens, Poseidon the sea, and Hades the underworld. Zeus was the supreme god of Mount Olympus and of the pantheon who lived there. As the supreme ruler, he was responsible for the law, justice and morals. Zeus was originally worshiped as a weather deity by the Greek tribes. Zeus had to defend his heavenly kingdom from other uncles. Three separate assaults were from the offspring of Gaia, mother earth. They were the Gigantes, Typhon, and the twins Aloadae. Zeus fought them with his thunderbolt and aegis, a shield from the skin of the divine goat, Amaltheia. As with the titans, Zeus banished them all to Tartarus, below the underworld.

Israel foreigners There are numerous outside gods identified in the Old Testament of the Book. You will notice there are numerous names for the same god. The designation changed with different cultures, languages, and attributes. The most common was Baal (Bamowth, 1120) , a Phonecian phallic deity. His Babylonian-Sumerian name was Marduk, the god name of King Nimrod. The Hebrew rendition of Marduk was Merodach (4781) . Moloch (4428) or Molekh was the entirely malevolent rendition of Baal, to whom children were sacrificed. Baal was called Ashur, as the patron god of Assyria. His wife was Ishtar. Baalís consort was also called Ashtoreth (6253) , Asherah, Anath, or Astarte, a Phoneician goddess of fertility and sex. She is equivalent to the Greek goddess Aphrodite. Beelzebub (954) is the patron god of the Philistines in ancient Palestine. Beelzebub is the prince of evil spirits and the name means lord of the flies (fliers). In Milton's Paradise Lost, he is Satan's chief lieutenant. Belial (1100) is the evil spirit of darkness and godlessness in old Palestine. Belial can also be compared with Satan. Dagon (1712) is an ancient Mesopotamian vegetation god of the Philistines, and father of Baal. Dagon is one of the old gods but his temple at Ashdod existed right up until the time of Jesus. Dagon was portrayed half man and half fish. These characteristics make him appear to be associated with Ham who came out of the flood.

There are indications by some theologians that Lucifer may have originally been assigned to this office. When he revolted to become an earth god, that agency became vacant. When human communication is necessary, the position must be fulfilled. Rather than have an agent perform the function, Yehovah himself took on the role. God is capable of all positions within the universe he created. Hence, the physical person of the Creator was perceptible from time to time. When Yehovah came to earth as Jesus, he was responsible for personal interaction with humans. After he departed the earth, his Spirit returned as a permanent comforter and protector. Therefore, once the Spirit was fully active, there was no longer a need for the angel of Lord. This is logical since, as we saw earlier, spirit is another representation of an angel.

Consensus is that angel of the Lord refers to the physical personification of the trinity. Hence, this would be the same member as the man Jesus. The appearance of God in physical form is called a theophany. Consider an insightful question. When God is in human form, does he still have all the authority and power throughout the universe? Of course, he is still God! Contrast this with the glory or essence of God, which was apparent on several occasions. No one can look on that and live to tell the tale.

So, by assuming the form of an angel, it was possible for Yehovah to physically appear before the birth of the God-man. Other angels walk about the earth observing what is happening. They report to the angel of Yehovah.

Talents Numerous capabilities are described as gifts of the spirit. The dictionary describes gifts in this connotation as a notable capacity, talent, or endowment. There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit. - I Corinthians 12:4 NIV And in the church God has appointed first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, also those having gifts of healing, those able to help others, those with gifts of administration, and those speaking in different kinds of tongues. - I Corinthians 12:28 NIV The gifts of the spirit are separated into three types.

Similarly, the service skills are helpers, administrators, and most healing. The sign talents are miracles, tongues, and some healing. Operation As noted earlier, the emotional phase is part of the birthing or initiation process. Similarly, the mental process is the maturing or control component. Hence, the sign gifts were a critical element during the formation of the Christian culture. They become less prominent as the community matures. Today, when translators go into a totally new, isolated culture, the sign talents may be very significant. Similarly, the ability may arise in developing new Christians. However, their importance diminishes as a person matures in faith and knowledge. Initially, the physical body reacts to emotional stimulus. Any emotion can be trained by focusing on it. It is possible thus to exercise the sign gifts in environments other than to get the attention of unbelievers. However, the normal process of intellectual curiosity and development tends to override the emotional. As recorded by the early intellectual Paul of Tarsus, the signs are illustrations for birthing new Christians. He continues that the searching or mental gifts are for maturing and growing. We are instructed to mature and seek the intellectual talents for personal development. Follow the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy. - I Corinthians 14:1 NIV He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church. - I Corinthians 14:4 NIV Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is for believers, not for unbelievers."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Chapter 18 Gifts of Spirit 187 - I Corinthians 14:22 NIV Exercise of the sign gifts is not an integral component to being a great person of faith.

They said, though John never performed a miraculous sign, all that John said about this man was true. - John 10:41 In addition, none of the later letters by Paul or others gives record of exercising the sign abilities. However, in all instances, people are implored to grow in wisdom and knowledge. Searching Group The searching talents provide the educational process. They include apostles, prophets, and teachers. The first, an apostle, is one sent on a mission to initiate an important belief. Since there can only be a few initiators, this number is limited by definition. The apostles enter an arena first. The second, prophecy, simply means insight or to proclaim. A more common related word in present vernacular is to preach or advocate. Proclaimers are the leaders that build on the work of the apostles. Third, teachers have advanced knowledge and education, which gives them the ability to instruct or show others. Rather than being advocates, teachers tend to pass on information. Miracle workers One of the sign gifts was a worker of miracles. What are these wonders?

Be well Healing is one of the talents that have been subject to some confusion of concepts. It fits most often in the service category and occasionally in the sign arena. To clear the record, from our experience, we are great believers in personal healing through the Spirit. With that, let us look at healing from the analytical perspective of a scientist. In every ancient culture, there was a medicine man or priest. His primary method of art was to invoke incantations. For certain conditions, he was the wizard who knew the magical abilities of plants. As medicine developed, we found it was not magic but chemical compounds in the herbs. In fact, one of the words translated witchcraft in an early version was pharmakeia (5331) . The word derivatives are also translated as sorcery. Idolatry, witchcraft (5331) , hatred, ...that they, which do such things, shall not inherit the kingdom of God. - Galatians 5:20-21 ..and whoremongers, and sorcerers (5331) , and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. - Revelation 21:8 It is obvious that the word is similar to pharmacy, a place of compounding and distributing drugs.

My grandmother learned about herbs from her grandmother. She had a special gift of healing because of that knowledge. However, my adult children search books and the Internet. They have more information than Grandmother ever dreamed. They can treat a much larger variety of things and have a greater expectancy of consistent success. Moreover, with increased information available, we have found many things impact health. This includes diet, exercise, water and air quality, and sunlight. Now, a medicinal man is not always necessary. Our intellect directs us to use pain relievers, vitamins and herbs, or precautions for some conditions. Furthermore, we pray through the Spirit and seek wisdom on how to treat other ailments. Incantations of the medicine man can work. They can cause psychosomatic or emotional impact on physical conditions. However, the medical arts are more logical analysis and physical repair. With learning, we are more dependent on the intellectual knowledge or spirit for healing. The appearance of the talents has changed from the medicine man or priest to the medical man. Nevertheless, it is still a spirit or intellect ability based on information provided by the Creator. Moreover, healing is involved with the expectation or belief it will work. Sometimes there is healing past just what we can intellectually understand. That has to be the Spirit of God and no one else. Service Group Service is the assistance of someone.

These tasks are often office positions that are critical to keep the machinery of the business operating. Language Language as we have seen earlier is the method of communicating within a family group. Language is learned; therefore, it is intellectual or mental. A person can make a decision to learn a new language. Place a child in the environment, and he readily grasps multiple languages. Language has structure and rules. In emotional situations, we revert to our mother tongue because of our comfort. Children raised in other cultures have a mother tongue separate from the parents. This was quite common in the French speaking area of Louisiana where we were raised. A similar circumstance was observed with the Spanish speakers when we lived in Texas and California. The parents often maintain the old culture language. Nevertheless, the children readily adopt the ubiquitous English language of their surroundings. Often they reject and cannot speak the traditional language of the parents. The scripture has discussions in the book of Acts and I Corinthians about speaking other languages. Two words are used for language. The word dialect is obtained from one of the terms (dialektos, 1258). It is translated language one time and tongue five times in Acts, the book penned by the physician Dr. Luke. The second word translated as language (glossa, 1100) is used fifty times throughout the New Record. In some cases it obviously refers to the member of the body in the mouth that makes speech. In other cases it is rendered as a particular or unique language."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"192 Who Is This God?  Durham It is the mouth organ in the books of Mark, Luke, Romans, Philippians, James, I Peter, and I John. The word is obviously language in Revelation. In Acts and I Corinthians 12 ñ 14, it is used both as the mouth organ and as a unique language. To illustrate the idea of a particular lingo, some translations use the modifier different, a, or unknown before the word language. Among serious scholars, there are three interpretations of speaking in other languages or tongues. Some think the language is a foreign tongue that is spoken for the alien listeners. Another group contends the language is a special communications between true believers and the Spirit. Others argue it is a temporary language as a demonstration for new believers. As with most things, the reality appears to be a combination. We noted above that the sign abilities were primarily for getting the attention of unbelievers. In addition, during the era of the writing, numerous languages were used in the city. The local and religious language was Hebrew. The educational language was Greek. The language of the Roman government was Latin. The adjacent language from surrounding areas was Arabic. Pilgrims to the religious temple often were from foreign areas with another language. Therefore, a very important ability would be to communicate in some or all of these languages. We experienced a similar condition recently when we visited India. The local language was Punjabi. There are 26 such states and each has at least one regional languages. The national and religious language was Hindi. The economic trade language was English. The Moslem and Pakistani culture used Arabic. School children are fluent in at least three languages, the local, national, and English. Fortunately, we could conduct our business in English.

Third, I remember a discussion in a graduate university class about learning the technique to help development in creative acts of art and music. This creates an altered state of thought. Free indeed The Spirit gives one very substantial gift that is not registered in the traditional list. That is the gift of freedom.

For the love of money is the root of all evil: - I Timothy 6:10 Have you noticed? People without money are more concerned and talk about money more than the wealthy. More crime is committed in the poverty areas than in the affluent. Therefore, the problem is not the quantity of money one has. It is the inordinate desire for more, regardless of the quantity.

Peter was an entrepreneur whose fishing business continued while he was doing ministry work. He was able to return to the business for an interim time.

The word sin has become to be such a religious term with future ethereal implications that its impact on daily human life has been lost. Quite simply, the concept is an offense, shortcoming, or fault. To be a fault, the action must be compared to something. To what is the fault compared? There must be principles that have overriding, universal value. There is one list of items that are unacceptable. These six things does the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him: a proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, an heart that devises wicked imaginations, feet that are swift in running to mischief, a false witness that speaks lies, and he that sows discord among brethren. - Proverbs 6:16-19 In religious circles, there are serious or cardinal problems. There are also those that are considered mundane or ordinal shortcomings. The seven cardinal errors according to religious tradition are pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed, gluttony, and lust. Oh what terminology to make everyone be evil. Are these faults ever specifically listed in the canon as more serious than others? No, any error is still a problem. This concept of every person being inherently evil dates to Augustine in 412 AD. The idea is fostered basically from only one passage in the New Covenant. Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way, death came to all men, because all sinned. Again, the gift of God is not like the result of the one manís sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification. - Romans 5:12 &16"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Chapter 20 Who Is This God to You? 205 These and the adjacent verses have been the foundation of the dogma about original sin.

Planetary changes The judgment that followed Adamís act resulted from a condemnation or curse on the earth system. This pronouncement by the Creator made changes to the way parts of the planet interacted. The basic structure stayed the same, but now there would be physical reminders of the foul impact.

This permitted the malevolent or negative spirits to have an entry into the human psyche. All people who now live must contend with the thorny reminders. Nevertheless, every person is responsible for his or her own choices. We are not inherently evil because of what Adam or our parents did. There may be some consequences for their errors, but that does not make the offspring responsible.

If he passes to the next life in this state, he does not suffer the ultimate penalty. At the point he knows what is right and wrong, and makes a conscious choice, then he is accountable. Invariably, at some point everyone makes a wrong choice. From that time forward, he will pay the ultimate penalty for all his errors. Life cycle of faults If we are responsible for our own choices, why do we make bad ones rather than those that help us? The theologian and legal scholar from Tarsus, Paul, made an acerbic observation. Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it. - Romans 7:20 How can this be, that we do what we know we should not?

When originally created, all items had a good purpose. Because of the influence of negative, malevolent spirits, good things can be manipulated to cause harm. Remember that a person is born with a physical, emotional, and mental capacity. The design of the human placed all the best options in his structure. These are etched in the brain segment related to the emotions."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Chapter 20 Who Is This God to You? 207  Bad influences come through the mental faculties. Because of the cyclic nature of the process, new grooves can be made on the brain paths, if thoughts and actions are repeated. A specific example illustrates the process. Humans were created with the drive, will, or emotion for self-preservation. When a stimulus causes fright, the emotional or limbic system causes a shot of adrenalin into the body. The adrenalin provides the short-term burst of energy and reactions for physical fight or flight. This is a very desirable trait. The negative spirit or attitude of fear can influence a personís reason. The fear becomes associated with an event or stimulus. Then, by repeated thinking about it, a disabling emotional reaction is formed that stops physical response. For example, speaking in front of people is ranked as the number one fear, even ahead of death. Why? It is not physical harm. By repeated thoughts of what bad can happen, a person develops a fear that is not real. Fear is the opposite of faith. Fear is what you believe will happen. Faith is what you believe will happen. Only Faith is positive. The exercise of faith requires a season to develop. The results of faith are not immediate. Faith requires the seed to be planted, the plant to be nourished and cultivated, and the fruit to be harvested. To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: - Ecclesiastes 3:1 stimulus +/- physical mental emotional"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"208 Who Is This God?  Durham A season is about 91 days. This seems to transcend every activity. The mean spirit destroys personal performance and influences you to select what is called sin. This comes by what Paul said, doing what you know you should not do. The spirit of the opposition takes the best and influences it for bad. Nevertheless, by assenting to the Spirit of God, you can succeed and overcome. You are of God, dear children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. - I John 4:4 Courage is fear plus action. Although the spirit of fear influences people, a strong enough emotion can cause action that wins. Heroes are simply people that acted even in the presence of fear. Meddling Another example of malevolent influence predominates in our society. It is revealed in our dietary habits. We know that excessive quantities of certain food items are not good for us. In fact they lead to health problems and ultimately shortened life. For example, excessive refined sugar, caffeine, salt, and saturated fat all will cause serious problems. Although it is common knowledge, most people in our society continue to over indulge. Why? It tastes good now. Human faults, in old English terminology, were called sin. Therefore to him that knows to do good, and does it not, to him it is sin. - James 4:15 It is your choice. It is not because of your environment, society, or parents. You have the consequences of your choice. By negative influence, you are constrained to less than God gave you the desire"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Chapter 20 Who Is This God to You? 209 and ability to be. There was a saying during the last century that is an accurate observation - God does not make junk! People are where they are because of choices they make. Do something about it. Ignorance An old folk-saying flippantly declares that ignorance is bliss. Ignorance of principles or law is no excuse. You will still pay the consequences. We have found in recent years that certain otherwise beneficial chemicals, medicines, and foods cause health problems. Because they had been used, people became ill from side effects. The Creator placed the reasoning ability within our mental faculties to discern problems. Therefore, even though we originally did not know they were bad, by observation we determined the challenge. We can never restore the past and its effects. We can change the present and caution about the future. Similarly, ignorance of Godís natural law is no excuse. There are consequences to rejecting its principles. If you find something you want enough, you will change to get it. If you do not want the results enough, you will continue to be bound where you are. This is the story of the Pearl of Great Price. The monologue was revealed by God himself, teaching as the Lord Jesus, the Christ. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it. - Matthew 13:45-46 The process starts with a stimulus that provokes an emotion. If the dream or emotion is big enough, you will take action. You will feed the process by thinking about it. Ultimately, your action will bring the Pearl of Great Price."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"210 Who Is This God?  Durham The Rest of the Story A well-known commentator had a series of short radio biographies called The Rest of the Story . The snippets were little known biographical facts that were crowned with the name of the honoree. If we left the discussion simply with you have a choice, we would leave out the rest of the story. Looking at the model of human behavior, we have often referred to a stimulus provoking an emotion. This caused a physical action. The mental analyzed then caused a positive or negative feedback. This caused the response to grow or diminish. The emotional and mental capacities are internal and the physical is external action. The individual is responsible for both internal and external actions. A key ingredient that impacts the model is the stimulus or input. The person does not control this external event. If you do not cause them and have no control over them, where do they come from? In the vernacular, stuff happens. The next few topics will look at the events. Stimulus The most obvious stimulus or events can come from the result of physical actions by a person. The person can be someone else or it can be a previous feat by you. Natural laws are another obvious source. For example, gravity exists in the natural law. Your emotions want something. You make a choice to heed or ignore gravity by performing a physical act. The third source is from the supernatural realm. We do not understand many natural items, so they appear to be supernatural. In addition, people may perform outside their normal range. Those actually fit in the natural laws. "},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Chapter 20 Who Is This God to You? 211 Supernatural intervention is very different. The most familiar are shields of protection from a person, physical phenomenon, or evil spirits. And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray you, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray you, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha. - II Kings 6:17-18 Several things are obvious from this passage. First, there are events going on that we cannot comprehend. Second, if we seek to know, we can understand. Third, if we ask Yehovah as the name of Jesus, he will intervene in our affairs as we ask. Charisma The most powerful input comes simply by a gift from God. God in his infinite wisdom, power, and love knows what is good, better, and best for each person. He does actively stimulate each individual. Paul penned perhaps one of the most eloquent passages to the Ephesus assembly. For by grace (charis, 5485) are you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift (doron, 1435) of God: Not of works, unless any man should boast. - Ephesians 2:8-9 Grace (charis, 5485) literally means joy, favor, gratitude, thanks, or pleasure. It is from the word for joy (chara, 5479) , which is a fruit of the spirit. Charisma (charisma, 5486) is an obvious extension that is always a gift. Gift (doron, 1435) is a present. It is significant that two different words in the passage both mean gift. It is like saying the gift is a gift."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"212 Who Is This God?  Durham You cannot work for the gift. To do so would be wages. The only option is to accept or reject the present. The input to you is a gift of God, now it is your choice what you are going to do with it. The construction of the sentence in this rendition requires one point of clarification. The gift that is offered is saving. You provide faith. You do not provide work. You do not save yourself. Another translation is even clearer. I mean that you have been saved by grace through believing. You did not save yourselves; it was a gift from God. - Ephesians 2:8 New Century Version More stimuli If God provides one gift, he provides numerous. Every opportunity he offers is a stimulus for you to do something. Our level of achievement or accomplishment is because of constraints we have placed on opportunity. There are numerous other practices associated with the gifts from God. Perhaps the most important practice is the concept of giving because God is the example. As you give, you will be rewarded. ÖLet the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant. - Psalm 35:27 Bring you the whole tithe into the store-house, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now herewith, says Jehovah of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before the time in the field, says Jehovah of hosts. And all nations shall call you happy; for you shall be a delightsome land, says Jehovah of hosts."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Chapter 20 Who Is This God to You? 213 - Malachi 3:10-12 ASV Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. - Luke 6:38 NIV In order to prosper, it is necessary to give. What are you doing with the opportunities given to you? Once given, it is your choice to receive the benefit. We have observed a rather interesting phenomenon. Many people that follow the precepts of the Scripture are selective in its application. Some tend to separate the Old and the New as appropriate for use. This philosophy asserts that only the New is valid to present day application. Others declare that the Old promises were only appropriate for the people of Israel. Even while applying these constraints to their belief system, they may ascribe to the Ten Commandments. The author of the most letters recorded in the New Testament also encountered this issue. He was very succinct in his charge to apply every message. All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: - II Timothy 3:16 We have just examined that God gives good things to people who will accept them. Now let us look at the other options. Why do bad things happen to good people? That is perhaps one of the most compelling questions to prick the thought of an individual. As noted above, there are inputs that come our way, other than those that are direct intervention by God. We have no control over the stimulus or inputs that come down our path. It is not our responsibility, nor is it really an option, to challenge the events that provoke us. "},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"214 Who Is This God?  Durham Nevertheless, we are responsible for what we do within ourselves. We make the choices of how we deal with circumstances. We can control our emotions and the attitudes we select in response to the events that are happening. Within the constraints, this controls the actions we take. Someone that accepts the right spirit or attitude will have greater victory than someone accepting a bad attitude. Someone with great circumstances and abilities can blow it by taking bad choices. Conversely, someone with terrible inputs can have phenomenal victory. It is up to you. The God of the universe gave you the greatest concept imaginable. He gave you freedom to choose whom you would serve and what you would do. What are you going to do today? Action comes easily to some people. The critical issue is making the right action. The study gives significant opportunity to learn and know facts. It is logical that you can know more by building on what others have taught. Your commands make me wiser than my enemies, for they are ever with me. I have more insight than all my teachers, for I meditate on your statutes. I have more understanding than the elders, for I obey your precepts. - Psalm 119:98-100 NIV What you do with the facts and how you apply them will determine your future and those you contact. A letter to a group in an ancient Greek city stimulates caution about just knowledge without expression. If I speak in the language of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. "},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Chapter 20 Who Is This God to You? 215 If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing. Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. - I Corinthians 13:1-5 NIV The word love (agape, 26) can properly be rendered compassion or care. Compassion or care is an emotional concern for others with a desire to give or help them. The word is also used in the command for husbands to love your wives. It is stronger than friendship (phileo, 5368) without any sexual (eros) implications. There is a vernacular version of the passage. ìI do not care how much you know, until I know how much you care.î You can have all manner of knowledge, but if you cannot relate to people, it does not matter. Your success will depend on how you relate to others. Vulnerable There are times that the external events are so strong that we feel vulnerable. We think we have made the right choices, but there is a gnawing feeling of insecurity. We feel overwhelmed by the circumstances and events over which we have little influence. Dr. Bruce Wilkinson relates advice from an older mentor Dr. John Mitchell. ìThat feeling you are running from is called dependence. It means you are walking with the Lord Jesus.î Personally, I prefer confidence and security. However, that is not always the situation. The greatest changes and success come with that frustrating insecurity. Thousands of years ago, a very successful individual felt this same way, but knew how to handle it.

He prayed perhaps the most succinct and powerful sentence in history. And Jabez called on the God of Israel saying, Oh that You would bless me indeed, and enlarge my territory, that Your hand would be with me, and that You would keep me from evil, that I may not have pain, so God granted him what he requested. - II Chronicles 4:10 This thought is so crucial that it has been available throughout recorded history for you. It closely parallels the Lordís Prayer recited by Jesus to his disciples. Think on it. Study it. Memorize it. Practice it. Depend on it. It will change your future. When things are not where you feel right, depend on the record of Jabez. It must work, since God cannot shirk from his guarantee and does not change in his relationships. Just remember, there are no rules for you to follow to obtain the love of Yehovah. As his child and joint heir, his care is unconditional to you. It is sometimes necessary to go to your Father for advice when you do not know how to handle an event. That is great. That is dependence. That is faith. What can he do for you?

MOD Foundations The study of Who Is This God? began with the traditions of the Jewish culture. These are embodied in the book called the Bible, Scripture, or Writ. The first essays of the document were written about 3500 years ago. The latest installments were scribed almost 2000 years ago. Any document that lasts in common usage for that length of time must be taken seriously. The Old Division was written primarily in Hebrew. The New Division was written in Greek. When any language is translated, there is the possibility of differences in shades of meanings. In addition, all languages evolve with time. The result is that English or French of today is very different from 500 years past. Again this may cause some questions on first look that are resolved with closer investigation. The Book has lasted for millennia with general acceptance of accuracy by current users. This record makes the Book the most legitimate resource available for the topics it addresses. The issue"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"218 Who Is This God?  Durham for analysis in this treatise is God. Since God is the focal subject of the Book, the recordís comments must be recognized as credible. Triad The first area of observation is that humans are in the likeness of God. Since we cannot see God, it is logical to evaluate people for a model. When examining mankind, we find that a person has three relationships in dealing with situations. These are emotional, physical, and mental. In old English, the terms were soul, body, and spirit respectively. A simple diagram is used to illustrate the interaction between the facets. The diagram can be explained in just a few lines. A stimulus causes an emotion to move forward. The emotion promotes a physical response. The mental analyzes the response and feedback controls the emotion. The control may be positive reinforcement, which causes the physical to grow. Or it may be a negative signal, which causes the physical effect to diminish to nothing. Similarly, God is a single entity, but he has three members. In the Hebrew record, the emotional will is called Elohiym and God in English. The physical person is called Yehovah in Hebrew and LORD in English. The mental faculty is called Ruwach in Hebrew and Spirit in English. In addition, a title is often used which is Adonay in Hebrew and Lord in English. stimulus +/- physical mental emotional"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Chapter 21 Recap 219 There is one God comprising inseparable emotional will, physical body, and intellectual spirit who interacts with people through these three relationships. The New Tribute is initially about the physical, human life of God. The emotional element of that person is Christ or Anointed. The physical representation of the man is Jesus. The intellectual or teaching feature is Lord or Rabbi. Another representation of the trinity is the relationship to mankind in time. Initially the emotional will was God of the Old Testament patriarchs. Then the physical person was the man Jesus of the New Testament apostles. We now have the mental characteristic of the Holy Spirit observed by the later New Testament disciples. Still another variation of the trinity is used in the sense of a family. God is the father or procreator. Jesus is the son or physical offspring. Holy Spirit is the mental attitude that is everywhere. Attributes Besides the trinity, are there other ways to look at God? An attribute is a quality, trait, characteristic, or feature that describes something. Attributes of God are expressed by ideals. The three categories of ideals are philosophy, science, and personality. Each of these categories is comprised of three attributes. Philosophy has perfect, unique, and infinite as its descriptions. Science has stable (immutable), perpetual (eternal), and everywhere (ubiquitous, omnipresent) as its values. Personality includes absolute (sovereign), self-sufficient, and all-knowing (omniscient). Character Two lists identify the character traits of the Spirit of God. There is one common term between the two inventories. However, the other"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"220 Who Is This God?  Durham terms are related. Therefore, the character of God is inferred from the compilation of the fruit of the Spirit. For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, righteousness, and truth. - Ephesians 5:9 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control: against such there is no law. - Galatians 5:22-23 NIV As discussed earlier, the understanding of some terms may vary with language and time. The current vernacular is preferred since it is more comprehensible by most readers. The short list for character is virtue (goodness), morality (righteousness), and integrity (truth). In reality, these terms encompass all that is good and right with God and man. The longer catalog of traits can be separated into three categories of relationships. Internal is a personal perspective. External or horizontal deals with other people. Vertical has to do with Deity. The internal feelings are compassion (agape love), charisma (joy), and calmness (peace). The horizontal transactions are patience (long suffering), kindness, and virtue (goodness). The vertical dealings are confidence (faith), gentlemanliness (gentleness), and control (temperance). Confidence is the mental assurance that something is true. In the name of Jesus There is a striking parallel between the creation of earth and the birth of the God-man Jesus. The Greek version of his name is Jesus, while the Hebrew rendition is Joshua. In simplest terms, Joshua and Jesus can be stated as Jehovah (Yehovah) is salvation. The personal names are a direct correlation to Yehovah, the name of God. "},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Chapter 21 Recap 221 The entire lineage of the Old Testament is the family tree leading up to this individual. The two branches of the genealogy are the royalty line and the bloodline of King David. Numerous prophesies of the Book point to this one person in history. Many titles, tags, and terms relate to the role of Jesus as God and man. Nevertheless, his entire reason for being can be summarized into what is called the Gospel. He was born of a virgin, he lived as a man, he taught as a prophet, and he was executed as a King. He was buried for three days, he came to life where he was seen by many, and then he ascended to heaven. There he is offering his blood as a substitute for the transgressions of any person that accepts it. As our advocate, he sits on the throne awaiting the time we will join him. In his physical absence, he has sent a mental comforter and protector, the Holy Spirit, to minister to us. Spirit The Spirit is the third and final study of God. The Spirit was at creation, is with us now, and will be involved in the future life. Spirit has access to humans through the mental pathway. Positive spirit or attitude is from the Almighty while a negative attitude is influence by the adversary camp. From looking at the control model, we can determine that a positive mental attitude causes growth. Conversely, a negative spirit leads to destruction and demise. Filling of the spirit is a term that simply means the mental is in control over the emotional relationship. The Spirit confers talents or gifts. These are either searching (mental), service (physical), or sign (emotional) abilities. The searching abilities are apostles, prophets, and teachers. The service talents are helpers, administrators, and most healing. The sign capabilities are miracles, tongues, and some healing. "},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"222 Who Is This God?  Durham The sign talents are part of the birthing process. Similarly, the searching capabilities are the maturing component. As the mental begins to take control, the emotional has less influence, and it may be overcome. One substantial gift by the spirit that is not listed above in the character traits is the gift of freedom. This provides the individual with the ability to choose. The fruit of the spirit is the character traits described previously. Law is most elegantly the identification of processes that provide security and protection. However, violating any of the natural principles will have consequences. Mankind has the option to choose to learn natural law or pay the consequences for not heeding its principles. Spirit of another kind The Holy Spirit is the mental member of the creator God of the universe. There are numerous other spirits, commonly called angels or messengers. Spirits or angels are associated with every leadership position and with every attitude. Humans reside in the natural realm, which is physical space. Spirits occupy the supernatural realm, which is in the same location, but is invisible. God has the ultranatural realm. Beings in a higher realm can go to a lower. However because of our reality focus, most humans are restricted from traversing or even seeing a higher realm. There are a few exceptions such as Elisha, John, and Paul. So we know humans can make the transition with the right mindset. Angels are divided into branches based on the extent of their relationships. The personal branch operates through internal dealings with a single person. That organization has archangels over angels. The relations branch is a horizontal relationship between multiple people. That group has angels for rulers over powers. The service branch is a vertical connection with Deity. Its structure has cherubim and seraphim."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Chapter 21 Recap 223 All spirits have names associated with their influence. In the canon, only three angels have human names. Michael is the archangel, Gabriel is the good news messenger, and Lucifer, was the bright star. In the Deuterocanonical book of Tobit, Raphael is the healing angel. Angels cannot procreate with other similar beings in the supernatural realm. However, one-third chose to leave their first estate and come to earth as gods. Some of these mated with women to produce demigods and giants. The leader of the revolt had his name changed to Satan, Devil, or Adversary. Since these chose earth as their realm of power, they are committed to the earth forever. They will ultimately be driven into the lower bowels of the earth when Yehovah returns to set up his reign. Other gods The original source of other gods was the angels that left their first realm. Because they had supernatural powers, compared to men they appeared as gods. Virtually every culture has these super beings as part of their heritage. Genesis 6 gives the story of how the idea for these alternative deities originated. In other cases, a malevolent relations spirit held influence over very strong men. With this authority, the men began to be worshipped. One of the originators that provided the foundation of this worship was Nimrod of Babel. Nimrodís grandmother, Hamís wife, set the groundwork for Egyptian religion. In some outside records, she is called Zeptah and she was the mother of the first Pharaoh. The Greek titans and Olympian gods have a correlation in most other cultures. However, the Greek system of mythology has the greatest influence in western civilizations as a story of other gods. "},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"224 Who Is This God?  Durham Angel of Lord and other spirits Angel of the Lord is a messenger that was involved specifically with a human. When God operated in the physical realm, it was as the man Jesus. Prior to that birth, his physical presence was as the angel of the Lord. These appearances are called a theophany. The ancient scribe John gave an admonition about the various spirits. Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. - I John 4:1 Numerous negative attitudes, spirits, or demons influence people. Some of these are proud, haughty, jealous, dumb, bound, fearful, lustful, and envious. The positive attitudes, spirits, or angels also persuade the mental aspect of people. Some of these are patient, gentlemanliness, wisdom, understanding, counsel, knowledge, truth, and freedom. It is a personís choice to respond to the negative bombardment or the positive affirmation. There are consequences to going down the negative path or the positive. Review The theme of the treatise is reflected in a few queries. What is the trinity in the Old Testament? What is the trinity for the God-man? What is the trinity with time relationship to mankind? What is the trinity using family terminology? What is the trinity relationship of people? Do you maintain a positive attitude or spirit? The review of these deliberations will tie the entire discussion together into a concise package.

Do you have curiosity and many questions about the supernatural? Do most books on the topics get too deep or too far out? Is there really a Creator or did the universe just happen? What are angels? Since the beginning of history, these questions have been the topics of theology and mythology. Our objective is to take the ideas from the religious realm, then transfer the thoughts to the thinking of practical, everyday relationships. These concepts and ideas have been tackled through a variety of examples, references, and applications. Some of the discussion required exercising your insight and evaluating your thoughts.
