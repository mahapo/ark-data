An unwillingness to accept any official version of historical facts without close scrutiny has led the author to notice certain gaps and omissions which by their frequency have struck him as being systematic. He has found this particularly true of the Holy See, and in his investigations into the part it has play ed in contemporary affairs he has taken inlinite pains to assemble the works of the most highly qualified writers as well as official documents and papers from archives, and his conclusions have been reached after much patient research and cross-checking. Born in Paris of a Roman Catholic family of scholars, Edmond Paris has always been especially interested in philosophical, religious and social matters, and after leaving the Sorbonne, where he was an assiduous student, he completed his studies in various parts of the world. Concerned always to remain in close contact with reality, he travell ed widely and was thus able to compare what he had learned with what he saw, and this no less than his vast culture is clearly apparent in his written works, which include Le Vatican Contre La France, as well as in his lectures, reflecting a s they do a man remarkably free from bias, and one governed by a veritable passion for the truth.

Consequently , I would stress that I have considered only the political side.\" In the present work the same principle has been fol lowed. I have confined myself to highlighting the historical cont inuity of the retrograde and evil politics of the Vatican, as wel l as the latter's overwhelming responsibility in the disasters that h ave succeeded one another in Europe during the last fifty years. The following pages lay bare the deceit and crimes in which the Holy See, its representatives throughout the world and its Nazi and Fascist allies have participated, and which the ir unparalleled hypocrisy has not been able to conceal. The book opens with a bill of indictment against th e Vatican. The charges are taken up separately in the ensuing chapters, where they are matched with ample and incontestable proof of a continued collusion with the torturers of mankind who started the last world catastrophe. But this collusion is well within the tradition of the Holy See. It dates back for many centuries. In all circumstan ces, ever since the days of Charlemagne, the Papacy has not ceased to l ean upon the Germans, in order to impose its authority and to ex tend it through- out Europe. The Reformation had undoubtedly disturb ed the agreement that for centuries had held good between the Holy See and Mittel-Europa, and had withdrawn a part of the German peoples from obedience to the Vatican. Austria-Hung ary alone remained entirely submissive. But, step by step and with infinite patience, the Roman Curia gradually and without pau se regained the influence lost, at the same time placing at the service of Pan- Germanic appetites the entire spiritual ascendancy enjoyed by the 1 Le Vatican contre la France (Fischbacher, Paris, 19 57)."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"8 THE VATICAN AGAINST EUROPE Holy See among the Catholics in both the Reich and the rest of Europe.

The game was lost in 1 918, but was resumed in 1939, with the Vatican playing the very same card which it is still playing today. Guy Emery Shipler 2 clearly summarized the importance of this political activity of the Vatican when he wrote \"No political event or circumstance can be evaluated without the knowle dge of the Vatican's part in it.

The extollers of Pope Pius XII may well cover their faces when an Italian Member of Parliament exclaims: \"The Pope's hands are dripping with blood!\" 2 Nevertheless, simply to recall the facts will be to build up a terrible indictment of the Vatican . In Germany, before 1914, the Catholic Zentrum whole heartedly supported the belligerent preparations of the Imper ial Government. Its chiefs were already proclaiming Germany's \"grea t political and moral mission\" in the world. \"In 1914, Cardinal Fau lhaber 3 declared that in effect God was German.'\" Pope Pius X, in his hatred of the Orthodox Christia ns, was continually inciting Emperor Francis Joseph of Aust ria-Hungary to \"chastise the Serbians\". After Sarajevo, on 26 J uly 1914, Baron Ritter, Bavarian representative at the Holy See, wr ote to his Govern- ment : \"The Pope approves of Austria's harsh treatm ent of Serbia. He has no great opinion of the armies of Russia and France in the event of a war against Germany.

Pope Pius X was succeeded by Benedict XV, \"the 'boc he' Pope\". His attempts to prevent first Italy and then the Un ited States from entering the war alongside the Allies, his intrigue s intended to divide the Allies, his note for a \"stalemate\" peace in 1917 (with the help of Mgr. Pacelli, Papal Nuncio in Munich) shock ed even the French Catholics, whose patriotism was still alive. Of course, the \"boche\" Pope took good care not to condemn the viol ation of rights, the torpedoing of neutral ships, or any of the excesses com- mitted by the German army. 2 Speech by Laura Diaz, Member of Parliament for Legh orn, delivered on 15 April 1948 at Ortona 3 Adrien Dansette Destin du catholicisme francais (Fl amrnarion, Paris, 1957. p. 192)."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THE POLITICS OF THE HOLY SEE: BILL OF INDICTMENT 15 In 1922, Pope Pius XI donned the tiara. The Papacy had lost the first war; it was about to prepare for the second. What was happening in Europe during the years betwe en the two massacres? In Italy, secret negotiations took place between pa pal agents and Mussolini, \"the man of Providence\". The priest don Sturzo, Chief of the Catholic Group, had full rights voted to the Duce on 16 November 1922. Then came the Lateran Treaty, to sea l the union of Fascism and the Papacy, the conquest of Ethiopia —blessed by the clergy—and. on Good Friday 1939, the aggression against Albania. In Germany the Papal Nuncio in Berlin, Mgr. Pacelli , and Franz von Papen, Privy Chamberlain to the Pope, advocated a \"union with Rome\" and concentrated on the overthrow of the Weimar Republic. The German Catholics were hostile to Nazi sm, but were informed that the Pope himself was \"favourably disp osed towards Hitler\". Consequently, the Catholic Zentrum, axis o f all the parlia- mentary majorities, voted full rights to Hitler on 30 January 1933. This operation was promptly followed, as in Italy, by the concluding of a concordat which was most advantageous to the R oman Church. The German Episcopate swore allegiance to the Fuhre r, and Catholic youth organizations combined with those of the Nazi s. In 1935, the Saar voted its re-attachment to the Reich after a f avourable electoral campaign by the Bishops of Trier and Speyer. Hencef orth, the principal champion of the Papacy—the Germanic \"secu lar arm\"— visibly gathered strength. In Spain, the Virgin appeared here and there, and e ffigies of Christ shed tears. These were unmistakable signs—the Repub lic and its impious regime would not last long. On 31 March 193 4 the Pact of Rome was signed, and pledged the support of Muss olini and Hitler for the rebellion. The \"holy war\" broke out. In 1937, in the midst of war, the Vatican gave de jure recognition to the Govern- ment of Franco, its sword-bearer, who was later to be decorated with the Supreme Order of Christ. \"Blessed be the g uns if the Gospel flowers in their wake!\" Soon the Catholic Ac tion was to spread its reign of tyranny across the ruined count ry.

Mgr. Picard, Canon C ardijn (later to be elevated to the rank of Monseigneur by Pope Pius XII) and their protege, the ineffable Leon Degrelle, applied thems elves to this pious task. In France, the spokesmen of Rome gave their blessin g to the \"strong\" policies; the Deats, the Doriots, and the Bucards all aped the dictators. The fifth column was organized, and already Gustave Herve was crying: \"Petain is the man for us !\" 4 In Austria (which was destined to be the Fuhrer's f irst prey), the \"Christian\" chancellors succeeded one another, beginning with the Jesuit, Mgr. Seipel. Their reactionary politics were to end, in 1938, in the country's being absorbed by Hitler's R eich. The entire Austrian Episcopate, led by Cardinal Innitzer, decl ared its whole- hearted support of the Anschluss. Thus eight millio n Austrians were to help to swell the ranks of German Catholics . In Czechoslovakia also, the Roman Church was workin g for the Fuhrer by upholding the separatist Slovaks, at whos e head was Mgr. Hlinka, with his \"Guard\" modelled on the Nazi S.A. Hitler annexed \"Sudeten Germany\", dismembered the country, and created the satellite state of Slovakia, where a Catholic p relate, Mgr. Tiso, played the role of Gauleiter. He promised to organi ze this state \"along Christian lines\", a policy which found its p articular expres- sion in the deportation of Slovak Jews to Auschwitz . Catholic Poland in its turn succumbed beneath the b lows of the Fuhrer, without any protest from Pope Pius XII. Ind eed, he tried to persuade France and England to accept a compromi se peace that would recognize the amputation of Poland to th e benefit of Germany. Here again, several more million Catholics would join the Reich, and so proportionately strengthen the po sition of Rome. War broke out. In an invaded France, Petain, the \"s aviour\" who had long been held in reserve, was raised to power. Then came the \"collaboration\" with Hitler which was unrelentingly urged upon the faithful by the French Episcopate, led by Mgr. Suha rd, Archbishop of Paris.

In a dismembered Yugoslavia, the temporary victors were carving out the pseudo-independent state of Croatia. As in Slovakia, the Catholic clergy were well represented in Parliament . Under the watchful eyes of Mgr. Stepinac and the Pontifical L egate, Marcone, the Jews were being either deported or massacred, a nd the Orthodox Serbs and their clergy exterminated with an unparal leled refinement of cruelty, when they were not being \"converted\" by terror. Catholic priests and monks preached murder and even particip ated in it, and Ante Pavelitch, Chief of the Ustashis, was received in great pomp by Pope Pius XII. In Russia, Hitler's troops were advancing, and amon g the SS that followed them were the Jesuit converters. In Poland, the \"Wartheland\" which was destined to b ecome the territory for German colonization, was scientifical ly \"cleared\". All Poles who opposed them and especially Jewish Poles, were exter- minated; \"genocide\", by shooting or by gassing, had begun. Mean- while, the camps of Auschwitz, Dachau, Belsen and o thers devoured their inmates, who had first been reduced to skelet ons. Twenty-five million human beings {the official figure recorded by the UN ) perished in these hells of slow death, without the Vicar of Christ ever having raised his voice. Not only that, but he sent no cha plains to these camps. Then came the Peace! Questioned later, Pope Pius XII was to say that he knew nothing of the German atrocities; as he doubtless knew noth ing of those of Croatia and Slovakia; as—in 1933—when, as Mgr. Pace lli, he knew nothing of the pogroms, the ever-increasing assassi nations in Germany, or the 40,000 persons already detained in forty-five camps by the Fuhrer, who had promised him that he w ould \"muzzle the anti-clericals\". But during the trials at Nuremberg, when these atro cities had been laid bare before the eyes of the whole world, by millions of testimonies, irrefutable documents, and films haunt ing in their horror, what did he do but fly to the aid of the gu ilty?

They are so serious, indeed, that they have ended in the most appalling massacres and in the irreparable decline of Europe. So serious an d so obvious were they that during the Italian electoral campaig n of April 1948, Emilio Bonetti declared, \"The Pope is a war crimina l!\" How is it conceivable after this that the \"undying devotion\" of the clergy and of faithful Catholics should have re mained unaffected? So far as the clergy were concerned, it is not inco nceivable if one recalls that even in the seventeenth century, Nicke l, the Jesuit General, wrote in his Instructions: \"Let us forget our native land... . The Company cannot continue if the national spirit is not entirely uprooted.\" But did the faithful also treat the inte rests of their country and the lives of their children so lightly, as soon as the Roman Curia thought fit to sacrifice them to its geopolit ical plans?

Furthermore, how is it possible to mistake the dire ct assistance which Pope Pius XII rendered in the perpetration of these atrocities, by \"lending\" certain of his prelates, to become pro -Nazi agents such as Mgr.

For, wherever one looks, one sees the same \"edifying\" spectacle. Yet the faithful were silent in the face of so many crimes. Is this not the most deadly of all the results of papal abs olutism? To be sure, we know that His Holiness makes infallible ex cathedra declarations upon faith and morals by virtue of the direct communi- cation which he maintains with the Paraclete—at lea st since 1870. 7 But the decrees that he fulminates under this lofty inspiration do not in principle cover political questions and all the more when such matters concern the very life of the country.

At the risk of being taken for impious \"rationalist s\", we shall take the liberty of drawing aside the honourable ve il of fable in an attempt to clarify this question. Let us first of all consult Abbe Brugerette, 1 an historian entirely free from the suspicion of anti-papist leanings: \"Pius X, who was extremely severe towards certain m odernizing innovators, thought it better to abstain from all r igorous measures against the instigators of war, contrarily to those who prayed for one of those official and tragic excommunications w hich, in the Middle Ages, brought consternation into the souls o f guilty kings and released subjects from their oath of allegiance . Was not Serbia, it was asked, a sufficient reason for the Pope to i ntervene ? Could he, should he, suffer an empire of fifty million men to prepare to crush a small neighbouring people of barely five million, a people which, to keep the peace, ever since 25 July, had given al most complete satisfaction to Austrian demands ? \" But it cannot be denied that Pope Pius X did not co ndemn this abuse of power.

For Rome, the matt er was assuming an almost religious importance; the apostolic monar chy's success over tzarism might be considered as Rome's victory over the Eastern schism.... \"We have access to a certain number of documents\", continues Pierre Dominique, \"whose analysis shows beyond doub t that, at least in the beginning, the Vatican looked with sat isfaction upon a venture in which the crushing of Serbia would have entailed a decrease in the influence of Russia, whose prestige the Roman Church detested. . . .

The real opinion of the Curia is not without intere st. When, two days ago, I went to the Cardinal Secretary of State , he did, of course, speak about the serious questions and problems that at present 3 Veroffentlichungen der Kommission fur neuere Geschi chte Osterreichs, 26 Wien—Leipzig 1930 pp. 893 and 894."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"PIUS X CAUSES THE OUTBREAK OF WAR 45 preoccupy the whole of Europe. His Eminence's conve rsation bore no sign of any particular goodwill or moderation.

'It goes without saying', remarked the Cardinal, 'that it is regrett able that Serbia should not have been brought low a long time ago.'' This declaration is equally consonant with the Pope's opinion: many a t ime during the past year His Holiness has expressed his regret tha t Austria-Hungary should have missed the opportunity to subdue its Da nubian neighbour\". Austria's representative at the Vatican then endeav ours to justify the attitude of Pope Pius X with arguments which, a ccording to Pierre Dominique, 4 Count Sforza reports in these terms: \"One might well ask oneself why the Catholic Church adopts such a bellicose attitude.

The Pope and the Curia see in Serbia a consuming disease which, little by little, has penetrated to the very marrow of the Monarchy a nd which, in time, would end by disintegrating it . . . Austr ia-Hungary is and remains the Catholic state par excellence, the stro ngest buttress of religion that is now left to the Church.

In the light of this fact, it is no t difficult to forge a link between the apostolic feelings and the spirit of war.'\" To this overwhelming document may be added another, no less official, establishing premeditation, on the part o f Pope Pius X, in causing the outbreak of war. In July 1913, after th e signature of the Peace of Bucarest, Austria-Hungary was already threatening to attack Serbia, and it was the turn of the Austri an prince Schonburg to go and acquaint himself with the feelings of the Vatican on the subject. This is how he reports 5 to Count Berchtold the conversations that he had there at the end of October and on 3 No vember 1913: \"Among the first subjects tackled by the Cardinal S ecretary of State during our interview last week, as was to be expected, was the question of Serbia.

Let us confess in all humility t hat we are unable to explain this fantastic state of affairs. But no matter: we have now established, beyond all possible question, with official records, the way in which Pius X \"did all he could to preven t the war of 1914\". Might it be said, nevertheless, in an attempt to ex cuse him, that he was hoping to see the conflict limited to Austri a-Hungary and Serbia? Let us hear the pious Rene Bazin, 6 of the Academie francaise, another author who cannot be suspected of bias agai nst the Vatican: \"Pius X ruled the Church from 4 August 1903 to 20 A ugust 1914. On 2 June of that year, he entered his eightieth ye ar. The war was approaching. He had forseen this upheaval of the wo rld; he had more than once said to Cardinal Merry del Val, who used to bring him diplomatic despatches and other papers of the p revious day, whenever he was explaining some serious question: \" What is that, compared with what is to come ? The Great War is coming: 1914 will not be over before it breaks out. \"To the Minister of Brazil, who was taking leave of him, Pius X said: 'You are fortunate', the Pope told him, 'you will not see the Great War at close quarters.' \"The diplomat, struck by this remark, wrote to seve ral of his friends about it. Less than three months later, fiv e nations were mobilizing their armies, and Germany was invading B elgium.\" Can it be maintained, after this, that the Holy Fat her did not foresee the extension of the conflict? On the contr ary, he foresaw it so well, that he expressly mentioned it before a diplomat, during an interview recorded in another official document which is quoted 6 Pie X (Flammarion.

Reference must now be made to the work that do n Lucan- tonnio has just dedicated to Cardinal Gasparri, La Supranationalite du Saint-Siege; Benedict XV having supervised the p lanning of the book, insisted on revising the proofs himself, and it is there that one must seek the true expression of his innermost thoughts. It teaches that the calamities which are ravaging the earth today have their real origin in 'doctrinal liberalism': s tates claimed that they could break away from the tutelage of the pope s and forcibly separate civil power from religious power; the pres ent conflict is a kind of epilogue to all the anger, all the fury and all the hatred which, having smouldered in the hearts of different nations and burst into tumults and domestic upheavals, could on ly result in a general outbreak of barbarous and pitiless war, in which human brotherhood has been drowned in an ocean of blood. Thus, 'the facts speak with terrifying eloquence; the Papacy, so much attacked, is vindicated by events'; and 'any people which is not climbing towards the summits of the faith, is little by litt le going down to the depths of a shameful slavery, whose chains it w ill have forged with its own hands.'

Italy herself—who woul d ever have thought it?—was not free from danger; really not, f or the British Cabinet had expressed a wish to take a lease on Sic ily. \"There was only one way of replying to this insolen ce, and that was to lay claim to Malta. But Baron Sonnino was st rangely weak. . . . This was more or less the argument of the Aus trian diplomats who, in the spring of 1915, were promising wonders to Italy, as a price for her neutrality. The pontifical press was pleased by these intrigues; and in the spring of this year 1918, the Civitta Cattolica was still surprised that the Royal Government shoul d have laid claim to some of the provinces under Austria withou t also asserting her rights to Malta, Corsica and the Cote d'Azur. \"Then there was Russia.

If this ingenious doctrine sho uld gain credence it would result in complete confusion. . . . \"To shatter the material strength of the Entente in order to get the better of its offensive fervour, and to ruin it s moral prestige in order to soften its courage and bring it to reason— this was the whole policy of Benedict XV, and the purpose of his neutrality has always been, and still is entirely designed to hams tring us. . . . \"So it is true that in this war, in which we believ e that on our victory depends the salvation of the Christian heri tage, the Pope has worked against us as an enemy. ...\" So, as it seems to us, the attitude of Benedict XV during the first world war is clearly demonstrated. Under the orders of the man who has been christened the \"Boche Pope\", Mgr.

For him this was the beginning of a long diplomatic career entirely devoted to pro- moting German hegemony in Europe, a career that he was to pursue under Pius XI before assuming himself the tiara. Bu t no matter how Germanophile his predecessors might have appear ed, it can be said that the student surpassed his masters. The scheme failed, thanks to Clemenceau's obstinacy . The Treaty of Versailles, in July 1919, put the finishing touc h to the defeat of His Holiness's champions. The Pope had in fact nothing to do with working out plans for the new Europe—a circumstance which is not difficul t to understand; but—and this is significant—this ban was primarily due to Italy, the most fervent Catholic of all the allied Powers.

He was to stir up Fascism, then Nazism, and, with Mgr. Pacelli, to prepare the 1939-1945 war of revenge.

Tiso, C hief of the Slovak State, asserting his intention to set up Slo vakia according to a Christian plan, is greatly appreciated by the Holy See'.\" On the other hand, at the Liberation, this good wor k met with less success amongst the Allies. Delivered by the A mericans to Czechoslovakia, the worthy ecclesiastic, expert in setting up states \"according to a Christian plan\", was condemned to d eath by the Prague Tribunal in 1946 and hanged there and then. It was doubtless the first time in history that a d ignitary of the Roman Church was to be seen swinging at the end of a rope as punishment for his crimes. But what should be said of the Holy See's \"apprecia tion\" ? Was Pius XII, who \" knew nothing\"—so he said—of the Ger man atrocities, also unaware of those of his prelate? M oreover, this is not the complete list of the horrors that were perp etrated under the approving eye of the Holy Father's representatives, if not under their instructions. In this respect, it will later be seen that Mgr. Stepinac's Croatia was in no way inferior to Mgr. T iso's Slovakia. In both these two unhappy countries, the Roman Chur ch was incontestably all-powerful. ... It was Tiso, the ch ief provided by the Roman Church, who gave the signal for deportati ons of Jews to the death camps. Lord Russell of Liverpool, 15 who was a legal adviser in the cases of the war criminals, tells in the following terms what happened to these Jews: \"In 1941, at Auschwitz, the first contingent of Jew s arrived from Slovakia and High Silesia and those who were not ca pable of working were immediately sent to the gas chamber in one of the rooms of the building which housed the crematorial ovens.\" Thus, with all due deference to the Holy Father's a pologists, the fact is well established for the edification of his torians: the first supplier to Auschwitz was a Catholic prelate.

O N 10 February 1939, Pius XI died, a little too early to see the outbreak of the most gigantic drama of modern times , which he had so long and so laboriously prepared by opening the road to the conquering dictatorships. On 12 March, it was the t urn of his right- hand man—or rather his accursed soul—Mgr. Eugenio P acelli, to don the tiara, and herein lies one more proof of th e continuity of a Vatican policy entirely founded on German hegemony in Europe.. . . It is not unimportant to know that Eugenio Pacelli was born of a Roman family which included many personalities from the Pontifical States and from the Curia. This readily explains th e specifically ecclesiastic character of his looks. Much could be said on this subject, and the photograph here reproduced, or any other as good, is a subject of interest to the amateur of physiogn omy, that neglected art. But there is no need to vie with a Porta, a La vater or a Duchenne de Boulogne to discern the narrow link between this mask, strangely imperious and cruel, and what we know — or are abou t to learn — of its owner.

It is well enough kn own that here was the focal point of many events that were to dis rupt Europe—or. if one prefers another picture, the bomb that was t o explode a few years later. \"Never will the spiritual have more openly declared that it was to march in the service of the temporal\", wrote Cha rles Maurras in Action Francaise, on 26 July 1933, the day after th e Concordat had been signed between Hitler's Germany and the Holy S ee. by Franz von Papen and Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli.

The key to this enigma is given us by Alexandre Lenotre: 6 \"During the entire inter-war period, Rome's foreign policy, more and more directly inspired by the Jesuits, is in al most all fields opposed to Paris. Indeed, the Vatican thoroughly su pports the wars of Italian Fascism against Ethiopia and Republican Spain. . . . \"In 1937, however, a strange campaign develops arou nd the personality of the Pontifical Legate Pacelli, on of ficial mission at Lisieux. The negotiator of the 1933 concordat with Hitler is presented not only as 'a great friend of France' but as 'a le ftist'. . . . His election, once achieved, is represented as a succes s for France. In fact, it is a disaster. The 1939 conclave is the co nclave of dupes for the French ministers who were magnificently cheated by the General of the Jesuits Ledochowski. . . . \"Having become Pius XII, Pacelli is seen to be an o ut and out pro-integrist and Germanophile.

Italy was throwing herself upon Albania to absorb her. . . . \"On 22 May 1939, at Berlin was signed the treaty of military alliance between Germany and Italy, which was given the spectacular name of 'The Steel Pact'....\" This brings us to the ineluctable issue. The dupes of Munich are about to pay for their serious mistakes. Hitler, ob viously, had never intended to keep his word; pushed to extremes, the English and the French will retaliate this time; the catastrophe is imminent—but Pius XII utters not a word.

At the Liberation, as we know, all the newspapers t hat had published under the German occupation were suppress ed. 'La Croix'' alone was excepted from this measure. Was t his the reward for having printed such texts ? This question should be put to Mr, de Menthon, one of the chiefs of the religious (M.R.P.) party, and at that time Keeper of the Seal. Indeed, let us see what Artaban of 13 Dec ember 1957 has to say: \"For four years, 'La Croix' was drawing upon the se cret funds of the 'Head of enslaved France'. An original document duly photo- graphed shows a monthly subsidy of 160,000 francs f or 1943—i.e., 1,920,000 francs for the year.

The affair was brought before the tribunal of the Chamber on 13 March 1946 (see J.O.D.P., pp. 713-714 ) and it was then learned that Mr. de Menthon, Minister of Justi ce and fiery reformer of the French press, had exerted pressure in favour of 'La Croix'. . . .\" Artaban also stresses a fact of vital importance: \" 'La Croix' used to receive orders from the German Lieutenant Sahm and, at Vichy, from Pierre Laval.\""},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"THE BETRAYAL OF FRANCE 185 Apparently, these orders were very much like those of the Holy Father, who expressed his satisfaction by saying: \"The Pope sends his blessing to 'La Croix', the org an of 'pontifical thought'.\" (La Croix, 28 January 1942). Is this not sufficiently clear? * * * The Episcopate, it goes without saying, did not exp ress itself any differently from the official organ of the Holy See. This may be seen from a few quotations: —\"Today, in the face of immense disaster, all Frenc hmen feel that the national Rebirth calls for a vigorous rene wal of our moral value. They expect the Church to play its important role in this urgent task of salvation. . . . Catholic Action mus t be given a more important place.\" (Cardinal Gerlier, Archbishop of Lyons, Primat des Gaules). —\"In mid-November 1940, Cardinal Baudrillart, fully supported by Cardinal Suhard, asked me to bring to Marshal Pe tain a letter in which the Rector was assuring the Chief of the Stat e of his devotion, friendship and complete loyalty.

There were monks, Franciscans and Jesuit s, who led these assassins and exhorted them to murder, brandi shing the cross in one hand and the \"mauser\" or cut-throat's knife in the other. The Inquisition, as we shall soon see, was a feeble instrument compared with the horrors that were now to be perpe trated by the adherents of the Roman Catholic Church. * * * It will be recalled that in 1941 Yugoslavia was inv aded and dismembered by Hitler and Mussolini. The Germans an d Italians shared Slovenia and Dalmatia; the northern part of the country, Voivodina, was ceded to Hungary; the southern part (Kossovo) to Albania; and Macedonia to Bulgaria. Along with Croa tia, Dal- matia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Srem were turned into a Fascist satellite state: the so-called Independent State of Croatia. At its head was placed Ante Pavelitch, Chief of the Croati an Fascists: the \"Ustashis\". This name has a sinister sound and indeed, during the inter-war period it was heard all too often, fi rst in connexion with numerous murders in Yugoslavia, then in 1934, when followers of this terrorist gang assassinated King Alexander I and Louis Barthou (the French Foreign Minister) in Marseilles . \"Mussolini's Government having clear connexions with the instiga tors of the crime . . .\" as Francois Charles-Roux 3 reminds us, the French Government vainly requested the extradition of Ante Pavelitch who had taken refuge in Italy. This gangleader was indeed working for Italy, which was pursuing its traditional policy of expansion along the Adria tic Coast; and, of course, the Vatican was equally interested in the s uccess of this policy. Even when this territory was still only one of the badly-assembled units of the Habsburg Empire, its Catholic-Orthodox duality was a sore spot in the ancient monarchy.

Indeed, on 18 May 1941 , when Pope Pius XII received Ante Pavelitch and his band of ki llers with all due honour, the massacre of the Orthodox was already in full swing in Croatia, concurrently with the forced conversions t o Catholicism.

It is that of a surv ivor, Jednak Ljuban, who told us the story of the fatal hours th rough which he lived in the tragic church of Glina: 'The Ustashis gathered a few hundred peasants from my village and from the outsk irts and took us to Topusko.

Stepinac's trial On 18 September 1946, the Yugoslav Government order ed the arrest of Mgr. Stepinac, Archbishop of Zagreb and P rimate of the Catholic Church in Yugoslavia. This measure was tak en after the Croatian Supreme Tribunal had heard the statements of those who were accused of war crimes and who belonged to the \"White Crusaders\" group of Stepinac's secretary, Father Iv an Salitch. These statements ran as follows: 'The Archbishopric is the centre of terrorist activ ity\", declared Father Superior Modesto Martinchitch, Provincial of the Fran- ciscans. \"Archbishop Stepinac's palace at Zagreb is the cent re of Ustashi, 'White Crusader' and terrorist activity\", affirmed Father Ivan Salitch. To the Prosecutor's question: \"What does the Archbi shop want?\", Father Ivan Salitch replied: \"He wants an Independe nt State of Croatia, like that created by the Ustashis and the Italians.\" Speaking of Colonel Erik Lisak, who clandestinely r eturned to Yugoslavia after the Liberation, Father Ivan Salitc h added: \"Colonel Lisak has passed the night at the Archbishop's pala ce and has had the banner of the 'White Crusaders' put up in the A rchbishop's chapel.\" The other accused confirmed that Mgr. Stepinac had played \"an active role of instigator and accomplice\" in their terrorist organiza- tion, which aimed to overthrow the Yugoslav regime. War criminal Charles Pichon 24 tells how the trial went. \"The trial of Mgr. Stepinac opened in September at Zagreb. The Archbishop was expecting this trial.... In a pastor al letter dated 24 Histoire du Vatican, pp. 389 to 393."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"216 THE VATICAN AGAINST EUROPE July 1946, he declared: '. . . It matters little to me if one day I find myself on the list of \"war criminals\". . . .' \"The trial took place at Zagreb College. The accuse d refused to reply. ... On 11 October the Court found him guilty of having incited the Catholic clergy to collaboration with t he Ustashi puppet regime, of having in his capacity as Chairman of th e Conference of Bishops and President of the Catholic press, writte n numerous articles of 'Fascist tendencies', of having 'served the Ustashi cause by provoking racial hatred', of having incited the Croatian people to collaborate with the Ustashis, of having given ' numerous and palpable proofs of his sympathy and collaboration w ith the Ustashis'. of having presided over the commission of three mem bers which directed the initial forced conversions of Serbian citizens. . . . The President of the Tribunal stipulated that, under th e influence of Mgr. Stepinac, other ecclesiastics had organized Us tashi units and 'crusaders' with a view to conducting terrorist act ivity against the existing regime. The Archbishop was, in consequence , condemned to sixteen years' hard labour, with loss of all civ ic rights for a period of five years and the confiscation of all his prope rty. . . .\" The \"clear conscience\" of the Archbishop of Zagreb \"To plead ignorance would have been absurd. No one is better informed of the happenings and the state of mind of the population than a high dignitary of the Church.

Nor was anyone able to prove the innoce nce of the Church's servants in face of the dreadful mass assa ssinations perpetrated in Croatia—the outcome of a cold politi cal calculation and a savage religious mystique. \"Archbishop Stepinac backed the Croatian Ustashi St ate with all the weight of his authority.

They were the creatures of Italian Fascism and were organized well before the war in Italy and Hungary. Could Archbishop Stepinac and his 'clear conscience' justify the unconditional support which he had given to the Ustashis ? . . . \"Stepinac concealed in his own palace the archives belonging to Pavelitch's Government. He equally hid the Ustashi treasures, fruits of pillage: thirty cases of gold pieces, which bore a sinister resemblance to the contents of the cases found in the Reichsban k cellars. \"But what lost Stepinac, was mainly his illusion of being able to launch against the new State a sort of insurrection of crusaders, made up of the few remaining Ustashi troops. It may well be asked what government in the world could continue to clos e its eyes to such acts, even if an archbishop were concerned. . . .\" 25 Beneath the sacred vaults \"If you have been plundering for four years\", write s Herve Lauriere, 26 \"you never cover up everything.

Herve Lauriere 28 gives us the reply: \"No less than 4,000 Ustashis—Pavelitch, his ministe rs, generals, chiefs of police, commandants of the concentration camps, execu- tioners and torturers—fled to Austria and Italy. Th ey left behind them thousands of burning, plundered and deserted v illages, and, in the cellars, caves, precipices, and in the grave s dug in the fields, just how many hundreds of thousands of bodies no on e will ever know.

Were their consciences so guil ty that they should abandon their own country in this way? Had t hey really committed so many terrible crimes? \"For a long while\", writes Herve Lauriere, 29 Ante Pavelitch went into hiding—with his gold—in the monastery of Saint Gilgen, near Salzburg, and the monastery of Bad-Ischl, near Linz , in Austria. He wore his cassock with dignity. Later, still disguis ed as a priest, he went to Italy, where, until 1948, he lived in Rome under the name of Pater Gomez and Pater Benarez, in a monastery which enjoyed the privilege of exterritoriality. Thanks to the Roman clergy, in November 1948 he was able to embark on an Italian boat for B uenos-Aires. He arrived in Argentina with a passport that had been issued by the International Red Cross in Rome on 5 July 1948 in t he name of Pal (Pablo) Aranyos. Other Ustashis, less fortunate tha n he, ended up in concentration camps which the Allies had had to organize in central Europe. ... It was not long before these ca mps were being visited by pious travellers from Rome. . . . This b and went from camp to camp, taking particular interest in the war criminals, in the important people of the former 'Independent Sta te of Croatia', and in their most bloodthirsty executioners. It ena bled two abomin- able individuals to escape from the camp at Fermo. The first, Ljubo Milos—the 'human hyena'—was responsible for t he death of over 120,000 people at the camp of Jasenovac. As for the other, the hideous Luburitch, he had been one of the hangm en of Sarajevo and in a single morning had had 56 people hanged on the town's electric pilons .... Soon, the Ustashi mob was leav ing the camps en masse, often clothed, like Pavelitch, in a casso ck. Their rescuers led them to where they were being awaited. \"In Austria, these Ustashis found a sure refuge in the monastery of the Franciscan Fathers of Klagenfurt, in that of Sa nta-Catholica, and so on. . . .

There, as nowhere else, the Roma n Church put aside its mask of gentleness and revealed its true countenance—a countenance of blind ambition and pitiless fanatici sm. Do we have to draw attention once more to the fact that the members of that Church who sat during four years in the Ustashi Parliament could, in pursuance of article 139-4 of the Canon Law. have accepted this mandate only if duly authorized by the Pope to do so? Must it again be recalled that the Holy Fath er never once reprimanded his good servants? And who could believ e that the innumerable priests and monks who were preaching ma ssacre would have persevered in their hysterical zeal had they felt in any way disowned, even tacitly, by their hierarchical s uperiors and their supreme chief, Pius XII ? To be sure, he never thought of disowning them, and the heinous Pavelitch, the \"adored guide\" of Mgr. Saritch, Cath olic Archbishop of Sarajevo, could rightfully take advantage of the flattering words, encouragement and blessings which the Holy Father s howered upon him. No doubt much would be given today to be able to eradicate their trace. But they remain, well and tr uly printed in the Croatian papers of the time. The audience granted o n 18 May 1941 to the Ustashi general staff was but a prelude to t he Pope's ever increasing manifestations of sympathy towards his p ious assassins: \"The Ustashi youth of the 'Crusaders', 206 strong a nd in uniform, was received in audience by the Pope on 6 February 1942, in one of the Vatican's most imposing rooms.

(Such humanitarian sentiments, coming as they do from the pen of this murderer, are particul arly edifying.) The Pope replied very cordially, \"praying God for t he happiness of the Croatian people\". 34 Doubtless the Serbian Orthodox Christians and Serbian Jews massacred by the Ustashis in hundr eds of thou- sands were not included in these good wishes. In 1944, the following telegram was sent by the Pop e to Pavelitch: \"The wishes which you and the Croatian people have expressed to Us, upon the occasion of the fifth anniversary o f Our Pontificate, are very dear to Us, and We pray that God may bless you with His most gracious gifts.\" 35 The Holy Father had many another opportunity to pro claim the high esteem in which he held the blood-thirsty pogl avnik. In 1943, he granted an audience to D. Sinsitch, Member of th e Ustashi Government; and E. Lobkowicz, representing the Croa tian State at the Vatican, summarized the interview as follows in his report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Zagreb: \"At the close of our conversation the Pope declared that he was 31 Katolicki Tjednik (the Catholic Weekly) 15 and 22 F ebruary 1942. 31 Hrvatskl Narod, 21 March 1942. 32 Katolicki List (Catholic Newspaper) No. 3, 1943. 33 Hrvatski Narod, 17 March 1943. 34 Katolicki List, No. 23, 1943. 35 Hrvatski Narod. 21 March 1944."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"222 THE VATICAN AGAINST EUROPE most happy to have had the opportunity to talk with Pavelitch and that it was a great joy to hear on all sides that h e is a 'practising Catholic'.

The Pope replied: 'I shall be happy to give him that blessin g'.\" It should be noted that in 1943, Pavelitch had alre ady been \"practising\" Catholicism for two years, by systemat ically carrying out the torture and extermination of the Orthodox c lergy and their flock. But this chief of killers was not alone in receivin g the apostolic blessing. Pius XII, in his great goodness, extended it to the most unpretentious executants. The Osservatore Romano 36 tells us that on 22 July 1941 the Pope received a hundred agents of the Croatian State Police, led by the Zagreb Chief of Police, Eu gen Kvaternik- Dido. This group of Croatian SS constituted the cre am of the hangmen and torturers operating in the concentratio n camps, and he who presented them to the Holy Father committed such unspeak- able horrors that his mother committed suicide in d espair. It may be imagined with what immense zeal these \"go od people\", once armed with the apostolic blessing, endeavoured to \"practise\" in the fullest sense of the term. Indeed, as early as August 1941, the Minister of Re ligion, Mile Budak, who was regarded as Pavelitch's \"dauphin\", d eclared, during a public conference at Karlovac: \"The Ustashi movem ent is based on religion. All our activity is based upon our dev otion to religion and to the Roman Catholic Church.\" In reality, all this goes to prove not only that Pi us XII was closely following the development of that activity, but als o that he approved it. Indeed, one would have to be singularly naive n ot to understand the role played at Zagreb by Father Marcone. Legate of the Holy See, Sancti Sedis Legatus (as he described himself in his relationship with the Ustashi Government), he was thus, in terms of the Canon Law, the Pope's alter ego.

The scenario hardly ever varied: after a few massacres had been judiciously perpetrated in a particular region, there would arrive an evangelizing priest o r monk, accom- panied by a group of Ustashis, and this apostle, ad dressing the terrorized peasants, would always use the same sort of language as the monk, Ambrozije Novak, when he spoke to the villagers of"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"224 THE VATICAN AGAINST EUROPF Mostanica: \"Serbs, you are all condemned to death, but you can save yourselves from death by becoming converted to Catholicism.\" This simple and practical procedure no doubt repres ented what the Episcopate understood by: \"Creating favourable psychological conditions\".

In this way 240,000 Orthodox Christians, all struck by a sudden illumin ation, were able to cry out, as in Polyeucte: I see, I know, I believe, I am undeceived! On the other hand, and in accordance with the progr amme, 300,000 were deported and more than 500,000 massacr ed. However, admirably enough, the same collective grac e was miraculously spreading over the members of the Gree k faith. These schismatics were also pouring into the bosom of the Roman Catholic Church \"without the slightest pressure and through deep- seated conviction with regard to the truths of the Catholic faith\", as prescribed by paragraph 8 of the Episcopate reso lutions. Thus at Kamensko, in the very diocese of Mgr. Stepinac, 400 people— 400 strayed sheep—returned to the fold as one man, under the fond eye of the Prefect, the Chief of Police and the rep resentatives of various Ustashi groups. When announcing this massive conversion, Radio Vati can, on 12 June 1942, affirmed that it was \"spontaneous and wi thout the slightest pressure on the part of the civil or eccl esiastical authorities\". * * * Yet, after the war, the Holy See was soon to realiz e that the \"spontaneity\", the \"deep-seated conviction\" of the 240,000 converts"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":" Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, Secretary of State of the Vatican, who later became Pope Pius XII"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":" Archbishop Stepinac and the pontifical legate Marco ne attending a military parade in Zagreb, surrounded by Italian, G erman and Ustashi Officers"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":" An archbishop with the murderer of his king In 1934, Ante Pavelitch played a leading part in th e assassination at Marseilles of his monarch, King Alexander of Yugoslavia"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"The pontifical legate Marcone and Pavelitch receive the Nazi salute from a group of young Ustashis "},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"MONSEIGNEUR STEPINAC'S CROATIA 225 might well be doubted, even by those who remained f ully convinced of the miracles of grace.

Instructions were th erefore modified as a consequence, and today there is not a single a pologist of Pius XII who does not know the new \"line\" to be taken. I t is now admitted that these mass conversions were not all \" sincere and obtained without the slightest pressure\", but if th e Roman Catholic Church did violence to conscience in this way it wa s out of pure charity, to deliver these poor souls from the wrath of the Ustashis, and to save them from the famous special knife whic h the Fran- ciscan Filipovitch and his emulators were wielding with such agility. (We are not told, however, whether or not these good monks, like those who were preaching murder, were also act ing out of charity; but surely they must have been, since they in no way incurred the blame of their hierarchical superiors.) Now, everything is clear—if not theologically, at l east in a way most honourable to the Holy Father. He, who, in his humanitarian ardour, went as far as to forget his duty, to tramp le on the \"doctrine\" and to violate the most sacred canons, by accepting in the bosom of the Roman Church hundreds of thousands of wretch es who had been falsely converted. Out of pure kindness, he to ok the sacrilege upon himself, thus jeopardizing his eternal salvati on.

But we must admit that we have been incapable of detecting it. * * * To revert to Croatia, the Roman Church was actively engaged in increasing its flock there, in perfect agreement with the Ustashi Government. It was thus that Mgr. Janko Simrak, one of Mgr. Stepinac's coadjutors in the Committee for the Conv ersion of Orthodox Christians, was received on 14 July 1941 b y Pius XII, named by him Bishop of Krizevci, and then decorated by Pavelitch with the \"Grand Cross and Star\", which was accompan ied by this citation: \"For his devoted service among his clergy and flock and for his sincere collaboration with the State author ities in true Ustashi spirit\". The \"Catholicization\" was proceeding splendidly, an d Mgr.

As Catholics you will re main peacefully in your homes and you will be unhindered in your da ily occupa- tions\". As may be seen, this good propagandist did not burd en himself with idle circumlocutions. Yet—many were called but they were by no means all chosen. On 30 June 1941, the Government had issued to the C atholic Bishops an instruction (No. 48468/41) defining the conditions under which the town halls or the police, upon receipt of a favourable recommendation from the Ustashi organizations, were to deliver the certificates of honesty required by the Orthodo x Christians desirous of conversion. This instruction contained, inter alia, the following: §3.—In issuing these certificates, care must be tak en not to hand them to the rich Orthodox priests, tradesmen, workm en or peasants, or to Orthodox intellectuals in general, unless the ir personal honesty(!) can be proved, the Government having ado pted the principle that certificates be refused to this cate gory of person. §4.—The peasants shall obtain this declaration with out difficulty, save in exceptional cases. The Bishopric of Zagreb (that of Mgr. Stepinac) in its letter No. 9259/41 dated 16 July 1941 recognized the merit s of this dis- crimination : \"Regarding the conversion of priests, teachers, tra desmen and intellectuals generally, as well as that of well-to -do Orthodox Serbs, it is essential that extreme caution be exercised o ver their accep- tance....\" We are not especially qualified in Canon Law, but w e have never heard that it authorizes the acceptance or rejectio n of conversion according to the candidate's social class. What can this mean other than that the integrity of the \"doctrine\" was once more being sacrificed to eminently opportu nistic con-"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"228 THE VATICAN AGAINST EUROPE siderations? It is easy to understand that the Usta shi Government was not concerned to see either the intellectual Se rbs escape its claws under the cover of conversion to Catholicism, or, in particular, to see the rich tradesmen and peasants thus save th eir goods from plunder. However good \"practising\" Catholics Pavelitch and h is hired assassins might have been, they did not for all tha t forget the money interest. The Croatian Episcopate, Mgr. Stepinac in the lead, made ample allowance for this . . . financial . . . point of v iew, and Father Marcone, the Pope's Legate, had nothing against it. Heavenly \"grace\" was thus not permitted to work miracles amo ng those Serbs who were too well provided with temporal good s, and, for the first time perhaps, the Church observed to the letter the words of the Divine Master: \"It is more difficult for a r ich man to enter into Heaven than for a camel to pass through the ey e of a needle\". * * * Yet the time came for the debacle of the Axis and o f this Independ- ent!) State of Croatia which, thanks to the combine d efforts of the Ustashis and the Roman Church, had for a while almo st achieved its own kind of \"Civitas Dei\". Thenceforth the Vati can propaganda went all out to try to prove the innocence of Mgr. Stepinac—and, incidentally, of Pius XII—in the eyes of world opin ion. But what are subterfuge and gratuitous affirmations compared with so many officially established deeds and words? As it happe ned, the Arch- bishop of Zagreb remained to the very end the sures t pillar of the puppet state and of its regime. On 7 July 1944, according to Fiorello Cavalli, 38 he declared: \"The Croatian people is shedding its blood for its State and it will preserve and keep its State. No one must be de terred by the many acts against the Croatian people and its auton omy but, on the contrary, all should join with renewed vigour i n defending and strengthening the State.\" And it was at this very time, when the satellite st ate was nearing its end, that the Ustashi Government decorated Mgr. Stepinac with 38 Il processo dell 'arcivescovo di Zagrabia (La Civil ta Cattolica, the Jesuit paper, Rome 1946, p. 77)"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"MONSEIGNEUR STEPINAC'S CROATIA 229 the \"Grand Cross and Star\" which he so proudly wore (Decree Oc. B. III, No. 552, 1944). The Croatian Episcopate, also, maintained its attit ude in its pastoral letter of 24 March 1945. It is a known fact that Mgr. Stepinac was thinking of accepting power from the hands of Pavelitch, when the advance of the Resistants towards Zagreb completely destroyed this plan. At all events, before fleeing with the routed German troop s, Pavelitch entrusted his valiant supporter with the care of th e defunct state's archives—films, records of his speeches, and, in pa rticular, cases of gold nuggets, jewels, watches, etc. . . . which were, as has already been seen, later found in the Archbishop's palace. The Church had refused her protection to the legitimate owners of this property, but she did not haggle over offering it to the property itself. . . . * * * The wondrous deeds of the Archbishop of Zagreb coul d not fail to bring their reward: the Cardinal's hat. On 18 December 1952, in his speech to the Foreign A ffairs Committee of the Yugoslav Federal Assembly, Mr. Edw ard Kardelj, Minister of Foreign Affairs, accused Stepinac of be ing a war criminal with a vast number of victims on his consc ience: 229 Orthodox churches destroyed, 129 Orthodox ecclesias tics killed and hundreds of thousands of Orthodox Christians massac red. He accused the Vatican of having sought, by naming him cardinal, to provoke religious intolerance in Yugoslavia and to undermine the unity of the Yugoslav people. This elevation of Ante Pavelitch's best collaborato r is indeed sufficiently eloquent. But the Holy Father's satisf ecit did not end here. He took no steps to forget the man who had so well \"Catholic- ized\" Croatia, and on 5 November 1955 La Croix anno unced: \"Upon the occasion of his sacerdotal silver wedding , His Holiness Pius XII has sent the following message to His Emin ence Cardinal Stepinac, Archbishop of Zagreb, who, as we recalled yesterday, is still detained in enforced residence in his native village of Krasic and unable to exercise his pastoral functions: 'We formulate paternal wishes for you, dear son, you who are at the end of the twenty-fifth"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"230 THE VATICAN AGAINST EUROPE year of your ministry, and who have acquired such w orthiness, and whose firm virtues We praise. In the trial you are enduring, We pray the Saviour to grant you His comfort, and We a ffectionately send you Our apostolic blessing'.\" * * * Such was the Croatian crusade and, with all due def erence to the fine Sacristy minds that are so keen to contradict the evidence, the responsibility of the Holy See is clearly written t here, in indelible characters, from beginning to end. It would indeed require exceptional impudence to re present the Vatican as \"opposed\" to the Ustashi regime, when al l the testimonies and documents confirm its perfect understanding wit h these \"Assassins in the name of God\", as Herve Lauriere s o aptly called them. There were two, and only two, men among the C roatian Catholic clergy who rose up against the horrors com mitted by these torturers: they were the Bishop of Mostar, Mgr. Alo is Misitch, and a priest from Zagreb, Josip Loncar. Of course, ther e was no sign of approbation from the Vatican to reward their ino pportune charity, and it may well be doubted that Mgr. Misit ch will ever be made cardinal. On the other hand, not one of the me n of religion who preached murder, or who committed it with their own hands, was blamed, punished or banished from the Church. We could look in vain for the slightest mark of rep robation, or even of reservation, on the part of Pius XII throug hout the gory tragedy, from the time of Ante Pavelitch's receptio n at the Vatican on 18 May 1941 to the praises showered even in rece nt years upon Mgr. Stepinac, whose \"apostolate shines with the pu rest brightness\", according to the Holy Father. The main point, obvio usly, is to agree upon the meaning of this word \"purity\", altho ugh the happen- ings in Croatia at that time are sufficient to disp el any ambiguity. 39 Has the world ever seen a clearer record than that of those four cruel years of evangelization by iron and by fire, four years during which Father Marcone, Legate to the Pope, never cea sed to occupy 39 ln the diocese of Gornji Karlovac (under the Archbi shopric of Mgr. Stepinac) comprising 420,000 Orthodox Serbs, 280,000 were killed, 50,000 took refuge in the mountains and about 50,000 were able to be sent to Serbia.

Is not the silence systematically observed by Pius XII towards the victims of the gigantic killing also significan t? Not a word of pity was there, no more than of blame for their mur derers, whether ecclesiastics or laymen. They are surely very moderate, who wish to see in t his attitude of the Pope nothing but a guilty inertia or a passi ve complacency. In fact, all this reeks of premeditated crime. No o ne can be made to believe that that terror, in which the Croatian Catholic clergy collaborated so passionately, could have come about without the express wish of the Holy See. Is fecit cui prodest, says the old judiciary adage: the crime has been committed by hi m that benefits thereby. Who was benefiting by the mass exterminati on of the Orthodox Christians, by their deportation or their forced conversion, if not the Roman Catholic Church, which was thus pu rsuing its secular dream: the extension of its influence towar ds the East ? The end warrants the means: it was necessary to kill in order to reign. Nothing was denied to this cause. Today The Ustashis who have taken refuge in France are th e subject of special solicitude on the part of the Roman Church and of certain politicians. In Paris, the Union of Croatian Worker s is affiliated to the \"Confederation Generale des Travailleurs Chreti ens\". They have in addition formed the two associations, \"Aloi s Stepinac\" and \"Stjepan Radic\". A paragraph which appeared in Fran ce Catholique of 19 December 1958 leaves no doubt concerning the support given to these separatists by the highest of religious au thorities: \"To exalt the greatness and heroism of His Eminence Car dinal Stepinac, a big meeting will take place on 21 December 1958, at 4 p.m., in the Crypt of S.

The confession This meeting had for its particular object the dist ribution among the Croatian colony in Paris of a recent work by Fa ther Dragun, prefaced by Mgr. Rupp, Cardinal Feltin's coadjutor. Judging by the title, Le Dossier du cardinal Stepin ac (Cardinal Stepinac's File) it might at first be thought that the author had attempted to be objective—but this would be a great mistake. The presence in Zagreb of the very important person tha t was the Pontifical Legate Marcone is passed over in silence , as with all the apologists, in fact—which is quite understandable w hen one knows that Pavelitch received this personal representativ e of Pius XII as one of the family (see photograph). Moreover, in this large tome, one is sure of findin g, abundantly commented, the pleadings of Mgr. Stepinac's two law yers, but there is no sign of either the bill of indictment or the charge. Father Dragun makes one solitary allusion to these primord ial documents, with the obvious intention of whitewashing Mgr. Ste pinac—but, as it happens, it is only the more compromising for th e Holy See: \"The Prosecutor himself, in his charge quotes the S ecretary of State of the Holy See, Cardinal Maglione, who already in 1942 had advised Archbishop Stepinac 'to establish more cord ial and more sincere relations with the Ustashi authorities'.\" ( pp. 32 and 137). So, when he was at table at the home of Pavelitch, Head of the killer-apostles, the Sancti Sedis legatus was but o beying papal orders.

And how di d this rather dull man of meagre intelligence accede to a State p ost second in importance only to Hitler's? He belonged to a family which was entirely devoted to the Church. His father had been the head of a Catholic school a t Munich, before he became private tutor to Prince Ruprecht o f Bavaria, in that royal court where his uncle, the Jesuit Father Himmler, had been canon; and his brother, a Benedictine monk, wa s living in the famous monastery of Maria Laach. In fact, it was th is brother who acted as liaison agent between Dom Ildefonso Herweg en, Abbot of the monastery, and their Uncle, the former canon. Knowing this, it is easier to understand that Kurt Heinrich Himmler, an odd person in himself, should have been able to rise to the highest functions. Someone must have been pu lling this puppet's strings. Was it not his uncle, the Jesuit father, who had been promoted high-ranking officer of the SS? 1 La politique des Jesuites (Grasset, Paris 1955, p. 131)."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"250 THE VATICAN AGAINST EUROPE And was not the latter the very eye and arm of Halk e von Ledo- chowski, 2 General of his Order, in the so sadly famous polic e services: Gestapo (Geheime Staats Polizei—State Sec ret Police), the Security Service SS, the Central Jewish Emigrat ion Office (execution of the scheme for exterminating the Jews ) ? In fact, a certain special organ was taking shape a t the heart of the Central Service of the Security Service SS, wit h Catholic priests occupying almost all the important posts—and these priests were wearing the black uniform of SS officers. Who, then, was sending so many million deportees to death? Was it Heinrich Himmler or his uncle, the former Ba varian canon ? It would really seem that here lies the conducting wire linking Borgo Santo Spirito No. 5, office of the Jesuit Fuhrer, a nd Leipzigerstrasse No. 86, office of the SS Reichsfuhrer. After the capitulation of the Third Reich, Heinrich Himmler's uncle was arrested and transferred to the prison of Nuremberg. But he never appeared before the international trib unal which tried the war criminals. One morning, he was found dead i n his cell. One never knew whether this was a case of suicide o r of opportune execution. The conspiracy of silence was such that nothing ever transpired of this strange death. The political schemes of von Ledochowski and Mgr. P acelli \"On the morrow of the Great War\", writes the Tribun e des Nations, \"the General of the Jesuits, Ledochowski, conceived a vast plan, still known as the 'Ledochowski Plan'—it is a lso called the 'Habsburg Plan'—for the creation, with or without a Habsburg Emperor, of a federation of the Catholic nations of central and eastern Europe: Austria, Slovakia, Bohemia, Poland, Hungary, Croatia, and also—this is most important—Bavaria. . . .

In 1915, as General of the Jesuits, he succeeded Father Wernz, who was Prussian.

This youthful dream of Pius XII seems thus to have haunted him all his life and to have inspired his entire po litics, both before and after his elevation to the throne of Saint Pete r. He saw in the obscure agitator of Munich, whom he c aused to accede to power and whom he upheld against all prin ciples, the \"secular arm\" who would make this dream come true. * * * The testimony of Raymond de Becker, 4 the repentant Rexist who was condemned after the Liberation, has exploded th e myth which was spread by Vatican propaganda—i.e., that the Cat holic Church was persecuted by the Germans during the years 1933 to 1954. During a journey in the Reich, before the war, he w as able to convince himself that this was in no way true: \"The churches were packed with worshippers, and the priests were continuing to receive their pay from the State and were enjoying a liberty to preach which was quite disconcerting.\" And still Raymond de Becker forgets to add that, on important religious occasions, banners bearing the Swastika w ere seen being carried in great pomp into the Catholic churches, a nd that they were even blessed by the clergy.

From Paraguay, where he stayed for some time after his departure from Argentina, he went to Spain—with that facility of movement, of crossing frontiers, for oneself and one's \"capital\" enjoyed by certain figures who are strongly protect ed by the Roman Church.

We shall therefore summarize what we have already p ublished on this subject, and would refer the reader to the above-mentioned work for any details or references. While the public may know that the Roman Church has landed property, in general it is far from imagining how m uch. Is it realized for instance, that in Italy the Church owns 250,000 ha?—that one-third of the land in Spain is hers ?—and that i n South America she owns vast expanses? And this does not include i nnumerable other properties spread over the rest of the globe. But today, it is less important that the question o f landed property should be studied; it is its financial force that c ounts. Already Peter's pence from 400 million faithful, offerings and masses ensure the Holy See a revenue that may be termed astronomi cal. This source of wealth which is ceaselessly flowing into the Vatican coffers has given rise to an accumulation of capita l. And, as is 1 Le Vatican centre la France (Fischbacher, Paris 195 7)."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"292 THE VATICAN AGAINST EUROPE rightly pointed out by Roger Garaudy, to whom we ar e indebted for some precious revelations in the question of ho ly finance: \"There is but one step from accumulation to speculation\". 2 This step was, in fact, taken a long time ago, for as early as the seventeenth century the Pontifical States had their own bank, the \"Banco di Santo Spirito\", But today this establishm ent, with its unexpected invocation of the Paraclete, is but a mo dest cog in the gigantic holding constituted by the Vatican's finan cial organization. In recent years, such scandals as the currency spec ulation affair, in which Mgr. Cippico was compromised, have thrown some light on this question and have revealed first of all tha t the Vatican, through a vast network of banks, is in almost compl ete control of the Italian economy. Furthermore, the fact that the nephews of Pope Pius XII and of his predecessor were found to be occupying important jobs in the largest of these banks is qui te eloquent. \"We have unbounded trust in the charity of the fait hful. . . . But divine Providence does not dispense us from the vir tue of prudence, or from the human means at our disposal.\" These wor ds, uttered in honeyed tones by Pius XI, clearly say what they are meant to say. The \"virtue of prudence\" and \"human means\" have not failed to bring magnificent results, for the Roman Church now owns two- thirds of the buildings of Rome and invests its cap ital in all kinds of Italian undertakings: building societies, insura nce companies, electricity, chemical industries (including the man ufacture of ex- plosives), and so on . . . nor must the production of spaghetti be overlooked; indeed, a nephew of Pius XII, Prince Ma rc-Antonio Pacelli, presides over the fate of this national in dustry. Moreover, this important member of the \"black\" nobi lity is far from confining his activities to this food speciali ty. The real estate business would appear to offer a keen interest to h im—or to those he represents. . . . This is confirmed in the follo wing account: 3 \"There was that famous story of real-estate specula tions which broke out last year in Rome, implicating a big comp any which was supposed to have reaped an illicit gain of 150 mill iard francs.

Spain, South America, even Switzerland, thanks to t he \"camou- flaged\" Jesuits, are all choice lands for the finan ces of the Roman Church. Her interests in the Middle East are no sec ret, and the defence of those owned by her in Viet-Nam weighed h eavily in prolonging the disastrous war of Indo-China. In France, the Vatican favours textiles and the ban ks and— according to what Roger Garaudy tells us—it does no t disdain the impure but substantial income from the casinos. Thu s at Deauville, and especially at Monte-Carlo, games are played on sanctified gaming tables and the roulette turns \"ad majorem De i gloriam\". A thought that should console the ruined punter. While on this subject, we should piously read once again the encyclical \"Quadragesimo anno\" of the sadly missed Pius XI, vituperating the \"unrestrained cupidity\" and \"insat iable thirst after temporal goods\", which—he said—was spreading across the world. \"But the war provided a new trend to the sacred mon ies\", writes Roger Garaudy. 4 \"The war industries offered a profitable invest- ment. The precious help given by Morgan's Bank, the biggest bank in the world, which had become the Holy See's power of attorney in America, enabled the Vatican to enter the 'Anaco nda Copper' Trust, and later, the field of petrol. . . .\" Indeed, North America is the Roman Church's new Pro mised Land; a land which in the old days was so hostile t o her but where Irish and Italian immigration has now ensured—toget her with the subtle work of the Jesuits—a situation which is bec oming increas- ingly favourable. The dollar now flows into the Pop e's coffers, and the position that he took against France in Algeria and the Middle East coincided strangely with his very important in terests in foreign petrol. We shall not revert here to what we wrote in our fo rmer work 5 dealing with the almost miraculous way in which the Holy See's funds have so swelled and multiplied in a few years as to constitute the formidable financial trust that may be seen tod ay.

Finally, the closely knit network of newspapers, pe riodicals and organs of propaganda which its present opulence has enabled it to spread over the world, is by no means the least imp ortant aspect of the colossal power thus acquired by the Church. In France alone, a thousand newspapers and reviews are under its con trol, and the profusion to be observed of works on apologetics or of Vaticanist inspiration, the many articles and books singing th e praises of the Holy Father—who deigns to suffer them to be publish ed, despite the price he has to pay in Christian humility—are a s significant as the almost complete disappearance of all contradictory writings.

THE DEATH OF PIUS XII As this book (French edition) was going to press, t he death of His Holiness Pius XII, on 9 October 1958, was bringing to a close the most tragic pontificate of all times. And it may be said that the pomp of the funeral was equal to such a fate. Moreover, this \"great pope\" who was so keenly aware of the power of modern publicity could not pass away witho ut a powerfully orchestrated concert of hyperbolic praises. The fac t that the Vatican controls \"a thousand papers and reviews\" in France made the event even less likely to be overlooked. 1 It is well known just how excessive was this \"popol atry\" during his lifetime. In 1954, when the Holy Father was ser iously ill, l'Express published a letter from a Catholic lady who was sho cked by the \"exhibitionist nature of certain demonstrations\", a nd Father Avril 2 wrote on the subject: \"The authors of these dithyrambs do not realize tha t the effect produced is exactly contrary to what they intended. The chief complaint against them is that, because they do not always ev ade the ridiculous, they expose the very person they claim to glorify t o the ridicule of ill-intentioned minds. . . . My colleague. Father D eman . . . remarked in this connexion . . .: 'The Pope would do well to spurn this type of homage'.

How is it possible to explai n such an insatiable craving for adulation on the part of a man whose fi nesse no-one ever contested? Did it not respond to a profound ne ed—a need to drown beneath an uninterrupted flow of praise the m ost tragic souvenir of his entire pontificate, and even of his entire career? It would seem that this constant burning of incense in his honour was meant not only to dull the memory of his flock, but also—and before all, perhaps—to daze himself. It is charitable at least to think that this Inquis itor's soul some- times knew remorse. Thus the following passage of h is will should be understood as more than a mere \"set phrase\": \"I humbly pray for the forgiveness of those whom I might have offended, those whom I might have harmed, whom I ha ve shocked with my words or with my deeds.\" 3 However that may be, his descent into the tomb was hailed with the very same dithyrambs and toadyisms that had unf ailingly exalted him during his reign. Certain newspapers—of no less than Vatican obedience, of course—in an attempt to sanctify his memory, were even displaying a zeal which was, to say the least, unexpected. This was equally true of certain ethnic groups. . . . So much for the world's play-acting. But from among the innumer- able orisons, there shone one which had the sparkle of a pure gem: \"Pius XII, the Pope of Peace!\" All honour to the ma n who made this discovery, which has been widely reproduced, i n fact! We can only confess ourselves beaten by this master of ant iphrasis. There is another curious passage in La Croix. It de als with a certain article by don Sturzo, in which \"the old pi oneer of Italian Christian Democracy\" draws a parallel between the f uneral of Pius IX and that of Pius XII: \"He recalls the dramatic night when Pius IX's remai ns were transferred to San Lorenzo Fuori le Mura, to the in sults of the populace who tried to throw the Pontiff's body into the Tiber . . . what a difference between 1878 and 1958. . . .\" 4 A great difference, indeed, but does not the editor seem surprised 3 La Croix, 12-13 October 1958. 4 La Croix, 18 October 195S."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 301 by this?

Thus, Jean d'Hospital 5 wrote in Le Monde: \"There is an uneasiness weighing upon the memory of Pius XII.

There was widespread p andemonium at the Vatican. It seemed as if the Holy College, a fter more than nineteen years in harness, wished to lose no time i n effacing every trace of a pontificate, which, according to the thu rifers, had been so \"glorious\". Rarely has the broom been so cheerfully handled. A periodical, l'Express, 7 has very aptly summarized the matter: \"If outward appearances showed the palace of the Va tican to be as calm as usual last week, the inside might be des cribed as having been 'swept by a tidal wave', as a prelate put it. Nineteen years is a long reign for a pope, especially when he is as aut horitarian as Pius XII. Once he had gone, profound upheavals were inevitable. \"For centuries the Church had not had such an autoc ratic pope as Pius XII. He had nearly all the administrative p owers of the Vatican in his own hands; he refused to appoint a S ecretary of State —the most cherished of all posts—and governed throu gh a small number of relatives and trusted men. These included : —Mgr. Tardini, the Pope's most influential politica l adviser, who acted as Secretary of State. —Prince Carlo Pacelli, the Pope's nephew, first leg al adviser to the Congregation of the Vatican (which manages the Holy See's property) and to the pontifical commission in charg e of administer- ing the Vatican City.

Without entering into the Daedalian labyrinth of Va tican factions and intrigues, it is possible, by reading the press of that time, to obtain an idea of just how daring was La Croix's as sertion that \"the main cause of the Holy See's growing prestige resid es in the attitude, as firm as it was nuance, which the Pope had adopte d ever since 1939.\" 8 In short—even without recalling the famous saying: \"Some dead people have to be killed\"—it may be said that the m ajority of the College of Cardinals wished to make it clear that t hey were breaking away from the deeds of the deceased. • * * Nevertheless, the shade of the departed autocrat se emed still to be casting upon the conclave a kind of maleficent a ura. First, the American Cardinal Edward Mooney was struck by heart failure, they say, before the doors of the Sixtine had close d upon the voters. Then Cardinal Canali's condition gave rise to much anxiety, whilst six other prelates were more or less overcome by a strange \"Roman 'flu\".

But one wonders why the new Pope has, by the choice of his name, made a point of evo king this truculent figure. Is it because, in the list of popes establi shed according to the prophecy of Saint Malachi, his place is graced with the motto Pastor et Nauta (pope and mariner)? In this case th e new Pontiff will not have usurped the reputation of humour that has been attri- buted to him. What kind of pontificate will his be? It would be q uite useless to venture to prognosticate on the subject. All tha t can be said with certainty, is that the Holy See's policy will not b e profoundly affected by it, since its objectives will remain unchanged. Also, it would be naive to credit the \"discreet criticism\" that the H oly College ventur- ed to make on the Pastor Angelicus with more meanin g than it contains. It was politic to bring some measure of appeasement to all the fits of anger and bitterness which the bearer of th at edifying title had awakened in the world, and to let it be known t hat they were imputable solely to the autocrat and not to the ent ire Roman Curia. He alone was responsible for having made the Church the nurse of the dictators and fomenter of the stupendous drama that trans- formed Europe into a field of ruins and slaughter. His alone, the diabolical perseverance with which he pursued a sen seless dream, when a precarious peace had followed upon the defea t of his champions. Such is truly the meaning of the manoeuvre: \"In all that\", the proporati and monsignori seem to say, \"they have no thing against us; we had no voice in the chapter\". It was an opportune gesture, with which we have bee n familiar ever since the days of Pontius Pilate, but which ca nnot clear the high clergy of the reproach of having servilely exe cuted the orders of their chief. In this respect, it is much more of a confession than an excuse. Certainly a superfluous confession, but one which is well worth recording. Thus have the prelates themselves denounced the pro found vice of a system which, from one day to another, can tur n a man who is subject to error into the possessor of an absolute power to which everything—even the most natural revolt of conscien ce—must give way."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 307 On no account do we wish to venture into the field of dogma. But how is it possible to avoid drawing the logical con clusions which follow from the principle of absolutism? How is it possible not to see the contradiction of the prelate's facile excus e ? If the Pope really is the Church's infallible navig ator, no criticism, even discreet, can be made against him. Inspired by the Holy Spirit, his decisions can only be excellent, even if they d o not appear so, and if he means to govern alone, without recourse t o the opinion of his \"brothers\" the cardinals, it is because God has willed it so. If this is so, it is difficult to understand the sp eech made by Mgr. Bacci at the opening of the conclave. Speaking in t he name of the entire Holy College, he said of the Pope-to-be: \"He will be ready to welcome his collaborators in t he government of the Church\". This clearly condemned the quite contrary conduct o f the deceased Pontiff—but at the same time, it censured Him who h ad inspired it, and was a warning that such an error should not be repeated. While this call to order was undoubtedly given at a most opportune moment, at the Mass of the Holy Spirit, it would ap pear none the less off-hand for all that. Before Heaven can inspi re the members of the conclave, is it in need of being inspired it self? This seems to be the inevitable conclusion one must draw from thi s type of warning. However this mystery may be, the cardinals' \"discre et criticism\" cannot make us forget the docility with which the p relates of the whole of Europe executed their chief's orders, with out any com- punction of national—or even moral—feeling, when he thought fit to promote the dictators and to assure them of the Roman Church's full support.

This balancing game is skilful, no doubt; yet, we must n ot be deceived, it is merely disguising the terrible appetite for d omination of a power that is after universality in the widest sens e of the term.
