There is but one Supreme Authority in the World, and that is the Pope. 2. God hath delivered over unto the Pope the Pow er and Rule of Heaven and Earth, therefore we must be obedient unto him upon pain of damnation. 3. All Right and Pow er a re lodged in his Breast. 4. No Law can be made to bind Christ ians, but by the Pope’s Authority, as of old the Israelites received none but by Moses. 5. The Gospel would not be the Gospel , if the Pope had not approved of it. 6. The Pope can tak e aw ay any man’s Right, and give it to another. 7. The Pope can do any thing, above all Right, against all Right and w ithout all Right. 8. If Christ commands one thing, and the Pope another thing, the Pope is rather to be obeyed than Jesus Christ. 9. The Pope’s Decretory Letters are to be received and esteemed as Authentic as the Word of Go d or the Holy Scriptures. 10. It is Sacrilege to question the Pope’s Actions, and he is cursed of God w ho violates the Pope’s censures. 11. If the Pope affirm that to be black, which our Eyes judg e to be white, we ought also then to declare, that i t’s black, upon pain of our souls. 12. The Pope hath the sole Rule and Pow er of the w hole World in Temporals as w ell as in Spirituals, and theref ore can depose Emperors and Kings, and may dispose of their Dominion s as he shall think convenient. 13. If the Pope shall depose a King an d give his Kingdom to another, and the people will not receive him, the Pope may bring him in by force of Arms, because he is Judge of all a nd instead of God on Earth. 14. Not to believe that the Pope can depose Kings is [ to be ] , and that deservedly, damned for Heresy. 15. Christ had not done wisely if he had not left the Pope power to depose Kings. 16. If a King be a Heretic or favor er of Heresy he may be deposed. 17. If the Pope shall declare a King to be a Heretic, he hath no right to his Kingdom, and the Pope may depose him. 18. The Pope can give the people lib erty either to choose or take new Masters; by this means they keep all Kings and Princes in their Obedience and Submission to the Pope. 19. All Protestants are Heretics, and th erefore they ought to be killed. 20. It is better and safer to make alliance and amity with Turks, Infidels, or Jews, than with Heretic Protestants, because they may draw us into the errors of their novelties. { 1 } "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 A Private Letter to the Reader Dear truth-seeker, Upon being exhorted by my constructively critical friends to give the reasons why I wrote Vatican Assassins: “Wounded In The House Of My Friends ”, the following has been written for you my Amer ican countrymen and foreign friends. I em barked upon this project, the culm ination of nearly twenty years of research and writing, having been em otiona lly damaged by three great injustices. The first was the deliberate and deceptive attack upon The K ing James A uthorized Version of the E nglish B ible , especially its underlyi ng Greek Text, being the foundation of the Protestant Reformation, the Modern Er a and Western Civilization, including the rights of freedom of conscience, freedom of speech and freedom of the press. The second was the assassination of a m an I was always taught to love and respect as the savior of our Union of Stat es, President Abraham Lincoln. The third transpired when I was in the Public School’s fourth grade. With vivid m emories I rem ember the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, m y weeping teacher, Miss Beals whom I loved, and m y heart-br oken guitar teacher, Dan Boyd, who, upon hearing from m e of the death of Jack Bath in Vietnam , dism issed m e early from m y lesson and wept bitterly. J ack was not only a fellow student but was also my swim teacher at the local YMCA. With guitar in hand, I remember standing outside in the cold, San Francisco Bay Area wind that day waiting for my mother to pick me up in her car while thinking to myself, “I w ill find the truth someday, for Lyndon Johnson looks like a liar.” The following pages descri be what I discovered over the years. This Second Edition is a little more comp lete and much more accurate. No conclusions however, have b een changed. A host of cr itics, both friendly and hostile, have contributed to the m aking of its suprem acy over the First, for which I hum bly thank them all. As my Heavenly Father sent a brilliant ex-Muslim to help me develop certain key points in the First Editi on, even so He sent a m ost hum ble and refined ex-Jesuit to aid m e as m y fina l editor of the Second, it now linking the ghastly implosion of the World Trade Center to President Kennedy’s m urderers. May the risen and all-powerful Son of G od bless you in reading this book, which, in attempting to live out its conclu sions, has cost m e the living of a norm al life, including the rearing of my sons and the respect of m y father. Its m essage is hum bly given with the hope that you will do your duty where Go d has placed you.

He must erect an absolute military dictator loyal to Rome in every nation. But how could this be accomplished without powerful resistance from “ heretic and pagan ” Protestant, Orthodox and Islam ic nations, as well as resistance from “ liberal ” Roman Catholic nations? He would first gain control of the world’s m ost powerful Protestant governm ents and banking houses through the Jesuit-revived and Baal-worshipping, Order of the Knights Templars , known today as Shriner Freemasonry . This happened in England by 1800 and in Am erica by 1900. With the Jesuits having been expelled from nearly every country in Europe during the Nineteenth Century, the Gene ral’s banking agents would finance both sides of his Second Thirty Years’ War (1914-1945) . Three im portant benefits for the Order would be the installation of Russia’s Rom an Catholic Grand Inquisitor, Joseph Stalin , the restoration of the Pope’s Temporal Pow er through Rom an Catholic Benito Mussolini and the breakup of the Turkish Ottoman Empire , the Muftis of the resultant Islam ic nati ons also being controlled through Shriner Freemasonry . Having m ass-m urdered the Jews of Europe and the Protestant Lutherans of Germany with Bormann- advised Rom an Catholic Adolf Hitler , the Jesuits would prom ote the Airborne Nuclear War Hoax creating a false enemy for the American people, as FDR would secretly give Stalin the nuclear device in 1943. The Nuclear War Hoax would give birth to the Cold War Hoax (1945-1989) , cunningly justifying Washington’ s foreign policy – dictated by the Jesuits in control of the Council on Foreign Relations – of non-resistance to Chinese and Soviet aggression. This great decep tion would enable the Jesuit Ge neral to install dictators around the world who would be secretly or openly loyal to the Pope. He would accomplish this using his International Intelligence Community , the KGB in the East and the CIA in the West, controlling its Global Terrorist Network to further justify fascist martial rule. The General would finance it all w ith the credit of his Federal Reserve Bank and then saddle the “ heretic and liberal ” Am erican people with the debt. For forty-five years no nation would seriously interfere with the Pope’s Cold War. By the time of its supposed termination in 1989 (thereby enabling the Vatican’s American Military Industrial Complex to give high technology to Red China), the Jesuit General would achiev e his goals including the revival of the Pope’s “ Holy Roman Empire ” centered in reunited Germ any, Rom e’s Em pire having been broken up by the Lo rd’s Grand and Glorious Protestant Reformation . One of the major victories for th e General would be the taking of Jerusalem by his Torah-despising Masonic Jewish Z ionists in 1967, paving the way for the rebuilding of Solomon’s Temple — for the “ infallible ” Papal Caesar! "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Dust Co ver and Quo tes 13 With every nation now subordinated to the Temporal Pow er of the Pope, the “ Holy Roman American Empire ” must now be destroyed ; for, it is the world’s haven for “heretics and liberals” c ondem ned by the Jesuits and their evil Council of Trent . As the Pope sought to overthrow the Protestants of England with the Spanish Armada, so the Jesuits are seeking to dest roy the peoples of North Am erica with a triple Sino-Soviet-Moslem invasion . By that time many of the nation’s Jews will have been destroyed by an Am erican fascis t dictator, the concentration cam ps being already in place. Jewish survivors will have been driven back to Zionist Israel to face their final annihilation to be attempted by the risen Pope — the A ntichrist . So why was President Kennedy killed? In followi ng the lead of pro- Com munist Pope John XXIII and his Second Vatican Counc il, he sought to end the Cold War, including the War in Vietnam. He also attempted to end the reign of the CIA. But as Pope John XXIII “died” a nd was replaced by a secret Cold Warrior, Pope Paul VI , even so President Kennedy “died” and was replaced with another Cold Warrior, President Lyndon Johnson . Through these acts of defying the Pope’s Temporal Pow er , the President became “a usurper and a tyrant” according to the Vatican’s Canon Law. Since it is “ no murder to kill a tyrant ,” John F. Kennedy was assassinated by the Jesuit General’s Int ernational Intelligence Community dom estically overseen by “the American Pope,” Francis Cardinal Spellman . He then, along with Cardinals Cooke and O’Connor covered it up. The present Archbishop, Edw ard Cardinal Egan , will continue this Great Jesuit Cover-up , he having ignited Am erica’s present Papal Crusade against the Islamic peoples of the Middle East and Central As ia through the attack and demolition of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon carried out by his loya l soldiers within the Central Intelligence Agency , including its Roman Catholic, Jesuit-trained, CFR/CIA Director a nd Knight of Malta, George J. Tenet , and the high-level Masonic Bush (House of Stuart) and Bin Laden fam ily dynasties tied together through The Carlyle Group , its CEO being another CI A/CFR m ember and Knight of Malta, Frank C. Carlucci . This, yet another act of bold High Treason, will result in the mass-murder of millions of Moslems, the destruction of Mecca , Medina and the Jerusalem mosques, including the Dome of the Rock , and the Al Aqsa Mosque . This will successfully incite both foreign (Wahhabic) and domestic (NOI) Neo-Islam ic fanatics to invade and destroy the White apostate and Jewish “heretic and liberal” peoples of post Reform ation Am erica – to the delight of the B lack P ope !

The desire for Worldly Power began to manifest itself in the Church, on a broad scale, in the 4 th century, when the Rom an Em pire ceased its Persecutions, and made Chris tianity its State Religion.

He also began to end that Jesuit Inquisition in Vietnam , as its future highpoint would be “Operation Phoenix,” the CIA m ass-m urder of 60,000 Vietnamese, “in cold blood” according to its Director, William E.

Millions of “infidel” Buddhists were to be exterminated, the Pope’s International Drug Trade would explode, Am erican pa triotism and liberty would further be destroyed and Vi etnam would be reunited under Ho Chi Minh – another communist military dictator loyal to the Pope – like Stalin, like Chairman Mao, like Castro, like George H.

Later, Spellman made several visits to the war-front calling the Am erican troops “the soldiers of Christ,” fighting the Pope’s Crusade against “godl ess Jew Com munism ”!) The outcom e was 58,000 dead, 130,000 post-war suicides and a 220 billion dollar debt to the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank. All these acts of President Ke nnedy were proper assertions of national sovereignty and th erefore infringed on the Pope’s Temporal Pow er . As the “infallible” Vicar of Christ and thus, “the Theocratic Universal Monarch of the World , ” the Pope, through the religious, political and financial power of the Jesuit Order , fully intended, then and now , to ultimately rule all nations through his loyal kings and dictators from Solomon’s rebuilt Temple in Jerusalem . For when the Pope is crowned during his co ronation these words am ong others ( having never been taught to us in the Public Schools ) are spoken: “Tak e thou the tiara adorned w ith the triple crow n, and know that thou art the fa ther of princes and kings, and art the governor of the w orld.” { 37 } "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 36 Thomas Aquinas , Rome’s “Angelic Doctor,” wrote in his Summa Theologica in 1272: “The Pope, by Divine Right, hath Spiritual and Temporal Power , as Supreme King of the World . . .” { 38 } Lucius Ferraris wrote in his Bibliotheca Prompta (1763), which has been adopted as a standard of Rom an Catholic law, as follows: “On account of the excellence of hi s suprem e dignity, he is called Bishop of Bishops, Ordina ry of Ordinaries, uni versal Bishop of the Church, Bishop or Diocesan of the w orld, divine Monarch, supreme Emperor and King of Kings. ” { 39 } Roman Catholic Priest and editor, David S.

Why is it the Pope has such trem endous power? Why the Pope is the ruler of the World.

These dictators then implemented secret police agencies and vast prison systems, tortur ing and killing millions of “heretics” and “liberals” within their borders pursuant to the Jesuit Oath and Council of Trent . In the near future, Washington’s Nationa l Security apparatus will be used by the coming Jesuit-trained military dict ator to crush the people of the American Empire , Rom e having used our s ons and service for over one hundred years. This final victory over the L ord’s P rotestant Reformation , will be the climax of the Jesuits’ quest to submit all nations to the Temporal Pow er of the Pope in a worldwide fascist, military police state, maintained by the Jesuits’ International Intelligence Community – the Holy Office of the Inquisition – grinding the “liberals” and “heretics” of all nations to dust.

Further, Paul Blatty , the author and promoter of the wicked and Satanic movie titled “The Exorcist,” was also a graduate of Georgetown. The Jesuits also educated the English Alfred Hitchcock , another Hollywood m aster of terror having released Psycho and The Birds am ong other gruesome thrillers.

Therefore, the dedication extends to the entire population of the world, the White, Celtic-Anglo-Saxon, Protestants and Baptists of the Calvinist persuasion in particular. For it was the Calvinists who successfully resisted the conspiracies of the Jesuit Order – that military army of the Pope known as “ The Company ” – and gave to the world religious and political liberty. For these me n wielded both “the Sword of the Spirit” – the Word of G od – and “the Sword of Just Defense” – the gun . And it was these Baptist-Calvinists who secu red for the American people the right to use “the Sword of the Spirit” with the First Amendment , and the right to use “the Sword of Just Defense” with the Second Amendment . May we never forget their great faith, purity and courag e. This dedication is also extended to the Rom an Catholic Pope Clement XIV , the Roman Catholic s overeigns, and the Rom an Catholic peoples of Europe who fearlessl y suppressed and expelled the Jesuit Order from their borders throughout the Eight eenth and Nineteenth Centuries. Further, the author, as a White Americ an Freem an and Dispensational, Fifth Monarchy, Seventh-Day Baptis t-Calvinist, dedicates the following pages to the four greatest ex-Roman Catholic priests ever to grace the shores of his native land. I. The first is Charles Chiniquy , a French Canadian and “the Martin Luther of Am erica,” who, although having been deceived into joining the Masonic Lodge after his conversion to Christ (believing Satan’s Masonic Craft was the enem y of Satan’s Jesuit Order) , boldly exposed the Jesuits as the a ssassins of President Lincoln during the 1880s. He also warned, th at if unchecked, the Jesuits would rule this country from the White House (Bill Clinton / George W. Bush) to every Governor’s mansion (Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, now the Order’s Gestapo Chief of the National Hom eland Security Agency including FEMA) in the Union — as they do this day ! II. The second is Jeremiah J. Crowley , an Irishman, who, at the turn of the Twentieth Century warned of the Jesuits’ conspiracy to destroy the bulwark of Am erica’s popular liberties – the Public School System – furthering the quest of “m aking Am erica dom inantly Catholic.” Authoring The Pope—Chief of White Slavers, High Priest of Intrigue , Crowley also warned of the Jesuits’ power in Washington, D.C. and their plan to use American political and military might to restore the Pope’s Temporal Pow er in Rom e and extend its influence around the world. This was accomplished during the Second Thirty Years’ War (World War I and World War II – 1914-1945) and the public schools were destroyed by Suprem e Court decisions handed down by a Chief Jus tice who was an arch -conspirator in the Kennedy Assassination, Earl Warren . "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Dedication          57 III. The third is Emmett McLoughlin , another Irishm an, who exposed the Rom an hierarchy as responsible for th e excessive crim e am ong Rom an Catholic peoples, in forbidding the public school system to teach about the Inquisition, and for carrying out the assassinati on of Abraham Lincoln. IV. The fourth is Alberto Rivera , an ex-Jesuit and Spaniard having left the Order after 27 years, who, although accuse d of questionable financial practices, exposed the Jesuits as the assassins of President Kennedy and warned in 1982 of Rome’s plan to bring America into a treaty agreement with “the Sovereign State of Vatican City,” called a Concordat. { 46 } ( Hitler’s Germ any, Mussolini’s Italy and Franco’s Spain all had Concordats with the Pope, while those fascist dictators were anti-Protestant , anti-Jew and pro-Moslem! ) The idea of Protestant America entering into a Concordat with Rom e and thus also becom ing anti-Jew and pro-Moslem , further enslaving us to the Papal Caesar , would be legally im possible had not President Ronald Reagan , America’s greatest Masoni c traitor and “conservative” pawn of New York Archbishop John Cardinal O’Connor , form ally recognized the Sovereign State of Vatican City as a sovereign nation in 1984 , fifty years after Great Britain had done the sam e in 1934 . George Orwell, here we come! In sharp contrast to these brave Catholic priests who left the system in disgust, the apostate Protestant, Ort hodox, and Baptist Churches ar e fast asleep enjoying the privileges of “being” and “doi ng” granted by their corporat e charters. The Jews are also fast asleep, as the Jesuits have al ways been their great persecutors from the revival of the Roman Inquisition in 1542 to the end of the Third Reich in 1945 . As a result of cowardice, com placency and com prom ise, the Protestants, Orthodox, Baptists and Jews face annihilation fro m a coming right-wing Fascist-Military Dictatorship, secretly using violent, heavily arm ed and racist hate groups such as the Ku Klux Klan (White supremacists) and the Nation of Islam (Black supremacists) to justify the implementation of executive orders and martial law. With the Jesuit General in control of Islamic Shriner Freemasonry , the Knights of Malta , the Opus Dei (presently advocating the Pope’s European Union and declared to be a dangerous religious sect by a Be lgian parliamentary commission in 1997) , the Club of Rome (presently headed by the Masonic/Islamic Prince El Hassan bin Talal of Jordan, appointed to the position in 2000 w ith the blessing of Knight of Malta King Juan Carlos of Spain) , the Knights of Columbus , Rothschild’s Illuminati and the Mafia , he has but to give the order and his Militia will inaugurate agitation, assassination, anarchy and fascist absolutis m, leaving Am erica drenched in blood and occupied by foreign armies whose co mmanders will be under Jesuit control.

With his two usurped powers, Spiritual and Temporal , he ruled the civilized world with “an iron hand in a velvet glove.” Both the m asses and their kings worshipped this m an who claim ed to be “ the Vicar of Christ ,” in command of an international system of theft, torture and murder called “ the Holy Office of the Inquisition .” This “Vicar of Christ” organi zed great “holy wars” called “ Crusades .” The forem ost purpose of these wicked and murderous “Crusades” was to take Jerusalem from the Moslems thereby en abling the builders of Rome ’s pagan cathedrals to rebuild King Solomon’s Temple . This has been Rom e’s se cret aim for centuries, as the Popes have desired worldw ide worship while ruling from Jerusalem . But the Crusades failed to secure Jerusalem for the Pope . They did succeed in m urdering hundreds of thousands of “heretics” know n as Jews, Moslem s and Orthodox. The sacking of Constantinople a nd the butchery inside the Dome of the Rock are but two exam ples of Papal fanaticism . God the Father , however, had decreed an end to this age of religious fanaticism , woe and poverty. In 1517, on October 31 (corrupted into Halloween Day), a brave Germ an m onk – Martin Luther – began the grand and glorious Protestant Reformation . He ultimately put the B ible into the hands of the German people in their own language! The people could read God’s Word for themselves, no longer needing the priests “ to interpret. ” William Tyndale , the father of the English Authorized Version did the sam e, enabled by that great invention — the world shak ing Printing Press .

The free-enterprise system was born, the direct result being the creating of the Protestant Middle Class and private wealth. The White Middle Class peoples, enjoying free dom of the press, freedom of speech and freedom of conscience, excelled in all the arts and sciences creating invention after invention.

This means that when th eir plan is permitted to succeed there will be a future “ infallible ” Pope who will be “that man of sin” ( II Thessalonians 2:3-12 ), “antichrist” ( I John 2:18 ), “the beast” ( Revelation 13:4- 18 ), “king of fierce countenance” ( Daniel 8:23 ); also called by the Lord Jesus Christ “the abomination of desolation” ( Matthew 24:15 in referring to Daniel 9:27; 12:11 ), ruling the world from Jerusalem . It is in this light that we shall see light and understand the flow of history for the last five centuries. The dial ectic of the Calvinists and the Reformation versus the Jesuits and their Counter-Reformation enables us to understand the rem arkable phenom enon called “ the Kennedy Assassination .” Rem embering “the truth is in the de tails,” few m en, having exam ined the events surrounding this “executive action” (a s the Central Intellig ence Agency (CIA) called it), have failed to rem ark at the gr eat power, which evidently is involved in maintaining the cover-up. Presently, all le gal processes have b een blocked and the cowards in Congress fear to raise the issue. It requires a powerful intelligence apparatus, deeply entrench ed in governm ent, to undertak e an assassination with its many necessary international connections and then execute and maintain the cover- up having taken place here. In the light of hi story, there is really only one candidate for an organization capable of controlli ng the groups and forces involved in the Kennedy Assassination . As viewed from the facts a nd associations of its power, both historically and of the pr esent day, it can only be the Militia of the Pope , The Society of Jesus .

All of the parties involved were caught and made a deal to provi de evidence for the embarrassment of President Nixon — all except the Cubans and G. Gordon Liddy. For the Jesuits intended to remove from office the Commander-in-Chief of their Fourteenth Amendment American Empire as a result of his disobedience to their Council on Foreign Relations . It began with Waterg ate, and upon m oving to his betrayal by Secretary of State a nd Knight of Malta, “Deep Throat” Alexander Haig (whose younger brother, Francis R.

Anticipating the command to kill E. Howard Hunt in prison, Liddy m ade ready his plan to poison him . But the order never came down! Hunt had been a key player in the Kennedy assassination and was not to be touched. Bu t in the providence of the risen Son of G od , Hunt would live, only to suffer the sham e and disgrace of being present while Mark Lane , the Jewish defense lawyer hated by both Hunt and his master, William F.

Protestants are “ heretics ” and m ust be “ exterminated from the face of the whole earth .” The term “ Liberal, ” as the Jesuits understand it, includes all Catholics who concur with the Protes tants in rejecting the Temporal Pow er of the Pope of Rome . Liberals both believe and teach that gove rnm ents are best when they serve the people, and when their powers are expressly limited by written Constitutions. Liberals, like both the Protestant and Baptist Calvinists, further believe that if governm ents becom e absolute tyrannies, they have the right and duty to form ally withdraw their allegiance and resist those tyrannies with arm ed force, called by John Knox “ the Sw ord of Just Defense .” It is for this reason the B lack P ope’s fascist- communist military dictatorship s forbid gun ownership by the peoples they rule.

It has only been disclosed to the worl d a few tim es, beginning in the early 1600s (openly published in Cracow, Poland in 1612) and extending through the late 1800s: “ . . . but it has been made to dis appear as has the mo st of all other books against the Jesuits.” { 22 } Because of the magnitude of its cont ents as it relates to our subject, Secreta Monita or Secret Instructions of the Jesuits { 23 } has been incorporated in its entirety, in the form of an attached CD within this volum e’s cover, as it was republished in 1857. The Secret Instructions are no forgery, as we again reca ll a portion of the famous letter from Juan de Palafox , Bishop of Los Angeles, Me xico (for which letter and continued resistance he was relentlessly pe rsecuted by the Order until he was forced to flee to Europe for his life), to Pope Innocent X dated January 8, 1647: The Jesuits – 1540 "},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Chapt er 1 101 “ . . . what other Religion has a secr et constitution, hidden privileges, and concealed laws of its own?

B. Nicolini adds: “Now, examine well these instructi ons, and you will find that the true Jesuit must be crafty, insinuati ng, deceitful, and you will at once perceive the extent of the Jesuit immo rality, and the artful way in which, in the name of the most sacred of all things — religion, they accomplish the m ost heinous offences.” { 26 } Dear truth-seeker, after revi ewing your CD containing the Secret Instructions of the Jesuits , notice the last page where th e Jesuit is permitted to commit high treason – the greatest of crimes worthy only of public execution – against a non- Rom an Catholic governm ent he has sworn to destroy. The Jesuits, in resisting the Biblical teachings of the Reformers, guided the Council of Trent from 1545 to 1563. The twenty-fi ve sessions of that Council condem ned all the “doctrines of grace” he ld by the Reform ers, accursing all peoples who maintained those beliefs. The Fourth Session condem ned freedom of conscience, freedom of speech and freedom of the press. We read and marvel: “The Fourth Session...was one of th e m ost im portant sessions of the council. In this session, a decree was passed which placed tradition upon an equality with the Scriptures – de clared the books of the Apocrypha to be a part of the word of God – el evated the Latin translation of the The Jesuits – 1540 "},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 102 Scriptures called the Vulgate, to an authority superior to that of the inspired Hebrew and Greek original s, and exacted severe penal laws against the liberty of the press . . . The right of private judgm ent in reading the Scriptures was prohibite d, its exercise punished and the liberty of the press was authoritatively forbidden.” { 27 } The Fourth Rule of the Congregation of the Inde x of Prohibited Books enacted by the Fourth Session of the Council of Trent and approved by Pope Pius IV in a Bull, issued on the 24 th of March, 1564 regarding the B ible reads: “Inasm uch as it is m anifest from expe rience, that if the Holy Bible, translated into the vulgar tongue, be indiscrim inately allowed to every one, the temerity of men will cause more evil than good to arise from it . . . But if any one shall have th e presum ption to read or possess it without such written permission, he shall not receive absolution until he has first delivered up such Bible to the ordinary . . . But regulars shall neither read nor purchase such Bibles without a special license from their superiors.” { 28 } [Em phasis added] The Council concluded with the cry, “Accursed be all heretics! Accursed!! Accursed!!” { 29 } This wicked and evil Council of Trent – the backbone of the Counter- Reformation – would embody the religious and po litical maxims the Jesuit Order and its “ infallible ” Pope would follow for the rest of the millennium. Trent would becom e the foreign policy of nations under Jesuit control, further extending the Temporal Pow er of the Pope. The nation whos e foreign policy has been the Council of Trent for the last one hundred years is Fourteenth Amendment America, as she financed the Second Thirty Years’ War including the Bolshevik Revolution , which introduced the bloodbath of Com munism into the Twentieth Century. Under the absolutism of Com munism the Bible is a forbidden book — pursuant to the Council of Trent ! President William Jefferson Clinton , that Jesuit-trained tool of the Pope, continued the policies of Trent with the m ass bom bing of Rom e’s old enem y, Orthodox Serbia during the late 1990s. The Jesuit General is an “absolutist.” Today we would call him a “fascist military dictator.” His absolu te, unlimited power is supreme — even over the Pope! We read: “The general has usually stood towa rds the Pope m uch as a powerful grand feudatory of the Middle Ages did towards a weak titular lord The Jesuits – 1540 "},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Chapt er 1 103 param ount . . . and the shrewd Ro man populace have long shown their recognition of this fact by styling these two great personages severally the ‘White Pope’ and the ‘Black Pope ’. In truth the society has never, from the first, obeyed the Pope, when ever its will and his has happened to run counter to each other .” { 30 } [Em phasis added] The General of the Jesu its, intending to set up a Universal Paparchy controlling the people and pr inces through “education [ indoctrination ] and diplom acy,” is without question the most powerful man in the world. He is the Sovereign over the Society of Jesus and his Provincials are the m asters of the Pope’s Cardinals, who are in turn the visi ble or invisible political masters over every governm ent of every nation. The Cardinals always prom ote or enforce som e form of absolutism over the peoples be it Monarchi alism, Socialism, Nazism, Communism, Fascism or Zionism . Of the General’s power over the Society of Jesus , also called “ the Company ,” we read from the pen of an ex-Jesuit, Andrew Steinmetz , in 1848: “The General possesses the secrets of every member — a terrible fulcrum for the lever of influence. He know s the character, the inclinations of every m ember; he knows these facts, or may know them , for he has them in writing. He is made acquainted with the consciences of all who m ust obey him , particularly of the provincials and others, to whom he has entrusted functions of great im por tance. He m ust have, like each Superior, a complete knowledge of hi s subjects; their propensities, their sentiments, the defects, the sins to which they have been or are m ore inclined or impelled . . . Every year, a list of the houses and m embers of the Society, the nam es, talents, virtues, failings of all are there recorded. It was such a list, doubtless, that suggested to a Ge neral of the Society that proud exclam ation, when, having exulti ngly alluded to his philosophers, mathem aticians, orators, etc., he cried . . . ‘and we have men for martyrdom, if they be required.’ In effect, from this minute list of mental and bodily qualities, he can com pute his power and direct his pl ans, adapt his com mands and insure success to his delegated functions . . . The simple Jesuit is to possess for hi mself neither power, nor office, nor credit, nor riches, nor will, nor sen timents: the concentrated authority belongs to the general. His com mands, his desires, are the law: his power flows from his hands as from its sour ce, on the heads whom he chooses: it extends as far as he pleases; it stops when he wills . . .

Of the General overseeing the Novices we observe: “The Jesuit novice . . . m ay som e day have kings and princes kneeling at his feet, and have the power to direct the destinies of nations.

In command of this family of traitors swearing allegiance to only the Pope of Rom e, the General is an absolute Monarch over the Order. And when the Order has conquere d a nation, the governm ent installed is always in fact absolutist. That is, the pow ers of the chief executive have no absolute limitations. In a letter to the king of Naples from a Jesuit Provincial written in 1854 we read: “SACRED ROYAL MAJESTY — [ We ] . . . have always inculcated respect . . . for . . . absolute m onarchy . This we have done, not only from conviction, but also because the doctors of the com pany, who are Francisco Suarez, the Cardinal Bellarm ine, and m any other theologian s and publicists of the sam e, have publicly taught absolute monarchy to be the best form of governm ent.

Miss Cusack , the brilliant and renowned convert ed Catholic nun of the late Nineteenth Century having warned the Englis h of the Jesuits’ plot (already successful by 1800) to take over the British Empire, properly concludes: “ . . . thus was established an Ins titution, which as we shall see from undisputable evidence, has done m ore than any other so-called religious order to ruin the peace of families, to check the growth of human progress, and to enslave the souls of m en, and yet all this was done in the nam e of religion.” { 37 } Having examined the purpose, oa ths and devilish doctrines of the Society of Jesus , we pause to reflect on the dying words of Ignatius Loyola , the Order’s founder and thus the father of the Counter-Reformation: “ ‘I have done m uch good to the Chur ch of Rom e — I have seen m any provinces of our m en, m any college s, houses, residences, and wealth belonging to our Society; but all thes e things desert m e now, and I know not whither to turn!’ At length he e xpired in a fit of trem bling, and his face turned black, according to an ey e-witness, the Jesuit Turrianus.” { 38 } In contrast, the dying words of Martin Luther , the father of the Reformation bringing freedom of conscience , freedom of speech and freedom of the press with the German B ible and his noble defender, Frederick III, Elector of Saxony , were: “O m y Father, God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of all consolation, I thank Thee for havi ng revealed to m e Thy well beloved Son, in whom I believe, whom I have preached and acknowledged, loved and celebrated, and whom the P ope and the im pious persecute.

Queen Elizabeth I , “every inch a queen” speaking six languages better th an her own, permitted the reformed doctrines of the B ible to be openly preached. From her kingdom , she first banished the Order in 1579. Of course the Jesuits hated her, called her a bastard, denied her right to the throne and attem pted to m urder her several tim es. The Ridolfi Plot (1571), the Throgm arton Plot (1583) and the Babington Plot ( 1586), although failures, were instigated by the soldiers of the Jesuit General in attemp ting to reduce England to the earthly, political rule of the Pope — the Temporal Pow er of “the Vicar of Christ.” Meanwhile, the Jesuits were in control of Spain. Philip II was the king through which they s ought to destroy the Reformation in the Netherlands as well as in England. (Philip II enjoyed the execution of his cousin Dona Isabella who, before a mock Inquisitional Court, professed Christ as her Lord and Saviour.) Therefore, with the military might of Philip, the Jesuits plotted the “extirpation” of England’s Protestants and Queen with one great stroke . They would invade with thousands of Spanish soldiers carried by a huge array of ships – the invincible Spanish Armada – its building having been financed by Rome’s P apal Caesar for two million crowns! Setting out in 1588 , assured of naval supremacy a nd ultimate victory, the Jesuits urged their thirty thousand a ttackers aboard 128 ships on to heretic England. But the risen Son of G od chose to intervene. After five desperate days of naval battle with the fleets of both Howard and Drake out of food and ammunition, we read: “A m ighty storm – a storm , which, to use the em phatic expression of Strada, ‘shook heaven and earth’ – finally decided the contest, and delivered England from the slightest apprehension of a rally, and fresh attack, from the scattered ships of th e Arm ada . . .

E. C. Shepherd, 1987 Canadian Historian The Babington Plot The Jesuits at every tu rn sought to discredit Queen Elizabeth in the eyes of her English subjects. They claimed “that guilty woman of England” had neither right nor title to the throne beca use she was the daughter of Roman Catholic King Henry VIII’s second wife, Anne Boleyn . Claim ing that Henry’s second m arriage was adultery, Elizabeth was called “the bastard Queen” by the Jesuits. To add insult to injury, the Jesuits then moved Pope Pius V to excommunicate her with his most infamous Papal Bull, Regnans in Excelsis (February 25, 1570). Form ally condem ned by the Devil’s dynastic “ Vicar of Christ ,” certain Rom an Catholic English lords could be convinced that killing Elizabeth woul d not be murder but a virtuous act. Therefore, the Jesuits plotted Elizab eth’s overthrow — m any tim es. They attempted to make Mary, Queen of Scots , the Queen of England. But the conspiracy failed and the treacherous Mary lost her life. The conspiracy to put a Jesuit- controlled, Rom an Catholic Monarch on England’s throne was thwarted — this time . She was tried and beheaded on the 8 th of February 1587, by order of the Parliam ent. Others would attempt the life of the Queen. William Parry , Anthony Babington , Roberto Ridolfi , as well as Jesuits Edmund Campion and Robert Parsons were a few of the m any would-be assa ssins. They too all failed and paid with their lives. The risen Son of G od was protecting Elizabeth not because of her personal purity but because of the prayers of her subjects a nd her benevolent policy towards the English Reformers. History would prove that the reign of Elizabeth was the birth of religious liberty, the Middle Class, and thus the mi ghty Protestant British Empire. Of her kingdom ’s great prosperity an ex-Jesuit writes: “The results of Protestantism were gloriously prom oted and expanded by Elizabeth – in the vast im provem ent of agriculture – internal trade – and foreign commerce.

E. C. Shepherd, 1987 Canadian Historian The Babington Plot In 1589, King Henry III of France was stabbed to death by the Jesuit assassin Jacques Clement — ending the dynasty of the House of Valois. For glorifying this treasonous m urder, the Jesuit Guignard was publicly executed with the hangman’s noose. The throne passed to a Protestant, Henry of Navarre also known as King Henry IV . Henry’s ascent began the Bourbon dyna sty that would span nearly three centuries. At its anti-Jesuit he ight it would threaten war on the P apacy if it refused to abolish the Company of Jesus in the late Eighteenth Ce ntury and at its pro-Jesuit depth it would end in disgrace, overthrow n by an outraged Fran ce, in 1830. Henry was not fully accepted as king until he renounc ed Protestantism, as the Jesuits had plotted to give the crown to a Spanish Rom an Catholic, Clara Isabella . Henry’s cowardly and sham eful renuncia tion was accom plished in 1593. Henry IV proved to be the grea test French king since Charlemagne . He sought to better the plight of the peasan ts created by Rom e’s Dark Ages. He encouraged the arts and industries while manufacturers arose throughout the kingdom . France began to flourish while its treasury increased. Henry IV’s greatest act, however, was the issuing of the Edict of Nantes in 1598. This edict guaranteed freedom of worship and equality of ri ghts to the Protestant Huguenots. The Jesuits were furious! If religious freedom was permitted, France might become a Protestant nation. O horrors! Alt hough a Roman Catholic, the king’s good will toward the Protestants brought upon him the one hundred and twenty-five curses of the Jesuits’ Council of Trent . Clearly Henry IV must die! The Jesuits must now fulfill thei r bloody Oath as they did with Admiral Coligny and Henry III . The king clearly understood hi s peril. Chiniquy writes in quoting Sully’s Memoirs : “Henry IV, King of France, after being wounded by an assassin sent by the Jesuits, said: ‘I am compelled to do one of these two things: Either recall the Jesuits, free them from the infamy and disgrace with which The Jesuits – 1589; 1610 "},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 136 they are covered, or to expel th em in a more absolute manner, and prevent them from approaching eith er m y person or m y kingdom .

For these people have correspondence everywhere, and ar e so very skillful in disposing the minds of men to whatever they wish, that I think it would be better that I should be already dead.’ ” { 5 } One sad day in 1610, the Jesuits, those m asters of m urder, slew France’s great King Henry IV . While returning from a visit with Sully (who later described this entire tragedy in his Memoirs ) the king’s carriage was stopped in the m iddle of the street — just like President Kennedy’s limousin e was nearly stopped in the middle of the street in Dallas . Instantly Francois Ravaillac , the Jesuits’ assassin, jum ped upon the wheel and stabbed his shocked victim th rough the heart. When arrested, he was still clutching his bloody knife. “With that good nature which character ized him , he at length consented to allow them [ the Jesuits ] to return. It was in vain that Sully, his minister, represented to him that no kindness could soften such foes; he recalled them, and fell a victim to their instigations, being stabbed by Ravaillac, on May 14 th , 1610.” { 6 } The Edict of Nantes would maintain re ligious liberty in France for eighty- seven years. In 1685, the Jesuits would cause it to be revoked through their m ost obedient servant and brother Jesuit, King Louis XIV who “ . . . saw his kingdom im poverished, his com merce gone, his nam e execrated throughout the world, and la y in his m agnificent palace at Versailles dying [ of venereal disease ]. He is utterly wretched. The people curse him , and hurl stones and m ud at his coffin.” { 7 } And Protestantism , including the B ible , would be outlawed for over one hundred years, Satan’s Jesuit-controlled Papacy maintaining absolute control over every civil institution of France. (Doesn’t this s ound like Communist Russia, China and Cuba?) Dear truth-seeker, do you understand how the Jesuits will murder even Roman Catholic rulers if they dare resist Rome’s policies? Did Presid ent Kennedy resist the Jesuits by seeking to break the CIA “into a thousand pieces” and end the Vietnam War? Was this a threat to the “ infallible ” Pope’s Temporal Pow er ?

With the Order first expelled in 1587 and again in 1597 by Daimyo Hideyoshi (for which he paid with his life in 1598), in 1614 Iyeyasu issued an edic t in the name of his son, Hidetada, finally expelling the Company and outlawing both Prot estant and Catholic “Christianity.” In 1622 m any Jesuits were justly put to death (“m artyred”) for high treason, and in 1624 the Rom an Catholic Spanish were banished by one of Iyem itsu’s edicts.

Then in 1949 the Order, using their British, American and Russian Empires, installed its Chinese Grand Inquisitor, Mao Tse-tung .

Even thos e virtues of the people which had been evolved at unutterable cost fo r the protection a nd conservation of society – their self-denial, their fa ith, their loyalty, their constancy and courage – were by this bl ack creed diverted, distorted, and transform ed into forces for the destruction of th at society.

They founded a new “ Holy Roman ” American Empire on the ruins of our nati on devastated by the War Between the States (1861-1865). The Jesuits th en used their new Am erican Em pire to subdue all nations to the Temporal Pow er of their “ infallible ” Pope. In so doing the Jesuit General used his Intern ational Intelligence Community – the Holy Office of the Inquisition – and thereby conducted his warfare against freedom of conscience, freedom of speech and human progress pursuant to the evil Council of Trent .) The result of this upheav al was that in 1639 shogun Iyemitsu , having previously expelled the Jesuits and the Sp anish, now banished the Rom an Catholic Portuguese and all foreigners from Japan forever . The Expulsion Edict reads: “For the future, let none, so long as the sun illuminates the world, presume to sail to Japan, not even in the quality of ambassadors, and this declaration is never to be revoked, on pain of death.” { 7 } As a result of these edicts, the Jesuits would be barred from Japan for over two hundred and fifty years , allowing art, prosperity and p eace to come to the nation under the Tokugawa shoguns. Little did the Empe ror and shogun know that both of their dynasties and nation would pay dearly for this! Always plotting and forever returning, in 1854 the Order used the Am erican gunboats of Commodore Matthew C. Perry to open up trade with Japan. In taking vengeance on its old enem y, the Company (formally readmitted in 1865), using foreigners , incited a revolution in 1868. The shogun Keiki was branded a “tyrant” (for refusing to submit to the Temporal Pow er of the Pope, pursuant to the evil doctrines of the Jesuit Francisco Suarez ) and was forced to resign, ending th e fifteen-generati on Tokugawa shogunate. With the shogun out of the way, the Society of Jesus restored Emperor worship and centralized power (Jesuit style) in Tokyo. In 1868, using the agents of Queen Victoria’s British Ambassador Thomas Glover , the Order assassinated Emperor Komei at the young age of only thirty-six. And why? Emperor Komei absolutely refused to open up Japan to the treasonous, Jesuit-controlled, White “Christian” foreigners who were at the time in the process of causing a revolution! (Thank you Toichi for these facts!) True to form , having assassinated another enem y in obedience to its wicked laws , the Sons of Loyola put the young Emperor Meiji on the throne. Inexperienced and intim idated through the m urder of his father, he became a most willing tool of the Order’s advisors for over forty years, from 1868 to 1912. In 1873 the “ Christianity Ban ” was lifted, allowing all “Christian” sects form al reentry into Japan, which include d not only the Jesuits but the true Bible believing, gospel m issionaries of the Lord Jesus Christ saving m any Japanese in the 1880s!

With this new absolute power in place, the Order would use its “ Japanese Sword of the Church ” until 1945. It used the Empero r’s army to make war on two of its old enem ies, China (1895) and Russia (1905).

At other tim es, they were bound without clothing, to be drowned in rivers; a nd if, on the road they did not m ove quick enough they were urged forward at the point of the pike.

Its hero was the Puritan freem an and Independent Baptist-Calvinist, Oliver Cromwell . The Jesuits, however, have slandered our greatest of hero es branding him “ the Usurper ,” as well as “a monster, a tyrant and a hypocrite,” and have done all they could do to destroy his m emory from English history. Therefore we shall review his astounding life pitted against Romish tyranny. In 1625 King James I died and his son Charles I came to the throne. But Charles unlike his father became a tool of th e Jesuits through the direction of the cruel and m erciless Anglican Archbishop William Laud . He violated the Magna Charta and sought to govern as an abso lute Monarch. Most of all, he suppressed the right of freedom of conscience by persecuti ng the Puritans who preached the B ible plan of salvation. Thousands left for Am erica and Crom well nearly departed England as well. But the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ had decreed that Crom well should rem ain and deliver the persecuted Protes tants from the designs of the Jesuits. With King Louis XIII of France (1610-1643) slaughtering the French Huguenots, ruining their Calvinist city of La Rochelle along with the sinking of the Huguenot Fleet via the Britis h Royal Navy on loan to France in 1625, the division between Charles I and the Puritan Parliament ultimately arose in 1642. Both prepared for war. Cromwell, after being defeated in his first battle by Rupert’s horsemen, declared that he would raise a cavalry of, “ ‘ . . . men who will bring some c onscience to what they do, and I prom ise you they shall not be beat en.’ . . . He thus got around him a body of men who scorned idlene ss and pleasure; and submitting cheerfully to his rigid discipline, bore privations and toils without a murmur, nay, with enthusiastic pride, for often their gallant leader slept beside them on the cold earth, and sh ared all their hardships. Fighting under the special protection of heaven , and for God and religion, they would rush to battle as to a banquet and embrace death with rapture . . . and this body of a thousand horse was never beaten .” { 2 } [Em phasis added] For he said, “ A few honest men are better than numbers .” { 3 } Crom well’s Puritan cavalry cam e to be known as the “ Ironsides .” They utterly routed Rupert’s finest horsem en at Marston Moor .

The battles of Nasby, Ma rston Moor, Dunbar, Worcester and charging the breach of Drogheda were all crowned w ith success, as Cromwell was fighting for freedom of conscience – so hated by the Jesuits and their Council of Trent – while Charles I was fighting for absolute monarchy and Papal supremacy . With the Parliam ent executing the king for high treas on, Crom well went on to be “the Lord Protector of the British Comm onwealth and Defender of the Protestant Faith.” He later dissolved the self-serving Parliam ent and banished the Jesuits from the kingdom resulting in m any conspiracies against his life. In 1654 a plot was discovered and the Jesuits’ would be assassins, Gerard and Vowel , were promptly executed. Therefore: “A hundred and sixty brave fellows selected from his different regim ents of cavalry, divided in to eight companies, became his bodyguard; ten of whom were always on duty about his person. On these he could rely; and unflinchi ng and bold m ust be the m an, and quick the assassin’s knife, that could reach him then.” { 4 } Clearly, Cromwell would not be another Admiral Coligny , William I of Orange or Henry IV .

On that day (January 3, 1655) he was to sign the treaty with France, which had for a long tim e been under contem plation; but he im mediately refused, declaring that negotiations should pro ceed no further until the king [ Louis XIV, whose Jesuit confessor would later cause him to revoke the Edict of Nantes ] and Cardinal Mazarin, the prime minister, would pledge them selves to assist him in saving the Vaudois Protestants . . . A day of fasting and humiliation was appointed, and a collection ordered to be taken in all the churches. The contribution am ounted to over 37,000 pounds, showing how deeply Protestant England was stirred by the persecution of the Piedm ontese Christians. It is said that Cromwell, in a burst of passion, replied to som e obstacles that were m entioned as inte rfering with his plans, that ‘he would sail his ships over the Alps, but that he would put a stop to the persecution.’ . . . War with France, nay, with the whole world, if necessary, he would wage, but this persecution of the childre n of God should cease. The king of France at length yielded, and word wa s sent that the Duke of Savoy had granted an am nesty to the Vaudois, and restored their ancient rights. Mazarin, who, in fact, ruled France, had brought this about, for he stood in deadly fear of Cromwell . It is said that he always turned pale when he heard his nam e m entioned. Oliver was the cham pion of Protestantism the world over, and he wished it so unders tood: he would defend it wherever his arm could reach . . . He also took pains to let the Pope understand, that he knew him to be at the bottom of th e unnatural persecuti on, and if he did not beware, he would see his ships in th e harbor of Civita Vecchia, and hear the thunder of his cannon around the Vatican. [ It was for this reason that the calculating rage of the Jesuit General would reach our hero through the Protector’s personal physician.

Its im piety is only equaled by its absurdity.” { 1 } John Hughes, 1864 Archbishop of New York Vigorous Defender of the Pope’s Temporal Pow er In 1598 King Henry IV issued the Edict of Nantes granting religious liberty to the Protestants of France. This act infuriated the Jesuits as it opposed their Council of Trent . As we have discovered in a previous chapter, the ki ng paid for this with his life; he was stabbed in the chest by a Jesuit-controlled assassin, Francois Ravaillac . Determined to implement th eir foreign policy – the evil Council of Trent – the Jesuits sought to abolish the Edict of Na ntes. The result would be the purging of France of its “heretic” Protestants. Their t ool for this heart-breaking injustice was the im moral “Sun King,” Louis XIV , whose belief in Rome’s works salvation drove him to murder the innocent: he was a spiritual captive at the feet of his confessor. In understanding the cause of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes we must review the famous intercepted lette r written by the king’s Jesuit confessor, Pere La Chaise , to Priest Peters , the Jesuit confessor of England’s corrupted King James II — who ultimately died in the palace of his cousin , King Louis XIV . We read his measured words with shocking unbelief, as they reflect the calculating coldness of the Council of Trent carried out by this, yet another, heartless Son of Loyola: “It cost m e m any threats and prom ises , before I could bring it thus far, our King being a long time very unwilling. But at last I got him on the hip, for he had lain with his da ughter-in-law, for which I would by no means give him absolution, till he ha d given me an instrument under his own hand and seal, to sacrifice all the heretics in one day .

Nay, more than that , I have m ade him beg for it on his knees before I would consent to absolve him .” { 2 } [Em phasis added] Hislop , in describing the psychology of cont rol used by the Jesuit, continues: “In the confessional, when they have an object to gain, they make the sins and transgressions good weight; and then, when they have a m an of influence, or power, or wealth to de al with, they will not give him the slightest hope till round sums of money, or the founding of an abbey, or som e other object on which they have set their heart, be cast into the other scale. In the fam ous letter of Pere La Chaise , the confessor of Louis XIV of France, giving an account of the m ethod which he adopted to gain the consent of that licentious Monarch to the revocation of the Edict of Nantes , by which such cruelties were inflicted on his innocent Huguenot subjects, we see how the fe ar of the scales of St. Michael operated in bringing about the desired result: – ‘many a time since,’ says the accom plished Jesuit, referring to an atrocious sin of which the king had been guilty, ‘ma ny a time since, when I have had him at confession, I have shook hell about his ea rs, and m ade him sigh, fear and tremble , before I would give him abso lution. By this I saw that he had still an inclination to me , and was willing to be under my government; so I set the baseness of the action before him by telling the whole story, and how wicked it was, and that it could not be forgiven till he had done som e good action to BALANCE that, and expiate the crim e. Whereupon he at last asked m e what he m ust do. I told him that he m ust root out all heretics from his kingdom .’ This was the ‘good action’ to be cast into the scale of St. Michael the Archangel, to ‘BALANCE’ his crime. The king, wick ed as he was – sore against his will – consented; the ‘good action’ wa s cast in, the ‘heretics’ were extirpated; and the king was absolved.” { 3 } [Em phasis added] So the Edict was revoked, the Huguenots lost their religious liberty and the protection of French law. “Let us see what the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes involved. The demolition of all the remaining Prot estant Temples throughout France, and the entire proscription of the Prot estant religion; the prohibition of The Jesuits – 1685 "},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 170 even private worship under penalty of confiscation of body and property; the banishm ent of all Protestant pa stors from France within fifteen days; the closing of all Protestant schools; the prohibition of parents to instruct their children in the Protestant faith; the injunction upon them , under a penalty of five hundred livres in each case, to have their children baptized by the parish priest, a nd brought up in the Rom an Catholic religion, the confiscation of the prope rty and goods of all Prot estant refugees who failed to return to France within four m onths; the penalty of the galleys for life to all men, and of imprisonmen t for life to all women, detected in the act of attempting to escape from France.” { 4} Then the fanatical Je suits with their Fren ch soldiers, called “ the Dragonnade ,” fulfilled the bloody Jesuit Oath and Council of Trent once again, shedding innocent blood throughout France. Of the bl oodthirsty Dragonnade we read: “The dragons entered the houses with drawn swords, shouting ‘kill, kill or become Catholics.’ The scenes of brutal outrage, wh ich occurred during these dragonnades, can not be describe d.

They beat them with whips; they struck them on the face with canes in order to disfigure them ; they dragged them by their hair in the m ud and over the stones . . . Great was the rejoicing of the Jesuits on the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes.” { 5 } Chiniquy , a French Canadian and one of our heroes, concludes: “It was to obey those bloody laws th at Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes, caused the death of half a million of men, women and children, who perished in all the highways of France, and caused twice that num ber to die in the land of exile, where they had found a refuge .” { 6} [Em phasis added] Ridpath agrees: “The regions where the Huguenot popul ation predom inated were reduced to a desolation , and it is estimated that Fran ce by her frightful barbarity to her own people lost fully half a million of her m ost industrious inhabitants . . .

The facts are that the Jesuits used their Masonic Jews to introduce it in 1848 with the Second French Revolution (Marx), and again in 1917 with the Bolshevik Revolution (Lenin). Several years later, in 1933, the Jesuits then m oved their Shriner Freem ason, Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR), to recognize Russia’s bloody governm ent.

In 1717 his Jesuit Order revived the Order of the Knights Templars – those bloodthirsty Crusaders – calling it “ Freemasonry .” Its purpose was to reestablish E nglish tyranny, restoring the Rom an Catholic Stuarts as “divine right Monarchs” subject to the Temporal Pow er of the Pope. Later in 1754, the Jesuits created Scottish Rite Freem asonry and in 1786 with their Protector, Frederick the Great, centralized all Mas onic power with the creation of Shriner Freem asonry. From 1789 to 1815 the Jesuits used this “warhorse” to punish the Rom an Catholic Monarc hs of Europe and the P apacy , including Pope Clement XIV , Pope Pius VI and Pope Pius VII , for suppressing the Jesuit Order in 1773. Since the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Satan’s Jesuit General has used Shriner Freemasonry for three purposes. Being keys of understanding, they are: 1. To maintain the Order’s death grip over the Pope, the College of Cardinals and thus the P apacy ( controlling the leaders of Roman Catholicism ) ; 2. To destroy the Protestant Reformation while restoring and maintaining the Temporal Power of the Order’s “infallible” Pope over every nation ( controlling the leaders of all Protes tants including the Orangemen, and pre Protestant “Christian” sects incl uding the Orthodox Church leadership ) ; 3. To gain possession of Jerusalem in order to rebuild Solomon’s Temple, for the Pope , after which every Maso nic Lodge is patterned ( controlling the leaders of all Islamic sects, includi ng the American Black Muslims, and the leaders of all Judaistic sects in cluding the Orthodox Chief Rabbis ) . Years later the Jesuits, using Shriner Freem asonry, would begin a powerful cult in George Washington’s Calvinistic Republic of the United States. The new brotherhood would be called “T he Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints” — Mormonism ! Being another salvation-by-works religion (like Roman Catholicism), its founder, Joseph Smith , was a high-level Freem ason. His successor, Brigham Young , was also another high Freem ason. According to the book Blackrobe , Brigham Young was an intim ate friend of Peter De Smet , one of the most powerful American Jesuits of the Nineteenth Century .

They were the confessors of nearly every king in Europe including the Pope. The Jesuit General knew the affair s of every nation and his soldiers were making millions of dollars fo r the Order. The Reductions produced herbs, hides, tallow, clocks and other goods , which the Jesuits traded in Europe with their huge fleet of ships. The profits were used to finance wars ag ainst the Protestant nations they had sworn to destroy. But all this wealth and power was ac quired in secret, as the kings of Portugal and Spain knew nothing about the Reductions . Therefore, upon the discovery of the Reductions , the most powerful Roman Catholic kings of Europe expelled the Jesuits from their dominions. First was King Joseph I of Portugal in 1759 with the help of his great Prime Minister Sebastian Cavalho , Marquis of Pombal . The king’s banishm ent of the Jesuits reads: “ . . . in order to protect m y roya l honour, which is equally the life and soul of the whole m onarchy; in order to m aintain uninjured m y independence as sovereign and ruler; in order to rem ove from the m idst of m y dom inions such extraordinary and great vexation, and to shield my subjects from similar frightful occu rrences with their sad results, I The Jesuits – 1750 - 1773 "},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 202 declare the so-called ecclesiastics – the Jesuits, namely – to be thoroughly corrupt, and to have rece ded from the rules of their Holy Order, and from deeply-rooted deprav ity to have become completely incapable of ever again learning to observe them; I declare them to be notorious rebels, traitors, enem ies, and disturbers of the peace , who have opposed, and will again oppose, my royal person and Government, the public peace of my kingdom, a nd the general welfare of my subjects, and, therefore order that each and every one of them m ay be looked upon as rebels and tra itors, and treated as such .

Hence, as a measure absolutely essential to the life of the nation, th e king issued a decree of banishm ent against the Jesuits as traitors, rebels , enem ies to, and aggressors on, his person, his States, and the public peace and the general good of the people. The Jesuits were then seized , transported to the States of the Church [ Italy ] under the jurisdiction of Clement XIII, and the three accused fathers were placed in prison to await his action . . .

The second expulsion was by the Bour bon King of France in 1764, having been heartily encourag ed by his mistress, Madame de Pompadour . Of Louis XV (nearly assassinated by the Jesuit-controlled Damiens for which he was burnt at the stake) and his Parliam ent’s righteous decree we read: “Whereupon, the investigation into th e constitution and statutes of the society (of Jesuits) . . . resulted in the enactm ent of a Parliam entary decree which shows the odium then attach ed to the society in France.

The third sovereign to expel the Jesuits was Charles III , the King of Spain, in 1767. He had read the Jesuit handbook, Secret Instructions of the Jesuits known as Secreta Monita (scanned onto a CD and enclosed herein). His confessor was a Franciscan – a confirm ed enem y of the Jesuits – and none of the Company were advisors in his Court. Of his renown we read: “His greatest work, the expulsion of the Jesuits, would never have been carried out if he had not been pers uaded of its political necessity.

What a movie this would make! “All the superior Spanish officials in the whole Spanish m onarchy, as well as all the military commandants in the towns in which there existed Jesuitical colleges, residencies, or houses of other description, at once received packets, the contents of which were precisely the same, and The Jesuits – 1750 - 1773 "},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 204 provided with the King’s seal; the contents thereof were extremely mysterious, as, upon the packet being opened, a nother was found provided with three seals, together with an open note, in which the following words were to be read: ‘On pain of death you shall not open the docum ent provided with three seals, previous to the 2 nd of April, at the hour of sunset, and the same punishment will await you, if anyone, be he whom he may, discloses his having received a secret writing.’ Precisely similar instructions were forwarded to all the prefects, governors, and com mandants, in di fferent colonies of Asia and Am erica...One m ay well im agine the anxiety that existed am ong those officials and com mandants on their rece iving this remarkable document, and not the less m ay it be supposed, how difficult it was for them to restrain their anxiety; but they all did so, without a single exception, and the secret remained inviolate up till the 2 nd of April.

Driven from the island of Malta in 1768 we discover: “In 1768 the Jesuits, having given m uch trouble, were expelled and their property confiscated.” { 12 } Little did the Knights know that they would pay dearly for this, as the Jesuits would use Napoleon to confiscate all their landed prope rty in France, invade Malta, plunder their weapons and treasures, and drive the Kn ights to an alien ex istence at the Court of Tz ar Paul I of Russia. (Dear truth-seeker, our lesson is we m ust never be blinded by the term s “Protestant,” “Rom an Catholic,” “Moslem ” or “Orthodox” when seeking to understand conflicts between nations for the last five hundred years – between patriotic, non-aggressive, nationalists opposing treasonous, im perialistic internationa lists – between the risen Son of G od with His Biblical Protestant-B aptist-Calvinist Reformation opposing Satan with his Tridentine ( Council of Trent ) Jesuitical Counter-Reformation . Knowing that the solution to any problem always lies in asking th e right question, we must unceasingly ask, “Where are the Jesu its and their Shriner Freemasons in this picture?” And in answering the questions, “ Who benefits ?” and “ Who suffers ?,” the smoke will clear and all will become naked before our eyes.) With the return of th e Jesuits to Italy, R. W. Thompson quotes the Rom an Catholic Louis Marie de Cormenin in his History of the Popes of Rome , “ . . . the soil of Italy was pollute d by this unclean slime which the nations had rejected, and which th ey had sent back to Rom e, the fountain of all corruption.” { 13 } The Jesuits – 1750 - 1773 "},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 206 With the Jesuits expelled from all of South Am erica and from the m ightiest Rom an Catholic nations on the continent, Europe’s kings dem ande d, under the threat of a form al declaration of war on the Vatican, that the Pope abolish the Company .

Cormenin . . . records th is event in the terse and expressive words: ‘ The Jesuits had poisoned him .’ ” { 14 } However, after a four-year investigation , his successor, Pope Clement XIV did sign a Bull of Suppression in 1773 “under the seal of the fisherm an,” part of which reads: “ . . . ‘that the name of the co mpany shall be, and is forever extinguished and suppressed;’ that ‘no one of them do carry their audacity so far as to im pugn, com bat, or even write or speak about the said suppression, or the reasons and motives of it;’ and that the said bull of suppression and abolition shall ‘forever and to all eternity be valid, permanent, and efficacious.’ ” { 15 } One of our hero ex-priests, Emmett McLoughlin , sheds further light on the power of “ the Company ” and the Pope’s extinction of so dastardly an Order. He writes: “The Jesuits have always been known to all other priests as the m ost treacherous, single-minded and supran ational of all Roman Catholic orders.

If it were not done, I would do it now. But THIS SUPPRESSION WILL BE MY DEATH .” { 17 } Further: “We can well believe with what a terri ble sense of responsibility the Pope signed this docum ent . . .

Dear truth-seeker, in addition to P opes, the Jesuit General using his m any soldiers has imprisoned or killed scores of liberal-minded priests within the Roman hierarchy and priesthood who dared to resist his absolutism .

Persecution of the Catholic Church in Germ any has been directed only against those elem ents which did not entirely submit to the ever-increasing centralization of authority in Church and State . To this end the Vatican helped crush out the Catholic popular parties both in Ital y and Germ any and centralized all political matters in Ro me. This insured to the dictators freedom from popular interference on the pa rt of Catholics; it established a more complete dictatorial regime within the Catholic Church itself ; it enabled the Vatican to ente r into secret concordats with fascist countries already existing, and with dem ocratic countries, like Spain, France, Belgium [ which, under the Order’s King Leopold II having invited the Jesuits into the Congo, murdered ten million Black Congolese ], and Portugal, after the destruction of their democratic govern ments by revolution and blitzkrieg. Finally it left the way clear for com plete harm ony and unity between Nazi- Fascism and Jesuit Catholicism . . . [ This is exactly the same scenario that will be followed within the American Empire during its coming White, “New Right,” fascist military dictatorship led by someone like the Jesuit-trained Knight of Malta, Patrick J.

Th e Jesuits, advising and directing their American Nazi fascists, will use domes tic concentration camps to murder “liberal,” Roman Catholic priests resi sting tyranny just as they did in Hitler’s Nazi Germany. This ruse of war will further create the deception that the Order’s American tyrant is against the Pope and his Hierarchy — to the delight of the B lack P ope !] With the extinction of libera l Catholicism and the imprisonment of liberal Protestant leaders, Vatican absolutism was trium phant. Of suprem e satisfaction to the Jesuit Catholic faction was the dissolution of Protestantism in Germany [ with the help of Jesuit General Ledochowski’s Grand Inquisitor, the Jesuit-trained Roman Catholic Joseph Djugashvili (“Son of a Jew”) Stalin (“Man of Steel”) , and his Red Army directed by the B lack P ope’s NKVD ].” { 26 } [Em phasis added] If the Jesuits, in assassinating their en emies, would kill Popes, Cardinals, Bishops and Priests, would th ey not kill a Roman Catholic American President if they thought it essential to the fulfillment of thei r imperial plans, while imposing their evil Council of Trent on us trusting and naive Am ericans?

It begins with the Order’s form al suppression by Pope Clement XIV in 1773 and ends with its form al reestablishment by Pope Pius VII in 1814 — a total of forty-one years . These forty-one years were absolutely golden for the Society of Jesus . For the Sons of Loyola punished all their enem ies including the Dom inican priests, perfected the inner workings between them selves and Freemasonry , created an alliance between the House of Rothschild in establishing the Illuminati , punished and then absorbed the Knights of Malta just like the “ Borg ” of Star Trek . They used the Orthodox Catherine II “the Great” of Russia and the Lutheran Frederick II “the Great” of Prussia to conquer and divide Po land, rendering the Pope’s Bull of Suppression and Extinction of no effect in that Roma n Catholic land. The Order caused the French Revol ution, beheading a Bourbon Catholic King , Louis XVI , and a Hapsburg Catholic Queen , Marie Antoinette , in retaliation for being expelled from France and Austria. With Napoleon the Freem ason they drove the Bourbons from their throne in Spain and the Braganz as from their throne in Portugal. They even attempted to take Palestine and thus Jerusalem from the Moslems, as did the Pope’s Crusaders, led by the evil Knights Templars of the Dark Ages.

The Bull was e ffective in countries where the Roman Catholic Church and the Civil State were united. In countries where another Church was united with the State, the Bull would not be enforced. Such was the case with Prussia and Russia. “Mother Russia” was gove rned by an absolute m onarchy, headed by the Rom anoffs. The Rom anoff dynasty was the legal protector of the Russian Orthodox Church , which included the Orthodox “Pope” called the “ Patriarch .” Church and State were united. Since P ope Clem ent XIV’s Bull of Suppression would not be enforced in Russia, the Jesuits sought and recei ved admittance and protection there. In spite of the fact that Peter the Great had expelled the Jesuits during his reign in 1719, Catherine the Great freely readmitted them once again in 1773. Catherine believed the Order would protec t her throne since she had m urdered her husband to acquire it. She was Germ an and a Lutheran, as well as a whore according to her son, Tz ar Paul I ; but as the Monarch of Ru ssia she was the protector of the Orthodox Church. Little did she know the secret designs of the Order as it deeply penetrated the Orthodox priesthood and acquired such political power that Tz ar Alexander I would expel it after the Congress of Vienna, in 1820. The other absolute Monarch who gave protection to the Jesuit Order was Frederick II “ the Great ,” King of Prussia. This he roic military leader of the Seven Years’ War with its Protestant victory was the protector of the Lutheran Church in that country. Church and State were un ited. Therefore, Clem ent XIV’s Bull of Suppression and Extinction was not enforced in Lutheran Prussia . . . So the Jesuits, “the Pope’s bodyguard,” sought and re ceived protection from Frederick II.

He adde d eight degrees to the twenty-five [ written by the Jesuits in France ] already recognized in Prussia, and founded a Suprem e Council of thirty-three degrees, of which he him self constructed the regulations in eighteen articles.” { 2 } Could it be that the Jesuits aided Frederick II in writing the additional eight degrees as well as establishing the Supreme Council of thirty-three degrees? This is one of the major connec tions between Jesuitism and Shriner Freem asonry. For when the Jesuits would cause the Russian Re volution in 1917 they would institute communism. (Communism had been perfect ed on their Reductions in Paraguay from 1600 to 1750.) And the great day of celebration in Stalin’s Russia and Hitler’s Germany would be May 1 st — the very day Frederick II instituted Shriner Freemasonry . Of this union between Frederick II and the Jesuits we read: “The Jesuits flocked, therefore, to Silesia from all quarters, seeking his Protestant protection, which caused Voltaire to remark in his caustic style, that ‘it would divert him be yond m easure to think of Frederick as the general of the Jesuits, and that he hoped this would inspire the Pope with the idea of becoming mufti.’ ” { 3 } Little did Frederick II know that Protestant Germ any would pay dearly for this . The Jesuits would penetrate the Lutheran clergy and add to th e words of Luther, portraying him as a Jew-hater! They would attack the B ible of Luther’s Germany with “higher criticism,” and overthrow Frederick II’s distant descendant, Kaiser Wilhelm II . The Jesuits would also bring Hitler to power and in their beloved Silesia (now Poland), would erect their Death Cam ps in which the Jews of Europe along with the Roman Catholic Roma (Gypsies, many of which were vagabond Jews by race) would be m ass m urdered.

On May 1, 1776, the Order of the Illu minati was officially founded at the Jesuit University of Ingolstadt in the old Jesuit stronghol d of Bavaria from which the Sons of Loyola had ignited the Thirty Years’ War. The Company would now use the Jewish House of Rothschild to finan ce the French Revolution, which would in turn enfranchise the Jewish People in 1791, furthering the illusion that “the Jews” were the real culprits behi nd the upheaval in France. Rothschild would also finance the rise of Napoleon the Freem ason with his Jesuit-trained advisor, Abbe Sieyes . In spite of the historical writings of the Jesuit Abbe Barruel , who blam ed the Rothschilds and Freem asonry for the Revolution, it was the Society of Jesus that used these very tools to carry out the Revolu tion and punish the Monarchs who dared to expel the Sons of Loyola from their dom inions. The Jesuits, having been expelled from the Spanish Em pire, found refuge in Co rsica. From there they raised up their great avenger, Napoleon Bonaparte . In the early forties, during World War II – nearing the end of the Second Thirty Years’ War – the Jesuits would again use their Rothschild Illuminati and Shriner Freem asonry to punish two nations having dared to expel the Order from their borders. In conjunction with the Roth schilds of England, they would use their “Federal Reserve Bank” to finance the build ing of a huge aerial war m achine. The B- 17s and B-29s would be used to destroy these nations, wh ich after the war would be rebuilt according to the religi ous and commercial blueprints of the Jesuit Order.

Knowing if they could control the English King, even though he was a Protestant and the protector of the Anglican Church, they could control the vast Britis h Empire. Then, that Empire, with the world’s greatest navy, could be used to s uppress Protestant liberty, both political and religious. Such was the case during Am erica’s War for Independence. According to Bancroft’s History of the United States , America’s thirteen colonies had been settled by Wh ite European Protestants — including Maryland . At the time of the Revolution, of the three milli on inhabitants, ninety -seven percent were Protestants and Baptists, the rest being Ro man Catholics and Jews. And what drove these displaced European Protestant s to a wild and unsettled land? It was the relentless and ferocious persecutions and wars having drenched Eur ope in Protestant and Baptist blood for over two hundred years . And as we have se en in our previous chapters these all were incited by the Jesuit Order! George Bancroft writes: “For more than two centuries the hum bler Protestant sects had sent up the cry to heaven for freedom to wors hip God. To the panting for this freedom half the American states ow ed their existence . . . The immense majority of the inhabitants of the thirteen colonies were Protestant dissenters . . .

In the Providence of the risen Son of G od , the Am erican Revolution erupted in 1775 — the sam e year Jesuit General Ricci supposedly died in the state prison of Cast el St. Angelo, Italy. (Like Hitler, his death could have been faked while he m ade his escape to another continent, possibly North Am erica. Interestingly, there was no formal successor to General Ricci for seven critical years until General Czerniewicz appeared in Russia.) Therefore, the Order had to punish Europe’s Rom an Catholic Mona rchs and the Pope for its suppression as well as im prison Pius VII as payback for the im prisonm ent and death of its General. It also had to prev ent the establishm ent of another Protestant “heretic and liberal” nation with a Constitu tional, non-absolute, form of government. To affect these ends the Jesu its sought control of the English throne. From there they could incite a revolution , justify a British Armada inva sion, and crush the preaching of the true gospel. From there the Jesuits could use England as a controlled enemy of Napoleon while he executed vengeance for th e Order. Therefore, the General of the Jesuits sought protection for his arm y of Jesuits from King George III . We read: “Clutching at straws [ Jesuit General Lorenzo ] Ricci had been heartened when King George III’s brother, the D uke of Gloucester, lunched with him and hinted at English support.” {8 } The Order received more than support . It was given all it needed, to survive and prosper, from George III . This wicked king also reestablished the English branch of the Knights of Malta in 1782, it having been banished from the Em pire for over two hundred years. In 1795, Stonyhurst, one of England’s m ost beautiful landed estates, was donated to the Company by an English lord, Thomas Weld . In exchange for the King’s protection, the Jesuits have never overturned but rather protected the British Crown, London having become the center of the world’s commerce. “It was Calvinism which formed the hosts who resisted and overcam e the worldly dictatorships of France, the Netherlands, and Great Britain. It Once in the Court of King George III the strategy of the B lack P ope becam e the foreign policy of England.

But these Protestants were Calvinists with a history of Biblical resistance to Jesuit tyranny. We read of these m en who did not hesitate to pit their convictions against the power of the state, the princes and dictatorships: was Calvinism which broke the chains in which the spiritu al dictatorship of Rom e and the Jesuits sought to enslave western Europe .

The answer is found in our second question: Why were these men able to resist th e Jesuits? Indeed, it was their creed, what they believed about Go d , man , themselves and the Pope , that enabled them to repel the armies of Rome. We read in their Westminster Confession of Faith of 1658 concerning what the Calvinists believed about Go d : II. God hath all life, glory, goodness, blessedness, in and of himself; and is alone in and unto him self all-suffi cient, not standing in need of any creatures which he hath m ade, not deriving any glory from them , but only manifesting his own glory, in, by, unto, and upon th em : he is “There is but one only, liv ing and true God, who is infinite in being and perfection, a m ost pure spirit, invisi ble, without body, parts, or passions, immutable, immense, eternal, inco mprehensible, alm ighty, m ost wise, mo st h oly, mo st free, mo st absolute, working all things according to the counsel of his own immutable and most righteous will, fo r his own glory; most loving, gracious, m erciful, long-suffering abundant in goodness and truth, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin; the rewarder of them that diligently seek him; and withal most just and terrible in his judgments; hating all sin, and will by no means clear the guilty. alone the foundation of all being, of whom , through whom , and to whom , are all things; and hath m ost sovereign dom inion over them , to do by them , for them , or upon them , whatsoever him self pleaseth.

He is m ost holy in all his counsels, in all his works, and in all his com mands. To him is due from angels and m en, and every other creature, whatsoever worship, servic e, or obedience, he is pleased to require of them .” { 10 } [Em phasis added] Of man , the Calvinists believed: “By the decree of God, for the manife station of his glory, som e m en and angels are predestinated unto everlasti ng life, and others foreordained to everlasting death. These angels and m en, thus predestinated and foreordained, are particularly a nd unchangeably designed; and their num ber is so certain and definite, th at it cannot be either increased or dim inished.” { 11 } The Jesuits – 1775 - 1815 "},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Chap ter 17 233 Of themselves , the Calvinists believed: “As God hath appointed the elect unto glory, so hath he, by the eternal and most free purpose of his will, foreor dained all the means thereunto.

Neither are any other redeem ed by Christ, effectually called, justified, adopted, sanctified, and saved, but the elect only . . . The doctrine of this high m ystery of predestination is to be handled with special prudence and care, that men attending the will of God revealed in his Word, and yielding obedience thereunto, m ay, from the certainty of their effectual vocation, be a ssured of their eternal election . So shall this doctrine afford matter of praise, revere nce, and adm iration of God, and of humility, diligence, and abundant consola tion to all that sincerely obey the Gospel.” { 12 } [Em phasis added] Lastly, of the Pope , the Calvinists believed: “There is no other head of the church but the Lord Jesus Christ ; nor can the Pope of Rom e in any sense be h ead thereof; but is that antichrist , that man of sin , and son of perdition { 13 } [Em phasis added] Ah, dear truth-seeker, sublimer words have never been written by sin-cursed men.

They in the minority, the P ope with his Jesuits and papists in the majority, the risen Son of G od mightily moved in answering their prayers , giving the world “ the Modern Era ” and the greatest refuge for the world’s persecuted Protestants, Baptists and Jews — The Federal (Calvinist) Republic of these United (Protestant) States of America ! They knew they were the elect and therefore believed whatever befell them was predestinated! For it was these White Celtic-Anglo-Saxon Calvinists who invented new technol ogies as did the learned Presbyterian Edwin H. Armstrong , the father of FM radio and m ore im portantly his Presbyterian predecessor, James Clerk Maxw ell , the father of electro-magnetic theory and engineering. They created prosperous civiliza tions out of barren wildernesses – like South Africa – and brought wealth and i ndustry to the great cities of Europe — like London, Paris, Berlin and Amsterdam . And it was the prayers, pens and swords of our American Calvinists that thwarted the de sign of Jesuit General Lorenzo Ricci whose evil agents attempted to make our Confederate Republic of these United States of America into a centra lized, Jesuit Empire of the West, with its “Rome on the Potomac,” subject to a British Monarch controlled by the B lack P ope . , that exalteth himself in the church against Christ, and all that is called God.” The Jesuits – 1775 - 1815 "},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 234 But above all the Calvinists regarded resistance to unlawful governm ent – the Anti-Christian tyranny of the Je suit General’s absolute monarchies – a sacred duty.

Then they bade m y blood be upon m y own head; but I told them th ey would find it would be on their heads, for it was owning of Christ’s kingl y office that they put me to suffer, say the contrary who will. This classic Calvinist conviction was expressed by a Scotch Covenanter, Isabel Alison , in 1681 before her heartless executi on by the governm ent agents of the Roman Catholic King Charles II . (In being fair, we must rem ember that during his reign the king, later given “the poison cup” on his deathbed in 1685, sanctioned Parliam ent’s decree to banish all Cat holic priests in 1662, consented to the Protestant’s anti-Popish “Test Act,” signe d a proclam ation in 1674 confirm ing all the pains and penalties issued against Catholic s by former sovereigns , and consented to the execution of no less that fourteen Jesuits , including the Provincial Fr.

Stealing quietly forward, he saw Washington’s horse tied to a sapling, and a little farther on, in a th icket, the chief himself, on his knees, and with tears streaming down his cheek s, beseeching Heaven for his country and his arm y.

Obviously, the risen Son of Go d worked mightily in answer to many prayers ! Enraged, the Jesuits would cause th e United Netherlands, France and Spain to pay dearly for this! Napoleon would destroy the Dutch Republic in 1795, driving King William I of Orange (1772-1843) into exile in London. In addition to France’s expulsion of the Order in 1764 and now her aid to the accursed Am erican “heretics and liberals,” the rage of the Jesuits w ould unleash the French Revolution. They would use Robespierre , brainwashed by Jesuits for nine years in their College of Louis-le-grand, to lead the Jacobi ns. The Jacobins would behead Louis XVI , who dared to resist the Order, and m urder his Hapsburg Queen Marie Antoinette , whose mother, Archduchess Maria Theresa , had expelled the Jesuits from Austria. They would cruelly torture and murder Louis’ young son, the Dauphin , and destroy the flower of French m anhood w ith the endless wars of Napoleon I. The Jesuits would break up the French Em pire and use King George III to restore the Bourbon Dynasty (after the Congress of Vienna) with their tyrannical Freem ason, Louis XVIII , who promptly readmitted the Jesu its. Spain suffered a similar punishment. The Jesuits used Napoleon to drive Spain’s Bourbon king, Charles IV , into exile and to begin to break up the Spanish Empire, race amalgamati on being one of their tactics. Again, they used George III to restore the Bourbon Dynasty (after the Congress of Vienna) with their beast, King Ferdinand VII of Spain (1808, 1814-1833), who then promptly readmitted the Jesuits and revi ved the Inquisition with all its fury.

He erected protective tariffs enabling the nation’s manufacturers to grow – and prosper – unlike the Jesuits’ oppressive North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) treaties of the 1990s. He left office after a glorious two term s as President and a brilliant Farewell Address with decency and honor. Lastly, it was George Washington who was so beloved by France’s General Lafayette .

We must remember that the Society of Jesus HATED George Washington and for good reason. The Revolution that Jesuit General Lorenzo Ricci had helped to foment, using continental, Bibl e-hating, pagan Freemasons like Benjamin Franklin , Thomas Jefferson and John Adams , was intended to be a War of Annihilation – a war that would have to wait fo r the passing of two generations in order to be successfully waged against the White Protestant South from 1861 to 1865. Employing the British Army, sevent een thousand Hessian mercenaries and the bloodletting Six Indian Nations , the war was to be a successful repeat of the Order’s French Indian War having been lost to England’s King George II (fully aware of the Order’s Secret Instructions ) in 1763. Once successful, with the aid of certain traitors within the Continental Congress who sought to overthrow General Washington as the Commander of the Con tinental Army while deliberately cutting off payments to our patriotic soldiers th ereby attempting to effect a mutiny, the Baptist and Protestant Colonies would be subordinated to the Anglican Church, it being under the control of the Jesuits via its protector, King George III . With the intended subjugation of the Colonies, which were then to be managed exactly like the Society’s communist Reductions in South America, the Jesuit General would then be able to realize th e goal of his Order in making the White Pope the Universal Monarch of the World . He would use his British Empire, with the world’s mightiest Navy, supported by the “reduced and centralized” American Colonies governed by their federal city of Washington, D.C. – surnamed “Rome on the Potomac” and designed by the Orde r’s continental French Freemason, Pierre-Charles L’Enfant , the job having been obtai ned through the intercession of Jesuit John Carroll – to subjugate all the governments of the world to the Temporal Power of the Pope. This Anglo-Am erican Jesuit-controlled Japhetic “Protestant Kingdom” in alliance with th e Order’s European, Japhetic, “Catholic Holy Alliance” established in 1815 (after the Company had used Napoleon to punish the Pope and Roman Catholic M onarchs of Europe for suppressing the Society from 1773 to 1814), was intended to be the death knell to the risen Son of God’s grand and glorious Protestant Reformation . Imagine, “Protestant” King George III acting in concert with “Roman Catholic” Prince von Metternich subject to Jesuit General Johannes Roothaan — the rebuilder of the Jesuits! But our hero, George Washington, brought the Revolution to a successful termination striking a major blow for Protestant liberty, thus outraging the Devil’s Jesuits.

He brought calm and stability to the discussions of the Convention, and within ninety days our organic document was complete, having been modeled after the Protestant Pelatiah Webster’s Treatise on Government written in 1775. Additionally, the Baptist-Calvinist James Madison , compelled by the demand of Virginia’s leading Baptist-Calvinist preacher, John Leland , added to the Constitution the Baptist Bill of Rights (modeled after the Baptist Calvinist George Mason’s Declaration of Rights adopted by Virginia, the “E mpire State of the South”). This further infuriated the Jesuit General and his fanatical Order of brainwashed cutthroats! Our gallant Washington (who, when he wa s fourteen years of age, wrote his 110 Rules of Civility and Decent Behavior ) went on to further stifle the Order’s quest in establishing absolutism in Ameri ca. He, unlike Napoleon, stoutly refused the title of “King,” as a monarchy could be more easily corrupted than a republic. He was unanimously chosen to be the first President of these federated United States of America , and he erected a protective tari ff stimulating the growth of our domestic manufacturers. Having inspir ed the 1792 Coinage Act, the Federal Government properly began minting gold and silver coins as lawful money. He abolished worthless paper currency calle d “continentals”, saving the nation from bankruptcy. After eight years in guidi ng the nation as its first and greatest President, he dealt the Order his final blow with his immemorial Farewell Address given in 1796 — America’s greatest state paper! In it he warned of the “insidious wiles of foreign influence” knowing full we ll the power of the Jesuit Order having been exercised over the nations of Europe for over two hundred years prior to this, his last address. (It is staggering to not e, when the Jesuits fomented our terrible War Between the States waged from 1861 to 1865, they merely instituted the federal policies to be avoi ded as described in the Farewell Address , one of them being the geographical division of our country into “the North” and “the South.”) It is for these reasons that our inspirational President George Washington became the greatest enemy of the Jesuit Or der throughout the Eighteenth Century. If the Society had murdered the Kings of France and England in the past, why would it not murder the greatest “accursed heretic” of the age, pursuant to the Council of Trent ? Indeed it did! With those masters of murder slipping him the poison cup on December 12, 1799, Washington was stricken at sixty-seven years of age in the full vigor of life. America’s greatest historian, J. T. Headley , in his The Life of Washington , on pages 465 to 467, describes the sufferings of our hero whose life ended on December 14 th , a mere two days after he became ill. Dr. Craik , Dr. Brown and Dr. Dick , after bleeding him, were “ powerless against the disease,” making “the last struggles doubly violent ,” which brought him to “the point of suffocation . . . . death seemed doubly terrible , when with one quick blow it could carry so much to the grave.” This, dear truth-seeker, is the poison cup!

In Washington’s darkest hour, he is weeping on his knees in prayer at Valley Forge. In Napoleon’s darkest hour, he is abandoning his arm y in the snows of Russia, it being left to the mercy of the Cossacks. Washington refuses the title of “King” while Napoleon accepts the crown from the Pope as “Emperor.” Further, the people of the colonies were Protestant Calvinists and Bible-reading ; the people of France were disillusioned, atheistic Catholics , the Jesuits having outlawed the B ible and Protestantism for over one hundred year s since the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. The outcome of the American Revolution was a Constitutional Republic of federated soverei gn States. The outcom e of the French Revolution was a Jesuit-controlled military dictator resulting in the restoration of a Jesuit-controlled Monarch, Louis XVIII . The Jesuits had their way in France; but, with their “Federalists” in America, failed to establis h absolutism, the Calvinistic, States’ Rights Anti-Federalists emphatically warning that Washington, D.C. would becom e the Pope’s dom ain. That victory of the B lack P ope would have to wait until 1868 . But the Jesuits, with King George III who later became deaf and blind for persecuting the Bible-believing Church of the risen Son of G od , were still alive and plotting. While Napoleon was busy deliberatel y sacrificing his arm y in the snows of Russia, George III invaded America again with the War of 1812 . The apostate English Protestants set fire to our White House on August 24, 1814, and threatened to reduce us to serving the British Cr own once again. But the risen Son of G od sent us a second deliverer who was the savi or of our Protestant Republic Washington had established. This m an, the hero of New Orleans, was none other than “Old Hickory” – another Protestant Southerner – President Andrew Jack son.

By saving this “heretic” nation in restoring economic stability th rough abolishing “the United St ates Bank,” returning to hard m oney (gold and silver coins) and er ecting a protective tari ff thereby helping our dom estic m anufacturers, the Jesuits attem pted to shoot him at point-blank range with one of their dupes.

These sovereigns had aided the Protestant American “ heretics ” in their revolt from King George III . Additionally, both the Bourbon and Hapsburg dynasties had expelled the Je suits from their countries. Louis XV , the grandfather of Louis XVI, had expelled the Jesuits from France and Archduchess Maria Theresa , the mother of Queen Marie Antoinette , had expelled the Jesuits from Austria.

We must remember th at the Order of the Dominicans was the enemy of the Jesuits from the inception of th e Jesuit Order! Furthe r, when the Jesuits had been suppressed by the Pope, the Dom inicans took back the “Holy Office of the Inquisition,” thus outraging the Jesuit Order. Could this be the reason why Napoleon made war on the Inquisition, exposing the dastardly deeds of the Dominican inquisitors to the light of day? For exam ple: “Even as late as the tim e of Napoleon, we read that after his troops had captured Toledo, an Inquisition prison was opened there. The historian of Napoleon’s wars said it was like opening tom bs, as the poor captives cam e forth. Their beards had grow n down over their chests, their finger nails were like bird claws, and thei r bodies not m uch m ore than m ere skeletons. Som e of them had not breathed fresh air in years.

Would not the Jesuits have benefited had Napoleon conquered Jerusa lem , he having called for the establishment of “ Jerusalem for the Jews” on April 14, 1799? Why did nearly every strategy of Napoleon result in benefiting the Je suit Order? The answer is in the person of Abbe Sieyes . According to Ridpath’s Universal History this priest was a prim e m over of the French Revolution, th e Directory, and was the Second Consul on Napoleon’s Consulate ( Pierre-Roger Ducos being the third), calling for the end of the nobility and clergy — the enemies of the Society of Jesus ! It is also most fascinating to see that Sieyes, the m an whose coup d’etat brought Napoleon to power, was Jesuit-trained.

Following Napoleon’s Russian cam paign – his successful be trayal and murder of hundreds of thousands of fr eedom-loving republican soldiers – the Jesuits sought to restore the old order of things. The Jesuit Order was revived in 1814 and the Congress of Vienna began as well. Meanwhile, Napoleon was rewarded for a job well done with an annual pension of two million francs while on the island of Elba. But the Monarchs at the Congress of Vi enna squabbled; so, the Jesuits brought Napoleon back to France, known as “the hundred days.” This frightened the Monarchs into com ing to term s with each other. With the Congress of Vienna having fulfilled the purpose of the Je suit Order, the soldiers of France could now be finally defeated.

In awe and in anger he declared: “The Jesuits are a military organization , not a religious order. Their chief is a general of an arm y, not the mere father abbot of a m onastery.

The Jesuits had used King George III to protect their Masonic King Louis XVIII while in exile during the French Revolution and Napoleonic wars. Having betrayed Napoleon into the hands of his captors, they used the English king to banish the Em pero r to a distant island in the middle of the South Atlantic Ocean. They again used George III to restore Louis XVIII to the throne of France.

The Jesuits then used French troops to suppress popular liberty in Spain pursuant to the oppressive policy of their “ Holy Alliance ,” called by the Saxons “ the White Terror .” The m urder of Napoleon crushed the hope of the French for liberal governm ent and silenced the only rival of Louis XVIII as he enforced the Jesuits’ tyrannical program for the Continent. Little did the French people know that Napoleon had been only a tool of the Jesuit Order and was never intended to bring popular, “ liberal ” governm ent to the European nations. If the Jesuits would poison Pope Clement XIV , would they not poison Napoleon ? And if they would poison Napole on would they not assassinate an American President like John F. Kennedy ?

The intended result was to have the P apal Caesar ruling the world from Solomon’s ebuilt Temple in Jerusalem as the Theocratic Universal Monarch of the World . r But before we begin our next chapter, please , dear truth-seeker, read the following brief history of the Knights of Malta, received from the secretary at their office in St. Patrick’s Cathedral, New York. Note that on the last page, the Order has established form al diplom atic relations w ith Cuba, presently oppressed by that Jesuit- trained, Jesuit Temporal Coadjutor, bastard s on of a Nazi and fascist military dictator – that Com munist Rom an Catholic son of the Church – Fidel Castro. As we shall later see, the Knights of Malta, in control of the CIA and the Pentagon, put Castro in power, as Castro is a puppet of the Jesuits’ “ infallible ” Pope. And being one of the Pope’s “altar boys” enforcing the Temporal Pow er of “the Vicar of Christ,” he forb ids the free circulation of the P rotestant B ible , has caused a mass Jewish exodus to Israel and Miam i by the thousands, while cruelly suppressing any m ovem ent towards liberal, popular governm ent pursuant to the Council of Trent . Notice also that the Ameri can Branch of the Knights of Malta was established in 1927. This was one year before the Company created Opus Dei (another international Brotherhood dedicated to the restoration of the Pope’s Temporal Pow er and the D ark A ges ) in Spain and two years before the Knights caused the Great Depression, which in effect m ade the Je suits’ Federal Reserve Bank the financial monopoly of the Am erican Em pire created in 1868. This was five years before they attempted to make FDR a fascist dictator who, as President, form ally recognized Jesuit-trained Joseph Stalin’s bloody governm ent. This enabled the Am erican Knights, in control of the Empire’s Milita ry Industrial Complex, to aid the Russian nights in building the Military Industrial Complex of the Jesuits’ Soviet Empire. K Then one day in 1962 three puppets of the Jesuits ( Kennedy , Khrushchev and Castro ), overseen by the intelligence agencies of the Knights of Malta (the CIA and KGB), created the hoax called “the Cuban Missile Crisis. ” That deceit was based on another hoax called “ the Cold War ” which in turn was ba sed on yet another hoax called “ Nuclear War .” The fear created by the Am erican press, controlled by Cardinal Spellman through his Knight of Malta Henry R. Luce (whose nicknam e as one of Yale’s Skull and Bone s members was appropriately “ Baal ”), resulted in a secret agreement between “the superpow ers.” That agreement, prohibiting an Am erican invasion of Cuba, secured the isla nd as a landing base for a future foreign invasion of the Am erican Protestant South — pursuant to the evil Council of Trent .

Martin HISTORY OF THE ORDER OF MALTA The Order of St. John was founded be fore the taking of Jerusalem in 1099 by the arm ies of the First Crusade. It began as a m onastic com munity, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, whic h adm inistered a hospice-infirm ary for pilgrim s to the Holy Land. Origina lly connected with the Benedictines, it becam e, under Blessed Gerard (1120), an independent organization. By the Bull of 15 February 1113, a ddressed to Gerard, Pope Pascal II approved the confraternity of the Hospital of St. J ohn, placed it under the protection of the Holy See, and ensured its right of freel y electing its heads, Gerard’s successors, without any interference from any other eccl esiastical or any lay authority. In virtue of this Bull and of subsequent Papal acts, the Hospital became an exempt Order of the Church. Owing to the political situation afte r the setting up by the Crusaders of the Kingdom of Jerusalem , the Order, now under its second head (and the first to be styled Master), Fra Raym ond du Puy, was obliged to assum e m ilitary functions for the protection of the sick, the pilgrim s, and the Christian territory which the Crusaders had won back from th e Muslims. Accordingly, the Order of the Hospital of St. John acquired the additional character of an Order of Knighthood. The Knights were thus also Religious, bound by the three monastic vows of Obedience, Chastity, a nd Poverty. It thus became a persona mixta, a religious-m ilitary Order.

While continuing on a vast scale its hospitaller activity, one of its two aim s: obsequium pauperum (service of the poor), the Order pursued valiantly its other aim – the defense of Christendom : tu itio fidei (protection of the Faith). However, in 1291, Acre, the last Chris tian stronghold in the Holy Land was lost and the Order settled tem porarily in Cyprus. From the beginning, the Order’s inde pendence of all other States, in virtue of Papal acts, and its universa lly recognized right to m aintain arm ed forces and wage war constituted its in ternational sovereignty. With the occupation of the island of Rhodes, co mpleted in 1310 under the Grand Master Fra Foulques de Villa ret, the Order acquired territo rial sovereignty as well (and the Knights of St. John cam e to be calle d Knights of Rhodes). The island faced Muslim territorial and naval m ight and becam e a bastion of Christendom in the East Mediterranean sea. The m ilitary defense of Christendom now of necessity required naval action. Accordingly, the Order came to possess a powerful fl eet; it patrolled the East Mediterranean waters and enga ged in m any renowned battles with the enem y. It took part in the crusades in Syria and in Egypt and brought aid to the Christian Kingdom of Arm enia (Cilicia) against Muslim invaders. The m embers of the Order who cam e to Rhodes from all over Europe, as well as the establishm ents of the Orde r in Europe, were from the beginning of the fourteenth century, grouped accordi ng to languages spoken. There were thus, initially, seven such groups of Langues (Tongues): Province, Auvergne, France, Italy Aragon(-Navarre), England (with Scotland and Ire land), Germ any. In 1462 Castile and Portugal separated fro m the Langue of Aragon and form ed together the eight Langues. In the sixteenth century the Langue of England was suppr essed and later, in 1782, tem porarily reestablished unde r the nam e of the Anglo-Bavarian Langue. Each Langue was com posed of Priories or Grand Priories, Bailiwicks, and Com manderies.

The Grand Master was Prince of Rhodes, as later he was Prince of Malta. The high offices of the Order were attributed to represen tatives of different Langues; and the seat of the Order, the Convent, was in eff ect com posed of a num ber of national religious houses. The Knights gallantly repulsed num erous Turkish assaults, until the Sultan Suleym an the Magnificent attacked Rhodes with a large fleet and a powerful arm y. On Christm as Eve of 1522 the Knights were forced to capitulate and, on 1 January 1523, left the island with m ilitary honors. For the next seven years the Order, while vested with internationa l sovereignty, was deprived of territory, until the cessi on by the Em peror Charles V (in his capacity as King of Sicily) of the isla nds of Malta, Gozo, and Com ino, as well as Tripoli in North Africa, in sovereign fief. On 26 October 1530 the Grand Master Fra Philippe de Villiers de l’Isle- Adam took possession of Malta, with the a pprobation of Pope Clem ent VII. It was stipulated that the Order was to re main neutral in wars between Christian nations. Yet the war of defense of Christe ndom went on. The Turks attacked Malta, but in the Great Siege, from 18 May to 8 Septem ber 1565, were finally routed by the Knights led by the heroic Grand Master Fra Jean de la Vallette- Parisot (after whom the island’s capital Valletta is nam ed). The decline of Ottom an sea power dates from the defeat of 1565. The navy of the Order of St. John (or of Malta as it now cam e to be called) becam e one of the m ost powerful in the Mediterranean and took part in th e final destruction of the Ottom an naval might in the great battle of Lepanto in 1571. In 1607 and, again, in 1620, the dign ity of Grand Master was conjoined with the title of Prince of the Holy Rom an Em pire and in 1630 with the rank equal to the dignity of a Cardinal of th e Holy Roman Church with the style of Eminence. In 1798 Bonaparte, engaged in a cam paign against Egypt, occupied the island of Malta and drove out the Order. The Knights again found them selves without a hom e. This was followed by what has been called the Russian coup d’etat (1798-1803). The Em peror Paul I of Russia, who had shown him self a The Jesuits – 1801 - 1814 "},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Chap ter 19 257 friend of the Order, now had him self pr oclaim ed Grand Master by a handful of Knights then in Russia, in place of the Grand Master Fra Ferdinand von Hom pesch zu Bolheim who had been oblig ed to abandon Malta to the French. This proclam ation of a m arried non-Catho lic as head of a Catholic religious order was wholly illegal a nd void, and never recognized by the Holy See (a necessary condition for legitim acy). Acco rdingly, Paul I, who was nevertheless accepted by m any Knights and a num ber of governm ents can only be regarded as a Grand Master de facto , never one de jure . His successor Alexander I, on the other hand, helped the Order to re turn to legitim ate rule; and in 1803 Fra Giovanni Battista Tom masi was elected Grand Master. The British had meantim e occupied Malta in 1801 and though the Treaty of Am iens (1802) recognized the Order’s sovereign rights ove r the island, it has never been able to avail itself of them . After temporary seats in Messina, Cat ania and Ferrara the Order finally established itself in 1834 in Rom e, where it holds, extra-territorially, the Malta Palace at 68 Via Condotti and Villa on th e Aventine. From 1805 the Order was ruled by Lieutenants, until in 1879 wh en Pope Leo XIII restored the Grandm astership and the honors of a Cardina l attaching to it. Hospitaller work, the original work of the Order, becam e once again its main concern. The hospital and welfare activities, undertaken on a considerable scale in World War I, were greatly intensified and expanded in World War II under the Grand Master Fra Ludovico Chigi della Rovere Albani [ Albani della Rovere ]. The activities of the Order have been further expanded under the rule of Grand Master Fra Angelo de Moja na di Cologna (1962-1988), who was succeeded by the present Prince and Grand Master Fra Andrew Bertie. The Order of Malta constitutes the sole unbroken continuation of the Order of the Hospital of St. John recogni zed in 1113. It alone is a religious Order of the Catholic Church and at the same time a Catholic Order of Knighthood. It alone contains the govern ing nucleus of the professed Knights of Justice, direct successors of its founders, from am ong whom the Grand Master and m ost of the m embers of the Sovereign Council are elected, and which is placed above the ranks of the lay Knights, grown num erous since the fall of Malta. It has never ceased to be recognized by the com munity of nations as sovereign and independe nt of any civil power.

THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION On April 28, 1927 at the special request of the Holy Father, Pope Pius XI [ whose confessors were Jesuits Alissiardi and Celebrano ], the Suprem e Council of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta granted a Constitution (Charter) creating the: AMERICAN CHAPTER OF THE KNIGHTS OF THE SOVEREIGN MILITARY ORDER OF MALTA (End of History of the Order of Malta having begun on page 240) Recalling previous chapters, the Kni ghts of Malta expelled the Jesuits from their island of Malta in 1768. So Napoleon the Freem ason, with his French Fleet, was used by the Jesuits to retu rn the insult, driving the Knights from Malta, absorbing their weapons and treasures thirty years late r. (The Order never forgives or forgets!) And to where would those ancient Cr usaders go? The Knights sought and received protection from the Russian Tz ar Paul I (having designated him self as their Grand Master ) and stayed in his Im perial Pa lace from 1798 onward. It just so happened that on March 7, 1801, the Polish Jesuit Vicar General Francisk us Xavier Kareu , also appeared in Russia. (For it was in 1801 that the suppressed Company of Jesus was given legal existence and perm ission to reside in that “heretic” nation by Pope Pius VII ). What reason could justify this secret rendezvous? The Knights of Malta and the Jesuit Order had mutual in terests. They both wanted to take Jerusalem away from the Moslems and rebuild Solomon’s Temple for the Pope. So having been hum bled by the Jesuits with Napoleon , they evidently agreed to be subordinate to the Jesuit General. The Knights would never be expelled from Russia unlike the Jesuit Order. By 1878, the Jesuit-trained Pope Leo XIII gave the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta the status of a Cardin al. This act form ally subordinated these warriors to the Pope — the now “ infallible ” Pope under Jesuit control. In 1927, the Am erican Branch of the Kn ights of Malta was established at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New Yo rk. One of the original thirteen founding m embers was John J.

Dear truth-seeker, the Knights and the Jesuits then and now work together! This m ay seem irrelevant but it is im portant for you to understand th is connection. As we shall see, the Knights financed Lenin and Hitler from Wall Street also using their Federal Reserve Bank headed by a Masonic Jew and CFR m ember, Paul M. Warburg . The Knights negotiated the Concordat (a Papal treaty) between the Pope and Hitler in the person of Franz von Papen . The Knights, as American ambassadors, coordinated Roosevelt with Churchill and Pius XII using Joseph P. Kennedy and Myron C. Taylor , another CFR m ember. They also helped top Nazis to escape to North and South Am erica after World War II using William J. Donovan , James J. Angleton , William J. Casey and Argentina’s President Juan D. Peron . In America the Knights w ith their Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which later became the Central Intelligence Ag ency (CIA), were behind the Pentagon’s “ Operation Paperclip ,” (publicly exposed in 1984) m oving the Jesuit General’s Third Reich across the Atlantic. After Worl d War II, over two t housand top Nazis and scientists were illegally secreted in to the United States, including SS Major Werner von Braun . Many were placed in the top- secret military installation in Tonopah, Nevada known as “ Area 51 .” The perfection of the Nazis’ anti-gravity aircraft (flying saucers made of Pyrex with a mirrored finish by Corning Incorporated, General Electric Com pany and Lockheed Martin, all three corporations being represented on the Council on Foreign Relations ) was to be com pleted there, am ong other secret light-electro-m agnetic technol ogies. “Operation Paperclip” was overseen by Am erica’s m ost powerful Knight of Malta, J. Peter Grace . Grace was subject to the Jesuit-trained Archbishop Spellman , as the Am erican headquarters for the Knights was and is St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York. Years later the Knights would oversee another clandestine event known as “ Operation Mongoose .” Mongoose, like Hitler’s “ Operation Barbarossa ” was a Jesuit-controlled fascist Crusade, betray ed by high-ranking intelligence officers who were Knights of Malta loyal to the Jesuit General. The result of the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Cuban Missile Cr isis and Operation Mongoose – all failures due to high treason – was the securing of Jesuit-trained Fidel Castro’s absolute power over Rom an Catholic Cuba.

Both Inquisitions have been fi nanced and supported by the Jesuit-controlled governments of the United States and Great Britain — to the shame and disgrace of both generally Protestant peoples! The Jesuits, refusing to pe rmit President Kennedy to destroy their CIA, called upon th eir fanatical “Cold Warrior,” Francis Cardinal Spellman .

O. Rossi , who was later assassinated. This resulted in the Jesuits causing a revolution in 1848 forcing the Pope to flee the city. Upon his return in 1849, protected by the French troops of Louis Napoleon , Pius IX obeyed his Jesuit masters becom ing thoroughly absolutist for the rest of his Pontificate.) But if the Pope determ ines to resist the power and purpose of the “Father General” he suddenly dies, as Pope John XXIII in 1963.

Metternich was also the bosom friend of that “Radical Red/ Black Republican” from Massachusetts, Senator Charles Sumner .

She has never gone to war ag ainst France, especially the governm ent of Napoleon III thanks to her treasonous Prim e Minister and Shriner Freemason, Viscount Palmerston (1830-1865); but, to the contrary, has sided with the French during both the Crim ean War (1856) and the war in China against the Manchu Dynasty (1860). She also sided with Fr ance when the Jesuits’ Napoleon III sent his troops to invade Mexico during th e Am erican “Civil War,” as well as during World War I and World War II — the Second Thirty Years’ War . It is for this reason that England, France and the Pope never gave any true aid to the Protestant governm ent of the Southern Confederacy during the American Civil War, properly called “the War Between the States” or “the War for Southern Independence.” England threatened war with the North if Lincol n (having only forty- four percent of the popular vot e) would not radically em ancipate the southern slaves. As calculated, the Emancipation Proclamation destroyed the Southern culture that generally had been a blessing to the Negroe s, in contrast to their barbarism and cannibalism in Africa. France sent troops in to Mexico pretending to unite with the Confederacy, but withdrew giving only the appearance that it favored the South. ( Pope Pius IX , towards the end of th e war, sent a letter to Jefferson Davis calling him the “President of the United States.” This too was a ruse of war, as Pius IX could have prevented the immigration and enlistment of thousands of Irish Roman Catholics in the Northern Army , thereby sparing Protestant Georgia of General Sherman’s raping and thieving “bum mers” during his Crusader’s m arch from Atlanta to Savannah. Clearly, “the Holy Alliance” w ith its Jesuits, favored the North and its Radical Red Republican party, the new Federalists.)

In 1967 the Temple site was taken from the Moslems enabling the Masonic Jews to lay the plans for the rebuilding of Solomon’s Temple . The Arabs fully anticipated this. Pierre van Paassen , a friend of the Jewish People, speaking fluent Hebrew and one of the greatest international corres pondents of his day, wrote in 1939: “In 1929 the Mufti [ Haj Amin al-Husseini , Arafat’s uncle and tool of the Order who, during Israel’s War of Independence in 1948, would secretly aid Chaim Weiz mann by ordering all Arabs to flee Palestine until the battle was over thereby securing victory for the Pope’s Zionists ] raised the issue of religion: behind th e peaceful behavior of th e Jews loomed a sinister design to secure a num erical m ajority in the country.

We shall first clarify the rela tionship between the political doctrine of Communism and the secret society of International Freemasonry . Rem embering our previous chapters, we know that socialist-com munism was perfected by the Jesuits on their commercial “ Reductions ” or “ Communes ” from 1600 to 1750. The reductions had a storehouse or central bank and the enslaved Indians contributed, “each according to his ability,” and received, “each according to his need.” We also know from our previous chapters that the old military Order of the Knights Templars – abolished by Pope Clement V in 1312 – was revived in 1717 in England called “ Freemasonry .” Its stated purpose was to restore the pro-Jesuit Stuart Dynasty to the throne of England. Th is occult, Luciferian religion of Freem asonry, grounded in the pagan, phallic, sex-worshipping mysteries of ancient Babylon , was intended to create a universal religious and political Empire. Its doctrines would be in accord with the Council of Trent and its political agenda subject to the Jesuit General. Therefore, we are not surprised in discovering that the Jesuit Order – the creator of modern communism – has written all the rites of Scottish Rite Freemasonry . In a letter written by Charles Sotheran addressed to the New York Press Club, dated January 11, 1877, we read: “It is curious to note too that m ost of the bodies which work these, such as the Ancient and Accepted Scottish R ite, the Rite of Avignon, the Order of the Tem ple, Fesslor’s Rite, the ‘G rand Council of the Em perors of the East and West Sovereign Prince Mas ons’, etc., etc., are nearly all the offspring of the sons of Ignatius Loyola . The Baron Hundt, Chevalier Ramsey, Tschoudy, Zinnendorf, and num erous others, who founded the grades in these rites, worked under instructions from the General of the Jesuits . The nest where these high degrees were hatched, and no Masonic rite is free from their balefu l influence more or less, was the Jesuit College of Clermont at Paris .” { 7 } [Em phasis added] (Dear truth seeker, what a perfect tool Free masonry has proven to be in effecting the reunion between Protestantism and Jesuit Ro manism !

The Jesuits boldly attack these systems with their mouthpiece, the P apal Caesar , or simply tolerate them. But they do all to conceal the facts that prove the Society of Jesus brought these diabolical system s into existence and control them both. On the surface the Jesuits appear to suffer by com munist revolutions but after the dust clears they always benefit! An example of this is the Second French Revolution of 1848. The Jesuits, in defense of absolutism, claimed they suffe red from this revolution. We read in a letter written by a Jesuit Provincial to the King of Naples in 1854: “Majesty, that we both think, and believe, and sustain that absolute monarchy is the best of governm ents, is dem onstrated by the dam age we sustained in the year 1848. We were the victim s of liberalism , because all liberals were and are well persua ded also, that the Jesuits are the supporters of absolute m onarchy.” { 13 } Yet in France, all the facts point to the realization that the Jesuits ultimately benefited from the revolution. Freem ason Louis XVIII was a Jesuit tool ruling France from 1814 to 1824. His Rom an Catholic brother Charles X , – another one of the Order’s high-level Freemasons – then ruled under Jesuit supervision from 1824 until he abdicated in 1830, ending the Bourbon Dynasty. But then an enemy of the Jesuits and Metternich’s Holy Alliance emerged on the scene. He was Louis Philippe , declared “King of the Fr ench.” He was known as “ The Citiz en-King ,” and his governm ent was one of m oderation a nd order. His policies, like those of Henry IV , were benefiting the people while the idea of absolute m onarchy was a thing of the past. In 1831 he expelled Satan’s Jesuit Order from France and refused to send French troops to protect the Pope during the Italian revolution . . . So the Jesuits used the Austrians. And what was the response of the Jesuits to th is liberal King? They hated him and set the powers of the Holy Alliance against him. An agent of the Jesuits attem pted to assassinate him w ith a special gun, but failed, only wounding him . Finally, the Order fom ented the Revolution of 1848 , led by its Freem asons crying their old Masonic watchwords of “ liberty, equality, and fraternity !” The Citizen-King abdicated, his throne was pub licly burned and he was banished from France. Four years later, the French f ound them selves under the absolutism of the Jesuits’ Napoleon III along with the continual plague of foreign war! It was the same story for Italy — bestowing temporary liberty giving way to tyranny . Replacing the Citizen-King’s liberal monarchy with a republic, the Jesuits installed Louis Napoleon as the President of France. He was the nephew of that great tool of the Order and Freem ason, Napoleon Bonaparte . Louis Napoleon’s first act was to return the Pope to Rome, thereby destroying the Ita lian Republic established in 1848, with the troops of republican France! The year was 1849.

As a result, the Pope would be deprived of his Temporal Pow er (the right to rule the governm ents of all nations) for nearly sixty years. But Roman Catholic Italy would pay dearly for this during World War I and World War II, the Second Thirty Years’ War . One of the m any benefits accruing to the Jesuits during the Second Thirty Years’ War would be the restoration of the Pope’s Temporal Pow er in 1929.

Mussolini’s confessor was the secretary of the Company of Jesus , Jesuit Pietro Tacchi-Venturi . (What a depraved display of dastardly crim inals!) In 1849, while the Pope had b een banished from Rom e, the Minister Sterbini of the Italian Republic abolished the Holy Office of the Inquisition liberating its prisoners. The crowds cried, “Death to the Pope! Long live the Republic!” A group of men then inspected the subterranean prisons of the Inquis ition.

From that day until he was defeated by the Germans in th e Franco-Prussian War of 1871, he was the dictator of France and the abject tool of the Jesuits of whom we read in 1854: “We have arrived at a great crisis . . .

But the Order could ne ver form ally endorse it, as it m ust appear to be its foe, as the Society would later appear to be the foe of its “ USSR .” Therefore, the Jesuits blamed the orig in of absolutist Socialist-Communism on two foes — one superficial , the other very real . Their pretended foe was International Freemasonry , their executioners during the French Revolution. Their real foe was the Jew ish Race , as it alone has been prom ised the land of Israel forever during the earthly reign of her Messiah , ruling all nations with “ a rod of iron ” while sitting on “ the throne of David .” The Jewish Race and its Jewish Messiah are the rivals of the Gentile Jesuit Order and its “ infallible, ” Gentile Papal Caesar , as to who will rule the world from Solomon’s rebuilt Temple in Jerusalem — forever!

The secret Treaty of Verona , Italy, furthered the conspiracy, which in turn was countered by the Monroe Doctrine of 1823. But the final touch was the Jesuit General’s Secret Plan at Chieri , Italy in 1825. Therefore we are safe in saying the Jesuits, with Prince Metternich’s “ Holy Alliance ,” conspired to overthrow that successful exam ple of popular Protesta nt liberty and envy the world over — The Federal Republic of the United States . (For years, our Protestant Republic refused to acknowle dge the sovereignty of Vatican City as well as the Temporal Pow er of the Pope. After 1867, as a re sult of the Jesuit hand in Lincoln’s assassination, the Am erican Governm ent never openly sent an am bassador to the Vatican until Shriner Freemason FDR , without the consent of Congress , sent Knight of Malta/CFR Myron C. Taylor during World War II, Rome’s advisor to the OSS headed by another Irish Rom an Catholic, Knight of Malta “ Wild Bill ” Donovan .) Our founding Fathers knew of the Jesuit intr igue directed at the new Protestant Republic of these United Stat es of Am erica. In 1816 John Adams , who later becam e the “King-aping” President, wrote to President Jefferson : “Shall we not have regular swarm s of them here, in as m any disguises as only a king of the gypsies can assum e, dressed as painters, publishers, writers and schoolm asters? If ever there was a body of m en who m erited eternal dam nation on earth and in hell it is this Society of Loyola’s . . . we are compelled by our system . . . to offer them asylum.” { 3 } Many writers warned of this Great Conspiracy of the Jesuits. Samuel Morse , the father of Morse Code, was one of them . The preface of his great work, Foreign Conspiracy Against the Liberties of the United States , written in 1835 reads: “The author undertakes to show – that a conspiracy against the liberties of this Republic is now in full action , under the direction of the wily Prince Metternich of Austria, who knowing th e impossibility of obliterating this troublesom e exam ple of a great and free nation by force of arm s, is attem pting to accom plish his object th rough the agency of an arm y of Jesuits .

F rom a m achinery of such a character a nd power, we shall doubtless be able to see already som e effect. With its headquarters at Vienna, under the im mediate direction and inspecti on of Metternich, the well-known great managing general of the diplomacy of Europe , it makes itself already felt through the Republic.

This society of m en, after exerting their tyranny for upwards of two hundred years, at length becam e so form idable to the world, threateni ng the entire subversion to all social order, that even the Pope [ Clement XIV ], whose devoted subjects they are, and m ust be, by the vow of thei r society, was comp elled to dissolve them . They had not been suppressed, however, for fifty years, before the waning influence of Popery a nd Despotism required their useful labors, to resist the light of Democr atic liberty, and the Pope (Pius VII) simultaneously with the formation of the Holy Alliance, revived the order of the Jesuits in all thei r power. From their vow of ‘ unqualified submission to the Sovereign Pontiff ,’ they have been appropriately called the Pope’s Body Guard . . . And do Americans need to be told what Jesuits are? If any are ignorant, let them inform them selves of their history without delay; no tim e is to be lost: their workings are before you in every day’ s events: they are a secret society, a sort of Masonic order with super added feat ures of revolting odiousness, and a thousand tim es m ore dangerous.

We re ad the following words written in 1855: “ The Duke of Richmond . . . in speaking of th e governm ent of the United States, said . . . ‘It will be destroye d, it ought not, and will not be permitted to exist . . . and so long as it exists , no prince will be safe upon his throne; and the sovereigns of Europe are awar e of it, and they have determ ined upon its destruction, and com e to an understanding upon th is subject, and have decided on the means to accom plish it; and they will eventually succeed by subversion rather than conquest .

Our religious discord and dissens ion arises from three basic documents. They are the Council of Trent governing Rom an Catholicism , the Koran governing Islam , and the Talmud governing Judaism . A ll three docum ents are Bible-rejecting , intolerant and hostile to Bible-believing Protestants and Baptists. And no wonder, for all three religions are controlled by the General of the Jesuits through Shriner Freemasonry .) Such was the plan . The following is how it was accom plished. The Jesuits, using Scottish Rite Freemasonry, first divided the country into geographical sections, North and South, with the Missouri Compromise . The Freem ason used to that end was the centralist, Henry Clay . The Jesuits then brought in thousands of Irish Rom an Catholics and settled them predominantly in Northern cities! In the 1820s British Secret Service agents under Jesuit control th en fom ented “the anti-slavery agitation,” as President Buchanan called it, branding slavery as “immoral and evil,” while neither the B ible nor the Constitution forbade it. Then a new political party, consisting of the centralizing, old Federalists, was created in the North called “the Republican Party.” The Jesuits used it to intensify their “anti-slavery agitation” with the Lincoln-Douglas debates, claim ing “America could not endure half slave and half free.” This created a trem endous hatred be tween Northerners and Southerners. Meanwhile, the Jesuits with th eir Freem asonry created the radical secessionists in the South. They would hotly prom ote the wit hdrawing of the Southern States from the Union. Two Freem asons who we re radical secessionists were John C. Calhoun and Robert Toombs. Ah, Yes! Enough hatred had been created to justify a war! The greatest and most powerful American Freemason at this time, however, was the evil Albert Pike . As the Sovereign Grand Commander of Scottish Rite Freemasonry and Confederate General, Albert Pike was to the War Between the States, what Frederick the Great was to the French Re volution and Napoleonic Wars. Both m en possessed the sovereign power over all “the Craft.” Both m en instigated horrific wars of decimation, Napoleon I wrecking Protesta nt Germ any and General Ulysses S. Grant (who was later privy to Linc oln’s assassination for which he was rewarded with two terms in the White House) wasting the Protestant South. Both m en served the Jesuit General as the S ons of Loyola authored the rites of “the The Jesuits – 1861 - 1865 "},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"Chap ter 26 325 Brotherhood.” And since the Jesuits authored Scottish Rite Freemasonry, the Order and the Craft m ust serve the sam e god as revealed by Pike who declared: “To you, Sovereign Grand Inspectors Ge neral, we say this, that you m ay repeat it to the Brethren of the 32 nd , 31 st and 30 th degrees — the Masonic religion should be, by all of us initiates of the high degrees, maintained in the purity of the Luciferian doctrine . . . Yes, Lucifer is God . . . the true and pure . . . religion is the belief in Lucifer . . . ” { 10 } The country was now ready for war by 1860. The Jesuits, in control of the “Radical Red Republican Party” insured the election of Lincoln by disrupting the Dem ocratic convention in Charle ston with their Masonic tools, Stephen Douglas in particular!

Before Lincoln took office, President James Buchanan , a Protestant Freemason , sent a navy vessel, “The Star of th e West,” into Charleston harbor to relieve Fort Sumter. This was an act of war in international law , as the Southern States had lawfully seceded, the right of resuming delegated powers having been specifically reserved by the State Ratification Contracts of New York , Rhode Island and Virginia . The Confederate States responded in the person of General Beauregard , a Roman Catholic Freemason , by firing on the Fort and have been wrongfully blam ed for starting the war — just like Germ any in World War I and Japan in World War II. Thus, the Northern Freemason who incited America’s The Jesuits – 1861 - 1865 "},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 326 bloodiest war was President James Buchanan . And the Southern Freemason who fired the first shot was General Beauregard . The Jesuit Order was now delighted . It had used the high Freem asons of America to cut the nation in half, to cause hatred and discord between the Northern and Southern peoples using “t he anti-slavery agitation,” and then to ignite a war of annihilation against the White Protestant peoples of the South pursuant to the evil Council of Trent! The great Southern Presbyterian, Robert L. Dabney writes: “The com mon language [ of the North ] breathed threatening and slaughter, and dem anded the sack, ruin, and exterm ination of the Southern people . . . Its intention was a wholesale murder and piracy, the exterm ination of a whole people’s national life . . . W ith an inhum anity unknown to m odern history, they had extended the law of blockade to all m edicines and hospital stores; hoping . . . to m ake the hurts of every wounded adversary m ortal . . . The Federal Congress and Executive had . . . ordained that the war should be a huge piracy . . . declaring all tobacc o, cotton and labor of slaves, . . . to be ‘contraband of war’ . . . ” { 12 } The purpose was to destroy the primarily Protestant States of Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina and Georgia while only lightly afflicting the primarily Roman Catholic States of Louisiana and Florida. And how did truly “ the Rebels ” of the Radical Red Republican governm ent of the North, backed by the power of the Jesuits’ Holy Alliance , carry out its plan in destroying truly “ the Yankees ” of the South? Hundreds of thousands of foreign m ercenaries were hired “ to extirpate the White Southern heretics from the face of the whole earth .” In addition to eleven thousand Germ ans, the Jesuits used hundreds of thousands of their most devoted Irish Roman Catholics to ransack the South just as th ey had done in Germ any during the ghastly and nightm arish Thirty Years’ War . We read: “The radicals, the proletaires [ like the future Russian communists ], th e robbers, the outlaws, of all other lands, flocked to their standards, taught by their ready instincts that their caus e was the same. One-half of the prisoners of war , registered by the victorious arm ies of the South, have been foreign mercenaries . . . the Moloch of Federal am bition has already sacrificed two hundred thousand Irishm en to it . And still, as the flaming sword of the South m ows down these hireling invaders, fresh hordes throng the shores.” { 13 } [Em phasis added] The Jesuits would control both sides of the conflict as they did during the Napoleonic Wars. They controlled the ra dicals in the North, particularly Thaddeus Stevens in the House, Charles Sumner in the Senate and Freemason Edw in Stanton , Lincoln’s Secretary of War.

Several m embers of th e fam ily of Jeff Davis belong to the Church of Rom e.” { 14 } To prove the point, a few specifics will be cited. It was for this reason , after the Confederate Army had defe ated the Northern invading Army at the first battle of Manassas (Bull Run), that Jefferson Davis would not permit “ Stonew all” Jack son to capture Washington, thereby prolonging the war of annihilation against the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant and Baptist peoples of the Stat es’ Rights Dem ocratic Party of the South — Virginia in particular! For the greatest enemie s of the Jesuit Order and the Monarchs of the Holy Alliance had been White, Calvinistic, Baptist and Protestant Virginians — George Washington , Thomas Jefferson , James Madison and James Monroe . These accursed “heretics and liberals,” having defeat ed King George’s army (under Jesuit control) at Yorkto wn, Virginia, had authored the Declaration of Independence , the Constitution of the United States , the Bill of Rights , the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions and the bold Monroe Doctrine . These great men had been used by the risen Son of G od to perform the miracle of rendering the Jesuits’ evil Council of Trent of no effect in Protestant North America . (Dear truth-seeker, eighty years later the Jesuits would order Hitler ( a homosexual according to Lothar Machtan’s The Hidden Hitler ) to forbid his victorious Germ an Army from destroying the British Army at Dunkirk, thereby prolonging the war of annihilation against Europe’s Jews, Orthodox Serbs and Germ an Lutherans. For the Jesuit General’s dream of reviving the Pope’s Holy Roman Empire – destroyed by the Messiah’s Protestant Reformation – could never com e to pass with all these “obstinate heretics and liberals” in the way. Seeker, are you starting to get a feel for the predictable workings of the Jesuit Order and its foot cavalry, the Masonic Lodge?) It was for this reason that Confederate General James Longstreet was “appointed” to replace General “Stonew all” Jack son after the latter had been “mistakenly” shot by his ow n men at the Battle of Chan cellorsville. The Jesuits greatly benefited from this a ppointm ent; Longstreet betrayed General Lee through disobeying orders at Gettysburg and the Wilderness by attacking too late , the Federals having gained the stronger positions. Of Gettysburg we read: “It is susceptible of the most overwhe lm ing proof that while General Lee, with a m agnanim ity that rises to the sublim e, when m oving am ong his shattered battalions at Gettysburg said, ‘Thi s is all my fault.

That abom ination of a m ovie was called Gettysburg .) It was for this reason that Federal General Meade , a Roman Catholic, was directed by a disguised Jesuit to send one third of his Arm y to quell Archbishop Hughes’ New York City Draft Riots (“a Ro mish plot from beginning to end” in the words of Lincoln), and theref ore did not pursue General Lee’s betrayed and defeated army at Gettysburg. Of the Jesuit influence on the battlefield President Lincoln said: “It is true, also, that Meade has re mained with us, and gained the bloody battle of Gettysburg . . . But it is evid ent that his Romanism superseded his patriotism after the battle. He let the army of Lee escape, when it was so easy to cut his retreat and force him to surrender, after having lost nearly half of his soldiers in the last days’ carnage. When Meade was to order the pursuit, after the battle, a stranger came, in haste, to the headquarters, and that stranger was a disguised Jesuit . After a ten m inutes’ conversation with him , Meade m ade such arrangem ents fo r the pursuit of the enemy, that he escaped alm ost untouched, with the loss of only two guns!” { 16 } [Em phasis added] And why would the Jesuits want Lee’s arm y to escape? So the war of annihilation could be continued until the Pr otestant States of the Sout h had been utterly destroyed by General Grant and General Sherman . In continuing the description of the dest ruction of the South, the Jesuits sought to create an insurrection of Black Southern slaves against their White masters by way of a mass emancipation. The Emancipation Proclamation , promoted heavily by the Jesuits in control of England through Queen Victoria , was calculated to incite the slaves to murder their master s. The plot failed as the vast m ajority of Protestant masters had lovingly taught the B ible to their slaves. One such Protestant was General “Stonew all” Jack son . Upon his death, the Bl ack slaves of his Sunday school gathered around his grave and bitterly m ourned his departing. For the Biblical doctrine of White supremacy and Negro subordination was universally believed am ong White Protestant nations in accord ance with Noah’s prophecy given in Genesis 9:18-28 .

America, more so than Fran ce, lay in ruins as nearly seven hundred thousand of her sons had died, according to th e Civil War Museum in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Margaret Mitchell , the author of Am erica’s greatest novel, Gone With the Wind , captures the tragedy of this mome nt with a poem written on the back of a Confederate Note: “Representing nothing on God’s earth now and naught in the waters below it — As the pledge of a na tion that’s passed away Keep it, dear friend, and show it.

(When the Jesuits create an Empire there is fi rst always “ethnic cleansing.”) R. L. Dabney , in foreseeing the overthrow of Europe’s M onarchs, wrote of this new Jesuit power: “History will some day place the positi on of these Confederate States, in this high argument, in the clearest li ght of her glory. The cause they undertook to defend was that of regul ated, constitutional liberty, and of fidelity to law and covenants, agains t the licentious violence of physical power.

One young Irish American trained by Jesuits at the Am erican College in Rom e was none other than “ the American Pope ,” the dark masterm ind behind the Kennedy assassi nation and sin-hardened sodom ite, Francis Cardinal Spellman ! Meanwhile in Mexico , shortly before our Am erican “Civil War” broke out in 1861, that oppressed nation, pla gued with dictators and revolts for nearly forty years, finally began to enjoy the wonderful taste of free, “ liberal ” governm ent, so condem ned by the Jesuits’ evil Council of Trent . The great pro-Protestant, liberal and inspiration of the Mexican people, Benito Pablo Juarez , was proclaim ed President upon his trium phal entry into the capital in 1860. For three long years the War of Reform , ignited by the suspension of th e liberal Constitution, had raged between the Jesuit tyranny of General Ignacio Comonfort (named after Ignatius Loyola) and the liberals led by Juarez . And now, with the sweet taste of victory, the risen Son of G od having answered their prayers , our hero, Benito Juarez , removed the millstone from around the neck of his beloved people, it having been ruthlessly fastened by the heartless Sons of Loyola. The first thing he did was to break the financial and political power of the Jesuit General’s soon-to-be infallible Pope Pius IX , along with his Hierarchy and Clergy manning his worldwide colossus of wealth – the Vatican Empire – by: 1. Suspending for two years all paym ents on pub lic debts of every kind; since, they were owed to the Masoni c banking agents of the Vatican; 2.

The despots of the Jesuits’ Holy Alliance had sided with the North, and thus, the Southern people fought the world. The deceiv ed patriots of the North fought to “save the Union” but they in fact destroyed it, and on its ruin s the Jesuits, with their Freemasons, would erect a new Union — a new United Socialist States of America . This new nation would be a Jesuit so cialist republic with the President exercising powers of an absolute Monarch. The old Calvinistic Federal Republic of Washington would be converted into a huge centralized Empire with the ten planks of the Masonic English Novelist Screwtape Proposes a Toast Communist Manifesto replacing The Ten Commandments of Moses. In order to accomplish this, the Constitution had to be am ended — “by hook or by crook.” It would be am ended in accordance with the Masonic cry of both French Revolutions. “Liberty” would be the Thirteenth Amendment . “Equality” would be the Fourteenth Amendment . “Fraternity” would be the Fifteenth Amendment .

The Jesuits – 1868 - 1872 "},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 340 On July 28, 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment was declared “ratified” by the Radicals in Washington. Since 1866 th e Southern States had been under martial law and divided into five military districts. The districts were governed by five Union Generals beholden to the Jesuits, including General Benjamin F. Butler known as “ Butler the Beast .” The wicked Thaddeus Stevens with his “ Reconstruction Act ” of 1866 had im plem ented m artial law. And why? Because the Southern State governm ents, having ratified th e Thirteenth Am endm ent, refused to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment . So the solution of the Radicals, to the disgrace of the Protestant ministers and people of the North , was to suspend the lawful State governm ents and im pose m artial law (absolutis m). The only way the Southern States could be readmitted into this new “ Union of North American Socialist Republics ,” thereby ending martial law, was to “ratify” this new amendment. That is called “consent at the point of a bayonet” or “forced conversion of heretics.” Why was the Fourteenth Amendment , forced on the South by the Jacobins of the North, so important to the Jesuits and their despots of Europe, including the Protestant Queen Victoria of England whose policies were dictated by her Jesuit- controlled Prim e Ministers, Lord John Russell and Viscount Palmerston ? Section 1 of the Amendment reads: “All persons born or naturalized in th e United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive a ny person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any pers on within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” { 5 } The coup d’etat is in the first sentence . It m ade all persons born in the United States (excluding the Indian na tions) citizens of the United States first and citizens of a State secondly . This reversed the original American citizenship . Senator James G. Blaine , one of the Radical Red Republic ans of the day, explained: “In the first place, we ask that they will agree to certain changes in the Constitution of the United States; and, to begin with, we want them to unite with us in broadening the citizenship of the Republic. The slaves recently emancipated by proclamation, a nd subsequently by Constitutional Amendment, have no civil status. Th ey should be made citizens, and in making this extension of citizenship, we are not confining the breadth and scope of our efforts to the negro. It is for the white man as well. We intend to make citizenship National . Heretofore, a man has been a citizen of the United States because he was a citizen of some one of the States: Now, we propose to reverse that , and make him a citizen of any State where he The Jesuits – 1868 - 1872 "},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"Chap ter 27 341 chooses to reside, by defining in a dvance his National citizenship — and our Am endm ent declares that ‘all pers ons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdicti on thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the States [ State ] wherein they reside.’ ” { 6 } [Em phasis added] Years later our Jesuit-controlled Suprem e C ourt, in describing the effect of the Fourteenth Amendment , would say the sam e as its radical authors. “ ‘In reviewing the subject,’ [ “Jesuitical” ] Chief Justice White [ according to our hero Jeremiah Crowley ] said in the Selective Draft Law Cases , 245 US 366, 377, 388-389, ‘ . . . it broa dened the national scope of the Government under the Constitution by ca using citizenship of the United States to be paramount and dominant instead of being subordinate and derivative , and therefore, operating as it does upon all the powers conferred by the Constitution.’ ” {7 } [Em phasis added] Simply put, by reversing American citiz enship and making it “National,” all the powers of the governm ent, granted by the Constitution, were greatly increased . A new citizenship created a new government . All the executive, le gislative and judicial powers in Washington were “ broadened. ” So the radicals, pretending to do good to the Black freedman, used these freedmen to centralize and incr ease Rom e’s power in Washington with the Fourteenth Amendment . (This is exactly what happened as a resu lt of the Civil Rights m ovem ent during the 1960s. In seeking to concentrate m ore power in Washington under the guise of ending segregation in the South, the Jesuits using Freem asonry fom ented the Civil Rights Agitation with their Black communist, Martin Luther (Lucifer) King . Once again, the using of Am erican Negroes conf erred m ore power in Washington with the 1964 Civil Rights Act enacted through a perversion of “ The Commerce Clause ,” written by one of Rome’s most powerful pr iests in America with over one hundred earned and honorary degrees, CFR m ember Theodore M. Hesburgh . Race-mixing in the South would gradually become a rea lity accelerating the destruction of another White Protestant and Baptist “heretic” nation!) “These monstrous Recons truction Measures, with all their enormities and fatal tendencies towards ultimate complete Centralism and Em pire, are still based upon the assum ption that the Stat es, as separate integral parts, constitute members of what is still, in words , at least, acknowledged to be a Many Southern statesm en knew the true purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment .

All these bold usurpations of power are, upon their face, nothing but resorts to induce, or to com pel, under duress , the Peoples of the several Southern States to go through the form s of adopting the Fourteenth Amendment . . . ” { 8 } The Freemason Alexander H. Stephens knew that the forced ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment would create a centralized Em pire out of a federation of sovereign States. The Presiden t would exercise powers of a Monarch , the Congress would exercise powers of a Parliament and the Suprem e Court would exercise powers of a King’s Bench , having its jurisdicti on extended to include anything and everything under the guise of the new “ Federal Question Jurisdiction .” Federal Question Jurisdiction is an alien and fore ign jurisdiction to the original Constitution. It created “judici al supremacy” in the Supreme Court, broadening its power to overtur n laws and decisions of the several States. There are virtually no judicial decisions, state or federal, that cannot be appealed to the Suprem e Court with a “ Writ of Certiorari .” With this all-encompassing jurisdiction and the thousands of appeals filed annually, the Jesu its at Georgetown University influence the Supreme Court as to wh ich cases to hear. The ensuing decisions further the purpose of the Order in dest roying White, Protestant Am erican culture along with its popular self-governm ent or “liberalism ,” as the Jesuits call it. Rem embering previous chapters, the Jesuits have avowed to destroy both Protesta ntism and Liberalism pursuant to their Jesuit Oath and Council of Trent . In looking back, we Am ericans can see the evil decisions m ade possible by the Jesuits’ “ Federal Question Jurisdiction .” Am ong others, it enabled the Suprem e Court to force the religion of evolution down our throats, to force the integration of public schools when neither the Whites nor the Blacks wanted it; to legalize abortion and prohibit capital punishment overthrowing laws of the St ates to the contrary, and to outlaw Bible-reading and prayer in the “ accursed public schools.” F or in prohibiting Bible-reading and prayer in the public schools, Protestant civilization is destroyed, and with it, popular self-governm ent — to the delight of the Jesuit Order! The Jesuits are absolutists . Therefore, the governm ents they control m ust exercise absolute powers. Since rights limit powers , the rights of the citizens can be no m ore than privileges granted from absolute governm ents. Ancient liberties and com mon-law rights cannot be included. Su ch is the case with every socialist- com munist governm ent of toda y, be it the m onarchy of Queen Elizabeth II , the military dictatorship of Castro or the dem ocracy of Presidents William J. Clinton or George W. Bush , alias “ King George II ,” being of England’s past Stuart Dynasty . Therefore, one m ore nail had to be driv en into America’s coffin.

The “ privileges and immunities ” of this new Fourteenth Amendment citizenship had to be defined by the Suprem e Court so as not to include fundam ental or com mon-law rights. This happened on April 14, 1873 (the anniversary of the assassina tion of President Lincoln in the Ford’s Theater “ Slaughterhouse ”) with the decision given in the Slaughterhouse Cases , 83 US 36, 80 (1873). The decision truly slaughtered our rights. The court held: “We are of the opinion that the rights claim ed by these plaintiffs in error [ fundamental common-law rights ] if they have any existence [ What arrogance!!! ] are not privileges and immun ities of citizens of the United States within the meaning of the cl ause of the fourteenth am endm ent under consideration.” { 9 } The Freemason, Justice Stephen Field , another hero and near ly assassinated by one of his judicial brethren, strongly dissented. He declared: “The fundamental rights, privilege s, and immunities which belong to him as a free man and a free citizen, now belong to him as a citizen of the United States, and are not depe ndent upon his citizenship of any State. . . . The Amendment does not attem pt to confer any new privileges or immunities upon citizens, or to enumerate or define those already existing. It assumes th at there are such privileges and immunities, which belong of right to citizens as such, and ordains that they shall not be abridged by state le gislation. If this inhibition has no reference to privileges and immunities of this character, but only refers, as held by the majority of the court in their opinion, to such privileges and immunities as were, before its a doption, specially designated in the Constitution, or necessarily implie d as belonging to citizens of the United States, it was a vain and id le enactment, which accomplished nothing, and m ost unnecessarily exc ited Congress and the people on its passage . . . But, if the Amendment refe rs to the natural and inalienable rights which belong to all citizen s, the inhibition has a profound significance and consequence.” {10 } [Em phasis added] Field was correct but the radica l Black Republicans prevailed. Slaughterhouse would be the precedent with which ever y following decision must agree.

If the people have no absolute rights of citizen ship, the rulers have absolute powers of governm ent. This is precisely what th e Radical Red Republican Suprem e Court accomplished for the Jesuit Order when it overt hrew the absolute rights of American citizens, secured by the pen and sword of Calvinist freemen . The Slaughterhouse Cases reduced each one of us to the status of a feudal, Rom an Catholic serf to whom , upon birth a nd baptism , is granted privileges and immunities of citizenship fro m the all-powerful National Government and Church of Rom e. The governm ent is ruled by its Commander-in-Chief and the Church is ruled by its “ infallible ” Papal Caesar of Rome , both of which are m ere puppets of the General of the Jesuits, the B lack P ope . Sum ming it up, by 1868 the Jesuits , with their radicals Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner , had forced the Fourteenth Amendment on the peoples of the States, North and South. They had created a new nation as a result of creating a new citizenship. By 1872 the Jesuits, with their radica ls on the Suprem e Court, had m ade the powers of both the Federal (now National ) and State governm ents absolute , lim ited only by decisions of their respective King’s Benches — the Federal (now National ) and State Suprem e Courts. The transition from a Presbyterian form of government to a Roman Catholic form of government had been accomplished . And how did they do that?

My escape from their hands, since the letter of the Pope to Jeff Davis [ who, as Vice President under President Franklin Pierce in 1856, began the work of erecting a Masonically designed bronze idol of the Virgin Mary , later hoisted upon the White House Dome in 1863 ] has sharpened a million daggers to pierce my breast, would be more than a miracle.’ ” { 3 } [Em phasis added] Chiniquy then concluded his m eeting with the President with these words: “I knew the hour to leave had com e, I asked from the President perm ission to fall on m y knees, and pray with him that his life m ight be spared: and he knelt with me. But I prayed more with my tears and sobs, than with my words. Then I pressed his hand on m y lips and bathed it w ith my tears, and with a heart filled with an unspeakable desolation, I bade him Adieu! It was for the last tim e! For the hour wa s fast approaching when he was to fall by the hands of a Jesuit assassin, for his nation’s sake .” { 4 } [Em phasis added] Indeed it was! But why? President Lincoln resisted the policy of the Jesuits and the Radicals. For, they sought to crea te a new government with a new citizenship via the Fourteenth Amendment . Lincoln wanted the Southern States to re-enter the Union with the same status with which th ey had left the Union. Clearly, he, like Andrew Johnson, would never have prom oted the Fourteenth Amendment . (It was this open refusal to prom ote the Fourteenth Amendment for which Lincoln was assassinated and Johnson was impeached although never expelled from office by the Senate. Being a Southe rner, Johnson was openly against the Order’s “anti-Mason” Thaddeus Stevens’ Fourteenth Amendment . But secretly , Johnson served the Company by working with his Masonic brethren who protected Lincoln’s assassin in obedience to their master , Shriner Albert Pike !) This would have frustrated the purposes of the Jesuits in creating a new governm ent with absolute powers.

The history of the governm ents of South Am erican, African and Fa r Eastern nations confirm s this truth. And if America becomes a na tion of color riddled with Bible-rejecting Blacks, mulattoes, Mexicans and Far Easterners, as it apparently will be within fifty years , an absolutist under Jesuit control – like Fidel Castro – most assuredly will govern it. To the contrary, Lincoln advocated the se paration of the races and attem pted to repatriate the freed Negroes to Liberi a, as Monrovia, nam ed after President James Monroe , had been built for that pur pose. The Negro policy of Jefferson , Monroe and Lincoln was the sam e and it would have thwarted the Jesuits’ plan of amalgamation of both races.

This is why when Black leaders cease to be agitators for the New York Cardinal’s CFR , they lose their influence, like Dick Gregory once did, or are slain, like Malcolm X . Martin Luther (Lucifer) King was also assassinated, as he deviated from his original purpose and began to oppose Spellman’s Vietnam War . It was clear, Abraham Lincoln , newly reelected in 1865, could not be allowed to stay in office four more y ears.

Of the Jesuit hand in Lincoln’s murder we read: “I feel safe in stating that nowhe re else can be found in one book the connected presentation of the story leading up to the death of Abraham Lincoln, which was instigated by the ‘Black’ Pope, the General of the Jesuit Order , cam ouflaged by the ‘White’ Pope, Pius IXth, aided, abetted and financed by other “Divin e Righters” of Europe, and finally consum mated by the Rom an Hierarchy and their paid agents in this country and French Canada on ‘Good Friday’ night, April 14 th , 1865, at Ford’s Theatre, Washington, D.C.” { 5 } [Em phasis added] Again we read the words of our hero, Charles Chiniquy : “But who was that assassin?

Having “called tim e” outside of Ford’s Theatre during the President’s m urder, John Surratt escaped from the United States into Montreal , Canada with the aid of the priests. From Montreal to Londonderry, to Liverpool, to Rom e, he enliste d in the Pope’s Zouave arm y. Having been recognized by a boyhood friend, Surratt confessed to the m urder stating, “I have done the Yankees as much ha rm as I could. We have killed Lincoln, the niggers’ friend.” { 7 } As a consequence of this confession, the old acquaintance reported Surratt’s whereabouts to the Am erican Minister in Rom e. Having been arrested, he “leapt down a precipice,” m ade his way to Napl es, boarded a steam er and escaped to Alexandria, Egypt. But there, in 1867, he was arrested by U.S. authorities; bound hand and foot; returned to Wash ington, D.C. via the specially chartered U. S. warship, the Sw atara ; and was forced to stand trial for the m urder of President Lincoln. Chiniquy narrates Surratt’s escape quite clearly: “It is evident that a very elaborate plan of escape had been prepared by the priests of Rome to save th e lives of the assassins and the conspirators. It would be too l ong to follow all the m urderers when, Cain-like, they were fleeing in ever y direction, to escape the vengeance of God and m an. Let us fix our eyes on John Surratt [ whose confessor and advisor was the Jesuit B. F. Wiget ], who was in Washington the 14 th of April, helping Booth in the perpetration of the assassination. Who will take care of him? Who will protect and conceal him? Who will press him on their bosom, put th eir mantles on his shoulders to conceal him from the just vengeance of the human and divine laws? The priest, Charles Boucher , swears that only a few days after the murder, John Surratt was sent to him by Father Lapierre , of Montreal; that he kept him concea led in his parsonage of St. Liboire from the end of April to the end of July, then he took him back, secretly, to Father Lapierre, who kept him secreted in his own father’s house, under the The Jesuits – 1865 "},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 356 very shadow of the Montreal bishop’ s palace. He swears that Father Lapierre visited him (Surratt) often, when secreted at St. Liboire, and that he (Father Boucher) visited him , at least, twice a week, from the end of July to Septem ber, when conc ealed in Father Lapierre’s house in Montreal. That same father, Ch arles Boucher, swears that he accompanied John Surratt in a carriag e in the company of Father Lapierre, to the steamer “Montreal”, when starting for Quebec: that Father Lapierre kept him (John Su rratt) under lock during the voyage from Montreal to Quebec, and that he accom panied him , disguised, from the Montreal steamer to the ocean steamer, “ Peruvian .” The doctor of the steamer “Peruvian”, L. I. A. McMillan , swears that Father Lapierre introduced him to John Surratt under the false nam e of McCarthy , whom he was keeping locked in his state room , and whom he conducted disguised to the ocea n steam er “Peruvian”, and with whom he remained till she le ft Quebec for Europe, the 15 th of Septem ber, 1865. But who is that Fa ther Lapierre who takes such a tender, I dare say a paternal care of Surratt? It is not less a personage than the canon of Bishop Bourget , of Montreal. He is the confidential man of the bishop; he lives with the bi shop, eats at his table, assists him with his counsel, and has to receive his advice in every step of life. According to the laws of Rom e, th e canons are to the bishop what the arm s are to the body. Now, I ask: Is it not evident th at the bishops and the priests of Washington have trusted this m urderer to the care of the bishops and priests of Montreal, that they m ight conceal, feed, and protect him for nearly six months, under the very shadow of the bishop’s palace? Would they have done that if they were not his accom plices? Why did they so continually remain with him day and night, if they were not in fear that he might compromise them by an indiscreet word? Why do we see those priests ( I ought to say, those two am bassadors and anointed representatives of the Pope ), alone in the carriage, which takes that great culprit from his house of concealment to the steamer? Why do they keep him there, under lock, till they transfer him, under a disguised name, to the ocean steame r, the “Peruvian”, on the 15 th July, 1865? Why such tender sym pathies for that stranger? Why going through such trouble and expense for that young Am erican am ong the bishops and priests of Canada? There is only one answer. He was one of their tools, one of their selected men to strike the great Republic of Equality and Liberty to the heart.

Who will conceal, feed, lodge, and protect him after the priests of Canada pressed his hand for the last tim e on board of the “Peruvian”, the 15 th of Septem ber, 1865?

If you want to see him after he has crossed the ocean, go to Vitry, at the door of Rome, and there you will find him enrolled under the banners of the Pope, in the 9 th com pany of his Zouaves, under the false nam e of Watson . Of course, the Pope was forced to withdraw his protection ove r him , after the Governm ent of the United States had found him there, and he was brought back to Washington to be tried. But on his arrival as a prisoner in the United States, his Jesuit father conf essor whispered in his ear : ‘Fear not, you will not be condemned! Through the influence of a high Roman Catholic lady, two or three of the jurymen will be Roman Catholics, and you will be safe.’ Those who have read the two volumes of the trial of John Surratt know that never more ev ident proofs of guilt were brought against a m urderer than in th at case.

The cream of the Nazi crop – the SS – would be brought in to the Em pire of Fourteenth Amendment America to enjoy the protection of Cardinal Spellman’s CIA and FBI , overseen by his Am erican Branch of the Knights of Malta.) Upon Surratt’s return to Washington, D.C. , designed to be the Order’s “ Rome on the Potomac ” and military headquarter s for the Pope’s new “ Holy Roman ” American Empire , we read of the Jesuit presence during the trial: “The appeals m ade by the em inent counsel for the prisoner to the political and religious prejudices of jurors was ably seconded all through the trial by the Jesuit prie sthood of Washington City and the vicinity. It will be recalled by scor es of people who attended the trial that not a day passed but that some of these [ Jesuits ] were in the courtroom as the most interested of spectators.” { 9 } This ever-present Jesuit influence gave John Surratt (a member of the Order’s Knights of the Golden Circle , the present day Knights of Columbus characterized by the same Mary-worshipping oath of alle giance) the confidence of his ultimate acquittal, that he, like Jesuit-trained Bill Clinton , was untouchable .

Shaw would be tried for the mu rder o f John F. Kennedy . Shaw, like Surratt , was Roman Catholic. He also would enjoy the protection of the Jesuit Order’s powerful tools in Washington. Shaw, like Surratt , enjoyed the benefit of a hung jury and he, like Lincoln’s murderer , would go free. Thirty years later, President Bill Clinton would be im peached. This Georgetown graduate and darli ng of the Jesuits would refuse to resign. He would be tried in the Senate knowing full well his protection from the Society of Jesus in control of the CFR , FBI, CIA, the Secret Service and the Mafia. The author predicted that he, like Shaw and Surratt , would never be convicted of his crim es. As it turned out, one of the Senators who voted to acquit Clinton was none other than “ Spelly’s evil Jew ” of the Kennedy Assassination. Senator Arlen Specter , a Scottish Rite Shriner Freemason of the 33 rd Degree according to a m ost inform ative and vast website, www.freemasonwatch.freepress-freespeech.com , had been the Junior Counselor on the Warren Com mission who conc octed the m agic single-bullet theory upon which the Warren Report rested its case. These are irrefutable exam ples of the power – the absolute power in Fourteenth Amendment America – exercised by the Jesuits through the Archbishop of New York, presently Edw ard Cardinal Egan . Lastly, certain high-level Freemasons we re used to stifle the capture of John H. Surratt . They were President Andrew Johnson , whose son was educated by Jesuits, and whose daughter was educated by nuns and converted to Catholicism , and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton , who oversaw the project of placing a statue of Rome’s “ Virgin Mary ” ( Persephone ) atop of the Capital Dom e. With the knowledge that Surratt was in Liverpool, Stanton’s War Departm ent refused to make the least attem pt to arrest him . A fe w weeks later President Johnson revoked the reward for the arrest of Surratt, greatly increasing th e assassin’s chances to escape. A similar story is true of Booth , the brother Freem ason of President Johnson . According to The Escape and Suicide of John Wilkes Booth by Finis L. Bates , Booth escaped The Jesuits – 1865 "},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 360 Washington with a password — a Masonic password .

But if “Booth’s body” was identifie d, having been shot by Boston Corbett , while the real Booth escaped, who then identified the body? It was a thirty-third degree Freem ason, Admiral George W.

In 1921 he wrote: “I was called on board the Montauk [ a Navy Gunboat ] by Lieut. W.W. Crowninshield, to identify the body of John Wilkes Booth, which I did . . . Surgeon General Barnes arrived at that m oment and probed the wound in Booth’s neck. [ The probing of the neck w ound sounds like the Kennedy autopsy, does it not? ]” { 11 } It is also incriminating to note that Rom an Catholic R. W. Thompson , who was a thirty-third degree Freem ason and a contem porary of hi s Masonic brother, Admiral Baird , wrote The Footprints of the Jesuits extensively quoted in this volum e and included on the enclosed CD. Thompson was the ex-Secretary of the Navy in 1894 when he published his historical m asterpiece . Baird , as an Adm iral, had been Thom pson’s subordinate prior to 1894. Nowhere in Thom pson’s five hundred-page volum e does he im plicate the Jesuits in Li ncoln’s assassination. He doesn’t even mention Lincoln’s assassination even though that m urder was fresh on the m inds of millions of Americans; the Freemasons Edwin A. Sherman and Charles Chiniquy had exposed the Jesuit hand in 1883 and 1886. And why does Thom pson silently pass by the Lincoln assassination? Because if the Jesuits were to be blamed, that guilt would also surely l ead to the door of Shriner Freemasonry . As a result, the Jesuits would have been expelled from the Unite d States and thousa nds of patriotic Am ericans would have abandoned the Masonic Lodge in horror and disgust. But as in the Kennedy Assassination so the Sons of L oyola went unpunished for assassinating Lincoln , m aintaining a successful cover- up through the years with their prostitute Press, manned by the Order’s Council on Foreign Relations in New York. “Barring the m artyrdom s of Jesus Christ and Joan D ‘Arc [ Joan of Arc ], th e methods used in Abraham Lincoln’s a ssassination will stand pre-eminent in point of m alice and cruelty, and, strange as it m ay seem , the sam e diabolical cunning which nerved th e hand of the assassin has pursued Lincoln beyond the grave, and has been largely successful in hiding from the public all details of his physical dest ruction, a crim e, in the eye of the writer, which alm ost outstrips the first, for by this conspiracy of silence on his death, the youth of Am erica are be ing deprived of the knowledge of the details of the greatest tragedy in their country’s history.” { 12 } The Jesuits – 1865 "},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"Chap ter 28 361 Years later in 1916, the Jesuits honored John H.

Although offi cially prohibited, the Society of Jesus was the master of France for nineteen years until 1871. And what did the Jesuits do during that tim e? They waged war! The first was the Crimean War of 1856. The Vatican’s Jesu its fought against the Orthodox Church. On the side of the Vatican were France, England and Turkey. On the side of the Orthodox Church was Russia. And why wa s that war waged? It was fought over which “Church” would “protect” the “hol y places” in Palestine! One hundred thousand French soldiers were called “m artyrs of the faith” by the priests, as that war was a Crusade. The Archbishop of Paris made the following incriminating adm ission on behalf of the Jesuits and their forever-warring Roman P apacy : “The Crimean War, between France a nd Russia, is not a political war, but a holy war; it is not a State fi ghting another State, people fighting other people, but singularly a war of religion, a Crusade . . . ” { 6 } [Em phasis added] (Years later the Jesuits, with their “ Holy Roman ” American Empire , would launch a massive Crusade in Europe , President Eisenhower later prom oting his Jesuit-authored book of that title. Subsequently, the Order would conduct another Crusade in the Far East. Archbishop Spellman of New York would call the American soldiers “the soldiers of Christ;” that Crusade would be the infam ous Vietnam War .) By the 1860s the Jesuits began to e xperience som e serious setbacks particularly at the hand of Protestant Germ any. In 1866 the Germ ans trounced Austria, the heart of the Holy Alliance, with the Prussian and Austrian War . This infuriated the Jesuits! So four y ears later, the Jesuits used Napoleon III to start a war with Germany. France was shamefully beaten, further enraging the Jesuits! O f the Jesuit influence causing the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 we read: “While the French army was spilling its blood in the four corners of the world, and getting weaker defending interests which were not hers, Prussia, under the heavy hand of th e future ‘iron chancellor’, was busy expanding its military might in order to unite the German states in a single block. Austria was the first victim of its will and power. In agreement with Prussia which was to seize the Danish duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, Austria wa s cheated by her accomplice. The war which followed, was soon won by Prussia at Sadowa on the 3rd of July, 1866. It was a terrible blow for the ancient Hapsburg m onarchy that was declining; the blow was just as hard for the Vatican, as Austria had been for so long its m ost faith ful stronghold within the Germ anic lands.

And if their arm ies were victori ous in World War I, they controlled the plunder of Germ any called “ the Treaty of Versailles .” And if they were behind that most infamous treaty, they caused World War II . And if their Allied Armies were victorious in World War II, they controlled the agreements at Yalta, Potsdam, Cairo and Tehran. And if they controlled those conferences, they authored the Cold War — the Jesuits’ Communist Inquisition behind the “Iron and Bam boo Curtains.” International socialist-communism was then aided and abetted by the Jesuits’ financial and military colossus, the American Empire , as the Jesuit-controlled John Birch Society – named after a Baptist martyr in China!! – has so ably proven. And if the Jesuits began the Cold War in 1945, they, with the stroke of a pen in the hands of George H. W. Bush (CIA) and Mikhail Gorbachev (KGB), ended it at Malta in 1989, only to continue to “ make relentless war on all heretics and liberals. ” Therefore, since the Jesu its have supposedly ended the Cold War , are they ready to strike their next great blow upon the American Empire? That blow will tend to further consolidate Europe into a revived “ Holy Roman Empire .” What national crisis will result in the rise of an absolutist, right wing military dictatorship? Would that military dictatorship attempt the annih ilation of the American Jewish “heretics” ultimately resulting in a massive Sino-Soviet-Moslem-Mexican-Cuban invasion and occupation , thereby destroying Am eric an Protestant and Baptist “heretics”?

When the French wit hdrew, the Italians took Rom e, creating the sovereign Kingdom of Italy. The loss of the Pope’s Temporal Pow er further enraged the Jesuits as they blamed Germany’s Kaiser Wilhelm I and Prince Bismarck .

He, like Napoleon, had been poisoned. Upon the death of Alexander I’s successor – Tz ar Nicholas I – Tz ar Alexander II ascended the throne . He greatly outraged the Jesuits! Rememb erin g that he was one of the key Monarchs obligat ed to enforce the po licies of the Jesuits’ “ Holy Alliance ,” Alexander II enacted many liberal reform s. He abolished espionage and emancipated the Serfs. As a result, the Jesuits incited the Polish rebellion for which the Tzar revoked his predecessor’s Concordat with Rom e. The Tzar also broke diplom atic relations with Satan’s P apacy in 1866, and again in 1877, further outraging the Jesuits while fueling their c onspiracy to ultimately overthrow Russia’s Rom anoff Dynasty. Finally in 1882 – the very year the anti-Jesuit Triple Alliance was formed – Tz ar Alexander II , in laying the capstone of his reforms, had attached his signature to the proposed Constitution of Russia. This the Jesuits would not tolerate! It violated th e absolutism of the Holy Alliance and infringed on the Temporal Pow er of the P apal Caesar . If the Tzar’s absolute m onarchy becam e a Constitutional m onarchy with express lim itations upon its powers, how could the Jesuits’ “ infallible ” Pope eventually rule Ru ssia in accordance with the Council of Trent ?

With a free Russia, the Jesuit General’s grand desi gn of submitting the Orthodox Church to the Vicar of Christ would never com e to pass. The Jesuits had to act quickly . As they had used Masonic Mazzin i to punish Pope Pius IX for proposing a Constitution for Ital y in 1846, so they would use the Masonic nihilists to punish the Tzar for nearly su cceeding in establishing “liberal” governm ent in Russia. Pius IX was forced to flee from the Vatican to Gaeta but Alexander II , who maintained liberty of conscience , would be assassinated. We read: “Alexander II had progressed well with his great reform s and had attached his signature to a Constitution to be adopted by Russia.

I might mention this, that when the Bolsheviki cam e into power, all over Petrograd we at once had a predom inance of Yiddish proclam ations, big posters and everything in Yiddish.” { 13 } [Em phasis added] The Jesuits succeeded in making the Bols hevik Revolution appear to be of Jewish origin by using Jewish Freem asons whose m asters (like Shriners Jacob H.

Further, as a Jesuit with the Cheka and then the Russian Civ ilian Intelligence (NKVD), the Soviet Secret Police was in fact an arm of the Jesuits’ Holy Office of the Inquisition . The great Messianic Jew, Arno Gaebelein , tells us: “A police system was inaugurated, the Cheka , with the commission to torture, to kill without mercy . . . The bloody work of the Cheka was carried on in a certain large building. There the victims, men, women, and children, were cruelly tortured be fore a shot ended their misery. In order to drown the despairing cries of the unfortunates, the building was surrounded with a num ber of powerful motor trucks; their m otors were started and for hours they were kept a going.

The Bolsheviks never expelled th e Knights of Malta from Russia . Surely if this was truly a revolution and not the secret Inquisition that it was, the wealthy Knights would definitely have been driven from Russia without question! Instead, business continued as usual between Am erican and Russian Knights through their joint venture, the Grace Russian Company . Of this interlock between American and Russian big business Anthony Sutton in his Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution writes: “The American International Corp .

We read from the Executive Intelligence Review Special Report of 1987: “The Irish Catholic Grace family wa s overlord of the British royal house, driven out successively by Cromwell, then William [ III ] of Orange [ Praise G od! ], joining the Stuart cause in exile. In 1850 William R. Grace arrived in Peru at age 18, where he acquired a British guano- trading firm as the lynchpin for future m ajor acquisitions in shipping, rail, banking, m inerals, sugar plantations, a nd so forth. Perhaps the greatest increase in Grace family holdings in Peru occurred after the War of the Pacific, where the Grace family had supplied material to both Chile and Peru. Then the Earl of Donoughm ore, heading the Committee of Peruvian Bondholders, tapped William Grace to m ake a debt-for-equity settlement that led to foreign acquis ition of most Peruvian agro-industry and infrastructure. Leav ing a brother in Peru, William Grace relocated to New York , where he was mayor from 1880-1888 [ and one of the powers behind Theodore Roosevelt ]. In 1907, Joseph P.

Joseph Grace becam e a m ember of the Am erican International Corp ., founded principally by Frank Vanderlip of City Bank, which traded extensively with Russia before and after the Bolshevik Revolution . It was located at 120 Br oadway, the office of a com plex of firm s representing ever y m ajor Wall Street financial group involved in sim ilar dealings.” {17 } [Em phasis added] The Jesuits – 1882 - 1917 "},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"Chap ter 32 401 Joe P.

This is why the Russian “Tongue” or “Branch” of th e Knights of Malta in Moscow was never expelled by the Bolshe viks or by bloody “ Uncle ” Joe Stalin, as FDR called him . 3. After the five-year Civil War, the Je suits were given permission by the Bolsheviks to reenter Russia after hav ing been expelled for over a century . Catholic priest James J.

Both the OSS and NKVD worked together during Wo rld War II and later, as the CIA and KGB , secretly continued to collaborate while dest roying the world’s “heretics and liberals” during that hoax called “ the Cold War .” This is why we s hould not be surprised to see the CIA agent, Lee Harvey Oswald , having been trained in the Russian language by the Office of Naval Intelligence while a U.S. Marine, pose as a communist defector to Russia when in fact he was under orders, unknow ingly being set-up to be a “patsy” for the assassination of President Kennedy .

At the same time, the Jesuits would destroy the historic Protestantism of Wash ington’s Republic pursuant to the Council of Trent . And how would the Jesuits do this in a country that was still predominantly Protestant and Baptist , whose inhabitants were of the White Celtic-Anglo-Saxon Race enjoying the Bill of Rights and well armed with an Authorized K ing James Version of the B ible in one hand and a gun in the other? The Jesuits would gain control of every State governm ent as well as the National Governm ent, and then pass legislation to further their nefarious ends . To do this the foreign and naturalized Rom an Catholic populations, enj oying the com munist m axim of universal suffrage since the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment since 1870, m ust be increased through im migration and then m anipulated to vote “en m asse” for the candidates whom the Hierarchy endorsed.

We read from Black’s Law Dictionary, Fifth Edition : “ Roman Catholic Church . The juristic personality of the Roman Catholic Church, with the right to sue and to take and hold property . . . It was form ally recognized between Spain a nd the Papacy and by Spanish laws from the beginning of the settlements in the Indies, also by our Treaty with Spain in 1898, whereby its property ri ghts were solem nly safeguarded.” { 7 } Concerning im migration, this is precis ely what the Jesuits did. We read: “Big Catholic population gains were m ade between 1881 and 1890, when 1,250,000 Catholic im migrants reache d Am erican shores. In 1890 there were nearly 9 million Catholics in the United States. From 1891 to the close of the century a nother 1,225,000 arrived a nd the total Catholic population grew to 12, 041,000. From 1901 through 1910 the num ber of Catholic new com ers was alm ost 2,320,000 and the total Catholic population leaped to 16,336,000. In a brief two-decade period the Rom an Catholic numbers had been increas ed by more than 7.3 million.” { 8 } Upon arriving in the Am erican Em pire, the Rom an Catholics were used by the priests to control the elec tions. One of our heroes, Jeremiah Crow ley , quotes “ The Catholic World ” in 1912: “The Roman Catholic is to wield his vote for the purpose of securing Catholic ascendancy in this country. All legislation m ust be governed by the will of God unerringly indicated by the Pope. Education must be controlled . . . and the utterances of the press are included . . . ” { 9 } This m eans that within thirty years, from 1880 to 1910, the Catholic population had doubled, thereby enabling the Jesuits to further control the powerful political machines of both parties using their junior Jesuits, the Knights of Columbus , along with the Mafia and their dupes — the Rom an Catholic people.

Thom as Sherm an, the Je suit, defined the purpose of the Society with one breath and then defended it with the next, while condem ning the ex-priests who were exposing Rom e’s true colors. We read: “It was Ignatius who conceived the da ring plan of forging the weapon to beat back the Reformation . . . He or ganized an Order expressly to fight and down Protestantism . He considered all outside the Church as doctrinally his enem ies and so do we now . . .

He never faced them! Ultimately, his lies and bad conscience drove him to an attempted suicide. Confined in the Milwaukee sanatorium he wr ote these most pitiful words to his Jesuit Provincial master: “I have not the faintest gleam of any hope of salvation since July 30, 1911 . . .

The Mafia would first be used to oppress the Catholic populations of the large Northern cities, fo rbidding the people to settle in Protestant communities or allowing their children to attend the Bible-reading public schools. The Mafia would control crim e in an orga nized fashion, establishing m onopolies in the traffic of liquor, prostitution, gambli ng, pornography and drugs , further enriching the coffers of Rome. Later, in accumula ting wealth and power, it would be used politically for controlling both the Republican a nd Democratic parties to the extent of high-level assassination. Am azingly, the Je suits would be so bold as to use their Mafia in conjunction with the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) during World War II. We read from The Luciano Project : “Not only did Lucky Luciano and his Mafia associates help the Navy protect New York Harbor from espionage , sabotage, and labor strife; their influence reached across th e Atlantic Ocean to the port cities of Sicily and Italy during the critical i nvasions of Hitler’s Mediterranean frontier . . . [ The story ] was kept secret for twenty-thr ee years, with a cast of hundreds of naval officers, Mafia grandees, and racketeers, judges, district attorneys, corrections officers and pa role personnel, not to m ention secret agents of all services, working fro m Great Meadow Prison to the front lines of the Italian campaign.” {14 } The Jesuits would also use th eir Mafia soldiers alongside the agents of the OSS in World War II, remembering that the head of the OSS was an Irish Roman Catholic whose brother, Vincent Donovan , was a Dominican priest. We read: “During World War II, William Donovan , chief of U.S. Intelligence (OSS), decided that a “corps of sk illed safecrackers, housebreakers and assassins” could further the war effort . Donovan secured the best – Mafia boss: Charles “Luck y” Luciano – who used his influence to protect Mafia infested American docks from Ax is sabotage. In return, Luciano was granted a com mutation of a long prison sentence [ convicted of compulsory prostitution ], and was deported to Italy in 1946.” {15 } The Jesuits – 1880 - 1913 "},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 422 (Dear truth-seeker, the collaboration betw een the Mafia and OSS is im portant to grasp, enabling us to understand the Mafi a/CIA assassination of President Kennedy.) In returning to the 1880s, the Jesuits, with the plan of “m aking Am erica dominantly Catholic,” through immigration and control of politics, needed more than the Mafia, Shriner Freem asonry (including the “ Royal Order of Jesters ” to which actor John Wayne belonged) and Rothschild’s I llum inati. They needed a new dom estic order to further control Fourteenth Amendment America’s political power and financial m ight. This new order woul d also pretend to be the enem y of the Jesuits’ old war-horse, Shriner Freemasonry , creating further agitations between unsuspecting Catholics and Protestants. So in 1882, one year after the Garfield assassination, an organizati on was born, having derived its name fro m a S panish Jew, who was a notorious slaver and pirate . Of the Knights of Columbus we read: “The Knights of Colum bus, founded at New Haven, Connecticut, February 2, 1882, by Rev. Michael J.

The end to which these oath-bound soldiers of a foreign power are working can only be the destruction of popular liberty, so condem ned by the Jesuits’ Council of Trent , while submitting the American Empire to the absolute Temporal Pow er of the Pope.

As we can see, the Jesu its, with their Rom an Hierarchy and Knights of Columbus, owe allegiance only to the Pope as he obeys their Jesuit General. They intend to subm it every hum an govern ment to the earthly rule or Temporal Pow er of the Pope. David S. Phelan , a priest in St. Louis, wrote in 1913: “Tell us we are Catholics firs t and Am ericans or Englishm en afterwards; of course we are.

The ex-priest and one of our heroes, Jeremiah Crowley , quotes the sam e priest, David S. Phelan : “Protestantism – We would draw and qua rter it. We would impale it and hang it up for crow’s m eat. We would te ar it with pincers, and fire it with molten lead, and sink it in a hundred fathom s of hell-fire.” { 21 } When Jerem iah Crowley was a priest in 1902 he asked Cardinal Martinelli that if the Catholics in this country numbered a bout seventy million and if the Protestants numbered about ten million, wh at would he do to the Protestants? He replied: “ Oh, Christ, I’d crush ‘em! ” { 22 } [Em phasis added] Rome’s attitude towards “heretics” has neve r changed even as the Jesuits and their Council of Trent have never changed! It is for th is reason that the great Protestant preacher Isaac Lansing declared in 1890: “I do not hesitate to say that, in all candor and reason, every Roman Catholic who confesses this allegiance to the Papacy, ought to be disfranchised in the United States, and forbidden the right to participate, as a citizen, in either holding an office or casting a ballot.” { 23 } Having doubled the Catholic population of the Am erican Em pire from 1881 to 1910, having brought the Italian Mafia into the major cities to control the Catholic populations and organized crim e, and having established th e Knights of Colum bus to implement “Jesuitical politics,” the Society of Jesus , in control of the Pope and his Hierarchy , had now subordinated the civil power of the American Congress to the Papal power — the will of the B lack P ope .

The Court’s decisi ons would be pursuant to Rom e’s plans for Fourteenth Amendment America which included the denial that the Bill of Rights were privileges of Fourteenth Amendment Citizenship , approving the replacement of the English Common Law procedure with the Roman Civil Law procedure in both State and Federal Courts, the abolition of segregation, the destruction of the The Jesuits – 1880 - 1913 "},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 426 Public School System through the forced integration of White s and Blacks while abolishing Bible-reading and prayer , the forbidding of capital punishm ent, the legalization of abortion and voi ding possible legislation targeted against the Jesuits — just to name a few!

Taft was also the bosom friend of General Sherm an’s son, the Jesuit, Thomas Sherman. Additionally, an English Jesu it and forem ost advisor to King George V , Fr. Bernard Vaughan , converted Taft’s sister to Rom anism . And it was President Theodore Roosevelt , with his “Maltese Cross Ranch” in the Badlands of North Dakot a, who branded Am erican Pr otestants as “bigots” over their concern of Rome’s ascending power in Washingt on. He also began the continuing centralization of power in the pres idency. One of his acts was the creation of the Bureau of Investigation: “From the time of Theodore Rooseve lt’s accession to the presidency, Am erican presidents of the twen tieth century had begun to assert unprecedented claims to centralize power in the executive o ffice. As part of this new federalism, President R oosevelt’s Attorney General, Charles Bonaparte, by executive order had created the Bureau of Investigation in 1908 as a full-tim e investigative divi sion of the Justice Departm ent [ America’s Holy Office of the Inquisition ].” { 27 } [Em phasis added] And by which Order and to what end is the control of the Legislative, Executive and Judicial branches of the federal governm ent? Crowley tells us: “ Rome’s Jesuitical emissaries, agents and m issionaries are everywhere . They have no conscience but the Pope’s dictation. They are allowed to assume whatever dress they plea se; for their better disguise, any occupations in church or state; th ey are in the highest and lowest conditions, and have been known to appear as active and zealous members in non-Catholic associations and churches — sometimes filling The Jesuits – 1880 - 1913 "},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"Chap ter 33 427 prom inent Protestant pulpits . . .

For the Jesuits produced their Chief Justice Earl Warren to cover-up the assassination with his Warren Com mission as well as de fend the Knight of Malta, Clay L. Shaw during his trial in New Orleans, initiated by Jim Garrison . The Jesuits used President Johnson to appoint the Warren Com mission and, with the Justice Departm ent, used J. Edgar Hoover and his FBI to suppress evidence of a conspiracy. The Jesuits, with their agents in Congress, such as Thomas “Tip” O’Neill , did all they could to thwart the proceedings of the Assassinations Committe e in 1976, which concluded there was a conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy thanks to Robert Groden , the author of High Treason . The words of our hero, Charles Chiniquy , were now fulfilled. Jeremiah Crowley , America’s Martin Luther of the Twentieth Century, proved, without refutation , Rom e’s control of both federal and state governm ents. But the warnings went unheeded. The Protestants, with their Jesuit-infested Federal Council of Churches , did nothing. The liberty-loving Am eric ans – Protestants, Baptists, Jews and “liberal” Catholics – for the most part had forgotten they were truly in a holy war initiated by those ever-present wa rlords, the Sons of Loyola. Priest Isaac Hecker was right. Rom e, controlled by the Jesuits , took the Am erican governm ent away from the Am erican people in the early 1900s, and have kept it! Since that time the Jesuits have used the military and financial might of their Fourteenth Amendment “Holy Roman” American Empire as “the Sword of the Church,” to subordinate the nations of the world to the Temporal Pow er of the cannibalistic Papal Caesar . May Go d help us to repent that He may forgive us!!! Of the year 1913 we ask in retrospect , “What would the Jesuits do now that they were in control of every President from Theodore Roosevelt to Woodrow Wilson ?” They would further develop their Am erican Empire patterned after their Reductions in Paraguay. In preparing for the Second Thirty Years’ War (1914- 1945) they would create a national, inquisitional polic e force and implement two pillars of The Communist Manifesto . In 1908, the very year Rom e declared the Am erican Em pire no longer to be a m issiona ry country (it was now conquered), they founded the FBI . In 1913 they created their priv ately owned national bank, called “ The Federal Reserve System ,” established a “heavy progr essive income tax” with the Sixteenth Amendment and created the IRS to collect it. Rom e would now have a police state with its corporate m onopolie s while destroying the White Protestant Middle Class. Rome’s seeds of absolutist, Jesuit corporate fascism had been successfully planted. The Jesuits – 1880 - 1913 "},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 428 In 1917, the Jesuits, contrary to Washington’s Farewell Address , brought Fourteenth Amendment America out of isolation – to be used like the nations of the Holy Alliance – to intervene in the affairs of fo reign countries via military invasion in restoring and m aintaining the Pope’s Temporal Pow er . This would be the true purpose of th e American Empire during World War I. President Woodrow Wilson , the apostate Protestant and self-confessed traitor, would be used to punish the Pr otestant Germ an Em pire. For Kaiser Wilhelm I and Prince Otto von Bismarck’s governm ent of the Protestant Second Reich had banished the Jesuits in 1872 and, in 1907, threatened to im mediately expel every Catholic priest from the Empire in retaliation for Pope Pius X’s “ infallible ” Decree, “ Ne temere .” (That Decree, simply put, declared that any Catholic not m arried by a Roman Catholic priest was living in adu ltery and their children were bastards. Humiliated, the Pope modified the Decr ee so as to not apply to Germany!) President Wilson would also be the tool in com mencing Rom e’s vengeance on Orthodox Russia. In aiding the Bolshevik Revolution, he would be used to punish Russia’s Rom anoff Dynasty and Orthodox Chur ch. The Jesuits’ new Russian Em pire, called the “ USSR ” would be greatly expanded unde r the Order’s Grand Inquisitor, Joseph Stalin . For Tzar Alexander II , who maintained religi ous toleration for all creeds professed in his dominions , abolished Russia’s Concordat with Rome’s High Priest and King, the P apal Caesar (who practices cannibalism through the Bible- rejecting and Baal-worshipping doctrine of “ Transubstantiation ” when drinking the blood and eating the flesh of his false, de ad and unbiblical “C hrist” still hanging on the cross of his occultic Cruc ifix), and the leaders of the Orthodox Church had refused to attend the Vatican Council of 1870. In 1880 Dostoyevsk y’s prophetic words warned of the power of the Jesuits in Ru ssia. Again, we repeat his war cry: “ . . . those are the worst of the Catho lics, the Inquisitors, the Jesuits! . . . They are simply the Romi sh arm y for the earthly sovereignty of the world in the future, with the P ontiff of Rome for Emperor . . . that’s their ideal, but there’s no sort of m ystery or loft y m elancholy about it . . . its sim ple lust of power, of filthy earthly ga in, of dom ination – something like a universal serfdom with them as m asters – that’s all they stand for.

To obtain this, they decry faith in God, join in attacks on Rome, play the atheist or the infidel [ as they would do in the Bolshevik Revolution ].” { 30 } [Em phasis added] The Jesuits were further enraged with the response of Tz ar Nicholas II (who was influenced by the Patriarch of the Orthodox Church ) to the Pope’s Decree, “ Ne temere ,” of 1907. Like Germ any, Russia utterly condem ned it.

The Jesuits, in turn, us ed these two Protestant Em pires to punish Rom e’s two greatest enem ies, the Protestant German Empire and the Orthodox Russian Empire beginning with World War I. The Great War , begun in 1914, would com mence the punishm ent of both Germ any and Russia for thirty years.

By the use of such machinery the Order has attained its high position and widespread influence .” { 5 } [Em phasis added] As we can see, by the be ginning of the Twentieth Century the Jesuit Order had this all-pervading power of intelligence. To know everything a bout everyone was one of its chief goals. We must remember that the Jesuits had been in control of England no later than 1800 during the reign of King George III .

That m eans all correspondenc e of every priest, bishop, archbishop and cardinal from around the world wa s subject to Jesuit review. Even the Pope’s confessor was and is today a Jesuit . Nino Lo Bello tells us: “The Pope’s confessor, an ordinary pr iest, must be a Jesuit: he must visit the Vatican once a week at a fixed time, and he alone m ay absolve the Pope of his sins. [ How can an unsaved man commit daily acts of sin who at the same time is “ infallible ” when speaking “ ex cathedra ” for a brief moment of time while decreeing the doctr ine of the Papal Institution? ]” { 6 } But how would the Jesuits expand their police registry, lists and indexes on individuals, into the United St ates? They would use the Bonapartes once again. For as the Freemason Napoleon I was their tool during th e Napoleonic Wars, and his nephew, Napoleon III was their tool during the Crim ean War and the Franco- Prussian War, even so was Charles Joseph Bonaparte their tool in creating the Bureau of Investigation. Bonaparte, a Masonic Papal Kn ight and grandnephew of the Emperor, created what became the Federal Bureau of Investigation — the Empire’s “ Holy Office of the Inquisition .” It was made subject to the Empire’s “Grand Inquisitor,” the Attorney General and his Depa rtm ent of Justice (to be later m anned in 1984 by Jesuits like U.S. Attorney John MacCoon ) newly established in 1870. The Em pire’s “Grand Inquisitor” was set up in th e m iddle of a national crises called “the Reconstruction” (1865-1876) – during martial law including the rape, pillage and plunder of the Southern peopl e by Northern soldiers and carpetbaggers – two years after the forced ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868. Dear truth-seeker, the Empire’s “ Holy Office of the Inquisition ,” the FBI , would experience m assive growth during th e Jesuits’ Second Thirty Years’ War under the all-seeing eye of its Shriner Freemason, J. Edgar Hoover . Hoover would recruit most of his Roman Catholic inquisitors from Jesuit Universities. We read: “So Catholics were ultimately preferre d. Hoover reportedly favored Irish Catholic youths, finding them gene rally clean-cut and good-looking and earnest about their religion. He ac tively sought them out and later, after Notre Dam e and Marquette [ Jesuit ] granted him honorary degrees, recruited heavily at those universities.” { 7 } Despite the Constitution , Bonaparte’s Bureau would com e to exercise truly inquisitional powers not only dom estically but also around th e world. The FBI would keep the Jesuit registry of police indexes on individuals within the American Empire and would be a vital link in the Jesuits’ International Intelligence Community The Jesuits – 1908 "},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 436 based in Rome within the Je suit General’s “War Room” — Borgo di Santo Spirito . Concerning the creation of the FBI , including its founder, Charles Bonaparte , we read from Curt Gentry’s masterpiece: “It had, for starters, been born illegitimately , on July 1, 1908. It was, as one congressm an had correctly labele d it at the tim e, a ‘ bureaucratic bastard,’ the issue of a union unsanc tioned by the Congress of the United States . However, its father was know n. He was Charles Joseph Bonaparte, Am erican-born grandne phew of Napoleon I, and attorney general of the United States from 1906 to 1908.” { 8 } [Em phasis added] From The Boss we read: “From the tim e of Theodore Rooseve lt’s accession to the presidency, Am erican presidents of the twen tieth century had begun to assert unprecedented claims to centralize power in the executive office. As part of this new federalism, President R oosevelt’s attorney general, Charles Bonaparte, by executive order had created the Bureau of Investigation in 1908 [ an all-male secret society ] as a full time investigative division of the Justice Department [ against the expressed wishes of Congress and while it had gone into recess ! ].” { 9 } [Em phasis added] (Dear truth-seeker, in reflecting upon the la st two quotes, do you “sm ell a rat” in the creation of the FBI? Should we not de mand that it be abolished im mediately?) The Bureau was established to “detect and prosecute crim e against the United States.” So the Jesuits – the masters of socialist-com munism and authors of the Bolshevik Revolution – created “the stra w dog” called “the Re d Scare” and then em powered their Am erican Chek a to shoot it down. The Bureau, in one of their m ass roundups in 1918, arrested fifty thousand ordinary American citizens! In 1921, J. Edgar Hoover was appointed assistant Chief of the Bureau; in 1924 he was appointed Ac ting Director and in 1935, the Bureau becam e “the FBI.” Until his murder in 1972, Hoover was a virtual dictator for nearly fifty years as the Bureau had been patterned after the m onarc hial governm ent of the Jesuit Order. For Hoover, like the Jesuit General, wielded the power of an absolute m onarch. During the years of World War II, the FBI grew enorm ously in power and influence under the supervision of the Em pire’s m ost form idable Freem asons, J. Edgar Hoover and Frank lin Roosevelt . Both were apostate Protestants as neither accepted the B ible as their final authority of faith and practice. This gave the appearance that Am erican tyranny was Protestant! W e m ust not forget that Charles The Jesuits – 1908 "},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"Chap ter 34 437 Bonaparte – a Freemason (whose father, Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte (1784-1860), in addition to being a high-le vel French Freemason, had been an officer on the staff of the Jesuits’ Napoleon III ) – created the Bureau that would enthrone Hoover the Inquisitor; and Joe Kennedy – one of Archbishop Hayes’ Knights of Malta – would be responsible for the election of FDR . As always, the Freemasons are in the foreground while the Jesuits and their Knights of Malta are in the background . Like the Jesuit “police index” in Rom e, Hoover established indexes and lists on thousands of individuals illegally, investigating their private lives without authorization from the Departm ent of Justice. That is an Inquisition! Hoover also compiled other lists anticipating the erection of Concentration Camps . We read: “Hoover had also – on his own initia tive and without any statutory authority – set up a Custodial Detenti on list, of persons to be rounded up and im prisoned in concentration cam ps, should the need arise. The list included . . . journalists critical of th e administration, writers critical of the FBI, and certain m embers of Congress.” { 10 } Hoover , like his Nazi counterpart Himmler , hated the Jews . He resisted Jewish im migration and blam ed notorious crim es of th e Jesuits on the Jews. For example, Emma Goldman was blam ed and deported for inspiring President McKinley’s assassination and the Rosenbergs were convicted and electrocuted for giving Stalin nuclear secrets. The trut h is the Jesuits murdered McKinley with one of their foreign born, fanatical Rom an Catholic assassins and they used FDR to give Stalin “the nuclear device” in 1943. This treason, committed through the Company’s International Intelligence Co mmunity (the OSS and NKVD), furthered the illusion of “the Cold War” and “the Co mmunist threat.” Using the Jews as scapegoats is nothing new: we are familiar with the Dreyfus Affair and the Protocols of Zion . Lastly, the FBI had a working relationship with the MID and ONI that would be perfected over the years. Of this beginning in 1939 we read: “During Hoover’s m eeting with Roosevelt and [ Cordell ] Hull, the president had ordered him to coordinate the FBI investigation with the Army’s Military Intelligence Divisi on (MID) and the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). Roosevelt’s reque st simply formalized what was already an ongoing relationship . . . On June 26, 1939, Roosevelt sent a confidential presidential directive – drafted by the FBI and Justice Departm ent officials – to the heads of the relevant departm ents stating, ‘It is m y desire that the investiga tion of all espionage , counterespionage and sabotage m atters be controlled and handled’ by the FBI, MID, and ONI, and that no investigation in these areas be conducted ‘except by the three agencies m entioned above.’ ” { 11 } The Jesuits – 1908 "},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 438 After the end of World War II a host of FBI agents resigned resulting in their replacement with many Jesuit-trained Roman Catholics. (Two such agents and Opus Dei memb ers were Louis J.

We read: “During the Bureau’s early years, ther e had been few Catholics in the upper echelons of the FBI, although there wa s an abundance of Masons. Although Hoover denied being prejudiced, not until the mid-1940s did the FBI begin recruiting agent applicants at Catho lic universities such as Georgetown [ Jesuit ], Fordham [ Jesuit ], and Notre Dam e. Two things were responsible for the change; the FBI director’s rea lization that the Catholic Church was strongly anti-Com munist, and thus could be a valuable ally; and the need to replace the special agents who had defected en masse at the end of the war. [ Why the defection? ] In addition to soliciting Ca tholics as agents, informal liaison was developed with va rious church officials, such as Francis Cardinal Spellm an*, Monsignor Fulton J. Sheen, and Father John F. Cronin. *The FBI m aintained close ties with Spellm an, largely through Lou Nichols and, later, the New York SAC John Malone, even though Hoover’s files contained num erous allegations that Spellm an was a very active hom osexual.” { 12 } When Lou Nichols retired in 1957, the m an who took his place as the head of Crim e Records Division and therefore becam e the liaison between the FBI and Cardinal Spellman was Cartha DeLoach — a Knight of Malta! We read: “ . . . Cartha DeLoach . . . succeeded Louis Nichols as head of the Crime Records Division on the latter’s re tirem ent from the Bureau in 1957.” { 13 } The ties of the Jesuits with the FBI, and thus the KGB, are obvious. Through the Jesuit-trained “American Pope,” Cardinal Spellman , and the graduates of Jesuit Universities, the Order had intimate ties with Hoover . The Director not only hired graduates from the Jesuits’ Georgetow n and Fordham Universities, he was given an honorary degree from the Jesuits’ Marquette University and maintained close ties with that powerful Jesuit and Georgetown University Dean, Edmund Walsh ! And it was Walsh, “an expert” on international politics and the Soviet Union, who led a team of Jesuits into Russia in 1922 on a supposed “mission of relief.” Soon after Walsh’s arrival, the Jesuit-trained Joseph Stalin was appointed Secretary of the Com munist Party and thus the head of the Order’s KGB , remaining so until the day the risen Son of G od sovereignly intervened with a word from His lips and brought about the tyrant’s prem ature death. For Satan , in attempting to nullify the promises given to Abraham , Isaac , Jacob and David , inspired Stalin in 1953 with “ the Doctors’ case ” to justify the attempted execution of every Jew in Russia! The Jesuits – 1908 "},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"Chap ter 34 439 And because of the Jesuit control of the FBI, Hoover denied the existence of the Roman Catholic Italian Mafia. In f act, he consorted with New York Mob boss Frank Costello , the personal friend of Knight of Malta, Joe Kennedy . We read: “There was no such thing as ‘org anized crim e’, Hoover insisted, no such thing as a ‘Mafia’, while the cl aim that there existed a ‘national crim e syndicate’ was itself ‘baloney’ . . . ” { 14 } There were theories as to “Why?” Many suspected the reason was personal. “They concluded that J. Edgar H oover himself was on the take, that he had reached an accommodation with the syndicate, and in particular with the New York crime boss Frank Costello . . . According to one tale, Hoover and Costello met regularly on a bench in Central Park – hardly a secret meeting place – to discuss mutual interests . . . Other accounts had the pair socializing at the Waldorf, where both had complimentary suites, or, in most versions, at the Stork Club . . . Like Hoover, Costello was a Stor k Club regular, as were numerous other mob figures . . . Yet there is no question they me t or that they reached an accommodation, of sorts . . . a nd, Hoover, for his own still mysterious reasons , refused to admit that a national criminal organization existed.” { 15 } [Emphasis added] The Jesuits, in control of the FBI through Hoover , and the Mafia through its “ Commission ” (one of its m embers being Frank Costello ), were virtually unchallenged in 1946. In cont rol of both the Governm ent and Organized crim e, the Jesuits would create the Unite d Nations and the Cold War with their Masonic tools, “Dirty Harry” Truman and “Smokin’ Winston” Churchill . Why? To carry out the Jesuit Oath in fulfilling the Council of Trent , restoring the Temporal Pow er of the Pope around the world, and to create Zionist Israel , for the purpose of rebuilding Solomon’s Temple and the final attempted mass-murder of the Jewish Race . For if “ the holy seed ” ( the physical descendants of the sons of Jacob, including the tribe of Manasseh, Ephraim being another name for the tribe of Joseph ) can be destroyed “ . . . of whom concerning the flesh Christ came . . . ,” – Romans 9:4 The Jesuits – 1908 "},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 440 its Messiah would have no descendants of Jacob over which to reign, as He is to sit “ . . . upon the throne of David . . . for ever [with the twelve disciples sitting] “ . . . upon twelve thrones, judgi ng the twelve tribes of Israel.” – Isaiah 9:7; Luke 1:32, 33 – Matthew 19:28 Israel’s Messiah is to rule all nations in a worldwide earthly kingdom bringing safety, peace and honor to his repentan t Jewish people of whom He said, “ . . . we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.” – John 4:22 Knowing this, the De vil , with his “ infallible ” Pope using Zionism , is attempting to keep these unconditional promises of G od, given to Abraham , Isaac , Jacob and David , from being fulfilled in the future. In conclusion, the Jesuits have been th e great intelligence gath erers of the past and by 1870 had the largest intelligence appara tus in the world. In 1908, the Jesuits extended that apparatus into the United States with the creation of the BI through one of their Masonic Papal Knights, Charles Joseph Bonaparte . In order to give the impression that the BI , which later became the FBI , was not a Rom an Catholic secret police, an apostate, homosexual , Presbyterian Protestant and Shriner Freem ason was appointed as the Director for nearly fifty years. The Bureau exercised inquisitional powers from the beginning . Mass roundups, lists, secret Divisions, secret indexes, plans for concentration camps, etc., all betray ed the true colors of “the bureaucratic bastard.” It was the American secr et police with powers as sweeping as Stalin’s NKVD that would later pr ove as ruthless as Hitler’s Gestapo.

Openly the FBI denied the existence of the Mafia , secretly the Bureau and the Mob cooperated together pursuing their mutual interests. Later, the FBI/ONI would forge an alliance with Roman Catholic Luciano’s Italian Mafia. Irish Roman Catholic “Wild Bill” Donovan’s Office of Strategic Services would likewise collaborate with Luciano’s Mafia. During the War, the OSS would aid and abet – wit hout presidential authority – Roman Catholic Stalin’s NKVD as well as establish a working relationship with Sir Stewart Menz ies’ British Secret Service. After the War, the OSS would help in evacuating the Jesuit General’s Nazi SD , Waffen SS and Intelligence Group out of Europe via the Vatican Ratlines , sim ultaneously used by the Masonic Jewish Z ionists in leading Europe’s surviving a nd unsuspecting Jews to Pales tine, merging Hitler’s best with the CIA in the West and the KGB in the East.

The building of Titanic has begun at a shipyard in Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland. Belfast is the Protestant haven of the Irish and is hated by the Jesuit Order. By 1912, nearly fi ve hundred thousand Ulster Protestants would sign the Ulster Covenant pledging “to defeat the conspiracy to set up a Hom e Rule [ Rome Rule ] Parliament.” Ireland is still part of the British Empire but most of the Island will be severed from the British Crown as a result of the Jesuits’ World War I. The Panama Canal is in building a nd will be completed in time to begin its usefulness during “ The Great War .” The Company’s planned destruction of the Protestant British Empire is at hand and will be completed by the end of the Jesuit General’s “ Cold War .” The destruction of the Pr otestant Germ an Em pire, having courageously expelled Loyola’s Black robes , has already been put in m otion with a secret treaty between the Order’s agents in France and Russia. The overthrow of the Orthodox Russian Em pire has already begun, the Jesuits having provoked a war in 1905 using Emperor Meiji of Japan. The destruction of Im perial Japan is in the making as payback for the Emperor’s s hogun expelling the Jesuit “missionaries” for over two hundred and fifty years. The atro cities of the Jesuits’ Bolshevik Revolution and subsequent Inqui sition by Jesuit-trained Joseph Stalin will be blamed on the Jews , converting the Europeans into the unwitting tools of Rome’s Third Reich. The Jewish Holocaust will be used to justify Rome’s creation of the Zionist nation of Israel , paving the way for an even greater “burnt o ffering” of Jews, as the majority of these descendants of Jacob, due to worldwide anti-Jewish fury , are to be driven from the nations to one geographical lo cation.

Death by drowning, am idst the scream s, yells, shri eks, wailing and weeping of helpless m en, women and children floundering in the North Atlantic, the innocents will plunge ten thousand feet to their nightm arish doom ! Therefore, the White Star Line is created to bring the immigrant traffic – Irish, French and Italian Roman Catholics – into the United States pursuant to Rom e’s plan of “m aking America dominantly Catholic.” But the deathship Titanic is built, in hated Protestant Belfast, to be sunk and will be used to entice three hundred and twenty-five of the world’s richest and finest to board “the unsinkable” m an-m ade monster, loaded with an additional nine teen hundred Protestant and Catholic “anim als.” With the first-class fare be ing fifty thousand Fede ral Reserve Notes by today’s standard, multi-millionaires board the ship, three of them Jewish — Benjamin Guggenheim , Isidor Straus , the head of “Macy’s” departm ent stores, and Freemason John Jacob Astor – a frequent passenger on the White Star line and the richest man in the world other than the Pope of Rom e residing in Caesar’s P alace . The Captain of the ship is Brother Edward J. Smith , S.J. , the world’s greatest pilot and master of the North Atlan tic waters, seasoned with twenty-six years on the high seas. Captain Sm ith is indeed one of the B lack P ope’s unseen and unknown Temporal Coadjutors .

He “without will or intelligenc e” will commit this crime – this shameless and heartless atrocity – at the will of his master who holds him “as a little crucifix” and “who uses him as it suits him best.” Edward Smith has been required for “martyrdom.” Departing southern England from th e port of Southam pton at 12:00 noon on April 10, 1912, the Captain’s m aster had boarded. This m an was the most powerful Jesuit in Ireland and answered directly to the Jesuit General, Francis Xavier Wernz .

This scene portrayed with the brush of a Rembrandt or a Thomas Kink ade , would serve as a crushing rebuke to any nation that would give the Sons of Loyola access to their shores.

Provincial Brow ne boards Titanic , photographs the victim s, m ost assuredly briefs Captain Smith concerning his Oath as a Jesuit, and the following morn ing bids him farewell.

But he, like Rodin the Jesuit of The Wandering Jew , is one of “the Borg” of Star Trek , nam ed after a past Jesuit General, Francis Borgia , as well as the General’s present headquarters being Borgo di Santo Spirito in Rome. He is a Jesuit of the Fourth Vow under Extrem e Oath. He is a m achine in a m an’s body, the perfect Manchurian Candidate and one of the Com manders of The Engineer Corps of Hell . He would betray his own mother to fu rther the worldwide political power of a tyrannical sinner who calls him self “ the Vicar of Christ ”!! So he goes through his religious m otions and so passes by. As “Father” Browne watches Titanic disappear over the horizon with a fire below in bunker num ber 10, he has no regrets. He knows “the law of the C hurch” and, having no “fear of offense,” is convinced that this crim e shall be “for the greater glory of God” — the god who sits in St. Peter’s Chair! On board the ship, the Jesuit Captain Smith knows his duty. He is under Oath. There is no recanting. The ship has been built for the enemies of the Order. He, after three days at sea, with only one pair of glasses for the bridge , propels full steam ahead – twenty-two knots – on a m oonless, dark ni ght through a gigantic ice field, nearly eighty square m iles in size, despite at least eight telegrams of warning as well as m any other cautions. He refuses to listen. Hell-bent on destruction, upon approaching the iceberg, first officer Murdoch – another conspirator – has been instructed by the Captain what to do. He or ders the engines to be thrown in reverse while swinging the ship sharpl y to the left, its starboard side. Had the captain not reversed his engines the Titanic would have turned much more qui ckly the greater the forward m otion. This error was a violation of one of the cardinal rules of safety, which is to never turn a ship’s broadside to danger! (Are we to believe that Captain Smith , the master of his profession, would ma ke such a basic blunder in addition to steam ing full speed ahead through the up-a nd-com ing icebergs that he had been warned about? Obviously, he wanted to break the ship in half! This is nothing m ore than a repeat of Napoleon’s perform ance at Waterloo deliberately sacrificing his arm y, and a preview of the violation of the most basic rules of security in Dallas, Texas in 1963 resulting in President Kennedy’s death.) Titanic grazes the iceberg at 11:40 PM, April fourteenth. Knowing full well the ship’s inadequate number of lifeboats and the crew having no boat a ssignments in case of an emergency evacuation, Captain Smith walks back to the radio room and instructs his officer to send a CQD; then later, an SOS. Smith , the Jesuit Coadjuto r, has fulfilled his intended purpose in obedience to his Jesuit master, “ Father ” Jesuit Provincial Francis M. Brow ne , pursuant to the Jesuit Oath . Am id the innocence of its passengers the brutal crew begins to evacuate the ship. But the Jewish multi-millionaires Astor , Guggenheim and Straus are forbidden to board a lifeboat .

Was not J. P.

This leads the author to believe there were more than two Jesuits on board the deathship. There were probably at least te n of the ship’s officer s and crew who were “Professed” and under “Extrem e Oath.” There were probably several Knights of Colum bus under the Oath of the Fourth Degr ee, as well as a few Freem asons loyal to the mark “ I.H.S. ” — the seal of the B lack P ope ! This explains why a Jesuit Provincial would personally board the vessel! He m ust have leisurely finalized the plan with his soldiers charging this select group of the ship’s yeom en – hired at the last minute as a result of a contrived strike in England – that upon the Jesuit Captain Smith’s order to abandon ship, to quickly lower the inadequate num ber of lifeboats, less than half full with only wom en and children, in to the water while forbidding the men who were the wealthy targets from board ing. The poorer passengers within the lower levels were to be locked down so as to prevent the Order’s wealthy victims from escaping its watchful eye and possibl y boarding a lifeboat am idst the hysteria and confusion on deck. ( Jesuit Captain Smith’s deliberate sinking of Titanic was a preview to the sinking of the doom ed U.S.S. Indianapolis overseen by the Order’s CFR m ember and Com mander of the Pacific Fleet, Admiral Chester William Nimitz , along with several devi ous subordinates including Captain Oliver Naquin . The ship’s captain and “patsy,” Captain Charles B.

Predictably, in 1968, unable to cope any longer with his m ental agony, the innocent and good Captain took his life, to the sham e and disgrace of the High Com mand of the U.S. Navy!)

Like the “selections” at Auschwitz , those “selected” to board the lifeboats would live. The rest, on the ship or in the water, must die the death including several Jesuits, Masons and possibly Knights of Colum bus. This leads us to another question. Who owned the White Star Line? For, its management was ultimately responsible for choosing the men who would man the ship. And with the m oney involved in financing those luxury liners ( Titanic , Britannic and Olympic ), only select Knights of Malta and the m odern day Knights Templar – select Shriner Freemasons – “ . . . the great men . . . and the merchants of the earth . . . ” – Revelation 18:3, 23 could have been the m overs and shakers of this attack on the private fortunes of wealthy Jews enjoying the blessings of Protestant-Calvinist liberty secured by William I of Orange , Oliver Cromwell and George Washington . The Knights knew that the Hebrews of both th e American and British Empires had never suffered formal persecution for over two hundred years , and as a result, invested their wealth in great industries bringing fi nancial prosperity to both Pr otestant peoples. About the time of Titanic the renowned com poser Gustav Mahler , directing the Vienna Court Opera and having com posed hi s im mortal and m agnificent Symphony No. 5 “Adagietto ,” abandoned Roman Catholic Austria and settled in New York in 1909 to enjoy Protestant liberty while c onducting the New York Philharm onic — as a Jew .

According to Anthony Sutton in his Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution , after Morgan’s death in 1913 a portion of his m assive we alth invested with the Am erican International Corporation in New York would finance the Bolshevik Revolution — that Jesuit Inquisition in Ru ssia! According to an Arts and Entertainment docum entary video, this J. P.

Another high-level Freem ason who also “cancelled” his reservation on the Titanic was Milton Hershey , Pennsylvania’s chocolate king!

The Jesuits, using the cronies of J. P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, Jr ., sneaked through Congress the Federal Reserve Act during Christm as (Baalm as) Break on Decem ber 23, 1913. That sam e year, the Sixteenth (Income Tax) Amendment was declared to be “r atified” and, with the passing of the Internal Revenue Act , the Order created “the Commercial Inquisition.” And why we re these planks of The Communist Manifesto put in place? To finance the up-and-com ing Crusade – the Second Thirty Years’ War – to begin in 1914. This Crusade would be financed ju st like the Crusades of old. We read: “In 1166 and again in 1188 the kings of England and France levied from their lay and clerical subjects for the support of a crusade a tax assessed on their incom es . . . The collectors . . . appointed assessors, who m ade the assessments themselves . . . or on the oaths of the taxpayers themselves .” { 9 } [Em phasis added] Dear truth-seeker, the Federal Reserve Bank is the American Empire’s Vatican central bank requiring a slave (Social Secur ity) num ber with which to do business. The Income Tax is a Peter’s Pence, a tax to finance the Vatican’s Crusades — they being World War I, World War II and every conflict during and after the Cold War. That wicked Incom e Tax was put upon us Am ericans in 1942 during World War II and was called “the Victory Tax.” That wicked Internal Revenue Service was unleashed upon a trusting public, the Service, like the Inquisitors of the Dark Ages, dem anding a full “voluntary” financial confessi on once a year at our expense. For, in the words of John D. Rockefeller , Jr ., “ It is a sin to make a profit! ” With the Jesuit General’s American Empi re in a continual state of war since Trum an’s executive order of 1950, the Fourteenth Amendment citizen mu st continue to pay his “war tax ” or it will be collect ed by force in the “ war courts ” flying the “ war flag ” of the Em pire’s Com mander-i n-Chief. To have m ore productivity for the Vatican’s “war effort,” the Am erican serf was given m ore daylight hours to perform his tasks. Th erefore, during World War II, the Jesuits’ Council on Foreign Relations , in control of the Em pire’s governm ent, began “daylight savings time,” properly called “war time”! When the hour arrives for the “taxpayer” to pay his “ war tax ” he is either assessed by the IRS assessor priests or voluntarily assesses himself under oath , just as in the Dark Ages when Rome’s Priest-K ing and Papal Caesar was the Theocratic Universal Monarch of the World! With these three planks in place, all the nation’s business could now be monitored and regulated by the Board of G overnors of a private Corporation — “the King’s Bank.” This Corporation would never be required to file a tax return nor The Jesuits – 1913 "},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"Chap ter 36 461 would it ever be audited. Ultimately every “person” having “income” would have to “file” a “return,” making a confessi on of every Federal Reserve Note earned and every Federal Reserve Note spent in “item izing deductions.” (Federal Reserve Notes are not “dollars” or “lawful m oney” but are “fiat m oney” or “legal tender,” backed by nothing except the “confiden ce” or rather the “ faith ” of the people. This m akes Federal Reserve Notes identical to the hist oric paper currency of the Rom an Catholic Church – another private Corporation – called “indulgences.” ) All good confessions to the priests of the Internal Revenue Serv ice mu st b e mad e no later than the anniversary date com memorati ng Rom e’s destruction of George Washington’s Calvinistic Confederate Repub lic of Sovereign States — The Federal Republic of these United States of America . That date on which the Jesuits instigated their crim inal “War of Northern Aggression” with their Federalist “Radical Red/Black Republican Party” – that date of infamy – was April fifteenth! Indeed, the Jesuit General’s Fourteenth Amendment “ Holy Roman ” American Empire is the Pope’s warhorse , extending the Pope’s Temporal Power around the world while enforcing the Pope’s Council of Trent . And Woe, Woe, Woe be to the Pope’s Fourteenth Amendment Roman citiz en who refuses to fight the Pope’s wars (every war since 1898), who refuses to participate in the Pope’s war crimes (mass-murdering “heretics, liberals, Protestants, Jews and pagans”), who refuses to pay the Pope’s war tax (the incom e tax), in support of the Pope’s war debt (the national debt), who refuses to be identified with the Pope’s war number (the social security number), w ho refuses to be financed by the Pope’s war chest (the national credit system), who refuses to live by the Pope’s war time (daylight savings time), who refuses to use the Pope’s war courts (both federal and state courts), who refuses to use the Pope’s war name (given to him by the Pope’s war courts — a proper name spelled with all capital letters ), and who refuses to subm it to the personal jurisdiction of the Pope’s war courts (using a statutory abatem ent), evidenced by the presence of the Pope’s war flags (both federal and state) trim med with gold fringe! Dear truth-seeker, “ . . . the prince that shall come . . . ” – Daniel 9:26 who being “At first no m ore than a king of m en, com manding the allegiance of the Roman earth, he afterwards claims to be divine, and dem ands the worship of Christendom .” { 10 } Of that coming prince – the P apal Roman Caesar being “ the antichrist ” – we read: The Jesuits – 1913 "},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 462 “ . . . in his estate shall he honour the God of forces . . . ” – Daniel 11:38 The god of w ar! And why? Because “ . . . the organizing principle of any society is for war. The [ absolute ] authority of the state over its people resides in its war powers.” { 11 } And for what purpose? Because absolutist war waged by the Roman Papal Caesar with his Society of Jesus destroys all religious and political liberties so accursed by the evil Council of Trent , as all “heretics and liberals” can be m ass- murdered without due process of law. Presently in the warring Jesuit General’s Am erican Empire it is called “Emergency War Powers” which have created a monste r called “the National Security Agency” with its hired assassins — select CIA agents, Green Berets and Navy Seals. By the middle of the Twentieth Centur y, Am erican Protestant and Baptist freem en would be reduced to the existence of a “taxpayer.” Robbe d of their status by the Jesuits’ Fourteenth Amendment , every “taxpayer” would be subject to an inquisitional audit, arbitrary bank account seiz ure or a dictatorial wage levy, as every “person” would be presumed guilty of “t ax fraud” or “evasion” until he proved his innocence to a hostile and prejudiced audito r. Thus, the controlling emotion between the citizen and his governm ent would be FEAR ! (The Dom inicans, like the IRS and its subordinate State collection agencies, ra n the Holy Office of the Inquisition during the Dark Ages in the same ma nner, controlling the people with FEAR .) These sweeping new powers would begi n to fulfill the Jesuit quest of submitting the United States to the Temporal Pow er of the Pope. The Jesuits’ ancient enemies – the White Celtic-Anglo-Saxon Protestant Middle Class – would be reduced to credit card poverty, trillions of dollars would be driven to offshore banking havens and the people would fearfully submit to the absolu te powers of an inquisitional bureaucracy. By 1914 the Jesuits were now rea dy to begin their vengeance – the Second Thirty Years’ War – on a Europe, Russia, Chin a and Japan having banished the Company “forever” from their shores . The Order would use the Federal Reserve Bank , their financial “Frankenstein,” to pay fo r it. The “Fed” was given the exclusive privilege to create credit with no collateral , that is, “out of thin air.” Like the The Jesuits – 1913 "},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"Chap ter 36 463 Bolshevik Revolution – also financed by the Fed – the Jesuits would use their Masonic Jewish Zionists such as Paul Warburg (yearning to rebuild Solomon’s Temple ) as the visible leaders of the Fed. This would enable the Order to justify American anti-Jewish fury at the later date in the person of the ex-Basilian (secret Jesuit) radio-priest, Charles E. Coughlin , “the father of hate radio .” Being the personal friend of J. Edgar Hoover and FDR , he would blam e the Jews for the Order’s Great Depression and the Ne w Deal, calling it “the Jew Deal.” This Jesuit credit was extended to the Am erican Congress, controlled by the Jesuits’ Council on Foreign Relations , to build a vast war machine with which to fight the Jesuits’ Second Thirty Years’ War. This Jesuit War Machine becam e Fourteenth Amendment America’s “Military Industrial Complex.” Thus the American Empire’s Military Industrial Co mplex, financed by the Federal Reserve Bank and enslaving the Am erican people to repay the debt from credit created out of nothing, would be directed against the Russi an and Germ an Em pires, the enem ies of the Jesuit General and his “m outhpiece,” the “ infallible ” Pope. (Rem em ber, the Russian Em pire was com posed of Orthodox “heretics,” accursed by the Council of Trent . That Em pire had expelled the Order from its borders in 1820. The Germ an Em pire was com posed of Luther an “heretics,” accursed by the Council of Trent . Likewise, that Em pire had expelled the Orde r in 1872. Both Em pires were dead set against the Jesuits establishing the Pope’s Temporal Pow er within their borders.) The Jesuits waited from 1913 to 1929 to m ake a virtual m onopoly out of their “Frankenstein Fed.” The Great Depression put all the sm aller banks out of business and m ade the Federal Reserve Bank “lor d of all.” And who caused the Great Depression? According to FDR’s son-in-law, Curtis Dall , it was the Knight of Malta, Joseph P. Kennedy . We read: “The feeling around the Street, in succeeding m onths, was that there were, in particular, three large shor t-sellers of stock, allegedly, Tom Bragg, Ben Sm ith, and Joe Kennedy . . . Of the three mentioned well- known short-sellers, Joe Kennedy was a llegedly the m ost im portant, the most powerful and the most successf ul. This service . . . made him invaluable . . . Was Joe Kennedy ca refully selected by world m oney leaders to sell short?” { 12 } Rome, in creating the Great Depression with Joe Kennedy , enthroned its Federal Reserve System in Fourteenth Amendment America as its international keystone to restore the Pope’s Temporal Pow er around the world. The Em pire’s privately owned central bank, created by the Jesuit General’s J. P. Morgan at the Millionaire’s Club off the coast of Georgia on Jekyll Island, became the master of both the Northern and Southern Am erican people while they became its slaves .

His victories, in returning the world to the D ark Ag es , were won as the Professe d Jesuits obeyed their bloody Oath pursuant to their Council of Trent . It will be attempted to enumerate but a few. The Jesuits had decided that abso lutist socialist-communist military dictatorships (fascism) would replace abso lutist divine right monarchies, as the dictators were easier to control and replace than the Monarchs. The Holy Alliance was to be replaced with an International Intelligence Community controlling the leaders of all nations. Any attem pt at popular liberty or national sovereignty would be met with assassination, revolution or betrayal. To begin with, the core of the Holy Alliance of 1815 consisted of the Monarchs of Russia, Prussia and Austri a. But by 1914, all three dynasties had revolted from Rome and had departed from the purpose of the Holy Alliance. We shall examine the polic ies of the Romanoffs , the Hohenzollerns and the Hapsburgs . The Romanoffs were the first to revolt. In 1820, Alexander I had expelled the Jesuits from Russia for which he was poisoned. By 1882, Alexander II had emancipated the serfs, abolished the secret police and was about to sign a Constitution creating popular liberty. He had also broken with the Vatican, nullifying the Concordat with Rome entered into by Nicholas I . After six attempts on his life he was finally blown to pieces. Clearly the Orthodox Romanoff Dynasty must go, as it resisted the tyranny im posed by the Council of Trent and the Holy Alliance. So in 1917, the Jesuits, with their Federal Reserv e Bank, financed the Bolshevik Revolution resulting in the abdication and secr et escape of Knight of Malta, Tz ar Nicholas II , whose cousin was George V . The Rom anoff Dynasty begun in 1613 was history! The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945 "},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 480 The second m onarchy to revolt was the Hohenzollern . Wilhelm I , with his “Iron Chancellor” Bismarck , defeated the Jesuits’ Napoleon III during the Franco- Prussian War of 1870. Further, he enabled Victor Emmanuel II to take the Temporal Pow er from the Pope for nearly sixty year s. He then expelled the Jesuits from the Germ an Em pire in 1872, further enraging the Order! For this the Jesuits, ever true to their bloody Oath, attempted his assassination with their “nihilists” but failed. In 1907, Wilhelm II threatened to expel every Ro man Catholic priest from his Empire for interfering with his civil power regulating m arriage, having previously refused to be “the sword of th e Church” at the insistence of Pope Leo XIII ! Clearly the Lutheran Hohenzollern Dynasty must go! So in 1914, the Je suits, with their Grand Orient Masonic Lodge , criminally forced the World War on the Protestant Germ an Em pire and drove its Lutheran Kaiser into exile, resigning in 1918. We read from the pen of Wilhelm II himself: “The whole war is plai nly arranged between Engl and, France and Russia for the annihilation of Germ any, la stly through the conversations with Poincare in Paris and Petersburg, and the Austro-Serbian strife is only an excuse to fall upon us! God help us in this fight for our existence, brought about by falseness, lies and poisonous envy!” { 14 } Kaiser Wilhelm II continues his brave confronta tion with and exposure of the Order’s treasonous Germ an Grand Orient Ma sonic Lodge, while having been betrayed by his own Jesuit-controlled m other, Queen Victoria of England: “I have been informed that an important role was played in the preparation of the World War direct ed against the m onarchial Central Powers by the policy of the interna tional “Great Orient Lodge.” The distinguished Germ an Freem ason . . . said that in 1917 an international meeting of the lodges of the “Great Orient” was held, after which there was a subsequent conference in Switzerland; at this the following program was adopted . . . elim ina tion of the House of Hapsburg, abdication of the German Emperor . . . ” { 15 } And so it cam e to pass. The Hohenzollern Dynasty, begun in 1415, was also history. The last dynasty to revolt was the Hapsburg . The Jesuits had punished this fam ily during the French Revol ution with the beheading of Queen Marie Antoinette and later, in 1898, assassinated Elizabeth , the Em press of Austria. Why? Franz Joseph , her husband and Em peror brought to power during the Order’s Second French Revolution in 1848, had enraged the Jesuits. He revoked the Austrian Concordat with Rome nullifying the Pope’s Temporal Pow er . Austria of all places!

Clearly the Catholic Hapsburg dynasty must go! So, in 1908 Austria annexed Kosovo outraging the Orthodox Serbian people. In 1914, six years later at Sarajevo, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was murdered in his coach, shot point blank in the chest by Oskar Potiorek , the Governor General of Sarajevo. By 1918, the Hapsburg dynasty begun in 1278 wa s finally history along with the Holy Alliance of European Monarchs. Four years later in 1922, Jesuit priest Ignaz Seipel becam e Chancellor of Austria. (That same year, Jesuit Edmund Walsh , aided by the secret power of Jesuit Edw ard Ropp (1851-1939), installed Joseph Stalin as the Secretary of the Com munist Party. At the tim e Ropp was openly in exile in Warsaw, Poland, being the Archbishop of Mohylew in Russia (1917-1939)). Seipel – nicknam ed “ the merciless cardinal chancellor ” (although not literally a Cardinal) according to Edmond Paris in his masterpiece, The Vatican Against Europe , – destroyed every ounce of Austrian resist ance to Hitler’s Nazism paving the way for the Anschluss (the union of Germ any with Austria). The Order’s Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss , although pro-Mussolini and a dictatorial fascist, ignorantly opposed the Jesuit General’s Anschluss for which he was assa ssinated by the Com pany’s Austrian Nazis. But the suppression of popular liberty and national sovereignty, as well as the extermination of “heretics” while increasing the Pope’s Temporal Pow er over the nations, would continue. The Holy Alliance of Monarchs would be replaced with the Holy Alliance of the International Intelligence Communities , financed by the Knights on Wall Street and the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank. That unified Com munity would be born during the Second Thirty Years’ War and finely tuned during the Cold War. This perfected International Intelligence Community would be nothing m ore than the Jesuit General’s “ Holy Office of the Inquisition ” operating under different nam es while im plem enting the despotism of the Council of Trent . The various intelligence agencies would be controlled by the Pope’s Knights of Malta in New York, London, Moscow, Washingt on, D.C., Paris and Constantinople overseen by the Jesuit Genera l from his headquarters, Borgo di Santo Spirito , (“Village of the Holy Spirit” — what blasphemy!), in Rome. In addition to overthrowing the m onarc hies while protecting the apostate Protestant English throne, the Jesuits accom plished the following from 1914 to 1945: In 1914 The Jesuits brought Venustiano Carranza to power in Mexico, igniting the Mexican Civil War. Coupled with The Guns of August in Belgium, this year began the G reat Jesuit Vengeance of the Twentieth Century.

President Juarez then broke the Temporal Pow er of the Pope over Mexico and late r executed the Austrian usurper, Ferdinand Maximilian , in 1867, further enraging the Jesuits! Although the Order murdered our hero Juarez in 1872, the Mexi can people expelled the Jesuits in 1873. Can you im agine the unbridled rage of Satan’s Jesuit G eneral — the B lack P ope? Three years passed when in 1876 the Company punished the freedom -loving Mexican people. As the Jesuits had overt hrown the Second French Republic with the dictatorship of Napoleon III , even so they overthrew th e Mexican Republic with the dictatorship of general Porfirio Diaz . He readmitted the Sons of Loyola and for thirty years oppressed the people, robbing them of their land and liberty. But by 1910 the people had had enough of the Jesuit-controlled dictator’s “altar and throne.” A revolution broke out as a re sult of rigged elections and Diaz fled the country. Francisco Madero was elected President in 1913 but was quickly assassinated by the Jesuits who then installed another tyrant, Victoriano Huerta . This gave rise to the resistance of Pancho Villa in the north and Emiliano Z apata in the south — the Revolution’s greatest enem ies of the Jesu its! As a result, that same year Huerta was defeated and fled. The Mexican people would now begin to pay dearly for their desire to be free from the dictators controlled by the Jesu it priests. In 1914, the Order brought Venustiano Carranz a to power and used its Fourteenth Amendment American Empire to recognize his de facto rule! What a disgrace to us Americans! O ur two heroes warred with Carranza for six years until Za pata was murdered and Villa surrendered. From the years of 1910 to 1920 Mexico ran red with blood, the Revolution claiming one million lives — thanks to the Jesuits! From the years of 1921 to 1928 the great anti-Jesuit Presidents Alvaro Obregon and Plutarco Elias Calles , honestly attem pted to m aintain a liber al governm ent for the Mexican people. Calles at one time deported two hundred Spani sh Jesuit priests and had to subdue murderous Catholic gue rrilla bands leading the Cristero Rebellion . From the beginning of the revolution to this tim e Avro Manhattan writes: “The result was one of the m ost dead ly civil wars ever experienced, which cost Mexico nearly one million dead . The civil war was conceived, provoked, and openly carried out by the [ hierarchical ] Catholic Church, encouraged and financed by North Am erican Big Business [ just like the Bolshevik Revolution ].

Dear truth-seeker, this terrible suffering of our southern neighbors was a part of the Jesuit General’s Second Thirty Years’ War brought into Mexico. And why? Because the people of Benito Juarez broke the Temporal Pow er of the Pope, expelled the Jesuits and asserted their national sovereignty — three deadly sins! And how did the Vatican’s Jesuits punish Mexico? They used their “ Holy Roman ” American Empire – “ the Sword of the Church ” – to fom ent a bloody Civil War which ultimately cost the Mexican people ri vers of blood, its earthly treasures and national life. Today poverty-st ricken and dem oralized Mexico is the great haven for the B lack P ope’s International Drug Trade overseen by his International Intelligence Community m anaged by the Knights of Malta. In 1917 The Jesuit General in Rome, using the British Army, took Palestine away from the Turkish Moslem s paving the way for creating his Weizmann/Ben-Gurion Labor Zionist Israel and the rebuilding of Solomon’s Temple for the “ infallible ” Pope.

This enabled the Jesuits’ Rom an Catholic Croatian Usta shi to m urder hundreds of thousands of Orthodox Serbs during World War II. We read: “In June 1941, within a few days, m ore than one hundred thousand m en, women and children were either killed or tortured and massacred in their hom es, on the roads, in the fields, the prisons and the schools and even in the Orthodox Churches . . . we discovered babies who had been im paled on the pointed slats of an en closure, their sm all lim bs contorted by pain, like pinned insects.

Rom an Catholic Slovaks a nd Protestant Bohem ian Cz echs were also united creating Czechoslovakia. This later enabled the Jesuits’ Msgr. Joz ef Tiso to murder thousands of Protestant Czechs and Jews, deporting them to Auschwitz. 5. England was used to take Palestine away from the Turks. Th is resulted in the creation of a national hom ela nd for the Jews with the Balfour Declaration . During World War II the Jesuits would not allow the trapped European Jews to emigrate to Roosevelt’s American Empire, Churchill’s Great Britain or Stalin’s Russian Empire. Rather, the Order permitted many to enter Pale stine while the major ity perished in the Death Cam ps located deep in the woods of Rom an Catholic, Jesuit-controlled, Poland. In 1921 1. The agents of the Jesuits created the Council on Foreign Relations . The locations would be in the two m ost pow erful Roman Catholic Dioceses in the American Empire — New York and Chicago . The CFR would control the Em pire’s finance, governm ent, industry, religion, educa tion, and press. No one could be elected to the Presidency of the Un ited States without the Council’s consent, as the office would be a tool for the Archbishop of New York subject to “ the Vicar of Christ ” in Rom e. (One of the founders of the CFR also aided in the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank. He was Edward M . H ouse —“the holy m onk,” a Shriner Freem ason and agent of the Jesuit General.)

Loyola com manded: “ ‘The chief aim ’– thus runs the orde r – ‘of all our efforts ought to be to procure the confidence and favor of princes and m en in places of distinction, to the end that no one might dare to offer opposition to us, but on the contrary, that all should be subject to us . . . In short, the Jesuit order looks upon it as their hi ghest aim and object to seize upon the place of Father Confessor at a ll the different Courts and among all persons of distinction, well knowi ng that enorm ous power lies hidden therein; at the sam e tim e the m aking publicly known of this earnest striving after power m ust be carefully avoided, especially as regards those princes who operate som ewhat beneficially by their worldly might. Assurance must often and earne stly be given,’ proceeds the same above docum ent, ‘that it is not sought in any way to interfere with the affairs of the State, and it is recom mended to those who m ight be pleased to see them selves at the rudde r not to m ake it ev ident that they are m anifestly in that position. This ought rather to be effected through means of som e trusted third party , that then the opi nion of the rulers’ Father Confessor m ight be asked; when by this means all appearance of direct interference is avoided , then will be the reality of the influence all the more effectually secured.’ ” { 22 } [Em phasis added] Dear truth-seeker, the Jesuits at George town are the Father Confessors to the President. The truste d third party is the Council on Foreign Relations sending its advisor, usually the Secretary of State, who in 1963 was the traitor, Dean Rusk . 2. The agents of the Jesuits cr eated the Royal Institute fo r International Affairs in London. The RIIA , working in conjunction with the CFR at 58 East 68 th Street in New York, would continue to use the Protestant British Empire as the Order had directed it for the entire duration of the Nineteenth Century, known also as “the British Century.” The Empire, usurpe d by the Jesuits during the reign of King George III , would be guided by the B lack P ope through the English Monarchy and “ Smokin ’ Winston” Churchill as another one of the Orde r’s “Swords of the Church” during the Jesuit General’s Second Thirty Years’ War and his ensuing Cold War .

The Jesuits established their Inquis ition in Russia called “Communism,” appointing their Jew-hating, Rom an Catholic Grand Inquisitor, – Joseph Stalin – Secretary of the Com munist Party. Inde ed, it was com mon knowledge in Russia that “ Koba ” was a Roman Catholic. To the contrary , it was a well-kept secret that he, like Hitler , Mussolini and Franco had a Concordat with the Pope. It was also known that he, like President Clinton , was educated by the Jesuits. That training transpired in Tiflis, Georgia, just outside of Russi a, as the Tzar’s uka se of 1820, banning the Order from Russia, was not in force there. Of Stalin’s Jesuit training we read: “ Then [ 1894 ], being nearly fifteen, he entered the Tiflis Theological Seminary on a free scholarship . . . [ Stalin then states ] ‘In protest against the humiliating regime and the Jesuitical methods that prevailed in the seminary, I was ready to b ecome, and eventually did become, a believer in Marxism . . . [ The Jesuits ] are methodical and persevering in their work. But the basis of all their methods is spying, prying, peering into people’s soul, to subject them to petty torment.’ ” { 23 } 2. The Jesuits with the help of the Mafia brought fascism to Italy in the person of Benito Mussolini . In 1929 their absolutist dictator signed a Concordat with the Pope, restoring his Temporal Pow er along with a gift of 20,000,000 dollars in specie! In 1932 Mussolini gave military aid to the Order’s Masonic King Ibn Saud , then ruling the B lack P ope’s newly created oil bonanza called Saudi Arabia (the hom e of the late exiled Muslim “Butcher of Uganda,” Idi Amin ). This Italian Catholic Fuhrer, known as “ Il Duce ,” was declared the “ Defender of Islam ” and given the “ Sw ord of Islam ” by Libya in 1937, evidencing the B lack P ope’s rule of Mecca . Of Mussolini’s greatest crime and betrayal of the Italian people we read: “The signing was to take place in th e sam e room in which Charlem agne had been the guest of Leo III over a thousand years earlier . . . The 1929 treaty was actually a unity of three se parate agreements: the Lateran Pact , which provided for the creation of th e new State of Vatican City; the Financial Convention, which granted pa ym ents to the Church for the loss of its Temporal Pow ers [ massive grand theft ]; and the Concordat . . . According to the articles of the Late ran Pact, the State of Vatican City was set up as a sovereign entity . . . And Italy agreed to accept the Church’s canon law [ including the evil Council of Trent ] . . . The Concordat also stipulated that Pr otestant Bibles could no longer be distributed in Italy [ like Stalin’s Russia ], that evangelical meetings in private hom es were forbidden [ like Stalin’s Russia ], and that Catholicism was to be Italy’s official religion . [ Could it be that Sta lin ( the “son of a Jew” as indicated by his Georgi an name, Djugashvili) , like Mussolini, The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945 "},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 488 also had a Concordat with the Pope — secretly restoring ‘the Vicar of Christ’s’ Temporal Power in “heretic” Russia? ]” { 24 } [Em phasis added] Mussolini was simply carryi ng out the plans of his Jesuit confessor , Pietro Tacchi- Venturi . Pius XI , in praise of Il Duce and his regim e described Mussolini as, “ . . . the m an whom Providence allowed us to m eet.” { 25 } The “ex-Jesuit” sovereign Pontiff, Pope Pius XI , further stated: “Mussolini . . . will conque r all in his path. Mussolini is a wonderful man – Do you hear m e? – a wonderful m an! . . . The future is his.” { 26 } Thus Fascism and Jesuitism go hand in hand. Pierre van Paassen declared in 1939: “For today Rom e considers the Fascis t regim e the nearest to its dogm as and interest. We have not m erely the Reverend [ Jesuit-led ] Father Coughlin praising Mussolini’s Italy as ‘a Christian dem ocracy,’ but Civilta Cattolica [ “the purest journalistic or gan of Church doctrine” says von Dollinger ], house organ of the Jesuits, says quite frankly . . . ‘ Fascism is the regime that correspon ds most closely to the concepts of the Church of Rome .’ ” { 27 } [Em phasis added] In 1927 The American Branch of the Knights of Malta was established in New York, one of the founding m embers being John J. Rask ob , the head of General Motors and builder of the (Fourteenth Am endm ent) Em pire State Building, also in New York. In 1929 1. The Jesuits caused the Great Depression in the American Em pire with their short-seller, Knight of Malta, Joe Kennedy . This enabled the Jesuits’ FDR , through CFR member and “Jesuit of the short robe” Harry Hopkins , to begin the building of the Empire’s Military Industrial Complex with the socialist-communist New Deal, strongly prom oted by priest John Ryan and the secret Jesuit, Charles E. Coughlin . 2. The Jesuits established their Russian College in Rom e enabling scores of Jesuits to invade and rule the “ USSR ,” advising Joseph Stalin while following in the wake of the Nazi SS Einsat zgruppen (SS/SD execution s quads) during Rom e’s Nazi Crusade against “Russian Communism ” called “Operation Barbarossa.” The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945 "},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"Chap ter 37 489 In 1933 1. The Jesuits, using Knight of Malta, Joseph P. Kennedy , brought Franklin Roosevelt to power in Fourteenth Amendment America . We read: “Following a night of wild celebra tion, Kennedy set to work raising money for the cam paign . . . Beyond the $50,000 he him self contributed, it is said that Kennedy raised ove r $150,000 for Roosevelt in the space of four m onths . . .

Coughlin endorsed FDR : “[ In 1932 ] I coined the phrase ‘Roosev elt or Ruin’ . . . Today [ 1936 ] it is ‘Roosevelt and Recovery’ . . . ” { 29 } For: “No [ secretly admitted ] Jesuit dare write or publish any book which he has not the full and free [ or secret ] im prim atur of his superiors.” { 30 } Friends with Fordham ’s Robert I. Gannon , occult Jesuit Coughlin , the political fascist and econom ic socialist, had direct access to the White House. We read: “In early Septem ber [ 1935 ] Coughlin . . . received a phone call from [ Knight of Malta ] Joe Kennedy [ subject to Cardinal Hayes ] . . . ‘The Boss wants to talk to you.’ . . . An instant later Coughlin heard the distinctive voice of the [ Shriner Freemason FDR ] President of the United States at the other end of the wire say ‘Hiya Padre.’ ” { 31 } The Knights of Malta, led by Patrick Cardinal Hayes , put FDR , the thirty-third degree Freemason, in power creating an obliga tion to fulfill the desi res of the Jesuits ruling New York and Rom e. The person who would have continual access to FDR and act as his international agent duri ng World War II was the Jesuit-trained and future “American Pope,” Archbishop Francis Spellman . We read: The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945 "},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 490 “Thus . . . Spellman was offe red an unprecedented opportunity by Roosevelt that would necessitate le aving his archdiocese for m onths on end . . .

These skills and c onnections with people of power would come in handy when carrying out the Kennedy Assassination . 2. Upon being put in office by the Knight s of Malta, FDR’s first act of high treason was to recognize bloody Joe Stalin’s com munist “ USSR .” This enabled American businessmen to legally build Stalin’s Military I ndustrial Complex as they had illegally begun prior to FDR’s election! One of those m en was the Jew-hater and personal friend of the ex-Basilian (Jesuit-controlled) priest , Charles Coughlin , “Episcopalian” Irish Rom an Catholic Henry Ford . Of Ford and Gorki we read: “In May 1929, the Soviets signed an agreem ent with the Ford Motor Com pany of Detroit. According to its terms the S oviets agreed to purchase $13 million worth of autom obiles and parts before 1933 and Ford agreed to render technical a ssistance until 1938 to construct an integrated autom obile-m anufacturing plant at Nizhni-Novgorod. Actual construction of this plant was com pleted in 1933 by the Austin Com pany for production of the Ford Model-A passenger car and light truck . . . In brief, the Gorki plant , built by the Ford Mo tor Company and the Austin Com pany and equipped by num erous other U.S. com panies under the policy of “peaceful trade,” is today – and always has been – a major producer of Soviet arm y vehicles and weapons carriers .” { 33 } [Em phasis added] The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945 "},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"Chap ter 37 491 3.

A distinguished m ember of a Rom an Catholic family, he had received th e Order of the Grand Cross of the Knights of Malta from Pope Pius XI in 1928.

Billions upon billions of our money has been pum ped into Germany by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Rese rve Banks . . . On April 27, 1932, the Federal Reserve outfit sent $750,000, belonging to Am erican bank depositors, in gold to Germ any.

The Jesuits, using Knight of Malta Franz von Papen, brought Hitler to power in Catholic Bavaria’s Third Reich. Edmond Paris tells us: “ Franz von Papen thought of dictatorship.

The Jesuits, having put FDR into office with Knight of Malta Joe Kennedy , attempted to make the President a fascist, m ilitary dictator. To make this happen, the Jesuits used the Knights of Malta, John J. Rask ob in particular. Raskob was Chairman of the Board of General Motors and the major financier of the Jesuit- controlled Dem ocratic party. The plot was stopped by the great Am erican hero and two-tim e winner of the Medal of Honor, General Smedley Butler . We read: “Raskob was one of the 13 founding SMOM [ Sovereign Military Order of Malta ] members in the U.S. and wa s also the treasurer of the SMOM’s U.S. component when he was implicated in a military plot to seize the White House in the early 1930’s.

Shaw referring to his ‘butler’ as ‘Smedley’. ]” {39 } The full story is given by Jules Archer in The Plot to Seize the White House . In 1939 1. The Jesuits brought Generalissimo Francisco Franco the fascist to power after he destroyed the Spanis h republic that expelled the order in 1932. Rom e called Spain’s quest for popular liberty a “com muni st revolution.” One of our heroes, the converted ex-Jesuit priest, Alberto Rivera tells us: “In the last half of the 1800’ s Spain was going through political convulsions. Her Rom an Catholic m onarchy was tottering and the queen was dethroned in 1868 [ and the Jesuits were expelled ]. Spain became a republic, which only lasted for two years.

Spanish Rom an Catholics were showing their contem pt for the Vatican’s power (never dreaming what was in store for them).

The Pope hired severa l divisions of Moslem mercenaries to fight under Franco (a good Freemason) to kill all Roman Catholics, Jews and Protestants who opposed them . . . The Islamic leaders were contacted. They owed a debt to the Vatican for double-crossing Rom e over Jerusalem . [ The Seventh Century agreement was that the Pope through his agent s would help Mohammed in exchange for Jerusalem after his armies had taken it.

Unlike the Brits, Hitler’s military planners ‘ failed ’ to build a long range, thousand- mile bom ber to knock out Russian factories in the Urals. 1939 During the lull after the German i nvasion of Poland, and before the invasion of France known as “t he phony war,” the negotiations conducted by Admiral Canaris of Germ an Intelligence’s ‘Abwehr’ with England, through the Vatican as interm ediary using the Pope’s diabolical Jesuit confessor and future Zionist, Robert Leiber , were disclosed through a Swiss newspape r, contributing to their ‘ failure ’. 1939 - 40 Knowing Norway was the geographi cal key to maintaining Swedish neutrality, whose steel was critical to the continuing of the German War Machine, and although in possession of intelligence, Churchill, as Lord of the Admiralty, ‘ failed ’ to attempt to defend Norway for over six weeks , doing too little, too late, and so Germany gained control of the Swedish steel needed for a long, protracted war.

First, one military analyst has written that de spite the six-week delay in the invasion of Russia caused by the upris ing of the Serbian people, the Germ ans had in August-Septem ber of 1941 a ninety-seven percent chance of conquering the Soviet Union and would have done so had it not been for ‘decisions’ or ‘ blunders ’ made by Hitler from Berlin over the objections of his Generals. Sec ondly, the Germ an invaders were at first welcomed as liberators in much of the Soviet Union, notably the Ukraine. And, if they had inte lligently enlisted the support of the peoples, rather than brutalize them via the Jesuits’ SS, they would have defeated Stalin in spite of Hitler’s wrong military decisions. Thirdly, Stalin had several intelligence sour ces telling him Hitler was about to invade and refused to act to prepare the defense , allowing a quick, deep penetration by the Nazis and the de ath of millions of Orthodox Russians and Jews. With Hitle r’s subsequent ‘ failure ’ to follow up on this military position or bring the peoples enslaved to co mmunism to his side, the com bination of ‘ blunders ’ led to the m axim um death and The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945 "},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 508 destruction to the mostly Lutheran German Army a nd many millions of Orthodox peoples. The ‘ blunders ’ were m ade in obedience to and in accordance with the Jesuits’ Council of Trent and Extreme Oath . December 7, 1941 Much has been written about FDR’s foreknowledge of the attack plans of the Japanese and his ‘failure ’ to warn the Admirals at Pearl Harbor to insure that the United States could get into ‘the war’ on the side of England against Hitler. The significance of a very basic point is always neglected in these discussions. The United States declared war on Japan after Pearl Harbor, not on Germany ! If Hitler, whose forces had just been bogged down and iced-in by the Ru ssian winter, had not proceeded to commit one of the rashest acts in the history of world diplom acy, by unilaterally declaring war on the United States , Roosevelt would have been hard put to drag Am erica into the war in Europe, which was not seen as necessarily closely connected to the War in Asia. Hitler got nothing for Germ any out of his ‘foolish ’ declaration. He ‘ failed ’ to even attem pt to get Japan to declare wa r on Russia in the East, though that, by opening up a second front , would have m ade m uch m ore likely a Germ an victory in the West over Ru ssia. It was a staggering mistake , strongly indicative that Hitler danced to someone else’s tune — the tune of the Jesuits’ ‘infallible’ Pope with whom he had a Concordat. 1943 Churchill talked about “the soft underbelly” of Europe but instead directed the Allies up what amounts to “a porcupine ridge” in Italy. A rapid invasion could have been m ade through Montenegro and Serbia, which, being the only active guerilla war in Europe, was already holding down fifteen to twenty Germ an Divi sions, and was without the general uprising, which would have oc curred immediately upon an Allied assault. This, however, would have brought the war to a close in early 1944, and would have put Eastern Europe in th e hands of the West, neither of which was intended . Instead, Italy was invaded in about the hardest and m ost ignorant way. If victory had been the object, the Generals would have gone for the capital, Rom e , landing am phibiously on any num ber of close s hore points and driving straight to the city, taking the enem ies’ natural base and m opping him up from there. Circling Sicily to take its capital, then letting the German army escape by boat unim peded to the m ain peninsula [ as Meade allowed Lee to escape from Gettysburg unimpeded ] was only the beginning of the The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945 "},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"Chap ter 37 509 follies – ‘ the blunders ’ – tragic to so many a llied soldiers and their families (including Shriner Freemason Bob Dole).

Secondly, there was the comp lete intelligence ‘ breakdown ’ on the side of the Allies that ‘ failed ’ to recognize that the beefed up and returned Germ an Arm y was about to atte mpt the breakthrough known as ‘the Battle of the Bulge’.

Unlike the Treaty of Westphalia ending the First Thirty Years’ War, the agents of the Jesuits controlled the negotiations at Yalta and Potsdam ending the S econd Thirty Years’ War. The Protestant British Empire , having founded m odern missions, including the China Inland Mission , was fragmented and would be de stroyed after World War II. It was time to apply the Jesuits’ Hegelia n Dialectic worldwide.

The Am erican Em pire would head the West and the Russian Empire woul d lead the East. Both sides would be financed by the Jesuits’ International Ba nking Cartel centered in London and New York, the Federal Reserve and Chase Manhattan Banks in particular.

Those pur poses were not only the building of the Russian War Mach ine and its intellig ence community, the KGB , with its opposite num ber, the CIA espionage state in Fourteenth Amendment America , but the using of the staged opposition between these two “superpowers,” in attempting to force nations into alignment with one or the other, creating a United Nations world police state in the hands of the B lack P ope . We must not forget that by the end of the Cold War the Protestant British Empire – so hated by the Jesuit General’s “ infallible ” Pope – had been destroyed and sixty-five nations of the free world had been betrayed into the Jesuit- controlled Inquisitiona l dungeon of atheistic Communism. These merciless crimes created worldwide anti-Americanism – another purpose of the Cold War – as we were and continue to be hated for allowing Rome’s CFR-controlled , socialist-communist , Am erican governm ent to spread and maintain the Jesuits’ Holy Office of the Inquisition . What scare tactic could be used to forc e the peoples of the West into accepting as fact the great “ Communist Threat ” in the East thereby justifying “ the Cold War ”? It was the splitting of the atom creati ng a nuclear device that, when carefully detonated, unleashed m ass dest ruction. This device, given to both sides , would justify the establishment of that cr im inal organization called “ the United Nations ” in New York. It would also coerce the peoples of the world into sacrificing their national sovereignties into the hands of a World Authority — the P apal Caesar . Towards the end of World War II, the Je suits, with their Manhattan Project, detonated a nuclear device.

The hoax of “ mutual airborne nuclear war ” was successfully created. Upon the destru ction of Nagasaki and Hiroshim a, the devastation was st rongly prom oted by Archbishop Spellman’s m edia m oguls, Knight of Malta Henry R. Luce and Knight of Malta Frank Capra . The mass destruction “proved” the im pending doom of a “nuclear holocaust” justifying the creation of a new “peace-keeping” world authority – the treasonous United Nations – that will one day control Jerusalem ’s Holy Mount while overseeing th e rebuilding of a glorious new Third Temple — for the Pope! But the facts prove otherwise. At the time the only nuclear devices ever detonated were stationary and on the ground! None had ever been dropped by aircraft in testing . We will grant that objects, represented to the world as being “atom ic bom bs,” were dropped over Hiroshim a and Nagasaki, and that atom ic explosions followed, as atte sted to by one of the pilots of Enola Gay while sailing with the author’s mother years later in the San Francisco Ba y. But pilots and crews would have no way of knowing whethe r it was the objects dropped by them that exploded, or different objects already inst alled and in place at ground level. Further, according to engineer, author and pilot Captain Bruce L. Cathie in his Harmonic 33 , nuclear detonations can only occur at certai n places on the earth (called “grid points”) and at certain times. After an el aborate discussion he concludes: “Until I am informed offici ally otherwise, I will main tain that the destruction of an atom depends on the geom etric position of the tri ggering device, and the geom etric position of the Sun [ called “a window of opportunity” ]. Is it possible to fight an atom ic war on this basis? The whol e thing would be com pletely illogical . . . the bom b has to be dropped on a pinpoint geom etric position and during a certai n instant of time, if it is to explode. [ Dear truth- seeker, were the “bombs” dropped on Japan merely ”dirty” uranium and plutonium-laced magnesium flash devi ces coordinated with technical ground teams below, one of which was located at the Jesuit House in the middle of Hiroshima and from where the undergr ound switch was thrown ( after which all five Jesuits emerged having survived the blast) , detonating the atomic device just as it was done at the prov ing grounds in the s outhwestern United States only a few weeks before? Is Ed win Corley’s fictional The Jesus Factor really true, that nuclear devices cannot detonate if they are in motion? ]” {6 } Thus, an airborne therm onuclear war destroying m ankind is a technological impossibility, and a pure fiction of Henry Luce’s Cold War propaganda .

Major Jordan, curious by natu re, opened various briefcases and cartons, and saw various words he was not familiar with on various papers: uranium , cyclotron, proton, neutron, cobalt, and plutonium . In addition, Jordan discovered va rious reports from ‘ Oak Ridge , Manhattan District ’ (it was the ‘Manhattan Project’ in Oak Ri dge, Tennessee, where the American scientists were developing the plans fo r the atom ic bom b) containing phrases like ‘energy produced by fission.’ Jordan also discovered ‘ . . . at least three consignments of uranium chemicals . . . nearly three quarters of a ton.

It was then that he realized that he had been witness to the transfer of the materials and plans for construction of Russia’s atom ic bom b. And this occurred in 1943 . Major Jordan’s charge s were corroborated by a [ non-fictional ] novel written by James Roosevelt , the son of Franklin Roosevelt , in 1980.

Meanwhile, the nation needed a scape goat for the treason of giving nuclear secrets to Stalin. Blaming the Jews, the Jesuits repeated the Dreyfus Affair using their darling Shriner Freem ason, J.

Gregory Agagianian , Patriarch of the Catholic Rite of the Arm enian Church [ was elevated by the ex-Jesuit Pope Pius XI ] to the Patriarchate in 1937, a post which he held for 25 years thereafter . . . In 1946, anti-Com munist Pope Pius XII m ade him a Cardinal . . . Cardinal Agagianian was expected to play a major role during the developing Cold War . . . The reason was that Agagianian was the top expert on the Soviet Union, Com munism , and the Orthodox Church ; . . . He was of Armenian origin, but a Georgian by birth. He had known Com munism at first hand, having lived three difficult years as a young priest in Tiflis, Georgia , whilst the Bolshevist Revolution was raging. He spoke fluent Russian . . . Agagianian was also considered very special by Stalin him self [ as both Joseph Stalin had been educated by, and Grigory Rasputin had been advised by the rector of the Or der’s “Orthodox” Tiflis Theological Seminary, the Jesuit Spiritual Coadjutor and Orthodox Bishop Hermogen ], the Cardinal having had the dubious dis tinction of attending the sam e Jesuit seminary [ though “Russian Orthodox” in name ] in Georgia as Stalin had done. This was a sm all, but significant, fact , . . . ” { 9 } [Em phasis added] Indeed it was a significant fact! For in 1946 Pope Pius XII mad e Gregory Agagianian the Cardinal for the Russian Empire the same year he m ade Francis Spellman the Cardinal for the American Empire. What Agagianian was to Stalin with his KGB , Spellman was to Truman with his CIA . Both Cardinals were loyal to Jesuit General Jean-Baptiste Janssens as much as Pope Pius XII who had appointed them on the advice of his Jesuit confessor, Robert Leiber , who was later replaced by another Jesuit and pro-Zionist confessor, Augustin Cardinal Bea .

So the Jesuits’ Cold War raged through the Fifties and Sixties, overseen by Agagianian in the East and Spellman in the West, murdering millions of “heretics and liberals” pursuant to the Jesuit Oath and the evil Council of Trent . It is the same story in China, as th e Order had a score to settle for their expulsion in 1783. True to form , the Jesu its used the Am erican Em pire’s Seventh Fleet to block Chiang Kai-shek’s planned invasion of Mainland China thereby enthroning ( via the Black Pope’s CIA ) “ Chairman Mao ,” who then expelled eight thousand Protestant m issionaries. This merciless dictator, whose favorite pastim e according to his wife was raping young Ch inese virgins, murdered at least fifty million “heretic” and “liberal” Buddhist Ch inese, including those who read the B ible or advocated popular liberty. He, as the head of the Jesuit Inquisition in the Far East, would also be responsible for the murder of millions in Thibet, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, and Cam bodia in conjunction with American B-52 bombers! To ensure the success of this Jesuit Inquisition against the Buddhists, the Order used Truman , a creature of the Jesuits’ evil Tom Pendergast’s Democratic machine, to relieve General Douglas MacArthur of com mand during the Korean War. As a result, the Am erican Em pire would never se riously resist the Je suits’ mass murder in the Far East. The Em pire ’s new policy would be “no win wars” during this age of “violent peace,” further indebting the Am erican people to the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank and destroying all confid ence in their so-called “elected” leaders. In creating the false enemy of “Soviet and Ch inese Communism” the Jesuits attained one of their ecum enical goals. It united Catho lics and Protestants in the West, as it was perceived as a threat to them both. To give the appearance that Communism was a threat to Catholicism , the Rom an Catholic nations of Poland a nd Hungary were put behind “the Iron Curtain.” To give the appearance that Communism was a threat to Protestantism – and it was and still is – the Protestant nations of East Germ any and the Baltic States were put under Stalin’s boot, shipping thousa nds of Lutheran “heretics” to Siberia.

Under their comm unist-fascist dictators there would be no room for the free circulation of the P rotestant B ible or the rise of popular self- governm ent. This is why the Hungarian Revolution instigated by Allen Dulles and the CIA, was crushed in 1956, the Jesuits punishing freedom -loving Rom an Catholics with their Russian Army. This is why the Jesuits used their CIA to betray freedom- loving Rom an Catholic Cubans at the Bay of Pigs. The Da rk Ages had been restored in the East as reflected in the doctrines of the Jesuits’ Council of Trent and Holy Alliance . The Jesuits’ fascist-socialist-comm unist-military dictators around the world were enforcing these doctrines of condem ning the circulation of the B ible , freedom of speech, freedom of the press a nd freedom of conscience and gun ownership . At the same time the dictators secretly established the Temporal Pow er of the Pope. The Jesuits’ Cold War of attrition, while suppressing the rise of popular government worldwide, murdered millions of “heretic” Buddhists, Orthodox, Protestants, Baptists and Je ws along with the freedom -loving “liberal” Roman Catholics. The m urder of Rom an Catholic priests of other Orders, as well as a few freedom -loving Catholic people, was necessary to pe rpetuate the illusion that Stalin’s Soviet Communism was anti-Jesuit/Catholic (having “imprisoned” or rather stationed a ruling American Inquisitor , Jesuit Walter Ciszek , to m anage Siberia’s Gulag Archipelago for fifteen years overseen by Cardinal Agagianian , and later returned to the U.S. under John F. Kennedy ) while purging the priesthood of its “liberal” element. While Protestants and Catholics in the West were being united against the “Jewish Anti-Christian Communist Conspiracy” in the East, “the Cold War” justified the building of huge military industrial co mplexes and massive intelligence agencies on “both sides”! The military complexes would be subject to the intelligence communities and both sides w ould be financed by Vatican -controlled international banks, such as Chase Manhattan.

Who would take Jerusalem away from the Moslem , som ehow destroy the Dome of the Rock and rebuild Solomon’s Temple — the ancient dream of the Popes havi ng launched the savage and disgraceful Crusades? There is only one Or der that would attem pt such an undertaking. It is the Society of Jesus com manded by its sovereign god — the B lack P ope! Therefore, the General and his staff pl an their work and then work their plan . Realizing that the Protestant British Empire was the most powerful military force in the world, he gained control of the m onarchy in the person of King George III no later than 1800. Having abso rbed the King, his Court and his Bank, the Order then harnessed the power of the world’s most penetrating intelligence network — the British Secret Intelligence Service . By 1856, the Order com pleted its Crim ean War having used Great Britain, France, Turkey ( Shriner Freemasons controlling Islam ) and Sardinia to defeat Russi a and her Orthodox political power in Palestine. By 1918, the Order, financed by its Federal Reserv e Bank and Bank of E ngland, will have com pleted the first phase of its Second Thirty Years’ War — World War I , including the Great Influenz a Pandemic of 1918 having globally killed from forty to one hundred million people. During that time the Jesuit General will have used his British Intelligence Service and Law rence of Arabia to unite the Arabs of Palestine in driving out the Ottoman Turks. He will have also used General Allenby to drive the Turkish Moslem s out of Jerusalem — a major accomplishment! And how would the Company maintain control of Palestine and Jerusalem won by its British sword? Enter the House of Rothschild with the Jewish Masonic Zionists. In 1918, the Jesuits would cause their Zionists in England to issue the Balfour Declaration declaring Palestine to be the new hom eland for “The Wandering Jew.” Could it be that afte r nineteen hundred years of Ro me’s crusades, inquisitions and pogroms the Jewish Race would now have a place to call its own? Or was Labor Zionism a setup for the greatest betrayal the Jew ish Race has ever k now n? Having secured Palestine for the Jews , how would the Jesuit General m ake them willing to return? Ah, he would raise up Adolf Hitler and, during the high point of his Second Thirty Years’ War (1940- 1945), he would purge Europe of its “perfidious Jews,” so called by the Jesuits’ Secret Instructions of the Jesuits as well as Rome’s priests for cen turies.

Using the same Vatican Ratlines through which the Nazis were escaping from the Allied authorities in Europe ( illegally, many were brought into America through the com plicity of Spellm an’s Iri sh Rom an Catholic im migration czar, Edward M O’Connor ), the Jews began to flood into their ancient hom eland. In 1945, the United Nations was form ed in Je suit-controlled San Francisco. In 1948, Rome’s Masonic Zionists declared Israel to be a sovereign nation. This declaration was acknowledged by President Truman , the Order’s Shriner Freemason, in eleven minutes! And thanks to Cardinal Spellman rallying his South Am erican dictators, Israel was admitted into the United Nations. Of Spellman we read: “Instead of taking a public stand, he [ Spellman ] would operate behind the scenes by ‘personally calling on every S outh Am erican country to cast their votes for Israel ’ . . . There was little doubt that Spellman knew U.N. delegates . . . After a bitter struggle, Israel was admitted to the United Nations by a vote of thirty-seven to twelve .

Our lesson is that Rome, the two-headed Janus , always has two policies. The first is her open but false policy , intended for public consum ption. The second is her secret but true policy , intended to be pursued. In th is light, what true policy is Pope John Paul II following – the man who worked for I. G.

Now that Zionist Israel was a member of Rom e’s United Nations, she needed a secret police to keep her politicians, like Yitz ak Rabin , in line. So the Nazi who helped to set up the CIA was also used to train the Mossad . He was the Pope’s Knight of Malta, Reinhard Gehlen .

This Jesu it Inquisition would be merged into the American Empire’s CIA . We read: “ General Reinhard Gehlen , Hitler’s chief intelligen ce officer against the Soviet Union, had struck a deal with the Americans (called OPERATION SUNRISE) . . . the principal negotiators were Allen Dulles and William Casey of the OSS, Sir William Stephenson for the British, and SS General Karl Wolff . . . Their negotiations enabled Gehlen to bring his entire apparatus ‘ unpurged and without interruption, into the service of the American superpower ,’ according to [ Heinz Hohne and Hermann Z olling ] the authors of ‘ The General Was A Spy ’ . . . ” { 17 } [Em phasis added] Further, “ Allen Dulles had been instrum ental in arranging, with Gehlen [ and with SS General ‘Gestapo’ Heinrich Muller , who met with Dulles in Switzerland, was ushered into the U.S. and given citiz enship, worked for the CIA, retired with rank of general and died in 1973, unbothered by any further investigations ] for this most unusual convers ion of one of Hitler’s most sinister generals into an officer in th e U.S. Arm y, but the details of Gehlen’s personal surrender and subse quent flight to the United States – in General Eisenhower’s own VIP aircraft – were arranged by U.S. Army officers . . . It is important to note the active role of these U.S. Army Officials in this unprecedented move of Hitler’s own inte lligence chief, Gehlen, directly into the U.S. Arm y as an officer by a special act of the Congress.” { 18 } [Em phasis added] To make the evacuation of Nazis possible, enabling them to escape Europe, the Vatican established intricate escape routes — the Vatican Ratlines . As the priests helped John H. Surratt escape from the United States after the Lincoln assassination, so they helped thousands of Nazi s to escape from Europe after the Second Thirty Years’ War . This would only be po ssible through a unified, international intelligence community in control of the superpowers’ military machines. This community was and is controlled by the Jesuits in Rome, as they have ruled “the Eternal City” since their restoration in 1814. Of the Ratlines we read: “ Unholy Trinity is the story of the Vati can’s underground Nazi-sm uggling networks, code-named ‘Operation Ratline’. The first hints of the existence of the Vatican’s Ratlines emerged in Americ a. This was perhaps appropriate, as The Jesuits – 1945 - 1989 "},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 542 it was U.S. intelligence which gave th is name to the Holy See’s escape networks . . . The first half of the book tr aces the flight of Nazi war crim inals to America after World War II. The evid ence confirms that a small cabal of Vatican officials coordinated the mass evacuation of Fascist fugitives to Argentina, Australia, Canada, and of course, the United States. Under the direction of Pope Pius XII [ whose bloody World Wa r II reign would be whitewashed by Jesuits Pierre Blet , Angelo Martini , Burkhart Schneider with the aid of Pius' former confessor, Robert Leiber ], Vatican officials such as Monsignor Giovanni Montini (lat er Pope Paul VI) supervised one of the greatest obstructions of justice in m odern history .” { 19 } [Em phasis added] (Dear truth-seeker, Pope Paul VI , the secret Cold Warrior but open Com munist, would oversee Cardinal Spellman’s assassination of President Kennedy .) And who were the key players in this , the m ost m onstrous scandal of the century? Two of them were Knights of Malta, William J. Casey and James Angleton . A third, Reinhard Gehlen , received an award from the Knights of Malta. We read from the National Catholic Reporter : “Central Intelligence Agency Director William Casey , also a Knight of Malta . . . who declined to comment on hi s association with the order . . . In 1948, SMOM gave its highest award of honor, the Gran Croci Al Merito Conplacca, to General Reinhard Gehlen , who ran Adolf Hitler’s spy operation against the Soviet Union . . . SMOM gave another award, the Croci Al Merito Seconda Classe, in 1946 to James Jesus Angleton , who ran counter-espionage operations in Rome for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the forerunner of the CIA. Angleton [ who advocated an American military Crusade against the Is lamic Peoples of the Middle East during the 1970s ] later went on to head what has been described as the CIA’s ‘ Vatican desk’ , but he declines to comment on this activity.” { 20 } [Emphasis added] The International Intelligen ce Community was in place and working. Jesuit- trained William J. Casey, (who later controlled Oliver L. North and FEMA , now the National Homeland Security Agency), Angleton and Gehlen (now working with the Agency’s dem on-possessed form er head of the Gestapo, Heinrich Muller ) were key players in controlling western intelligence, never dealing a true blow to Russian Communism . In the East, the Jesu its also had a m ost notorious agent. He was KGB agent and Joseph Stalin’s superior, Prince Anton Turkul . This infamous Turkul was also Reinhard Gehlen’s old friend and subordinate. Another Knight of Malta born of Russian nobility, Turkul , along with Myron Taylor and Franz von Papen , was loyal to the B lack P ope overseeing the Papal Caesar in the Vatican and therefore further entrenched Stalin in power by eliminating “ Koba’s ” enemies. We read: The Jesuits – 1945 - 1989 "},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"Chap ter 38 543 “Both the CIA and Gehlen belatedly agreed that Turkul was himself a Soviet agent . . . even Sir William Stephenson agreed that Turkul ‘was in fact a Soviet agent’ . . . No one reinvestigated Turk ul’s ‘unimportant’ years in Rome . No one reexamined his role in the Ratline . . . No one remembered the mail inter cepts showing that Tur kul was coordinating the ‘Yugoslav em igration’ networks. No one suspected a Soviet connection inside the Vatican .” { 21 } [Em phasis added] And why not? Because the Vatican’s formal position was public denunciation of Russian Communism. But the facts of previous chapters are clear. The Bolshevik Revolution fulfilled Rome’s ancient objec tives against the Orthodox Church in Russia. The Jesuit Order was readmitted by Lenin in 1922 after having been form ally expelled forever by Alexander I in 1820; the FB I and CIA gave the KGB high technology to m aintain Sta lin in power; the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank financed the Bolshevik Revolution and built Russia’s Military Industr ial Complex; the Jesuits’ “Episcopalian” Irish pro-Rom an Catholic Henry Ford was used to build Gorki; Stalin was given tons of military hardware during Lend-Lease; Stalin was given the nuclear device (bom b) by the Jesuits’ CFR , it controlling FDR and the American Military; and later, Knight of Malta William J. Casey was instrum ental in using the American Empire’s Export-Import Bank to finance the building of the Kama River truck factory thereby m echaniz ing the Soviet War Machine. Why then should we be surprised to see Prince Anton Turkul fulfilling the desires of the Vatican while eliminating Stalin’s enem ies? (Turkul’s ancestor – Privy Councillor Turkul – negotiated Russia’s Concordat with P ope Pius IX in 1847!) Because the Jesuit Superior General Ledochowski (1915-1942), Vicar Generals Alcessio A. Magni (1942-1944) and Norbert de Boynes (1944-1946), and Superior General Janssens (1946-1964), for whom Turkul worked, were the m asters of both the Vatican (since the Order’s restoration in 1814) and the Kremlin (since the Order’s re-entry in 1922)! Loftus gives us the facts; the author gives the interpretation : “ General Prince Anton Vasilevich Turkul [ was ] the greatest com munist agent of them all. In additi on to penetrating the Holy See [ Turkul deceiving Jesuit Intelligence? How ridiculous! ], General Turkul was a com munist double agent in German, Japanese, British, French and American intelligence. [ All the intelligence agencies worked together — including Russian intelligence. ] It was Turkul who sp lintered the Anti-Bolshevik ‘em igre’ groups after World War I [ He further entrenched the Jesuits’ Bolsheviks ( Lenin and Stalin) in power ], sent Hitler false information that crushed the Nazis on the Eastern fronts [ Remember, Hitler did not permit the German Army to capture Mosc ow.

Did this not fulfill the con tinuing policy of the Jesuits’ Holy Alliance by crushing all movements towards popular liberty and national sovereignty while furthering the P apal Caesar ’s universal Temporal Pow er in governing every nation on earth from Jerusalem ? ].” { 22 } An additional connection between Western and Eastern Intelligence Communities was another Knight, Kim Philby . Like Turkul , he was of noble blood. As an English royal, he was a British SI S agent, an American CIA agent and a Russian KGB agent simultaneously! When it becam e too evident in England, he “defected” to Russia and participat ed in the Kennedy Assassination via Lee Harvey Oswald’s connection with the KGB. Another connection to Philby was Anthony Blunt and his Cam bridge spy-ring called “ The Magnificent Five ” of which Philby was a member. Through Blunt , Russian Intelligence was linked to the British Secret Service, the British Royal Family, the Wh ite House and American Intelligence. Sir Anthony , who died in 1988 was, like Philby , a British Knight, KGB kingpin and loyal to Sir Stewart Menz ies , past head of the British SIS. Both Blunt and Philby were obviously linked to Va tican Intelligence through Prince Angelo de Mojana — the Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Mojana , holding the status of a Cardinal until his death in 1988, “ . . . is also member of the Pa lazzo Giustiniani Freemasonic Lodge, which practices the Ancient and Accepte d Scottish Rite of Great Britain. He was said to have been imposed as Grand Master by the British Secret Intelligence Services on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II . . . ” {23 } These three men, Blunt , Philby and Mojana (not to m ention Guy Burgess , Donald Maclean , and John Cairncross who were the other three m embers of the Cam bridge Spy Ring known as “the Magnificent Five”), were Papal Knights tied to the Knights of Malta and Shriner Freem asonry.

Being both a Rom an Ca tholic and a fanatical anti-Communist, James V. Forrestal became the Empire’s first Secretary of Defense or more correctly, “the Secretary of Offense.” Housed in the Pentagon – that “Shrine of War” (designed after a pentagram em ployed in the sym bol of the Baphomet and in the worship of Satan , being the Egyptian SET ) whose constructi on was overseen by Archbishop Francis Spellm an’s Colonel Leslie Groves (the controller of the Order’s Manhattan Project ), and which was subseque ntly dedicated to the restoration of the Pope’s Temporal Pow er – the Secretary would oversee the Crusades of his m asters in accordance with the Jesuit General’s wicked and evil Council of Trent . In 1949 an Arch-Catholic and oath-bound Knight of Columbus of the Fourth Degree , became the Secretary of the American Navy. Of this sinister character we read: “ Mr. Francis Matthews was nominated Secretary of the Am erican Navy.

And what did these three agents of the Pope – a foreign king – advocate? An attack on the non-com munist Orthodox population of Stalin’s “Communist Russia” with a “preventive atomic war.” This was a formal call for an American-led Crusade, “ . . . as the London Times som berly described ‘what alm ost am ounts to a crusade of Christendom ’ and what the Manchester Guardian bluntly called ‘the Pope’s blessing for a preventive war.’ ” {5 } Knowing that an aerial nuclear attack by the Em pire’s Air Force was impossible , knowing that the only wi nner of World War II was Stalin’s Russia, why the call to war? Knowing that the Jesuits used Hitler to prevent the German Army’s Protestant Generals on the Eastern Front from capturing Mosc ow (even though aided by Catholic enlistments from Italy, France, Ireland, Belgium, Holland, Latin America, the United States, Portugal and Spai n’s Blue Division during “Operation Barbarossa”), could Americans expect “The Cold War of Liberation” to succeed in eliminating Russian Communism while the Knights of Malta on Wall Street and the Federal Reserve Bank were financing it? Cl early, the Cold War, led by the American Empire’s most powerful Roman Catholic Co ld Warriors had another purpose in view. That purpose for Vietnam was fulf illed. During the Crusade called “ the Vietnam War ” nearly two million “heretic Buddhist s” were murdered and the nation was destroyed, the Am erican Air force having dropped m ore bom bs than in World War II. On its ruins was erected a unified Vietnam led by a “former” OSS agent and Soviet-trained, fascist-communist dict ator loyal to the Pope of Rom e — Ho Chi Minh . Saigon was renam ed “Ho Chi Minh City.” Of Ho Chi Minh’s alliance with the P apal Caesar , Avro Manhattan writes: “ Ho Chi Minh began before World War II to m aneuver for a com munist Vietnam.

Using the Am erican Navy under the com mand of a Knight of Columbus , and using Ho Chi Minh advised by a Catholic Bishop (unnam ed by Avro Manhattan), the Jesuits m oved thousands of Catholics in the North to resettle in the South.

We read: “ President Ngo Dunh [ Dinh ] Diem of South Vietnam was a practicing Catholic who ruled South Vietnam with an iron fist. He was a genuine believer in the evil of communism and the uniqueness of the Catholic Church. He had originally been ‘planted’ into the presidency by Cardinal Spellman and Pope Pius XII. He transformed the presidency into a virtual Catholic dictatorship , ruthlessly crushing his religious and political opponents.

He sought the annihilation of a political enemy — Communism ; he sought to destroy a religious enem y — the Buddhists ; and he installed Jesuit absolutism in the country — Roman Catholic Fascism . And who was the chief prom oter of the Vietnam War? It was the great Cold Warrior, Francis Cardinal Spellman , as he controlled the Am erican press through Henry R. Luce and later the American military through President Lyndon Johnson . Of Spellman’s allegiance to the Vatican and his pa rticipation in the war we read: “He was active in persuading the U.S. to select Diem and support him as president of South Vietnam . He was made Vicar Ge neral of the U.S. arm ed Forces and called the GIs the ‘ Soldiers of Christ ’ [ of the Pope ] in his frequent visits to the Vietnam war front.” { 9 } [Em phasis added] But Kennedy , the new American Commander-in- Chief, posed a problem . He followed the pro-com munist policy of Pope John XXIII (who, along with Pope Paul VI and Pope John Paul II, was a high-level Freem ason a nd Rosicrucian according to William Schnoebelen – a form er Freem ason and author of Lucifer Dethroned , published in 1993 and offered by Ch ick Publications – who, like Alberto Rivera , had been a Bishop of the Old Rom an Catholic Church based in Utrecht, Holland) and not the secret policy of Jesuit General Janssens who prom oted the Cold War. Kennedy withdrew the CIA advisor from Saigon and abandoned Diem . Fleeing to the Jesuits’ Church of St. Francis Xavier (the Jesuit “m issionary” to the Far East) in Saigon for protection, Diem and his m urderous brother Nhu were turned over to Buddhist Generals and prom ptly executed. Ah, dear truth-seeker, we must never forget the law of the Church written by the Spanish Jesuit, Luis de Molina , in 1600: “Priests may kill the laity to preserve their goods.” { 10 } This m ust have infuriated Spellman ! His Inquisitor was dead, the CIA was expelled and his Crusade was in se rious trouble. This m eant that Spellman looked bad and was in big trouble with his Master in Rom e! So, “the Lion” in New York’s “little Vatican” marshaled his for ces and eliminated his opposition – President Kennedy – so fanatically despised by his secret m aster — the B lack P ope ! Vietnam went on to be called “ Spelly’s War .” And what was the cost of that Crusade? For the American Empire — shame and defeat , including fifty-eight thousand dead and one hundred and twenty thous and post-war suicides, m any of whom were Rom an Catholics. Rome’s created dialectic so su ccessfully used in World War II – Catholic (Jesuit) Fascism versus Atheistic (Jesuit) Com munism – produced the desired results.

As the Order – in control of the British Empire – had conducted the drug trade during the Nineteenth Century, even so its General – in control of the Am erican Em pire – would continue to expand the Trade during the Twentieth Century. Using th e Knights of Malta with the CIA and the Mafia as their agents, the Jesuits would make trillions, fu rther weakening the nations and increasing their financial power so as to bring the world closer to the universal rule of the Pope — from Jerusalem . Of the drug trade and its beginnings we read: “In 1715, the British East India Comp any opened up its first Far East office in the Chinese por t city of Canton and began trading in opium . Between that tim e and the First Op ium War against China in 1840 . . . the dope trade took over Britain. The vehicle was the 1783 near coup d’etat by Lord Shelburne (the British prime mi nister who concluded peace negotiations with the American colonies after Yorktown) . . . known as “ the Jesuit of Berkeley Square .” Shelburne’s ruling com bination centered on the East India Com pany, a group of Scottish merchants, and an alliance on the continent with the chivalric order of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem and the Society of Jesus . . . Since the orig inal Jesuit mission had established itself in Beijing in 1601, the Society of Jesus had held the key to the Far East Trade — including the dope trade .” { 11 } [Em phasis added] After centuries of progress we see: “Alfred McCoy had written The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia (published in 1972) as part of his Ph.D. thesis requirem ent.

For the Mafia and the CIA had worked together since the late forties with their s uppliers in the Far East in building Jesuit General Janssen’s drug trade. President Kennedy , if permitted to fulfill the policies he pursued, would have ended the General’s sinful business, intended to secretly finance his International Intelligence Community with its secret underground Military Industrial Complexes — the Holy Office of the Inquisition . How do we know this? President Kennedy began to prosecute powerful Mafia Dons, he sought to break th e CIA “into a thousand pieces ,” and he began to end Cardinal Spellman’s Crusade in the Far East — the Vietnam War .

We read from Loftus ’ and Aarons ’ The Secret War Against the Jews , “It was Menzies who ordered British tr oops to help the Vatican truck the Nazi treasure into hiding . . .

American, Russian and Israeli in telligence merge with the pairs Gehlen and Turkul ; and Angleton and Philby .

The British SIS and Soviet KGB/GRU were united in Philby . The CIA, Mossad and KGB were united in Angleton . This gallery of traitors , all of them being Papa l Knights, unified the International Intelligence Community merging at Borgo di Santo Spirito , the com mand post of Jesuit General Janssens just outside the Vatican walls in Rome. With this interlock of men loyal to th e General of the Jesuits, the Cold War would be waged but kept under control, that is, from becom ing a full-scale war between East and West. The deceived patriots of both sides would be kept in check or elim inated if attem pting to truly “win” th e Cold War or expose the truth about the intelligence men at the top. The murder of the staunch Roman Catholic, Opus Dei member and CIA Director, William Colby , after forcing Angleton to retire, is a classic example of their policy. The Order will terminate its own disobedient tools! In 1959 Fidel Castro , the Rom an Catholic Com munist (who, according to som e Cubans, raped two nuns while in Colom bia for which he was castrated, as he is never seen with a wom an) wa s put in power with the help of the Jesuit-controlled CIA. Educated in youth and advised when he becam e Cuba’s dictator, we read of the Jesuits shaping his m ind and controlling his actions: “Fidel and Raul were sent to Santiago de Cuba [ St. Ignatius of Cuba ] to study under the Jesuits at the Colegio Lasalle, and then to the Colegio The Jesuits – 1959 - 1962 "},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"Chap ter 40 569 Dolores, also Jesuit . . .

We read: “ ‘After the Matthews articles which followed an exclusive interview by the Times [ Henry R.

From that tim e on arm s, m oney and soldiers of fortune abounded. Much of the Am erican press began to picture Castro as a political Robin Hood. Also because Batista was the dict ator who unlawfully seized power, American people assumed Castro mu st, on the other hand, represent liberty and democracy.

A powerful Knight of Malta, W. Barron Hilton , owned the chain of hotels around the world.

Barron Hilton of the hotel chain; . . . ” { 16 } Freemason Castro (according to a Cuban Fr eem ason who personally saw 33 rd degree Freem ason Castro in a lodge in Hava na) was further entrenched in power by the CIA. It was the high com mander of “ the Company ,” Allen Dulles , who organized the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. The “failure” of the attem pt to overthrow Castro resulted in the decimation of the Rom an Catholic patriots of Cuba. During the invasion Dulles was conveniently out of town and not at his duty station, as if he knew it would go sour. Two Kn ights of Malta were involve d in the set-up and failure of the invasion. One of them was Roberto Alejos Arz u . Alejos becam e the Honduran Knights co-chairm an in 1985, of whom we read: “Alejos – a sugar and coffee grower who let the CIA use his plantations as training grounds for the 1960 [ 1961 ] Bay of Pigs i nvasion of Cuba [ its secretly purposed failure having been intended by the CFR’s Director of the CIA to further entrench the power of the Order’s Fidel Castro ].” { 17 } The Jesuits – 1959 - 1962 "},{"pageNumber":571,"pageContent":"Chap ter 40 571 Further, “During and after the period of the Bay of Pigs, Alejos Arzu reported that he worked with Irangate pr incipal, Theodore Shackley [ CIA ], then running “Operation Mongoose” to assassinate Fidel Castro from the JM/WAVE station in Miami, Florida . . . ” { 18 } The other CFR/Knight of Malta was Gustavo Cisneros of whom we read in 1987: “Vice-president of the Venezuelan Association of the SMOM. The Cisneroses are the overlords for the Ibero-Am erican cocaine connection in Venezuela, whose special role emphasize s ‘washing’ part of the billions in annual narcotics proceeds that go through that country . . .

Curiously, through the World Finance Corporation the Cisneros are linked to the Bay of Pigs invasion team , which quickly turned to drug trafficking to finance operations and get rich quick. But Os waldo Cisneros’ wife Ella Fontanals de Cisneros, is a Cuban whose brother , Jose’ Fontanals Perez , currently sits on the board of directors of the Banc o Nacional de Cuba in Havana, where he is an econom ic adviser to Fidel Castro .” { 19 } [Em phasis added] Dear truth-seeker, the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion was pure betrayal! This is what Napoleon did to his Grand Arm y in Tzarist Russia, what Hitler did to his Germ an Arm y in Soviet Russia, and what the CIA did to the Roman Catholic patriots of Hungary in 1956. The betrayal re sulted in the elim ination of all resistance to Castro within Cuba, securing the island as a staging base for future use by our invaders. This could never have happened had not the Je suits controlled both sides. Now, the Jesuits had to suppress the Am erican and Cuban enem ies of their mouthy, little puppet Castro who were outside of Cuba. So their CIA “confirm ed” the existence of Soviet “nuclear missiles” in Cuba creating the paranoia of a possible “nuclear first strike attack.” Kennedy dem anded their rem oval and prepared for a joint Am erican and Cuban-exile invasion from Florida. (We strongly believe from our argum ents of previous chapters that airborne nuclear war has never been a real threat to the nations, the Jesuits controlling both “super powers.” We know that the Jesuits’ CFR in control of FDR gave Stalin the nuclear device in 1943.

The Jesuits in control of Khrushchev (who declared that the CIA and the KGB ought to be com bined “because we use the same people” ) dispatched a Russian fl eet (built with American technology and financed by the Jesuits’ Fede ral Reserve Bank) towards Cuba. This resulted in “ the Cuban Missile Crisis ” in 1962 creating m ore paranoia. Kennedy and Khrushchev struck a secret deal resulting in no invasion , the Russian fleet returning hom e. Like the Hungarian uprisi ng in 1956, this stage-play and betrayal inflam ed the fury of all involved. The low-level CIA agents not “in the know” with Angleton were enraged against Kennedy ; they thought he had deliberately betrayed them . Mafia soldiers not “in the know ” with Cardinal Spellm an’s Mafia “Com mission” were enraged against Kennedy , as they had lost their casinos in Havana. The patriotic Cubans were enraged against Kennedy perceiving him as again refusing to end Jesuit-trained Fidel Castro’s merciless, absolutist, Jesuit- controlled dictatorship. The Jesuits, perfectly creating the agitation , were now ready to eliminate their disobedient son a nd brother Knight, President Kennedy . Betrayed by Skull and Bo nes memb er McGeorge Bundy at the Bay of Pigs and deceived by his Secretary of State – the Cardinal’s Dean Rusk – during the Cuban Missile Crisis, Kennedy the victim now had enough serious en emies among the infuriated CIA, FBI, Military Intelligence and Mafia foot soldiers to be boldly assassinated in broad daylight. The Intelligence Community began th e “black operation” called “ Operation Mongoose .” Its purpose was to further exhaust and eliminate Castro’s enemies, precisely as Knight of Malta Oliver L. North and Knight of Malta William J. Casey , with their “aid to the Contras,” elim inated all resistance to the Com munist governm ent in Nicaragua, John Cardinal O’Connor having warm ly em braced Daniel Ortega . The CIA secretly attacked Cuba with regular raids, crop burning and counterfeiting its currency justifying Castro’s devaluation and creation of a ne w currency further im poverishing the Cuban people. But “Operation Mongoose” was ultimately suppressed by President Kennedy, which resulted in two things. First, it sealed Kennedy’s fate. The assassins within the Ca rdinal’s Network were eager to eliminate him. Lastly, Castro’s Jesuit despotism was sealed and for the last forty years he has been the perfect puppet of Rom e. He has vi ciously suppressed the free circulation of the B ible as well as any popular m ovem ent towa rds “liberal” self-governm ent – where the people can be more than slaves – pursuant to the Jesuits’ wicked and evil Council of Trent and their “ Holy Alliance .” One final question . Why would the Jesuits go to such extremes to enthrone and maintain Castro in power and thereby close Cuba to a free press and American tourism ? What possible benefit would th e island of Cuba – th at poverty-stricken hellhole specializing in cigars and sugar – give to the long-term plans of the im perialistic Sons of Loyola?

If the Soviets were so powerful in 1962 why did they not dem and that we Am ericans abandon the Base to Castro ? Could it be that the Cardinal’s Council on Foreign Relations , in control of the Navy’s top Ad mirals, are using it as a secret supply line, am assing weapons and equipm ent underground for the future invasion of the American South, filled with Protes tant and Baptist communities providing the majority of the world’s gospel-preaching m issionaries? As Protestant East Prussia was destroyed by the Jesuits’ Grand Inquis itor and his Red Army, so will be the Protestant South – filled with the Jesuit General’s occult Freemasonry – unless we repent and return to serve the risen Son of God, the L ord Jesus Christ! And if this is true, when the Jesu it-trained, Rom an Catholic Com munist, Fascist, bastard son of a Nazi and absolute military dictator, Fidel Castro , dies, Cuba will never be free unless we invade it with a Bible-reading Protestant arm y free of Jesuit com manders and intrigue. Would it not be wonderful to give back Cuba to the Cuban people having suffered exile, im prisonm ent and death at the hands of Castro and his advisors — those Sons of Loyola!

Now who betrayed those brave m en, Cubans and CIA agents attem pting to overthrow tyranny in Cuba with the Bay of Pigs invasion? According to Col.

Plus, it infuriated the lower levels of the CIA, the FBI, the Mafia and M ilitary Intelligence, as they believed Kennedy to be the culprit behind the betray al. Only the few at the top really knew what happened. And why did this happen? Because prior to “the sacrifice of the mass” at the Bay of Pigs, the Jesuits knew that Kennedy was not going to escalat e their “Crusade” in Vietnam, as it was intended to ignite the present multi-billion dollar drug trade. So having enraged the rank and file of the Am erican Empire’s Intelligence Community and having angered every Mafia fam ily, th e Jesuits used the leaders of those communities, commanding hundreds of foot soldiers , to murder the President. The Jesuits used their Cardinal of internati onal intrigue from “the Powerhouse” in New York, Francis Spellman , to oversee the assassination and cover-up. The leaders Spellman used were Knights of Malta, Shri ner Freem asons and Mafia Dons. Dear truth-seeker, this is why the Vatican’s Jesuits, w ith the blessing of their “ infallible ” Cold Warrior and Rom an Caesar, Pope Paul VI , used their foot soldiers under the com mand of that Rom an Senator, Francis Cardinal Spellman , to assassinate the Em pire’s only Rom an Catho lic President and “brother” Knight of Colum bus, John F.

According to Robert Groden’s most excellent video, JFK: The Case For Conspiracy released in 1993, the gunshot entered above the right eye . While traveling through the President’s head, the bullet blew out and away the flap of flesh and bone from the right temple area and exited the rear of the head. Thus, the path of the trajectory leads directly to the driver , the shot from “the Grassy Knoll” serving as a deliberate distraction for the crowd. Fearing for her life and terrified, with her flight survival instinct in full control of her will, this is why Jackie Kennedy sought to get out of the Presidential limousine by moving away from the murderous driver.

Thus the Vatican threw off its mask a nd openly recom mended the continuance of the cold war — pending the hot one.” { 1 } Edmond Paris, 1964 French Historian The Vatican Against Europe Vatican II began in October of 1962 and lasted until December of 1965. There were many surface changes to the Roman Ca tholic Institution. The Mass would no longer be perform ed in Latin, Pr otestants were no longer called “ heretics ” but rather “ separated brethren ” and the priests’ form al “ prayers ” for “ the perfidious Jews ” ceased. After Rome’s Second Thirty Years’ War , the Jesuit masters wanted to deceive the world into believing that the P ope was for peace and religious liberty. But in substance nothing changed. The Pope was to continue to uphold the Jesuits’ bloody Council of Trent . We read from the Documents of Vatican II : “The salient point of this Council is not, therefore, a discussion of one article or another of the fundam ental doctrine of the church which has repeatedly been taught by the Fa thers and by ancient and m odern theologians, and which is presumed to be well known and familiar to all. For this a Council was not necessary . But from renewed, serene, and tranquil adherence to all the teaching of the Church in its entirety and preciseness, as it still shines forth in the Acts of the Council of Trent and First Vatican Council [ i.e. we must still kill the “accursed heretics” and the Pope is still “infallible” ] . . . The substance of the ancient doctrine of the deposit of faith is one thing, and the way in which it is presented is another [ i.e. we must carry out the anc ient goals of killing “heretics and liberals,” accursed and condemned over one hundred times by the Order’s “sacred Council,” but in another way ].” { 2 } [Em phasis added] The Jesuits – 1963 "},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"Chap ter 41 577 In pursuing Rom e’s quest to establis h an international World Governm ent under the Pope of Jesuit m aking, the Counc il called for an end to the Cold War by calling for universal disarm am ent, including the abolition of private gun ownership , and the end of war in general. Again we read: “THE TOTAL BANNING OF WAR, AND INTERNATIONAL ACTION FOR AVOIDING WAR: It is our clear duty, then, to strain every muscle as we work for the time when all war can be comp letely outlawed by international consent.

Hence everyone m ust la bor to put an end at last to the arms race, and to make a true beginning of disarmament . . . ” { 3 } Pope John XXIII followed the Jesuit General’s open and future policy laid down in the Council. We read: “Pope John XXIII (1958-63) reversed the anti-Communist policies of his predecessor, Pope Pius XII. He commenced dialogue with the com munists of Europe and signaled Soviet Russia that the Vatican would be ready to cooperate with her. He fathered the Vatican II Council and ecum enism .” { 4 } But while pursuing the policy of ending the Cold War, Pope John XXIII suddenly “died” of a rapidly progressing cancer (according to Gordon Thomas , an Irish journalist, as revealed in his m asterpiece on Israel’s Mossad, Gideon’s Spies ) in July of 1963. And who replaced him? It was the secret Cold Warrior and kingpin, having operated the Vatican Ratlines, Cardinal Montini who becam e Pope Paul VI . Under Pope Paul VI the Cold War would continue but President Kennedy persisted in following the pro-comm unist, anti-Cold War leading of Pope John XXIII . Therefore, like the Pope, President Kennedy also “died” and was replaced with the Cold Warrior Fr eem ason and servant of Cardinal Spellman , President Lyndon Johnson — who, on his deathbed for a job well done , was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church just like Thaddeus Stevens . As the Cardinal of Lorraine in league with the Jesu its, used the military of Queen Catherine de Medici of France to m ake war on the French Pr otestants in 1572, so would Cardinal Spellman , in league with the Jesuits, use the military and Commander-in-Chief of the American Em pire to m ake war on the Vietnam ese Buddhists in 1964.

Because both sought to end the Cold War prematurely! The International Intelligence Community, the Drug Trade and the Russian War Machine were not yet fully developed. The Hoax of the Moon Landing ( www.m oonm ovie.com ) led by 33 rd Degree Freemason Neil Armstrong , had not yet been perpetrated on the peoples of the world, as the true purpose of the Space Program was to put spy satellites into orbit enabling Rome’s Intellig ence Communities to monito r the actions of all the inhabitants of the earth, while enforcing the evil Council of Trent . The Order’s old enemy, the White, Celtic-Anglo-Saxon Calvin istic Protestant and Baptist Middle Class people of the North Am eri can Em pire, had not yet been amalgamated and communized or broken in their will, morale, hea lth and finances. Thirty years of “ relentless war, secretly or openly, against all heretics, Protestants and Liberals, . . . to extirpate and exterminate them fr om the face of the whole earth ” had not yet taken its deadly toll. For many other reas ons it clearly was not tim e to end the Pope’s Cold War . Thus, the Vatican’s open but false policy was to end the Co ld War while its secret but true policy was to continue that most suc cessful of Inquisitions in making “ the risen Vicar of Christ ” the Theocratic Universal Monarch of the World — enthroned in Jerusalem ’s rebuilt Temple as “ that man of sin ”! Francis Park man , one of America’s greatest Nineteenth Cent ury historians, sustains our conclusion: “The Jesuits, then as now , w ere the most forcible exponents of ultramontane principles. The church to rule the worl d; the Pope to rule the church; the Jesuits to rule the Pope: such wa s a nd is the simple programme of the Order of Jesu s, and to it they have held fast, except on a few rare occasions of misunderstanding with the Viceregent of Christ.” { 5 } [Em phasis added] Indeed, the great and learned M.

The Jesuit General has been the m ost powerful m an in the world since Pius VII restored the Order or “Com pany” in 1814. Because of the Order’s suppression by Pope Clement XIV in 1773, the Jesuits began the Ba varian Illum inati with one of their soldiers, Adam Weishaupt . The Illuminati ab sorbed the Jewish House of Rothschild creating a colossus of wealth around the world, subject to the Jesuit General. With this financial arm in plac e the Jesuits then ma de war on the Vatican including the Pope, the Rom an Catholic Mona rchs of Europe a nd the Order of the Dominicans.

Bonaparte also punished the Knights of Malta, driving them from their island hom e to Russia. Shortly before Napoleon’s deliberate loss of the Battle of Waterloo , the Jesuit Order was revived and em erged suprem e am ong secret societies. It controlled the Papacy, the Knights of Malta, Islamic Shri ner Freem asonry, Opus Dei and later, in Fourteenth Amendment America , the Knights of Colum bus and the Mafia. It is this Network that controls every nation more or less, restoring and maintaining the Pope’s Temporal Pow er worldwide. In the American Empire it controls Wall Street , the m ajor corporate m onopolies, the Federal Reserve Bank , the Council on Foreign Relations – it com manding the President and every departm ent subject to him – and thus, the country’s Military Industrial Complex . The Network or “Fraternity,” also called “t he Octopus,” controls all shipping ports and overland trucking with the Mafia’s Longshoremen and Teamsters . In control of organized crime, including white slaver y and the drug trade, it makes billions annually, the CIA and Mafia working together. The Jesuits , being the great agitators of States, control the Press, the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, the anti- com munist John Birch Society, and the Black Muslim s co mposing the pro-com munist Nation of Islam — all through the Egyptian Mystery Religion of Isis and Osiris culminating in high-level, occult Freemasonr y com posed of ninety degrees according to a form er eighty-eighth degree Freem ason, Michael J.

As “ the American Pope ” operating out of “ the Little Vatican ” in New York – the wealthiest Dio cese in the world – his power extended to the Mafia’s “ Commission ” first revealed by Joe Valachi in The Valachi Papers .

They included Presidents Roosevelt, Truman and Johnson. I t also included Allen Dulles , the Freem ason and Director of the CIA (who had a direct line to the KGB in the Krem lin ), who was also a m ember of the Council on Foreign Relations. Dulles’ nephew, Avery Dulles , became a powerful Jesuit at Fordham University and was recently, at the age of eighty-two, created a “Cardinal.” Others were J. Edgar Hoover , who made it a practice to recr uit FBI agents from Jesuit (and Mormon) Universities, many of whom became Knights of Columbus. Others were Gerald Ford and Chief Justice Earl Warren of the Warren Com mission, as Warren was responsible for the illega l imprisoning of thousands of Japanese Americans in mid-West concentration camps during Wo rld War II. Of the Masonic influence involved in Cardinal Spellman’s oversight of the Kennedy Assassination we read: “Mason Lyndon Johnson appointed Mason Earl Warren to investigate the death of Catholic [ Knight of Columbus ] Kennedy.

They were Robert Moses , the Freemason Bernard M. Baruch and bosom friend of Freemason John D. Rockefeller Jr ., Abraham Beame and Charlie Silver , called “Spelly’s Jew” by John Cooney, the author of The American Pope , of whom we read: “And then there was . . . ‘Spelly’s Jew’, who raised funds and provided political and economic contacts in the Jewish community [ Jesuits and Talmudic Rabbis working together ] and also becam e a deputy m ayor.” { 9 } After the assassination, during the Warren Com mission’s cover-up, Spellman would be served by another Jew who, for his good behavior, would be rewarded with a lifetim e in the U.S. Senate.

Aided by the Jesuits, the Cardinal’s Knights in high finance and intelligence kept him inform ed as to any movement afoot that would pose a threat to Rom e’s power in her “ Holy Roman ” Fourteenth Amendment American Empire , further enabling him to uphold his Oath as a Cardinal! Dear truth-seeker, based on the foregoing conclusion, if there was a threat to the life of our Rom an Catholic Knight of Columbus , President John Kennedy , who would have fulfilled the Vati can’s bidding, whose father, Joseph P. Kennedy , was a prominent Knight of Malta having aided “Jesuitical Po litics” by causing the Great Depression, by putting FDR in office and by endorsing the Jesuits’ Adolf Hitler (whose War Machine was built by the Jew-ha ting, “Episcopalian” Irish pro-Roman Catholic, Henry Ford , and financed with gold from the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank), would not the Cardinal have been ordere d to use all his power to prevent it? During the last forty years of fascist tyra nny in Cuba has the Jesuit-trained, Rom an Catholic Com munist Castro , with am bassadors to the Pope’s Sovereign State of Vatican City and to the headquarters of th e Sovereign Military Order of Malta, ever been overthrown by any faction including the CIA? (An old school mate and friend of the author was told by John Hickey , a deceased CIA assassin that, upon having Castro in his sniper rifle sights and ready to delightfully pu ll the trigger, he was given the order to abort!!!) The Jesuits, in co mmand of Cuban and American intelligence, would never perm it it! So it would have been with Kennedy had he, like Castro , obeyed his Jesuit masters. Clearly, it was no less than a Cardinal Spellman who could oversee the Kennedy assa ssination while possessing the power to cover it up. That power was wielded through his Knights of Malta for the benefit of his m aster, Pope Paul VI , whose confessor was the pro-Zionist Jesuit Paolo Dez za (who had converted Chief Rabbi of Rome Israel (Eugenio) Z olli to Catholicism, taking his “Christian” nam e from Pope Pius XII !) and whose m aster in tu rn was the General of the Jesuits, Jean-Baptiste Janssens , whose master in turn was Satan . And why did Satan , who “ was a murderer from the beginning ,” use his vast array of brainwashed slaves to com mit this crim e of the century? Dear truth-seeker, Satan ’s great dream is to “ be like the Most High ” — the L ord Jesus Christ . With an insatiable desire he craves to be worshipped by all nations in Jerusalem , as he sits on his throne inside Solomon’s rebuilt Temple . Jealously protecting the office of the Papacy for the last seventeen hundred years, he intends to indwell a resurrected Pope “ whose mortal wound was healed . ” He will become the Eighth Roman K ing called “ the beast .” Using the Militia of the Jesuit Gene ral in control of the Pope and his Hierarchy, it is to this evil end that he actively works every political event under his im mediate control, including the assassination of President Kennedy .

But after the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion President Kennedy changed . Due to his betrayal by the Jesuits’ Council on Foreign Relations in the person of McGeorge Bundy , he sought to “break the CIA in to a thousand pieces.” Why? Because the CIA was the teeth of the Council on Foreign Re lations, the enforcer of the Em pire’s secret governm ent. Of this relationship Victor Marchetti tells us: “It was in such an atm osphere of restiveness and doubt, on a January meeting in 1968, that a small group of former intelligence professionals and several other members of the cult of intelligence met to discuss the role of the CIA in U.S. foreign policy, not at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia but at the Harold Pratt House on Park Avenue — the hom e of the Council on Foreign Relations.” { 2 } And no wonder, for Allen Dulles , the Director of the CIA in 1961 had been a CFR memb er fo r y ears just like Bundy , who was Dulles’ tool to wreck the Cuban invasion that Kennedy had approved. So, Kennedy secretly fired Dulles – the darling of the Vatican’s Jesuits – while openly he accepted hi s resignation. Kennedy then appointed John A. McCone to replace him . McCone was one of Spellman’s Knights and would prove to be one of the President’s assassins, resigning in 1965. Meanwhile, President Kennedy seriously resisted the power of the Vatican’s Jesuit General Janssens . First, according to The Washington Post , he determined to destroy the CIA — that agency which Truman described after the Kennedy Assassination as “ a symbol of sinister and my sterious foreign intrigue. ” We read: “Kennedy did fail in his attem pt to ga in full control of the CIA and its major partners in the Defense Department. It was the most crucial failure of his abbreviated presiden cy. He recognized his adversary during his first term , and as he related confidentially to intimate acquaintances, ‘When I am reelected, I am going to break that agency into a thousand pieces.’ He meant to do it too, but the struggle cost him his life.” { 3 ) Secondly, President Kennedy sought to end the Viet nam War. The way in which he sought to end it was de scribed in a report, entitled, “ ‘Mem orandum for the President, Subject: Report of McNam ara-Taylor Mission to South Vietnam ’ . . .

But those policies were reversed. “On Novem ber 22, 1963, the governm ent of the United States was taken over by the superpower group [ the Order merely using its American Intelligence Community to remove one of its Presidential creations ] th at wanted an escalation of the warfa re in Indochina and a continuing military buildup for generations to come.” { 5 } And who was responsible for the reversal of President Kennedy’s policies after his brutal assassination? It was the Jesuits’ CIA , controlled by one of Cardinal Spellman’s Knights of Malta, John A. McCone . We read from the book First Hand Knowledge written by CIA agent and Kennedy assassin, Robert D. Morrow : “At 8:30 AM, on Saturday, the 24 th of Novem ber, 1963, the lim ousine carrying CIA Director John McCone pulled into the White House grounds. McCone was there to br ief the President and the slain President’s former aide, McGeorge Bundy [ the one responsible for the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion ] . . . He was also th ere to transact one piece of business prior to becoming invol ved in all the details entailed in a presidential transition — the signing of National Security Memorandum 278 [ in fact 273 ], a classified document which im mediately reversed J ohn Kennedy’s decision to de-escalate the war in Vietnam . The effect of Memorandum 278 would give the Central Intelligence Agency carte bl anche to proceed with a full-scale war in the Far East , a war that would eventually involve over half a million Am ericans in a life and death st ruggle without the necessity of Congressional approval. In effect, as of Novem ber 23, 1963, the Far East would replace Cuba as the thorn in America’s side [b ecause the Jesuits had given Cuba to Castro! ]. It would also create a whole new source of narcotics for the Mafia’s worldwide markets . (As mentioned earlier, Victor Marchetti , the former Deputy Director to Richard Helms , claim ed in his book, The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence , that Air America, the CIA’s proprietary airline, was used as a carrier for opium.)” { 6 } [Em phasis added] The Jesuits – 1960 - 1963 "},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"Chap ter 43 593 Dear truth-seeker , there you have it! The Vatican’s Jesuits with their tool, Cardinal Spellman , using one of his Knights of Malta, John A.

Every segm ent of Rom e’s Fraternity benef ited. The Vatican’s Federal Reserve Bank made trillions financing the Military Industr ial Complexes of both the East and West; the International Intelligen ce Community grew to unbelie vable proportions united at its apex in the Vatican; th e pharmaceutical industry made billions; the Mafia made billions with the drug trade; Rome’s oil companies and Arab nations made billions; President Johnson and his Texas oil men made billi ons as the tankers of Rome’s shipping tycoons unloaded their crude in both Saigon and Hanoi; and, millions of “heretics” were m urdered throughout South east Asia. The blindly patriotic people of Fourteenth Amendment America were further reduced to economic and political slavery with its White Protestant Mi ddle Class further destroyed along with eighty thousand vets committing suicide , m any of whom having suffered untold tortures. Thirdly, President Kennedy al so resisted the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank and its monopoly fiat money , properly called “indulgences.” Colonel Gritz writes: “When Kennedy . . . called for a retu rn of America’s currency to the gold standard, and the dism antling of the Federal Reserve System — he actually m inted non-debt m oney that does not bear the m ark of the Federal Reserve; when he dared to actually exercise the leadership authority granted to him by the U.S. Constitution . . . Kennedy prepared his own death warrant. It was tim e for him to go.” { 7 } Indeed it was, time for him to go. L ike Lincoln resisting the policies of the Radical Red Republicans leadi ng to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment , so Kennedy resisted the policies of the Council on Foreign Relations leading to the war in Vietnam . Neither could be allowe d to serve a second term . John F. Kennedy , unlike any President since Lincoln , truly resisted “the superpower group,” Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty’s The Secret Team (so described by Papa l Knight of Malta Daniel Sheehan , the chief legal council of the Jesuits’ Christic Institute , and called “ The Octopus ” by the murdered freelance writer Danny Casolaro ), known in history as the Society of Jesus . May we Am ericans never forget the courage that President John F. Kennedy showed in refusing to bow to Francis Cardinal Spellman , knowing full well that his countrym en would never apprec iate the pain and national tragedy he sought to prevent. Indeed, his severa l acts in resisting Jesuit tyranny were Profiles In Courage , forever wounded in the house of his friends , who continue their betrayal of the last bastion of freedom in the worl d — an Am erica founded on Protestant and Baptist-Calvinist liberties.

The hundreds of works covering the Kennedy assassination can be reduced to a few si mple facts. These facts viewed in the context of the prev ious chapters lead us to the “ Lion ” in his “ Den of Iniquity ” that had the power to execute the murd er and successfully cover it up. That Lion was the Cardinal of New York and his Den of Iniquity was St. Patrick’s Cathedral, “the little Vatican,” and home base of the American Branch of the Knights of Malta. From the death of Cardinal Spellman in 1967 until now (2003), the succeeding “Lions,” having kept th e assassination covered up, were Cardinal Cook e (himself a Knight of Malta) and Cardinal O’Connor , a Knight of Malta and form er Chaplin during Spellm an’s Vietnam War, and later, a Navy Admiral . ( O’Connor must have known Admiral Edward Kenney , the Surgeon General of the Navy, as well as every detail of the President’s de liberately botched a nd covered up autopsy overseen by JFK’s physician, Admiral George G. Burk ley , at the Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland.) Edw ard Cardinal Egan is presently the Archbishop of New York and will continue the Great Jesuit Cover-up. Of Cardinal Spellman’s power in 1963 controlling the American Empire’s inte lligence and military structure we read: “Spellman . . . the Military Vicar of the American armed forces . . . was also the unofficial link between th e Pope and John Foster Dulles, the U.S. Secretary of State [ whose son, Avery Du lles, is a Jesuit ] and, therefore, the Secretary’s brother Allen, head of the CIA . . . The Catholic Church in the USA [ controlled by the Jesuit Order ] is a force in the Pentagon, a secret agent in the FBI and the . . . prime mover of . . . the Central Intelligence Agency .” { 14 } [Em phasis added] Knowing that President Kennedy was not going to escalate the Vietnam War, the Intelligence Community began to prep are for his assassination. Raised a Lutheran, Lee Oswald was chosen to be a patsy . . . As a CIA agent, he had been sent to Soviet Russia by Allen Dulles in 1959, supposedly as a defector. Knowing that the CIA (OSS) and the KGB (NKVD) had worked toge ther during World War II, Oswald apparently took a vacation for nearly two years. During that tim e he m arried a Russian woman, Marina , whose uncle was a KGB Colonel, Vasili Khritinin . When he returned to the Am erican Em pire in 1962, without being formally debriefed , he associated with CIA agents Howard Hunt , Frank Sturgis , David Ferrie (a former Catholic Priest), Guy Banister , Count George DeMohrenschildt (a personal friend of Jackie Kennedy’s father) and Clay L. Shaw . Oswald was a CIA agent and was related to a Jesuit. Emanuel Josephson tells us: “An interesting angle is pr esented by the Lee Oswald involvem ent. His cousin is reported to be a Jesuit pr iest. And it is a matter of record that Lee Oswald was invited to address the Jesuit College in Springhill, Alabama, on the subject of his activities, two weeks before the Kennedy Assassination. The Jesuit involvem ent closely parallels that in the Lincoln Assassination.” { 15 } The Jesuits – 1963 "},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"Chap ter 44 601 Jim Garrison clearly proved the CIA was involved in the assassination through Clay L.

To m e am ong the m ost significant revelations were . . . the confirm ation by both Victor Marchetti and Richard Helms that Clay Shaw had been an agent of the Central Intelligence Agency .” { 16 } [Em phasis added] And who was the Director of the CIA in 1963? It was Knight of Malta John A. McCone . Prior to that McCone had been a defense contractor who had form erly headed the Atom ic Energy Com mission. La ter in 1970, he was a board m ember of International Telephone & Telegraph Co mpany (IT&T) while rem aining a CIA consultant. Marchetti tells us: “(ITT board member who later adm itted to a Senate investigative com mittee that he had played the key ro le in bringing toge ther CIA and ITT officials was John McCone, direct or of the CIA during the Kennedy adm inistration and in 1970, a CIA consultant.)” { 17 } Cardinal Spellman’s soldier and Director of the CIA, John A. McCone , participated in the Kennedy Assassination. Jim Garrison and others have proved that the FBI was also involved in the assassination . He writes: “I already had concluded that parts of the local Dallas law enforcement establishment [ controlled by Cardinal Spellm an’s Dallas Bishop Thomas K. Gorman ] were probably im plicated in the assassination or its cover-up. But now I saw that the highly respected FBI was implicated as well.” {18 } Cardinal Spellman had two agents in the FBI. The first was the Shriner Freem ason and brother Cold Warrior, J. Edgar Hoover . According to John Loftus , Hoover had cooperated with the Vatican Ratlines resettling Nazi war criminals in the predom inantly Rom an Catholic Northeas t United States. Why should he not cooperate with Spellman now? Why would he refuse? More im portantly Spellman’s key m an in the FBI was Knight of Malta, Cartha DeLoach . As the third in comman d, DeLoach was in a position to supervis e the assassination and suppress evidence. Garrison proved DeLoach did in fact suppress evidence. After the assassination we see a telling relationship between President Lyndon Johnson and Cartha DeLoach . DeLoach was known as Johnson’s man in the FBI and the President would call him any tim e of day. Curt Gentry writes: The Jesuits – 1963 "},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 602 “Lyndon Johnson couldn’t sleep . Late at night he had his aid Marvin Watson telephone the DeLoach bedroom . The president had suddenly become convinced that the murder of his predecessor had been a conspiracy and wanted more information from the FBI.” { 19 } This is the Cartha DeLoach that had signed a five-year contract with Lee Iacocca’s Ford Mercury in connection w ith the television series, “ The FBI. ” Both DeLoach and Iacocca were Knights of Malta subject to Cardinal Spellman during the Kennedy assassination. Later DeLoach went on to be a director of PepsiCo, and according to Colonel Prouty , that company also participated in Kennedy’s assassination. We read with wonder, as it seem s this web of assassins appears to be endless: “ Nixon was in Dallas with a top executiv e of the Pepsi-Cola Com pany, Mr. Harvey Russell, the general counsel. Nixon was a legal counsel to that corporation. That top executive’s son has told of Nixon’s presence in Dallas at the time of the assassina tion, and Russell has confirm ed the accuracy of his son’s account. Late r, sometime after the shooting, Nixon was driven to the Dallas airport by a M r. DeLuca, also an official of the Pepsi-Cola Com pany. In addition, the son of another Pepsi-Cola executive was in Dallas at that time and had di nner with Jack Ruby, Oswald’s killer, the night before JFK was murdered.” { 20 } (Is it any wonder why President Nixon , a co-conspirator in the assassination, was paranoid over the release of “the Watergate tapes”?) DeLoach , Iacocca and the Knights of Pepsi , now PepsiCo, all worked together . At the time of the assassination in Dallas, the Catholic priest, Oscar Huber , escorted by an unknown priest , was sent from Holy Trin ity Catholic Church to administer “last rites” for the President. Knowing that Kennedy’s wounds were frontal wounds of entry , Huber reported everything to his superior, the Bishop of Dallas, then “The Most Reverend Thomas Kiely Gorman , DD.” According to Martin Lee’s article entitled “ Who Are the Knights of Malta? ” appearing on October 14, 1983 in the National Catholic Reporter , Thomas K. Gorman was a Knight of Malta. Being a brother Knight, he must have reported directly to Cardinal Spellman and kept him apprised of wh at was happening in Dallas. At the tim e of the assassination in Da llas, roughly 12:30PM (in the afternoon), all the telephones went dead in Washington, D.C. for about one hou r. How could this have happened? Som eone at IT&T had to be responsible as it serviced the Washington area. In 1963 one of the VIP’s of IT&T was Francis D. Flanagan . You guessed it . According to Martin Lee’s same article, “ Who Are the Knights of Malta? ”, Flanagan was a Knight. Later McCone , with his brother Knights, coordinated a deal between the CIA and IT&T to better work together.

They were working for the FBI in partic ular. But the only notable Knight i nvolved was Senator Edward Kennedy , in that, through his silence he has consented to his brother’s murder . Maybe this is what has driven the perpetual Senator from Massachusetts to his ruined, al coholic life. Let us take a few moments to pray for the Senator that he m ight have a cha nge of heart, that he would tell all and that we m ight protect him . For he too wa s subject to the occult power of Pope Paul VI’s Francis Cardinal Spellman . He was indeed “ Spellmanized ”! Lastly, we know that the Mafia was involved in the Kennedy Assassination. The Mafia, OSS/CIA, FBI and Office of Naval Intelligence had been working together throughout World War II. Jack Ruby was a Mafioso and David E. Scheim makes it perfectly clear in his Contract on America that the Mob had at least two motives; the Kennedy brothers assault on Or ganized Crim e and the loss of the Mob’s gam bling paradise in Cuba. But those were not the reasons . The Mafia Dons m ust have been prom ised that they would m ake m ore m oney than Havana could ever produce, through the explosion of the International Drug Trade m ade possi ble by the Vietnam War. If they helped eliminate Kennedy , Johnson would escalate the war and th ereby, the drug trade. The CIA would bring the drugs in from the Golden Triangle , distribute them to the Mafia families ( Sam Giancana and Santos Trafficante families) and both would profit. Mob bosses not wanting to participat e would be deposed or elim inated. More importantly, the Mafia’s Commission had a favor to repay . Cardinal Spellman , through FDR , had arranged the release of Charles “Luck y” Luciano because of “Operation Underworld” menti oned in a previous chapter. Now the Cardinal needed a favor. If refused, Spellman could use the entire International Intelligence Community, which he had helped to organize, to eliminate any Mob boss. If agreed to, new gambling cente rs would open up, Atlantic City being one of them . Clearly, if the President was rem oved, everybody would acquire m ore power and wealth, the Intelligence Comm unity would become more ab solute and the Cardinal would be even m ore respected by his peers in Rom e. The rest is history. Later, in 1964, for the first tim e in th e nation’s history as a Republic (1789- 1868) or an Em pire (1868-2003), the Pope of Rom e set foot in Fourteenth Amendment America . Cardinal Spellman had perform ed well and was rewarded by a visit from his Master, fellow Cold Warrior and Vatican Ratline handler, Cardinal Montini , who was now the P apal Caesar , Pope Paul VI . There is yet another reason for the rem oval of President Kennedy . He wanted to arm Israel . Loftus and Aarons write: The Jesuits – 1963 "},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 604 “In Septem ber 1962 Kennedy decided to supply Israel with defensive ground-to-air m issiles capable of st opping aircraft, but not the Egyptian offensive missiles.

Kennedy prom ised the Isr aelis that as soon as the 1964 election was over, he would break the CIA ‘int o a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds.’ . . . With Kennedy’s a ssassination in Novem ber 1963, the Israelis lost the best friend they ha d had in the White House since Trum an departed.” { 21 } And why did the Vatican’s Jesuits not want any arms sales to Israel at this tim e? Why did our Jesuit-controlled President, Lyndon Johnson , turn his back while the Egyptian arm y m oved up through the Sinai de sert to prepare its assault on Israel in 1967? Because the attack upon Israel had to be provoked! The Jesuits’ International Intelligence Community, deceiving Egypt into falsely perceiving the weakness of the Israeli arm y and the supposed abandonm ent of Israel by the American Empire , provoked that attack. Indeed, weakness breeds cont empt and invites attack! The Six- Day war, engineered by Knight of Malta James Angleton , had one primary purpose : the taking of Jerusalem from Islam ic Jordan, along with the Temple Mount . The apparent lack of military hardware on the part of Israel provoke d the planned attack by Egypt. Therefore, Israel launched a preem ptive strike and in six days the holy city was in the hands of Rom e’s Zionist governm ent. Had Kennedy armed Israel, the Egyptians would never have been em bol dened to m aneuver for war. With no provoked war there would have been no Israeli attack. With no Israeli attack the Zionist Arm y, controlled by the Jesuits’ Mossad , would never have taken Jerusalem . With Jerusalem in Arab hands, the high Masonic Je wish Zionists could never rebuild Solomon’s Temple – unbeknown to the Israeli people – for the Jesuits “ infallible ” Papal Caesar who, when risen from the dead , will be “ . . . a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences . . .

Kennedy in 1963. For it was Cardinal Spellman , “the American Pope,” in com mand of his soldiers – the Knights of Malta – who oversaw the assassination. And it was certain Knights of Malta, using the Central Intelligence Agency , that aided in the actual assassination of the President. Those Knights were CIA Director, John A. McCone , and CIA officers, William F. Buckley , Jr. and Henry R. Luce . In 1963, both William F. Buckley, Jr. and Henry Luce were personal friends of CIA agent E. Howard Hunt .

And in 1985, it was Mark Lane who proved in Miam i’s federal court that Hunt was in Dallas the day President Kennedy was murdered. Theref ore, the conclusion was obvious. The CIA with its agent, E.

In Jesuit Temporal Coadjutor Oliver Stone’s masterpiece movie entitled JFK, Director’s Cut , Colonel Prouty , in speaking with Jim Garrison , poses three questions in solv ing the Kennedy Assassination. They are: 1. Why ? 2. Who Benefited ? 3. Who has the power to cover it up ? In light of the past two hundred years of true history, we have answered the first two questions. We shall now address the third. We know Jesuit General Janssens (who ruled the Masonic Jewish Zionist s’ World Jewish Congress through its President – Nahum Goldmann – and his assistant/advisor — Joe Golan ), in control of Pope Paul VI (through the Pope’s Jesuit confessor, Paolo Dez za . the pro- Zionist, intim ate friend and fellow cabba list of the powerful Talmudic Chief Rabbi of Rome Israel (Eugenio) Z olli ), in control of the Archbishop of New York, Cardinal Spellman , in control of the Knights of Malta, Am erican Freem asonry, Opus Dei, the Knights of Columbus, the Council on Fore ign Relations, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Inve stigation and the American Mafia greatly benefited by the Kennedy Assassination. This is why they did it.

Therefore, the last three Archbishops of New York, Cardinal Cook e , Cardinal O’Connor , and Cardinal Egan , have continued to exercise the sam e all- encom passing power, or more , that Cardinal Spellman used to carry out and cover- up the assassination of JFK. As we have previously covered, the Archbishop of New York is a warrior , a commanding General. This is why he is styl ed “the Military Vicar” of the American Em pire. In 1921 the Council on Foreign Relations was founded by several Papal agents, one of which was the Shriner Freem ason Colonel Edward House . By 1963 the CFR (overseen by David Rock efeller ) controlled the press, both political parties, banking, the major corporations, the gove rnment and its intelligence community. Cardinal Spellman controlled the CFR through two of his Knights of Malta. The first was shipping tycoon and international industrialist, J. Peter Grace , head of the American Branch of the Knights of Malta a nd President of W. R. Grace & Co. of New York. The other was Henry R. Luce , the seventh m ost powe rful man in the United States according to Winston Churchill , and the utter dictator over the Em pire’s press, called the “Lucepress.” Between Henry R. Luce and the far-reaching influence of the Council on Foreign Relations including AP, UPI, the New York Times , Time , Life , Newsweek , Sports Illustrated , ABC, CBS, and NBC, the cover-up of JFK’s assassination would be fairly ea sy. The press, which every American considered to be “the gospel,” was controlled by the power of this one m an in conjunction with the Council on Foreign Rela tions — subject to Cardinal Spellman . For Luce was a Knight of Malta ; an apostate Presbyterian and spokesm an for the Jesuits’ evil World Council of Churches ; the betrayer of the Chinese pe ople into the hands of Rom e’s Inquisitor, Mao Tse-tung ; a “jet setter” and member of Yale’s “Skull & Bones” fraternity; a proponent of fascism (the Order’s favorite form of absolute governm ent); a “Cold Warrior” having coined the phr ase, “The Am erican Century;” and a close friend of the Jesuit John Courtney Murray , who resided at Woodstock College — the Jesuit Theological Seminary in Woodstock, Maryland. “A concept . . .

Shaw in 1969. We now know why! Luce was also responsible for pu tting the famous picture of Oswald holding a rifle on the cover of his Life Magazine . That photo, like th e Ashbourne Portrait of Shakespeare, later proved to be a forgery. Henry R. Luce , the Knight of Malta, CFR member and CIA operative did all he could to cover-up the true details of the assassination — to the satisfaction of Cardinal Spellman . Spellman’s Freemason, Allen Dulles – whose nephew, Avery Dulles , at the tim e was a powerful Jesuit and is now a Cardinal, having been appointed by Pope John Paul II – was appointed to the Warren Com mission by Spellman’s Freem ason, President Johnson . Dulles was the major connection between the Com mission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Central In telligence Agency and its “Vatican Desk” through James Jesus Angleton who in turn had secretly m onitored the m ovem ents of CIA agent Lee Oswald through one of his CIA assets, Jane Roman , two m onths prior to the Kennedy Assassination. This arch-dem on, who disgraced his Protestant Presbyterian Church and betrayed his c ountrym en, was one of the m ajor players linking the Vatican’s intellig ence communities together. He had worked with Cardinal Montini evacuating Nazis through the Ratlines, and now on the Warren Com mission, protected the interests of his old friend who was now Pope Paul VI . Additionally, future President Gerald Ford , the Shriner Freem ason, and Cardinal Spellman’s Knight of Malta, Cartha D. DeLoach , worked together to subvert the Warren Com mission. Mark Lane in his Plausible Denial tells us: “An internal FBI m emo dated Dece mber 17, 1963, details the item s Ford passed to Cartha D. DeLoach , then the assist ant to the FBI director. Ford did not disclose to the other six m embers of the Warren Commission his course of im proper and illegal conduct. The Jesuits – 1964 - 2000 "},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":"Chap ter 46 625 DeLoach reported that Ford agreed to continue to betray his colleagues on the Com mission. Ford said, DeLo ach reported, “I should call him any time his assistance was needed.” [ Recently, Gerald Ford has admitted to his misconduct while on the Warren Commission. ] { 11} In 1968 when Jim Garrison sought to question Allen Dulles concerning Knight of Malta and kingpi n of Permindex (Permane nt Industrial Expositions), Clay L. Shaw , the Justice Department refused to serve the subpoena . The Empire’s Holy Office of the Inquisition was simply being loyal to th e Pope’s Papal Knights, who are always above the law. The “reigning King of the Am erican Em pire,” then Archbishop Cook e , was continuing the cover-up by stifling the inve stigation in fulfilling his Oath as a Cardinal, whose first loyalty was to the “ infallible ” Pope of Rom e. A portion of that oath reads: “I, Terence Cooke , of the Holy Rom an Church , Cardinal of New York, promise and swear . . . to be faithful and obedient to . . .our Most Holy Lord Paul VI, and his canonically elected successor . . . To try in every way to assert, uphold, preserve, increase and promote the rights, even temporal, especially those of the civil principality , the liberty, the honor, the privileges a nd authority of the Holy Roman Church of our lord the Pope , and the aforesaid successors; When it shall com e to m y knowledge th at som e m achination, prejudicial to those rights, which I can not preven t, is taking place, im mediately to make it known to the Pope . . .

So help m e God and these holy gospels.” { 12 } [Em phasis added] William F. Buckley, Jr. , another Knight of Malta, CFR memb er an d CIA operative along with his brother James Buck ley , continually maintained in his periodical, National Review , that Oswald was a lone assassin. He too, as the faithful servant of Cardinal Spellman , prom oted the Great Jesuit Cover-up . Shriner Freem ason J. Edgar Hoover , with his FBI , also suppressed evidence misleading the Warren Commission chaire d by another Shriner Freem ason, Chief Justice Earl Warren . Of his general power and role in the assassination we read: The Jesuits – 1964 - 2000 "},{"pageNumber":626,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 626 “In 30 years on the job, J. Edgar H oover has developed an intelligence system which nothing – no racket a nd certainly no conspiracy – can escape. Through its extensive netw ork of inform ers, the FBI knows everything worth knowing that goes on in the United States even in areas that lie outside its legal jurisdiction. The Dallas conspiracy was born and took root in places where the FBI was well represented . . . By mid- October, Hoover had been inform ed of the existence of a plot and was familiar with many of the details . . . The week before the President’s departure for Texas, Hoover knew exactly what was going to happen . Why did the FBI fail to intervene ? ” { 13 } [Em phasis added] Why? Because Hoover was working for his master and brother Cold Warrior, Cardinal Spellman , just like Earl Warren who later “investigated” the murder. In 1976 the House Select Committee on Assassinations was convened. Again, it was filled with fighting from with in and resistance from without. The Irish Catholic Papal Knight, Thomas “Tip” O’Neill , strongly resisted its proceedings pursuant to the wishes of his master in St. Patrick’s Cathedral. We read: “ ‘The Committee was programmed to se lf-destruct,’ claimed Gonzalez. He saw his unsuccessful entreaties to Tip O’Neill to help fire Sprague as a sign that O’Neill , who was very close to the Kennedy family . . . never really wanted an investigation .” { 14 } [Emphasis added] Further, “Both the Chairman of the Comm ittee, Thomas Downing, and the Speaker of the House retired, and Henry Gonzalez took over as Chairman of the Assassinations Committee, with Tip O’Neill as Speaker. O’Neill [ a trustee of the Order’s Boston College ] was hostile to the Committee and the investigation .” { 15 } [Emphasis added] Tip O’Neill , another trustee at the Jesuits’ Bost on College, was just another Am erican traitor loyal to a foreign prince and sovereign — the Pope of Rome . Another key-player who resisted the A ssassinations Committee was the wife of the late Henry R. Luce , the apostate Baptist having be en converted to Catholicism by Bishop Fulton J. Sheen . We read of the Dame of Malta, Clare Boothe Luce : “One of the wealthiest wom en in th e world, widow of the founder of the Time, Inc. publishing empire, former member to the U. S. House of Representatives, former Ambassador to Italy, successful Broadway The Jesuits – 1964 - 2000 "},{"pageNumber":627,"pageContent":"Chap ter 46 627 playwright, international socialite, and longtime civic activist, Clare Boothe Luce was the last person in the world Schweiker would have suspected of leading him on a wild goos e chase. . . .Her im pression, Luce told Schweiker . . .was that Oswald was hired by Castro to assassinate Kennedy in retaliation for the assassina tion attempts against him . . .

She, with O’Neill , helped to successfully defeat the Assassinations Committee in obedience to her master in New York, Cardinal Cook e . The m urder of over one hundred witn esses to the Kennedy Assassination makes it clear that Fourteenth Amendment America is under a Jesuit-controlled, fascist military dictatorship — the favorite government of Rome! The Vatican’s International Intelligence Co mmunity has committed these murders using their tools most fitting for the job. Their agents could be NSA, CIA, FBI, MID, ONI, KGB, GRU, British SIS, Mossad or Mafia. Th e Jesuits have many sources through which they fulfill their bloody Jesuit Oath on a regular basis. Of the general m urder of witnesses we read: “ Jim Marrs , author of Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy , wrote: ‘In the three-year period which follo wed the m urder of President Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald, 18 m aterial witnesses died — six by gunfire, three in motor accidents, two by suicid e, one from a cut throat, one from a karate chop to the neck, five from na tural causes.’ . . . A m athem atician hired by the London Sunday Times in February of 1967 concluded that the odds of the num ber of witnesses invol ved in the assassi nation of John F. Kennedy dying between Novem ber 22, 1963 and that date, (18 in num ber) were one hundred thousand trillion to one . . . . In the time period ranging from Novem ber 22, 1963 to August, 1993, over 115 ‘witnesses’ have died or fallen victim to death by strange circumstances, suicides or murder [ including Chicago Mob Boss Sam Gianc ana ( 1975) with his underlings Johnny Roselli ( 1976) and Charles Nico letti ( 1977) , the boss of Grassy Knoll shooter, the imprisoned James E. Files ].” { 17 } One of the more recent CIA actions was the murder of Bud Fensterwald in 1991. We read: “Gus Russo felt the man [ a former Air Force Colonel ] was ready to talk about the assassination and, based on th is assessm ent, the head of the JFK Assassination Archives in Washington, D.C., attorney Bud Fensterwald, The Jesuits – 1964 - 2000 "},{"pageNumber":628,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 628 was ready to head to Florida and inte rview him .

Just days before I was to meet Bud, I received a call from Bud’s secretary that he had died the previous night. Before I could do anything, Bud’s body was crem ated and no autopsy was performed.” { 18 } The Intelligence Agencies, controlled by th e “Knights” of Rome, continue to murder any honest m an who would dare to tell the truth about Kennedy’s assassins. And who is the present Roman Senator , “ A Prince of the Church,” and the “Military Vicar” of these Knights, whose loyalty would go to the extreme of committing high treason against Am erican national sovere ignty in obedience to the Jesuits’ “ infallible ” Papal Caesar ? It is none other than Edward Cardinal Egan , the Archbishop of New York and one of the m ost ardent defenders and prom oters of the Temporal Pow er of the Papal P riest-K ing in Rom e. For it is this Card inal Egan, along with his Knights of Malta, Knights of Colum bus and Sh riner Freem asons in control of the American Intelligence Community , that is responsible for th e attack and demolition of the World Trade Center and partia l destruction of the Pentagon which has resulted in the present Papal Caesar’s Crusade against the Islamic peoples of the mid East. Finally the Jesuits, in control of Tim e-Warner (as well as Param ount Pictures having em ployed Knight of Malta Joe Kennedy ), produced Jesuit Oliver Stone’s masterpiece movie, JFK, Director’s Cut . One of the key m oments of the m ovie takes place in New Orleans when Garrison is meeti ng with his staff in a restaurant. After reviewing the evidence he concludes th e m eeting by rebuking his aides saying: “You all got to start thinking on a di fferent level like the CIA does. We’re looking through the looking glass he re people. White is black and black is white .” { 19 } [Em phasis added] His last line is a Jesuit m axim laid down by the Order’s founder, Ignatius Loyola , in his Spiritual Exercises . The Jesuit, as well as every Jesuitized “good Catholic,” has no mind of his own . At the word of his superi or the truth is a lie and a lie is the truth. In the words of Loyola , “Putting aside all private judgment [ !!! ] we should alw ays be ready to accept this principle: I will believe th at the white I see is black, if the hierarchical Church [ Pope, Cardinals, Ar chbishops and Bishops controlled by the Jesuit General ] so defines it.” { 20 } The Jesuits – 1964 - 2000 "},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":"Chap ter 46 629 Jesuit John Courtney Murray, 1960s #176 A personal friend of Spellman’s Knight of Malta, Henry R.

Lee Iacocca, of Italian descent, is what m any Am erican m en would love to be and rightly so. It is for these reasons the author proc eeds with a great sorrow of heart in exposing the terrible deed of Lee Iacocca , as he participated in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy . Hopefully this chapter w ill serve as corrective surgery rather than a dagger to the heart. Since Mr. Iacocca still lives the writer has prayed that he would repent and confess his sin to the Lo rd knowing that, “He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsake th them shall have mercy.” – Proverbs 28:13 Since a great host of us Americans are mu rderers, having polluted our land with the blood of aborted millions, we are no better th an Mr. Iacocca. May we confess and find forgiveness and m ercy, even as our friend m ay. Knowing the B lack P ope’s POWER that would rage against Lee Iacocca if he would dare to tell all, the hundreds of assa ssins that would appear to expedite his dem ise via “the poison cup, the strangulati on cord, the steel of the poniard (the blade of the knife) or the leaden bullet,” we realize the request to confess to the nation is great. But we are convinced his personal grea tness is equal to the task. And there are many of us fundam ental, Bible-believing Baptists and Prot estants who would gladly hazard our lives to protect him from every Jesuit assassin, be he Mafia, CIA or Mossad. For we are Calvinist warriors wielding both the Sw ord of the Spirit and the Sw ord of Just Defense , believing that to fight and di e in defense of a righteous man for a righteous cause is to die well, that we “ might obtain a better resurrection ” ( Hebrews 11:35 ) at the Judgment Seat of Christ (II Corinthians 5:10 ). On Novem ber 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. The evidence inside the lim ousine proved there was m ore than one shooter as there were several prim ary strike s. The Secret Service took great pains in destroying this evidence. We read: “Three days after the assassination, Carl Renas , head of security for the Dearborn Division of the Ford Moto r Company, drives the limousine, helicopters hovering overhead, from Wa shington to Cincinnati. In doing so, he noted several bullet holes, the m ost notable being the one in the windshield’s chrom e m olding stri p, which he said was clearly ‘a prim ary strike’ and ‘not a fragm ent.’ The Jesuits – 1979 "},{"pageNumber":636,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 636 The Lim ousine was taken by Renas to Hess and Eisenha rt of Cincinnati, where the chrome molding was replaced . The Secret Service told Renas to ‘Keep your m outh shut .’ ” { 3 } [Em phasis added] As we saw, the m an who drove the lim ousine to Cincinnati was the head of security for the Dearborn Division of Ford Motor Com pany. And who was the head of the Dearborn Division in 1963 that dispat ched Renas for the task of his life? According to Robert Lacy it was Lee Iacocca . We read: “Henry Ford II says today that the first time he can remember meeting Lee Iacocca was in November 1960, when he summoned the young salesman to his office to tell hi m he was giving him com mand of the Ford Division [ at Dearborn ].” { 4 } Lee Iacocca remained the head of the Dearborn Division until he became President of Ford Motor Com pany in 1970. Therefore as the General Manager of the Dearborn Division in 1963, Iacocca particip ated in the suppre ssion of evidence in dispatching his security chief to drive the lim ousine from Washington to Cincinnati. As a prom inent Rom an Catholic, Lee Iacocca was well acquainted with the Jesuit Order and Ignatius Loyola’s Spiritual Exercises . He writes of his life during the Depression: “It took m e a num ber of years to fu lly understand why I had to m ake a good confession to a priest before I went to Holy Com munion, but in my teens I began to appreciate the importance of this most misunderstood rite of the Catholic Church. I not only had to think out my transgressions against m y friends ; I had to speak them aloud. In later years, I found m yself com pletely refreshed after confession. I even began to attend weekend retreats, where the Jesuits, in face-to-face examinations of conscience, made me come to grips with how I was conducting m y life .” { 5 } [Em phasis added] The most important tie to the conspiracy in assassinating Kennedy was Iacocca’s subordination to Cardinal Spellman and the Knights of Malta. According to his autobiography he had eaten supper with Cardinal Spellman (p. 116) and shortly after the assassination, Knight of Malta Henry R. Luce , who bought and suppressed the Zapruder Film , gave Iacocca a great write-up in his periodicals. “Unveiled at the New York World’s Fair in the spring of 1964, the Mustang proved a sensation . . . Lee Iacocca well deserved the rare accolade of simultaneous cover stories in both Time and Newsweek .” { 6 } The Jesuits – 1979 "},{"pageNumber":637,"pageContent":"Chap ter 47 637 Could this have been the beginning of the rise of the Lee Iacocca’s star, leading to his appointm ent in 1970 as President of Ford Motor Com pany [ founded by Freemason Henry Ford ], then to his appointm ent in 1975 as the President of Chrysler [ founded by Freemason Walter P. Chrysler ], and finally the U.S. Governm ent loan to Chrysler in 1979 resulting in th e making of an American hero? And who was the force in Congress th at was ultimately responsible for the passing of the Act creating the Loan Guarantee Board that extended the loan to Chrysler? Iacocca declares that it was House Speaker, Thomas “Tip” O’Neill . “ Tip O’Neill was our real point m an in Congress . . . . As soon as he turned on his lights to he lp us, the tide started to turn. . . . By the time the vote came, we had a lot of backer s in Congress. Still, Tip O’Neill’s support was crucial.

When the vote cam e in, the House had agre ed by a two-to-one m argin (271- 136) to help Chrysler get back on its feet.” { 7 } [Em phasis added] What is the significance of Tip O’Neill helping Lee Iacocca in securing the loan? Tip O’Neill strongly resisted the proceedings of the House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1976 as covered in our previous chapter. Here we have two Papal Knights, Iacocca and O’Neill , involved in the assassination of President Kennedy through willful acts of suppressing evidence. The first Knight was Lee Iacocca , a highly placed official in one of Rom e’s corporate giants, it composing a part of the Jesuits ’ Military Industrial Complex. (Remember Nicholas Brady , the multimillionaire, Papal Knight of Malta and personal friend of the Jesuit General’s Francis Spellman , was one of the original owners of Chrysler.) Ford Motor Com pany ha d helped to build Hitler’s and Stalin’s War Machines during the Second Thirty Years’ War and therefore had a financ ial interest in continuing the war in Vietnam . (The guidance unit of the air-to-air m issile known as “the Sidewinder or AIM - 9” was built by Philco-Ford.) The second Knight was Tip O’Neill . Being the Speaker, he was the m ost powerful m an in the House of Representativ es for ten years. Handling the nation’s business, it was the House that had been responsible for borro wing 220 billion dollars in credit from the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank (m anaged by the Council on Foreign Relations) to finance the Vietnam War . The returns for this “investment” would be the fantastic profits generated from the International Drug Trade , while further destroying the Fourteenth Amendment American Empire’s “heretic” and “liberal” population with debt, drugs, disease, and demoralization . The Jesuits – 1979 "},{"pageNumber":638,"pageContent":" Vatican Assassins 638 Thus, Iacocca and O’Neill , two kingpins in the Kennedy assassination and cover-up, worked together in obtaining the loan for Chrysler. That loan was credit extended to the Am erican Congress, created out of nothing , by the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank. The result wa s the rebuilding of the automaker’s entire manufacturing base, exalting Chrysler to one of the Em pire ’s m ost advanced corporate giants within the Jesuits’ Military Industria l Complex. (The author wonders if Chrysler will provide hardware and technology to the arm y of our com ing invaders, the Red Chinese and “the former” Soviet Union?) The victory of Chrysler’s recovery was credited to Lee Iacocca . But he would never have succeeded had it not been for Tip O’Neill . Therefore, what or who could have united these men to accomplish such a feat? Both were devoted Rom an Catholics; but, m ore im portantly , they were “Roman Knights” loyal to the Pope’s American M ilitary Vicar, the Cardinal of St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York. Of Lee Iacocca’s membership in the Kn ights of Malta, again we read from the article entitled “ Who are the Knights of Malta? ” written in 1983: “The SMOM’s [ Sovereign Military Order of Malta ] U.S. section has approxim ately 1,000 m embers — in cluding 300 “dam es” who hail from society’s upper crust.

When his description is applied to the American Medical Association (AMA), the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) we can easily see these three agencies as arms of the Great Jesuit Conspiracy , described by Abate Leone in his The Jesuit Conspiracy: The Secret Plan of the Order printed in 1848. The purpose of the AMA, ADA and FDA is to destroy the American people in the name of helping them. By making the people chronically ill these agencies break any will to resist an American fascist tyranny (possibly to be led by the Jesuit-trained Knight of Malta, Patrick J. Buchanan ) and the com ing “New World Order” under the Jesuits’ “ infallible ” Pope. The AMA, as we know it today, began in the early 1900s. The Jesuits, through Shriner Freem asonry, the Morgans and the Rockefellers in particular, began to control the medical educati on of young physicians, teaching them to treat symptoms with their drugs. Later came surgery, and then radiation com pleting the m edical “unholy trinity” of “cut, burn and poison.” Warning us of the drug-happy doctor we read in 1912: “ . . . for the doctor who imagines he can kill disease by his drug gatling-gun will quite as oft kill his patie nt. Be suspicious of the doctor who comes into the sickroom with an air of om nipotence, takes out his stethoscope as tho it was Gabriel’ s Trumpet, writes a lot of Latin prescriptions and asks ne ver a question regarding the daily habits of the patient...Beware, I say, of this cla ss of physicians.

It was known at the time that this virus caused brain can cer in experim ental anim als but, it was covered, there was no worry as it caused no problem s in hum ans.

I noted at the tim e that brain tum ors had increased in frequency since I was graduated from m edical school. In 1950, they were rare, but by 1990 they were com mon — 1950 plus 40 equals 1990 (the year I m ade m y first report on SV40 and brain tum ors). The horrifying truth cam e out in the February 14, 1999, London Telegraph : ‘The mass vaccination campaigns of the 50’s and 60’s may be causing hundreds of deaths a year because of a cancer-causing virus which contaminated the first polio vaccine, according to scientists.

Dr. Jonas Salk is quoted as admitting, ‘When you inoculate children with a polio vaccine you don’t slee p well for two or three weeks’ (E.

With harmful viruses and bacteria in the se men, their wives and babies would becom e infected producing m ore cancers and birth defects. The Gulf War Syndrom e is a classic example of murder by injection. The Vatican, with its Sovereign Military Order of Malta, has created many viruses that have been used for the systematic annihilation of the “heretic and liberal” American people. The Knights, with thei r former Nazis, CIA and drug companies, created the Human Immune Deficiency Vi rus (HIV) causing the present Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) epidem ic.

The true cure s for viral diseases were heavily suppressed. Those cures we re prim arily oxygen-ozone, light with color, ultra-violet blood irradia tion (so ably explained by Dr. William Campbell Douglas in his Into the Light { 12 } and Kenneth J. Dillon’s Healing Photons: The Science and Art of Blood Irradiation Therapy { 13 } ) and direct current freque ncy generators using both photons and electrons. The use of m edical grade ozone, Royal Rife’s photon/frequency m achine, Emmett Knott’s blood irradiator and Darius Dinshah’s light-color therapy called “Spectro-Chrom e” were all violently suppressed. The use of m edical grade colloidal silver was di scontinued and all non- drug rem edies were suppressed. And why? Because these treatments address the true causes of chronic disease. Of the true causes, Dr. William H. Philpott tells us: “The oxidoreductase enzym es are ne cessary to produce biological life energy by oxidation phos phorylation producing ATP and oxidation rem nant negative poled m agnetism . The biological life energy consists of enzym e catalytic production of: (a ) adenosine triphosphate (ATP), (b) oxidative rem nant m agnetism (a negative m agnetic field). This oxidation/reduction enzym atic res ponse is dependent upon alkalinity and m olecular oxygen (alkaline-hyperoxia) . . . This oxidoreductase fam ily of en zym es is alkaline-hyperoxic-negative (south-seeking) m agnetic field activ ation dependent. When these 3 physiologically norm al factors are not present, then cellular ATP is made by ferm entation.

Therefore by refusing all infective vaccinations and immunizations as well as amalgam fillings and root canals, by using negatively charged photons and ions to kill all anaerobic bacteria, viruses, fungus and microscopic parasites (such as ultraviole t light and ozone/oxidative therapies), by keeping the body in a highly alkaline state using enzym es and alkaline m inerals (as found in raw, unprocessed foods, whole f ood supplementation a nd alkaline water), by keeping a highly oxygenated state through deep breathing, exercise and oxygen therapies (such as hyperbaric oxygen and ozone steam cabinets), by keeping in negatively charged m agnetic fields (such as m agnetic beds, m agnetic wraps, m agnetic bricks and seat pads while dr inking m agnetized, alkaline water – all north pole – and by using laetrile and herbs) Wh ite Protestant nations would cease to be the leaders in chronic degenerative diseases! But the licensed treatment of the AMA’s created diseases m ust be by m eans of Rom e’s unholy trinity — cut, burn and poison . The Church of Modern Medicine tolerates no heresy and uses the sword of governm ent to punish those “obstinate medical heretics” who would dare to trul y cure us Am ericans of our diseases. And of course, the Knights of Malta control the great pharm aceutical industries such as Merck, Sharp & Dohme , as they are connected with the Order’s Central Intelligence Agency.

The Jesuit Order, behind the new constitution, created the American Em pire. In 1868, on the ruins of George Washington’s Calvinistic Republic, the Jesuits’ new “Holy Rom an Em pire of the We st” was set up with its massive central governm ent in Washington. Its nati onal purpose would be to restore the Temporal Pow er of the Jesuits’ “ infallible ” Pope over every nation. To do this the Empire was made the financial and military colossus of the world using J. P. Morgan , their Federal Reserve Bank and the Great Depr ession. In subduing the nations, credit created out of nothing would be used to build trem endous war m achines for the “extirpation of heretics and liberals.” This same Jesuit credit, called “foreign aid,” would be used to establish a nd finance the reign of dictat ors loyal to Rom e over every nation, including the Zionist and Talm udic governm ent of Israel. The econom ic policy of the Em pire w ould be the destruction of sm all, independent, free enterprise businessm en a nd the consolidation of capital into the hands of Rom e’s corporate m onopolies (cor porate fascism ), while the people would be submitted to the ten pillars of The Communist Manifesto in exchange for The Ten Commandments .

A heavy and progressive income tax would invade the privacy of the people while replacing the apportioned tax . The wicked Social Security numbering system would keep track of all “taxpayers.” In fact, it would be the Vatican’s world governm ent num ber by which the Society of Jesus , through its FBI and CIA , would track every citizen of the Em pire. These two pillars alone would be enough to destroy the prosperous White Celtic-A nglo-Saxon Protestant Middle Class, while creating the feudal system of the D ark A ges composed only of the noble super-rich Catholic Whites and the com mon super-poor of all races and religions. The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion say it clearly in Protocol num ber twenty: “The concentration of i ndustry in the hands of [ cartel ] capitalists out of the hands of sm all m asters has drained away all the juices of the peoples and with them also the states . . .” { 9 } Dear truth-seeker, do you see how the ra dical m ass em ancipation of the Negro slaves after the War Between the States was never intended to benefit them but rather was calculated to destroy the private wealth of small White “heretic” masters in the South? Historically speaking, Blacks generally only produce wealth when trained and/or overseen by Whites.

The author of Vatican Assassins highly recommends Michael Bunker’s: Swarms of Locusts: The Jesuit Attack on the Faith “Even though the Jesuits exude vast influence a nd control in the areas of theology, education, recorded history and current media, it is still perplexing that virtually no literature exists exposing the Jesuit’s influence on mainline Protestantism. This is what makes Swarms of Locusts such a necessary book. In this work, the author uncovers forgotten history regarding the cooperative salvation theology of the Jesuits. The author then builds upon these historical truths and clearly exposes how the Jesuits (a nd their cooperative redemption theology) have permeated all denominations of the Protes tant Church. From Cain to Charles [ G. ] Finney, this book historically connects-the-dots and undeni ably proves that modern Protestantism has abandoned the Doctrines of Grace and embraced the doctrines of cooperative salvation.” Author, Michael Bunker, 2002; www.michaelbunker.com P.O.
