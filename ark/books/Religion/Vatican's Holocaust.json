A copy of this book was hurled across St. Paul's Cathedral, London, England, by the Archbishop of Canterbury, to the stupefaction of a vast congregati on gathered there to pray for Christian unity. A journalist bought a copy to use it as a \"shield\", expecting to be att acked by the three thousand people who had participated at the launchi ng of the book in the Ulster Hall, Belfast, Northern Ireland, simply because they approved of its contents. The book was also kicked, trampled and spat upon by a Catholic student in Belfast. None of these people had read a line of it. The Anglican primate had lost his temper—and, even more tragically his reas on—as swiftly as had the newsman and the university intellectuallo id, at the mere sight of its title.

The ordinary i ndividual cannot accept as yet the startling facts that only a few years back, for instance, the Catholic Church advocated forcible conversions, helped to erect concentration camps, and was responsible for the sufferings, torturing and execution of hundreds of thousands of non-Catholics. Deeds coolly pe rpetrated by her lay and ecclesiastic members. Furthermore, that many of such atrocities were ca rried out personally by some of her Catholic priests and even monks. One of the main purposes of this book is to relate where, when and by whom such atrocities were committed. It took th e author almost half a decade of painstaking investigation before he accepted what seemed unbelievable. The result is this account, documented from as authoritative and as varied sources as possible. Among them , people with whom the present writer became personally acquainted. Some of these played no mean role in the religious, political and military events herein narrated. Others were eye-witnesses. Indeed, not a few even victims of the incredible atrocities sanctioned and promoted by the Catholic Church. Th e names of most of the participants, Catholic laymen, military, priests, friars, bishops, archbish ops and cardinals, as well as those of their non- Catholic victims, men, women and children, including clergymen, are as genuine as the names of the localities, villages and cities wher e the atrocities took place. Their authenticity can be verified by anyone willing to do so. Document s and photographs of Catholic co ncentration camps, Catholic mass executions and Catholic forced conver sions, some of which are in this book, are kept in the archives of the Yugoslav Government, of the Orthodox Church, of the United Nations and of other official institutions. The Ecumenical revolution, although seemingly alluring, has shown itself to be nothing more than a Trojan Horse via which Catholic power, apparelled in contemporary garb, conti nues to assert itself as effectively active as ever. The striking samples of contemporary Catholic te rrorization which occurred in Malta and Vietnam, many of wh ich took place during the days of \"good old Pope John\" and, indeed, under the pontificate of Pope Paul VI, need no eluc idation. They are the most damning proof that the Catholic Church, notwithstanding all her alleged liberalization, fr aternization and up-to-dateness, basically, has not changed an iota. The portentous significance of what is here described, therefore, should be carefully scrutinized. Lest the past be repeated in the fu ture. Indeed, now. In the present. Avro Manhattan, London. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"PREFACE TO THE AMERICAN EDITIONS: THE VATICAN'S HOLOCAUST is not a misnomer, an accusation, and even less a speculation. It is an historical fact. Rabid nationa lism and religious dogmatism were its two main ingredients. During the existence of Croatia as an independent Ca tholic State, over 700,000 men, women and children perished. Many were executed, tortur ed, died of starvation, buried a live, or were burned to death. Hundreds were forced to become Catholic. Catholic padres ran concentrati on camps; Catholic priests were officers of the military corps which committed such atrocities. 700,000 in a total population of a few million, proportionally, would be as if one-third of the USA population had been exterminated by a Catholic militia. What has been gathered in this book will vindicate the veracity of these facts. Dates, names, and places, as well as photos are there to prove them. They should become known to the American public, not to foster vi ndictiveness, but to warn them of the danger, which racialism and sectarianism, when allied with religious intolera nce can bring to any contemporary nation, whether in Europe or in the New World.

"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 NEW NATIONS FROM OLD ONES When in 1917, during the First World War, the Papal N uncio in Munich, E. Pacelli, secretly negotiated with the Central Powers to accomplish the Pope's Peace without Victory , in order to save both Germany and Austria-Hungary from defeat, he had al ready made his first attempt to strangle a nation as yet unborn; Yugoslavia. If the Vatican's attempt wa s directed at preserving its most useful Hapsburg lay partner, it simultaneously ha d another no less important goal: to prevent a motley of nationalities from springing out of the Empire's ruins as soverei gn States in their own right . In such States, Poland excepted, Catholicism would have sunk to the level of a minority. Worse, it would have been dominated by heretical churches and their political Allies: i.e. by the Protestant and Liberal in Czechoslovakia, by the Orthodox in Yugoslavia. With its last attempt to save the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Vatican therefore st ruck a final blow against the yet unborn \"Hussite\" Czechs and the Catholic Slovaks on one side, and the Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Cr oats and Slovenes on the other, the fulfillment of their dreams lying as it did in th e disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian colossus. The Emperor Charles was advised to transform the Empire into a Federation. The idea, which originated at the Vatican, was repellent to both, as it meant, besides the looseni ng of Imperial control, the loosening of Catholic control over the various races of the tottering Empire. But in the circumstances the alternative was total collapse. In October Charle s announced the transformation of the Hapsburg Monarchy into a Federal State. The offer—which, significantly, was made only at the last moment—although accompanied by secret papal move s, left the Allies determined to end for good the rule of the double-headed Austrian eagle. Presiden t Wilson's reply to Charles, and thus to the Pope, was firmly hostile. The USA, said Wilson, admitted \"the justice of the national aspirations of the Southern Slavs.\" It was for these people, he added, to decide what they would accept. As far as the USA was concerned, he conclude d, it had already recognize d Czechoslovakia as a belligerent independent State. The American reply had sealed the fate of Austria-Hungary. On October 28, 1918, the Czechoslovaks declared their independe nce. On the 29th the Yugoslavs proclaimed theirs. On December 1 the Yugoslav Council invited th e Regent, Alexander, in Belgrade, to proclaim the Union. The new independent kingdom of the Se rbs, Croats, and Slovenes—Yugoslavia—had come into being. The birth was welcomed in certa in quarters—e.g. by the Allies—and was unwelcome in others—e.g. the Vatican—to which the new nation, besides being the unnatural creature of the Allies' political blindness, was a religious aberration not to be to lerated. Orthodoxy, swept away in Russia, where it had seemed unassailable, with the birth of Yugosla via had now become paramount in a country the population of which was more than one-third Catholic . Worse still, in additi on to permitting Orthodoxy to rule Catholics, Yugoslavia was preventing the latt er from setting up a wholly independent Catholic community. When to the above was added the fact th at Yugoslavia, by her mere existence, represented the greatest obstacle to the long- range Catholic strategy, the Vatican 's feeling, more than one of hostility, become one of implacable hatred, a wind which boded no good to the young nation. This hatred became the main inspirer of the Vatican's anti-Yugoslav stra tegy, the objective of which was the destruction of Yugoslavia. Having embarked on such a course, the Vatican began a vigorous campaign, the fulfillment of which to some exte nt depended on another factor: the collapse of Bolshevik Russia, the early disappearance of which wa s, at that period, taken almost for granted by everyone, particularly by the Allies , who had dispatched sundry armi es to hasten her collapse. The"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Vatican counted, then, on a Russian collapse in or der to execute its policy of a forced Catholic domination of the Balkan peninsula through the sw ord of Pilsudski. The creation of the Catholic Danzig-Odessa Polish Empire would have meant one thing: the death of Yugos lavia and other Balkan Orthodox and Protestant c ountries. When, however, Pilsudski's bloody adventure terminated and the Allies' efforts to destroy Bolshevik Russia relaxed, the Vatican changed its tactics and embarked on a new policy: destruction of Ort hodoxy by penetration, instead of by fo rce. Consequently, when in 1920 Pilsudski's Catholic Empire vanished, and the Pope set out to convert Russia, a parallel policy was pursued in connection with Yugoslavia. Although the keynote of this new anti-Orthodox strategy was penetration, its tactics were different in each coun try. Thus, whereas in Russia they were meant to penetrate in order, in the long r un, to dominate her religious life, in Yugoslavia they consisted of penetrating Yugoslav political life in order, once Catholic s had come to contro l it, to enhance the power of Catholicism, and thus ultimately st ultify, and indeed paralyze, the Orthodox Church throughout Yugoslavia. Such a policy, vigorously promoted, mostly by ambitious , clerically-dominated Catholic politicians in Croatia, yielded no little success. In no time Catho lic clericalism became a power behind the scenes, with the result that, w ithin a few years, the Hierarchy be gan to exert undue weight in the administration, not only of Croat affa irs, but also of those of Yugos lavia as a whole. This alarmed several honest Catholic Croats, not ably Radich, leader of the power ful Croat Peasant Party, aware of the danger that such tactics were creating both for Yugoslavia and for Croats. Defying the Hierarchy— and thus indirectly the Vatican—he began to combat the Catholic Trojan-horse tactics, warning Croatia that, by permitting their politicians to be led by th e Hierarchy in political matters, they were bound, sooner or later, to lead all Croats to disaster. Radich's counsel was followed; and for almost a decade Catholic strategy, weakened where it should have been at its strongest, was far less successful than if Radich had acted otherwise. But in 1928 Radich was assassinated. The assassination coincided with the general overha ul of Vatican European strategy towards Communism. In that same year the Curia finally broke off its negotiations with Soviet Russia. The Papal Nuncio in Germany, E. Pacelli, led the powerful Catholic Centre Party sharply to the extreme Right, thus al lying it with the forces which were to sky-rocket Hitler to power. In Italy the Vatican strengthened Fascism by signing a pact with Musso lini (1929). Fascist Catholic movements rose everywhere. An era of Catho lic policy had ended, and a new one had begun. The policy of penetration had been repl aced by one of active agitation and the swift mobilization of all the religious and political fo rces of Europe against Strip of photographs from the Album of Terro rists, maintained by the Yugoslav Secret Police, as early as 1933. Bottom row, first left , Ante Pavelic, the future Leader of the"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Independent Catholic State of Croatia. Prior to the latter's establishment, all the men above, as sworn Ustashi were engaged upon the promo tion of a policy of te rrorism, within and outside Yugoslavia. This they did by murderi ng singly or collectively, political enemies or innocent people alike. They placed explosives in public places, ships or trains. For instance, a train compartment was blown up by an Ustashi bomb at Zemum, killing the family of Professor Bruneti. Before the Second World War these men we re active all over Europe. Their most spectacular success was the simultaneous assass ination of the King of Yugoslavia and of Mr. Barthou, the French Forei gn Minister, during a State visi t to France, 9 October 1934. The double murder was the forerunner of a seri es of many others which were to contribute to the birth of the Independent Catholic State of Croatia. The Ustashi and Ante Pavelic were \"protected\" by Mussolini, and tacitly but effectively by the Vatican. Both supported them financially. Bolshevik Russia. Thus, while in the West the Vatican had launched upon a global hate campaign against Communism, in the Balkans, after Radich's death, it embarked upon a policy directed at the disintegration of Yugoslavia. Radich's successor, Dr. Macek, reorientated the Croatian Peasant Party into a rabid nationalist movement which, by becoming increasingly bold, becam e an active factor for the growing political tension inside Yugoslavia. From this period onward, Separatism became the keyword of Croat Nationalism, with the result that the latter began increasingly to play into the hands of the Catholic Hierarchy and thus into those of the Vatican. The Vatican's policy in the first decade implied Yugoslavia's existence as a united nation; in the second—i.e. since the emergence of a naked Separatism—it overtly aimed at Yugoslavia disint egration. In the promotion of the Vatican's new grand strategy, Yugoslavia was reckoned a major obstacl e even more than in the past, in that now it was impeding the swift Fascistization of Europe and th e eventual Fascist attack on Soviet Russia, with all the ensuing Balkan commotion which, it was hope d, would cause the tumbli ng of Yugoslavia itself. In connection with the la tter, the Vatican laid down a three-fold policy: 1. (a) The detachment of Ca tholic Croatia from the rule of Orthodox Serbia, 2. (b) the setting up of Croatia as an independent Catholic State, and, last but not least, 3. (c) the possible creati on of a Catholic Kingdom in the Balkans. For such goals to be attained, one thing was necessary: the pa rtial or total disinteg ration of Yugoslavia. To assert that Yugoslavia succumbed thanks only to Vatican machinations would be to falsify history. On the other hand, to minimize its role would be a cr ude historical distortion. Factors alien to religion played into its hands. These could be summarized as: the animosities of the Croats and the Serbs in the domestic field, the political ambitions of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany in the international. Croat Separatism became an increasingly important factor as the internal and external tension grew. Its identification with Catholic ism made it almost a blind tool of th e Catholic Hierarchy, and thus of the Vatican, which unhesitatingly used it to further not onl y its local interests, but also its vaster Balkan schemes of religio-political domination."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" Typical portraits of Ustashi leaders. Men like the above were the brains behind the numberless acts of terrorism carried out by th e Ustashi in Yugoslavia, Austria, Hungary, Germany, France and in other countries, chiefl y from their headquart ers in Fascist Italy. (Left) Mijo Bzik, known as \"M iko,\" was chief of the Usta shi camps in Italy, and the recruiter of the assassins who came from Yanka-Pusta. One of his main tasks was the placing of internal machines in public buildings, or crowded places. (Centre) Eugen Kvaternik, one of Ante Pave lic's principal accomplices. He personally accompanied from Italy to France, the assa ssins, who went to murder the King of Yugoslavia. Pavelic created him Minister of Police when Catholic Croatia became independent. (Right) Zvonimir Pospishil, one of the most br utal of terrorists. He belonged to a special group of Catholic Ustashi charged with the a ssassination of eminent personalities. He was given the task of killing King Alexander, by blow ing him up in Paris had the Marseille plot failed in 1934. The Croat leader, Radich, never tired of warning th e Croats against following the Vatican in political matters; in this he echoed the voice of another gr eat Catholic patriot, the leader of the Polish Nationalists, Roman Dmowski, whose slogan b ecame a by-word of certain Catholic Polish Nationalists: \"Never rely upon th e Vatican in political affairs.\" Hostility to Vatican political dire ctives by Catholic political leaders was born out of bitter experience: e.g. during the First World War, when Roman Dmow ski, having gone to Rome to ask for help to establish Polish independence, was greeted with op en disfavour, such Vatican hostility being inspired by political interests identified with those of Austria and other great European Powers who had worked against Polish aspirations for centuries. The extraordinary result of this was that the Poles never got any support from the Vatican, even when they rose against the Czars—an attitude which incensed them to such a degree that one of thei r great national poets, Ju lius Slowacki, coined the famous warning: \"Poland, thy doom comes from Rome.\" Which subse quent events proved was more than prophetic. Radich adopted the same slogan, a lthough with more tact. When, howev er, his Party was taken over by Macek, the original ideal of Ante Starcevic was swiftly injected with a new overdose of undiluted extremism, which made it turn shar ply to the extreme Right. The main exponent of this new trend was one Ante Pavelic, an individual obsessed by the idea of an independent Croatia, inspired by racialism, erected upon Fascism, wholly impregnated with Catholicism, a formidably compact miniature totalitarianism. A movement sprang out of this we ird conception; its bac kbone a ruthless core of terrorist bands, led by Pavelic himself, whose po licy consisted of blackmail, murder, plots, and assassinations. The shadow of powerful protectors from acro ss the sea descended swiftly upon them, thus enabling them to carry on thei r activities in defiance of nationa l or international procedure—e.g."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"from Italy and Germany, both of whom saw in Pave lic's Croatia a useful instrument for Fascist and Nazi expansion in the Balkans. The expansionist policies of thes e nations often ran pa rallel with that of the Vatican, which, by skillfully manipulating them, could frequently promote its own interests. It did that, not by remaining only an aloof spectator of various Fascist and Nazi activities, but by promoting a most vigorous anti- Yugoslav policy of its own. The Vatican and Fascism helped each other fr om the beginning. Pope Pius XI (1922-1939) ordered the Leader of the Cathol ic Party to disband it (1926), the better to consolidate the regime of Mussolini. The latter negotiated the Lateran Treaty and Concordat with the Church (1926-1929). By virtue of the first, the Vatican became a sovereign state within Rome. While with the second, the Church was granted immense privil eges and Catholicism was declared the only religion of Fascist Italy, whic h it wholehearted ly supported. Bishops took an oath of allegiance to the Fa scist Dictatorship, and the clergy were ordered never to oppose it or incite their flock to ha rm it. Prayers were said in Churches for Mussolini and for Fascism. Priests became member s of the Fascist Party and were even its officers. One of the main supporters of the Fascist-Vatica n pact was Mgr. E. Pacelli (the future Pope Pius XII), then in Germany. His brother, a lawyer, became one of the chief secret negotiators. He is seen in this photograph standing behind Cardinal ...... Later, the Papal Nuncio to Germany, Mgr. E. Pacelli saw to it that his brother was made a Prince. This yielded a rich harvest sooner than was expecte d. While the Vatican's Fascist associates were busy engineering political or terrorist activities, Catholic diplomacy—as previously in Spain, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, and France—came to the fo re with the promotion of a powerful Catholic fifth column. This, which had already gnawed at the internal structure of Y ugoslav unity, consisted of all those Croats infected with national-religious fa naticism, of the Catholic Hierarchy of Croatia, and of an illegal Nationalist Army composed of bands of Catholic terrorists, called the Ustashi, the last led by Ante Pavelic, supported by Vladimir Macek, l eader of the Croat Peasant Party, who in 1939 arranged for Mussolini to finance him with 20 million diners for th e Croat Separatist Movement, and by [1] Archbishop A. Stepinac, leader of the Catholic Hierarchy in Croatia."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The specific role played by the Vatican followed th e familiar pattern: use of the Hierarchy to help political and military plotters e ngaged in undermining or overthrowi ng the legal Government. Unlike its practice in other countries, however—e.g. Petain 's France or Franco's Spain—here the Catholic Church attempted to erect, and indeed did erect, a State in complete accord with all her tenets. The result was a monster standing upon th e armed might of twin totalitarianism: the totalitarianism of a ruthless Fascist State and the to talitarianism of Cat holicism—the most bloodthirsty hybrid yet produced by contemporary society. Wh at gives to such a creature of Vatican diplomacy its peculiar importance is that here we have an example of th e Catholic Church's implementing all her principles, unhampered by opposition, or by fear of world opini on. The uniqueness of the Independent Catholic State of Croatia lies precisely in this: that it provid ed a model, in miniature, of what the Catholic Church, had she the power, would like to see in th e West and, indeed, everywhere. As such it should be carefully scrutinized. For its significance, by tr anscending its local background, is of the greatest import to all the freedom-loving peoples of the world.

What was the price for his silence? If he was willing to forget all about certain goods in certain ca rriages, a large sum would be put at his immediate disposal. The railwayman spurned the offer, passed the informati on to his Union, who handed it over to the Press. Overnight an obscure occurrence became an interna tional sensation, and what the Catholic Austrian Government had until then carried on in the utmo st secrecy was promptly made known to the world. The Foreign Offices of Europe began to hum with unus ual activity as the threads of a vast in ternational plot, enmeshing half a dozen count ries, gradually came to light. What the railway trade unionist ha d discovered was that Austria was bl atantly dealing in arms, with the connivance of Catholic Dictator Dollfuss. At this period Austria, in common with other defeated countries, was supposed neither to buy nor sell ar ms, nor indeed have anything to do with parties connected with arms production.

Highly placed officials of the Austrian Government, an extraordinary per centage of whom proved to be fervent Catholics, semi-Fascists, or, indeed, fanatical Fasc ists, were implicated in the smuggling. The affair created a political furor. But more was ye t to come. The rifles it was eventually discovered, were not for Hungary; they were be ing sent there solely as a tempor ary depot. The weapons in reality were intended for Fascist Italy. Had that been the end of the story, the Austrian discovery would have caused sufficiently serious international repercus sions. But that was by no means all. Further investigations proved that the ulti mate destination of the weapons wa s with certain separatists who, in accord with Mussolini, were planning an armed ri sing, to detach themselves from their central Government. The separatists: certain Catholic Nati onalists of Croatia. The central government they wanted to fight: that of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The association of such extremists with an aggr essive great Power had thus transformed a purely regional affair into an international plot. This ra ised awkward international complications, not merely of a diplomatic and political na ture, but of a racial and religi ous character as well, which, by trespassing national barriers, affected the domestic a nd foreign policies of various countries, of which Fascist Italy was one. Mussolini had developed a grand expansionistic design of his own in connection with the Balkans. One of the first steppingstones to its fruition was th e partial or, if possible, the total dismemberment of Yugoslavia. This would have im plied not only the disappearance of a stumbling- block to Fascist Balkanic ambitions, but also the in corporation into Fascist Italy of former Yugoslav provinces, the most coveted of which was Dalmatia. Italian-Yugoslav relations at this period became so strained that Mu ssolini began to toy with the idea of accelerating the political disintegration of the Yugoslav Kingdom by force of arms. This could result in war. Mussolini's aggressive plans were welc omed by none more than by certain Separatists (in Croatia). This for the obvious re ason that a Fascist dismembermen t of Yugoslavia would have given them the unique opportunity they dreamed of to set up an \"independent Croatia.\" Mussolini, the most"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"powerful Fascist dictator at that period, being in a position to bring about such changes, became therefore the main hope of all thos e who backed his anti-Yugoslav polic y. These, realizing that their interests ran parallel with his, soon banked upon his active help. Th e understanding was of a concrete nature, thanks mainly to the fact that Mussolini ha d become the protector of various terrorist bands operating throughout the Balkans, the chief aims of such bodies being the destruction of the Balkan status quo , which conformed with Fascist Italy's expansionist designs. In Bulgaria one of these bands was run by me mbers of the GRIM or VRMO (Organization Revolutionnaire Interieure Ma cedonienne). Among other things , it was violently anti-Yugoslav. Because of this, one of its leaders, Ivan Mihailo ff, nicknamed Vantcha, was subventioned by Mussolini with millions of lire. In April, 1929, Vantcha met Ante Pavelic, the Ustashi leader, near Sofia. Pavelic had recently fled from Yugoslavia into Catholic Austria, King Alexander having set up a special tribunal (January, 1929) for the prot ection of the State against the subve rsive Separatist activities of the Ustashi extremists, of whom Pavelic was the chief. The purpose of the meeting was to join forces against Yugoslavia, and to put th e Bulgarian and Pavelic's terror ist organizations under the joint protection of Fascist Italy. In that year ORIM wa s granted 44 million lire. Pavelic visited Mussolini, and asked for financial help. He got 25 million lire , plus the promise of further financial aid and political protection to come. On July 17, 1929, the Yugoslav Government condemned Ante Pavelic to death in absentia . Pavelic, invigorated by the Duce's money and blessing, went from Rome to Vienna to organize, with ORIM and Italian Fascist agents, nothing less than a plot for the assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia. The plan of the assassination had been studied in all its details by Mussolini, who, to help Pavelic's work, granted him every facility. Pavelic organized hi s terrorist bands or Ustash i. At first a villa at Pessario was put at his disposal; then, when his bands grew, they were installed at the Fascist camp of Borgotaro, near Bologna, where they were reinforced by a brigade of the Fascist Secr et Police, the OVRA. Pavelic was further supplied with a false pa ssport, arms, and counte rfeit Yugoslav money. All this with a view to achieving the first Mussolini-Va ntcha-Pavelic objective: the assassination of King Alexander. A sum of 500,000 lire wa s promised by Mussolini to the Ustashi who would execute the King. The attempt took place in Zagreb in 1933. It wa s made by Peter Oreb, a terrorist, but failed completely. Mussolini's anger knew no bounds. To make su re that the next attempt should not misfire, he charged his son-in-law, Count Ciano, with the task of organizing a second coup. Senator Bocini, Chief of OVRA, and Antonio Cortese, head of the Po litical Department of the Fascist Foreign Office, were put at Ciano's disposal.

King Alexander had gone to seek French s upport against the terr oristic activities of Mussolini and of Ante Pavelie, whose headquart ers were in Fascist Italy. Pavelic, and with him the Catholic Hierarchy, wanted the coll apse of Yugoslavia so as to set up an Independent self-ruling Croatia. The plotters were all Catholic Ustashi. On October 6, 1934 they met in Paris. On October 9 King Alexander landed at the old port of Mars eilles. An Ustashi approached the royal coach, and, to the cry of \"Long Live the King!\", fired his revolver, killing the King and the French Minister Barthou. The assassin was killed on th e spot by the police. His accomplices were imprisoned for life. Ante Pavelic was conde mned to death by France, but managed to escape. Yugoslavia and France, meanwhile, owi ng to the deterioration of the poli tical situation in the Balkans, were planning to strengthen the \"Little Entente,\" the Entente Balkanique . Promoted partly by King Alexander himself, this went straight against the sc hemes, not only of Fascist Italy, but also of Nazi Germany, who had begun the promotion of a successor to the Kaiser's Drang n ach Osten. Last but not least, it was anathema to Pavelic and his followe rs. The better to consolidate the Entente, King Alexander planned to visit Bulgaria and France. On receiving this news, Count Ciano summoned Ante Pavelic and Vantcha Mihailoff to Rome. There, at the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, they discussed ways and means of killing the King. Mihail off wanted to carry out the attempt at Sofia. Ciano, Boccini, and Cortese, however, were against th is, fearing that Boris, the Bulgarian King, might be killed at the same time. Boris was no mean Ki ng. The interests of three Powers depended for their success on his head being left on his shoulders. Bori s' assassination, in fact, would have alienated Mussolini, the Vatican, and the House of Savoy. The pres ervation of Boris' life re sted in the fact that he had married King Victor's daughter; that by such a marriage Mussolini counted on expanding Italian influence in the Balkans; and that the Vatican's plan was to have the Royal children brought up as Catholics, in order to install a Catholic king in Orthodox Bulgaria , and thus strangle the Orthodox Church there from above. [1] In order to avoid such risks, therefore, at the next meeting which took place at the Hotel C ontinental in Rome, it was finally decided to kill King Alexander in France. Following this, Pavelic would stir up trouble in Croatia, while the followers of Mihailoff rebelled in Macedonia. Mussolini would intervene to ensure their success, and thus, by setting a foot in the Balkans, ca rry out his expansionist scheme in those regions. Once these plans had been agreed, Mussolini met the plotters in his Villa Torlonia. These were Vlada Georgief Cernozemski, a Bulgar ian, who had already kill ed two members of the Bulgarian Parliament in Sofia; Eugene Kvaternik, late r head of the police of Za greb in the Independent State of Croatia; and three more Catholic Ustashi, Kralj, Pospisil, and Raitch.

His death suited not only Mussolini but also Hitler. Hitler had wanted to get rid of Dictator Dolf uss, of Austria, who had prevented him from incorporating Austria into Germany. On July 25, 1934, three months before the murder of King Alexander, a group of Nazis had entered the Austrian Chancellory and assassinated Dolfuss. The triple murders se t the pace of Fascist, Ustash i and Nazi terror throughout Europe leading to the outbreak, in 1939, of the Second World War. Pavelic was supported in turn by Mussolini and Hitler. But always tacitly by the Vatican, which intermittently dealt with all three to furt her the interests of anyone ready to further the interests of the Church. Alexander and Louis Barthou, the French Foreign Mi nister, were riding, and, to the cry of \"Long live the King\" fired his revolver, ki lling both. Cernozemski was instantly killed by the police. His accomplices were arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment [3] but Ante Pavelic managed to escape, and was condemned to death, in absentia , by a French tribunal. But if the first part of the Mussolini-Pavelic pl ot had succeeded, the seco nd, the Pavelic revolt in Yugoslavia, was a complete failure: nothing happene d. Pavelic and Kvaternik fled to Italy. The French Government asked for their extrad ition, but Mussolini refused, going so far as to declare that if Yugoslavia pressed for Pavelic's extradi tion he would consider the request a casus belli . Yugoslavia appealed to the League of Nations. The League, be ing, like the United Nations, its successor, a pawn of the Great Powers, ignored the case and did no thing. The assassination cr eated turmo il throughout Europe. In Berlin the reaction was ominous: Nazi Germany accelerated the promotion of her Drang nach Osten policy. At the sudden elongation of th e Hitlerian shadow over the Central European landscape, Mussolini became cautious. Hesitation a nd, above all, the growing power of Hitler weakened his resolution, and soon the Duce-Pavelic adventure, ha ving become unwholesomely risky, was shelved, pending better times. Hitler, meanwhile, had not been idle. He had been plotting on his own, going so far as to develop a plan in Central Europe opposed to that of Mussoli ni, viz. the incorporation of Austria into Nazi Germany. This was being promoted at the very tim e when Mussolini and Pavelic were hatching their plot against Yugoslavia. Indeed, Hitler had decided on the assassina tion of the Catholic Dictator, Dollfuss, prior to Mussolini and Pavelic having carried out their plans against King Alexander.

Mussolini promp tly dispatched two divisi ons to the Brenner Pass to impede Hitler from upsetting the Balkan equili brium and thus throwing out of gear the schemes of Italian Imperialism in those regions. Hitler repaid Mussolini by cold-shouldering him after the killing of King Alexander. The two assassinati ons, however, awoke Europe to reality. Mussolini and Hitler decided to forget their pride and reach a tacit agreement. Mu ssolini left Austria to Hitler, and Hitler supported Mussol ini in his seizure of Abyssinia. From then onward Fascist-Nazi terror filled with ever-increasing echoes the politi cal corridors of Europe and even of Asia: the assassination of the Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss and of King Al exander of Yugoslavia in 1934, the Fascist war on Abyssinia in 1935, H itler's occupation of the Rhinel and in 1936, Japan's attack upon China in 1937, Hitler's incorporation of Austria in the spring of 1938, Munich in the autumn of that same year, Hitler's dismemberment of Czechoslovakia in the spring of 1939, Hitler's attack on Poland in the autumn of 1939. While all these ominous events followed one another, Pavelic, directly in t ouch with Catholic and Fascist authorities, presided over sundry plottings and intrigues, tu rning now to Mussolini and now to Hitler, according to which of the ambitions of the tw o dictators seemed to have the greater chance of success. Pavelic's strategy consisted of submitting plans to both Mussolini and Hitler for waging a terrorist campaign throughout Yugoslavia in order to force the Central Government to grant autonomy to Croatia. With the approaching storm of the Second World War, however , Hitler, having fitted Yugoslavia into a vaster scheme of his own, re oriented his policy and promoted one aimed at neutralizing Yugoslavia—indeed, at making her an ally. To avoid antagonizing the Yugoslav Government, Pavelic's activities were grea tly reduced and officially discouraged. Hitler's policy paid him handsome dividends. When the Second World War broke out, Yugoslavia remained stubbornly neutral. Indeed, on March 2 4, 1941, she entered the Nazi camp, signing a pact with Germany. Pavelic's dream seemed to have been flung into the dim future . Yet he continued to wait, in the hope that the day when destiny woul d call on him to implement his life's work was, perhaps, not far off. Footnotes 1.

But not for long. Two days later, on March 27, 1941, an anti-Nazi coup d'etat , carried out by General Mirkovic, unsaddled the pro-Nazi Yugoslav Government. While the rest of Yugoslavia celebrated the event in Zagreb, circulars, full of threats, were found on the doors of Serbs. Pavelic, who only a few days before ha d been relegated to th e background, suddenly found himself the centre of feverish activities. Orders we re conveyed to all the Usta shi, inside and outside Yugoslavia, to be ready for acti on. Ustashi leaders from Germany a nd Italy moved at speed towards the Yugoslav frontier. The German Army moved with them. On April 6, 1941, Hitler attacked the Yugoslav Kingdom. Many of Pavelic's followers joined the Nazi invaders ; others directed their arms against Yugoslavia; still others turned plain traitors—e.g. Colonel Kre n, an active fanatic, a secret member of Pavelic's army, an Ustashi who flew from Belgrade airdrome to give the Nazi Air Force the secret location of all Yugoslav aircraft, with the result that the Yugos lav war planes were destroyed on the ground by Nazi bombers, which Kren directed. Thanks to Ustashi Kren's action, the whole of the Yugoslav Air Force was thus annihilated in one single blow. While Belgrade was still burning after the Nazi air ra ids, Ante Pavelic addre ssed the Croats by radio: \"Croat soldiers,\" were his words, \"use all your w eapons against all the Serbian soldiers and officers. We are already fighting shoulder to shoulder with our new Allies, th e Germans and the Italians.\" On April 7 the Yugoslav Government left Belgrade for Montenegro. Two days later, on April 9, Vladko Macek, its Vice-President, in his turn deserted it. Macek was a Croat, a Catholic, and the leader of the Catholic Croat Peasant Part y. Yet this individual, while acting as the leader of that Party, and, indeed, as Vice-President of the Yugoslav Government, was simultaneous ly plotting with Fascist Italy for the disintegration of his country. As early as 1939 Macek had, in fact, established contact with Mussolini, who had agreed to pay him 20 million diners to finance his bold Separatist plot—that is, to destroy Yugoslavia in order to set up a Catholic Fascist State of Croa tia, as was subsequently disclosed by none other than the Fascist Foreign Minister, Count Ciano. [1] The Minister of Commerce, anot her Catholic, followed Macek's example, soon imitated by a third Minister, who treacherously and for a long time had b een a secret member, not only of the Ustashi, but also of Nazi Intelligence. He was, in fact, a lia ison with the main Nazi Intelligence Agent in Yugoslavia, D. Tomljenovitch, former Austrian officer and a Catholic, to whom he passed details of all the secret deliberations on defense which took pl ace in the Yugoslav Cabinet, of which he was a member. Following all this, while Slavko Kvaternik, having arrived in Zagreb from Italy, announced the formation of the Independent State of Croatia, Macek incited his followers to recognize the New State: \"I invite all the members of the Peasant Party of Croatia to rec ognize the change, to help the New Croatia, and, above all, loya lly to obey all its laws.\" [2] Within a few days all the secret members of Pavelic's Catholic terrorist organi zation within the civil administrati on and the Yugoslav Army came to the fore, working havoc wherever they appeared; and th is to such an extent that they quickly succeeded in paralyzing the prosecution of the war against Hitler."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Standing in sinister prominence among them all, the Us tashi initiated vigorous fighting in the rear of the Yugoslav units; while others within the Yugoslav Army carried out fifth-column activities to such an extent that nothing could be done according to pl an.

Units of Macek's \"Peasant Guard\" immediately became Ustashi units and disarmed units of the Yugoslav Army. The widespread disorganization created by Catholic extremists was su ch that it turned out to be one of the paramount factors enabling the swift N azi conquest of Yugoslavia. This was confirmed by Lorkovitch, Minister of the Fore ign Affairs of the Indepe ndent State of Croatia, in full Parliament (February, 1942): It was thanks to the support of the Croat people a nd of the Croat revolution, which have shortened the duration of the war in Yugoslavia, greatly redu ced the losses of the Germans and Italians, and permitted, at the Eastern frontier of Serbia, the death-blow to be given to Yugoslavia. [3] The promotion of such a large treacherous body within the country would have been impossible without the active cooperati on of the Catholic Church. Pavelic's te rrorist bands, the Ustashi, had been morally and financially encouraged and supported by her. Indeed, their backbone had been formed by priests, monks, and even bishops. Monasteries had been used as the clandestine headquarters of the Ustashi long before the Nazi attack. Secret sepa ratist and military activities had been disguised for years under the cloak of religion. The Catholic priesthood in Croatia , Herzegovina, and Dalmatia had repeatedly convoked so-called Eucharistic Congresse s which in reality were for extremist political purposes (e.g. those held in Pozega as late as 1940, under the fictitious name of Mary's Congregation). The sundry semi-military, illegal terrorist movements were likewise screened by the mantle of religion. Most of them were affiliated with Catholic organizations under the direct supervision of Catholic Action, which was strictly controlled by the Ca tholic Hierarchy—e.g. the Brotherhood of the Crusaders, with about 540 societies and 30,000 memb ers; the Sisterhood of the Crusaders, with 452 societies and 19,000 members; the Catholic Stud ent Associations, Domagoj, and such like. Most of the members of such reli gious organizations were active in sabotage, acts of terrorism, and a good number of them even particip ated in the treacherous disarmi ng of the Yugoslav Army following Hitler's attack.

Indeed, even after Ustashi Croatia collapsed following the disint egration of Nazi Germany. Stepinac was not only the Head of the Council of Croatian Bishops and of the Committee which carried out a policy of forcible conve rsions, he was none other than the Supreme Military Apostolic Vicar of the Ustashi Army. When Ustashi Croatia fell in 1945 as a result of the defeat of Nazi Germany and Pavelic had to run for his life, Archbishop Stepinac, in a vain effort to save the Regime, succeeded him as Head of Ustashi Croatia. Stepinac ordered special ceremonies in all the Catholic churches on Pavelic's birthday, and he frequently invoked the blessing of God upon the Ustashi. gave military training, or were sworn officers of th e Ustashi formations—e.g. Father Radoslav Cilavas, a Franciscan monk, who on April 10 and 11, 1941, disarmed the local gendarmerie, captured the Post Office, and drew local plans to prevent the mobili zation of the Yugoslav Army; or Father Chaplain Ivan Miletic, who, in collaboration with the N azis, led bands of guerrillas against the Yugoslav Government. In Herzegovina the centre of the Us tashi movement was located in the Franciscan monastery and in the high school of Siroki Brijeg. On the same day as the German Army had entere d the capital of Croatia, one of the chief Ustashi leaders, Kvaternik, proclaimed the Independent St ate of Croatia (April 10, 1941), and, while fighting between the Germans and the Yugoslav Army wa s still going on in the Bosnian mountains, Archbishop Stepinac called on the le ader of the Ustashi and urged all Croats to support the New Catholic State. On that very day the newspapers of Zagreb carried a nnouncements to the effect that all Serbian Orthodox residents of the new Catholic capital must vacate the city w ithin twelve hours, and that anyone found harbouring an Or thodox would immediately be executed. On April 13 Ante Pavelic reached Zagreb from Italy. On the 14th Archbishop Stepinac went personally to meet him and to congratulate him on the fulfillment of his life-wor k. What was Pavelic's life-work? The creation of perhaps the most ruthless Fascist tyranny ever to dishonour Europe. The establishment of Pavelic's dictatorship was rapi d, efficient, and ruthless.

The objective of his systematic crimes of murder, torture, pi llage, and wholesale massacre was nothing less than the total extermination of all non-Catholic, anti-Fascist elements in the New State. Simultaneously with the reorganization of the Usta shi, Pavelic set up a political body modeled on the Nazi Gestapo and on the Fascist OVRA, called Usta shka Nadzorna Sluzba (Ustashi Supervisory Service), which exercised absolute control over the whole population. This Ustashi Gestapo was composed of thirteen different t ypes of police: Ustashi Police; Intelligence Service; Defense Police; Security At the opening of the Ustashi Parliament, Archbishop Stepinac, af ter offering special prayers to God in a ceremony in the Cathedral, ordered the si nging of a solemn Te Deum, as thanks to the Almighty for the establishment of the Ustashi Dictatorship.

Yet what was the attitude of the Catholic Church when faced by such an abominable transformation? The Catholic Church, represented by th e Hierarchy and the Catholic Press, following Stepinac's example, promptly initiated a feverish campaign of praise for Pavelic and Hitler. A leader of the Crusaders wrote: God, who directs the destiny of nations and controls the hearts of Kings, has given us Ante Pavelic and moved the leader of a friendly and a llied people, Adolf Hitler, to use his victorious troops to disperse our oppressors and enable us to cr eate an Independent State of Croa tia.

At Easter, 1941, Stepinac announced from the Ca thedral of Zagreb the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia, thus giving the solemn sancti on of Church and Vatican to Pavelic's work. On June 28, 1941, Stepinac, with other bishops, went to see Pavelic. After promising the wholehearted cooperation of the entire Hierarc hy, the Archbishop solemnly blessed Pavelic, as the leader of the Croatian people: \"While we greet you cordially as head of the Independent State of Croatia, we implore the Lord of the Stars to gi ve his divine blessings to you, th e leader of our people.\" Pavelic, it should be remembered, was the same man who had been sentenced to death for political assassinations: once by the Yugoslav courts, a nd once by the French, for the murders of King Alexander and the French Foreign Minister, Barthou. In his hour of triumph Pavelic did not forget that a ll those who had helped the birth of a strong united Yugoslavia had contributed to the death of the Catholic Austro-Hunga rian Empire, the political pet gendarme of the Vatican, and, significantly enough, as a belated tribute to the old Austrian-Vatican alliance in the Balkans, he ordered the confisca tion of the real property of \"any persons who had volunteered with the Allies agains t Catholic Austria-Hungary during the First World War\" (Statutory Order, dated April 18, 1941).

Pre-war acts of terro rism were begun anew. Pavelic became the victim of a murder attempt hi mself. He died shortly before and after the deaths of his two main ecclesia stical supporters, Pope Pius X II and Cardinal Stepinac, still dreaming of resurrecting anew Catholic Ustashi Croatia. The throne of Croatia had originally been assign ed to the scion of the Hapsburgs—i.e. Otto. As, however, Hitler suffered from anti-Hapsburg phobia, plans had to be somewhat modified. Otto had to be discarded. A feverish exploration amid the re maining forlorn royal crowned heads of Nazified Europe was speedily initiated.

Pius XII had been the recipient of portents—that is, of phenomena w ith which only saints, it is said, are privileged. This even though such phenomena as a rule occur after death, and always when a rational scrutiny of the miracles has become impo ssible.

It must have been, for Pius X had died almost three decades earlier. Pacelli was indeed elected Pope. The fact that he ca st his own vote for himself did not really affect the issue. Pacelli became Pope Pius X II, choosing the name of Pius in honour of Pius X. [6] Ten years later, in 1950, Pius XII, after patient years of self-canoniza tion, saw the sun zig-zag in the sky of Rome. Not once, it must be noted, but on thr ee successive days. As if this were not enough, the very Mother of God appeared to him, within the convulsed sphere, \"in a spectacle of celestial movements in transmission of mute but el oquent messages to the Vicar of Christ.\" [7] It was not difficult for so extra-holy a successor of St. Peter, th erefore, to find a worthy king. The fact that Pius XII had to conduct down-to-earth secret, hard bargaining with Mu ssolini was discre etly hushed up. The chosen one?

These characteristics made of him one of the param ount personalities of our times. A match for his fellow Fascist and Communist Dictators. He , more than anybody else outside Germany, helped Hitler to power. This he did by steering the German Ca tholic Party, and top Catholic leaders, to support the Fuehrer. Pius' pet obsession was Communism. After World War 1, he allied the Church with Italian, Spanish and German Fascism, and with the USA after World War 11. He became the main instigator of the Cold War that followed. Besides being ruthless in politic al matters, he was unscrupulous in religious ones. He self- sanctified himself with alleged miracles. He cl aimed that the Virgin Mary worked a miracle personally for him, alone. He claimed also that none other than Jesus Christ himself visited and spoke to him. He practiced nepotism, that is, the granting of undeserv ed titles, riches and privileges to his own family. He was a paranoiac, on a par with Hitler and Stalin. He transformed the Catholic Church into a global political instrument, using the Catholic masses as gullible expendable pawns in his own ideological gambles. conquest of Coptic Abyssinia, where Fascism and Cat holicism were jointly to implant Catholic-Fascist civilization. King Victor, although physically a midget, was a ve ry brave man. He was already resignedly suffering under the weight of two crowns: th e kingly crown of Italy and the Imperial crown of Abyssinia. The idea of a third, that of Croatia , fired him with the most admirable democratic conviction that three crowns upon the head of one single man might be considered by envious masses as a genuine social injustice. So Victor, for the firs t time in his life, took a decision. To the chagrin of that most virtuous trinity, Pope, Duce, and Pavelic, he shouted an immortal ditty, \"Now then, that's truly much to much, even for me\" and refused. Following a moment of bewilderment, and hasty confabulations with the ot her two members of the trio, Pius Xll, thanks to a supernatural hint, found a priceless substitute: the cousin of Victor, the Duke of Spoleto. The life of a mere Duke nowadays is somewhat dull. The Duke of Spoleto, although a mere Duke, was born with above-average ducal amb ition. Hence, when political fortune blew his way, he seized her tightly by the hair. Having first made quite sure that the somewhat mood y Austrian commoner who had promoted himself to the Chancellorship of Germ any approved of him, sec ondly that the son of a blacksmith from Romagna would smile on him, and last but not least that His Holiness Pius Xll would"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"give him a triple blessing, he accepted the royal Cr oatian sceptre with a blush. A name worthy of such a crown was selected, approved, and hailed. And so it happened that a po or unknown Duke suddenly found himself the head of a new dynasty in the Ki ngdom of Croatia, and became His Most Gracious Exalted Majesty, Tomislav II. At such wonderful news a massive Ustashi delegation, led by Ante Pavelic, rushed to Rome, where, in the very seat of the Fascist Empire, on Ma y 18, 1941, Tomislav II's gracious acceptance of the Croatian Crown took place, punctuated by clicking of military heels, Fascist salutes, and hurrahs. At the Vatican the happiness of the Pope was unbounded. Ye t his fatherly heart was made a little heavy by the fact that Tomislav II, hi s triumphant political godchild, could not openly be given a solemn papal blessing. Pius XII was the head of the Univer sal Church. Catholics by th e million were at that very moment fighting with the Allies to smash that very Fascist world with which Pius was on such cordial terms. In addition to that, Pius was simulta neously the head of the Vatican State and as such— oh, happy coincidence!—a king himself. To recognize hi s new royal colleague at that juncture would have been interpreted by the democratic camp as a breach of \"papal neutrality.\" His Holiness, therefore, had to use caution. Popes claim they can unlock gates—in heaven and in hell. That is why they have St. Peter's massive keys. But very often they can ope n back doors as well down here. And, the world being what it is, that is even more important. Particularly on occasions wh en the official gates of international diplomacy have to remain firmly closed. Adept in the age-ol d Catholic Macchiavelliana Pius XII solved the riddle triumphantly. He received good King Tomislav one day before the ceremony of his coronation. Who could say this was a breach of \"pap al neutrality?\" The Duke of Spol eto was not yet officially a king. His Holiness the Pope had received him before he had legally become His Exalted Majesty, King Tomislav II. That same day Croatia was officially proclaimed a kingdom. The devout murd erer of King Alexander of Yugoslavia—that is Pavelic—was granted a long and very private audience by the Pope. Only one stenographer, who cautious Pavelic had brought with him and who was made to take the oath never to reveal what he heard, was presen t. Strengthened by what Pius Xll had told him, Pavelic called on Mussolini, with whom he signed a treaty. Following all this, the indefatigable Holy Father received and solemnly blessed Pavelic's Prime Minister and his whole Ustashi delegation. Who, again, could label this a breach of \"papal neut rality?\" All those excellent peopl e had been received merely as \"Catholic individuals,\" not as the heads of the Government of the New Croatia, declared the Osservatore Romano . Honi soil qui mat y pense . Yet the real significance of it all did not escape those who knew. Pius XII had granted all those good people a special audience, not be cause they were mere \"Catholic individuals\": he had sp ecially received, specially ble ssed, and specially praised them because, while members of the Mother Church, they were, above all, the representatives of the newly born Independent Catholic State of Croatia, a political creature stubbornly nurture d and ruthlessly promoted by that most malign of all its conceivers, the Vatican.

"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 THE NIGHTMARE OF A NATION The Independent Kingdom of Croatia, having thus officially sprung in to existence, set forth with burning zeal to fulfill all the hopes so obstinately entertained by its religious and political promoters: the Vatican and Fascism. Inspired by the gracious ly remote majesty of good King Tomislav II, under the patronage of His Holiness the Pope, protected by Hitler, watched by Mussolini, ruled by Catholic terrorists, and policed by Catholic bayonets, the New Croatia began to transform itself into the ideal commonwealth as advocated by Catholic tenets. A State, however, according to papal dicta must be regulated not only by civil but also by religious authority. So Pavelic, having determined that a reli gious equivalent of himself should partake of the rights and duties of rulership, saw to it th at the head of the Hierarchy became a de facto ruler of the New Croatia. Archbishop Stepinac, the Croatian Primate, and others , members of the Hierarchy, the religious equivalent of the Ustash i, were duly elected members of th e Sabor (Totalitarian Parliament). The military, political, and religious architraves of the new State having thus been erected, Pavelic and Stepinac set out to transform its whole structure in to what a true Catholic-Fascist State should be. Movements, institutions, men, and ev erything else were made to conf orm to the letter and spirit of Catholicism. All potential opponents—Communists, So cialists, Liberals—were either banished or imprisoned. Trade unions were abolished, workers' organizations became pitiful caricatures of their former selves, the Press was paralyzed when it wa s not altogether gagge d, freedom of speech, of expression, and of thought became memories of the pa st. Every effort was made to dragoon youth into Catholic semi-military formations; the children were marshalled by priests and by nuns. Catholic teaching, Catholic tenets, Catholic dogma became co mpulsory in all schools, in all offices, in all factories, and everywhere the iron heel of the new State was felt. Catholicism was proclaimed the main religion of the State. Other religions and those pr ofessing them were ostraci zed, chief among these, the Orthodox; while the Jews were compelled to wear th e Star of David on their clothes, all members of the Orthodox Church went in fear for their propert y, their personal and family safety. To be Orthodox had suddenly meant to be a potential victim. Soon, in all parks and public transport vehicles, a new inscription appeared: \"Entry forbidden to all Serbs, Jews, Gypsies, and dogs.\" The Ministry of the Interior, led by Andrija Artukovic, i ssued the following decree: \"All th e Serbs and the Jews residing in Zagreb, the Capital of Croatia, must leave the to wn within 12 hours. Any citizen found to have given them shelter will be immediately executed on the spot.\" While Ante Pavelic was transforming Croatia with a mailed fist, his religious equivalent, Archbishop Stepinac, facilitated the revolution by a timely nati onwide mobilization of the whole of the Catholic Church. No opportunity was allowed to pass without Stepinac openly singing the praises of, or sprinkling with oral or holy-water blessings, the new Catholic Croati a, her great Leader Pavelic, the Duce, and the great Fuehrer. When dates commemor ating the bloody ascent of Fascism to power were celebrated in Fascist Italy or in Nazi Germany, Stepinac, although in Croatia, celebrated them with no less fervour. Thus he punctiliously celebrated Oc tober 28, the day when, in 1922, the first Fascist dictatorship was installed in It aly. While Mussolini annually parade d His Black Shirt battalions in Rome on that date, Stepinac annually commemora ted the march with sp eeches, prayers, and congratulations, distributed with equal generosity also to Hitler on his ever-gloomier succeeding April birthdays. When it came to his ow n new Fascist State, however, th e archiepiscopal panegyrics became impassioned recommendations for everything don e by the New Croatia.

Additional decrees were issue d, e.g. \"Law concerning the conv ersion from one religion to another.\" On June 1, 1941, the Ustashi Premier set up an Office of Religious Affairs, in charge of \"all matters pertaining to questions connected with the conversion of the Orthodox Church\" (Decree No. 11,689). Such legislation rested upon the tenet that \"t he movement of the Ustashi is based upon the Catholic Church,\" as enunciated by M ile Budak, July 13, 1941, at Karlovac. Forcible conversions became the standard prac tice of Ustashi Croatia. The conversions were duly legalized by the State and gave immunity to the new Catholics, from arrest, from seizure of property and from execution. A mass execution carried out by the Ustashi at Brode, early in 1941. Nazi troops were looking at some of the victims."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Nazis, who for a time were posted in Croatia, were so horrified at the Ustashi atrocities that they set up special commi ssions to investigate them. The Orthodox Church of Serbia, in fact, appealed directly to th e Nazi General Dulkeman to intervene and stop the Ustashi horrors. The Germans and the Italians managed to rest rain the Ustashi while they were under their supervision. When the Nazis left Croatia, how ever, the Ustashi multip lied their atrocities, unreprimanded by the Government. Since the latter 's policy was one of total elimination of the Orthodox Serbian population via forcible conversions, expulsion, or straightforward massacre. Victims were executed in groups without trial on bridges and then thrown into the river. In May 1941 the Ustashi besieged Glina. Having ga thered together all the Orthodox males of over fifteen years of age from Karlovac, Sisa k and Petrinja, they drove them outside the town and killed 600 of them with guns, knives and sledge hammers. Russia, Stepinac flanked by Dr. Ramiro Marcone, the repr esentative of that lover of peace, Pius XII, celebrated the triumphal departure in Zagreb, su rrounded by the Catholic Hi erarchy, mumbling Latin incantations for speedy victory by those brave aquatic crusaders. Stepinac's colleagues imitated their leader with unmatched zeal—e .g. Bishop Aksamovic, of Djakovo, who was personally decorated by Pavelic because \"His Excellency th e Bishop has from the very beginning cooperated with the Ustashi authorities.\" Or Archbishop Saric— the bosom friend of Jure Francet ic, the commander of the Black Legion—who raised his right hand in the Ustashi— that is, the Nazi—salut e at every opportunity, public or private. The transformation of the Ca tholic Hierarchy into a de facto Ustashi Hierarchy had a most dreadful significance. It meant that the whole machinery of th e Catholic Church in Croa tia had been put at the complete disposal of the ruthless individuals determined to make of the new State a compact political and military unit, cemented by the most secure guarant ees of the State's indestructibility. Such a policy implied, not only the transformation of the Croatian social, cultural, a nd political fabric , but also the complete extirpation of whatever was \"alien\" to Croatian stock and to it s national religion. This required the total elimination of w hoever was not a Catholic Croat. No t an easy task, as a large portion of the new State was composed of bu lky racial-religious groups wholly foreign to Ustashi Catholicism. Out of a population of 6,700,000, in fact, only 3,300,000 were Croats. Of the remainder, 700,000 were Moslems, 45,000 were Jews, followed by sundry sm aller minorities. Over 2,000,000 were Orthodox Serbs. The inclusion in the New Croatia of so many alien elements was due to the territorial ambitions of Croat Separatism. These, as we have already se en, had been epitomized in the conception of the \"Greater Croatia\" of Ante Starcevic, who founded an extreme political party, the Croatian Law Party, subsequently elevated to the level of a fanatical National programme by Ante Pavelic. The Party's ideology, although one of racial and religious excl usiveness, accepted geographical expansion. This meant the inclusion in an independent Croatia of disputed territories, a nd hence of non-Catholic elements, which became automatically the greatest obsta cle to the complete Catholicization of the new Croat State. To solve the problem, a policy directed at the swift elimination of all the non-Croat, non- Catholic population was adopted and promptly se t in motion. This was re peatedly and publicly"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"enunciated by members of the Ustashi Governme nt—e.g. on June 2, 1941, in Nova Grarfiska, Dr. Milovan Zanitch, Minister of Justice, declared: This State, our country, is only for the Croats, an d not for anyone else. There are no ways and means which we Croats will not use to make our country tr uly ours, and to clean it of all Orthodox Serbs. All those who came into our country 300 years ago must di sappear. We do not hide th is our intention. It is the policy of our State, and during its promotion we shall do nothing else but follow the principles of the Ustashi. Dr. Mile Budak, Minister of Education and of Cults , lost no time in enlighten ing his listeners of the nature of such principles. During hi s first Press interview as a Minist er, when asked what the policy of Croatia would be in relation to the non-Croat r acial and religious minorities, his reply was an ominously simple one: \"For them\" (the minorities), he said, \"we have three million bullets.\" This was not the boasting of a fanatical individual. It wa s the epitomization of a policy, coolly planned by Pavelic in concert with the Cat holic Hierarchy, which was set in motion immediately when the Nazis invaded Yugoslavia. Dr. Milovan Zanich, Dr. Mi rko Puk, Dr. Victor Gutic h, Ustashi Ministers, unhesitatingly declared that the New Croatia would get rid of all the Se rbs in its midst, in order to become 100 per cent Catholic \"within ten years.\" On July 22, 1941, the plan was again officially confirmed by Dr. Mile Budak: \"We shall kill one part of the Serbs,\" were his words, \"we shall transport another, and the rest of them will be for ced to embrace the Roman Catholic religion. This last part will be absorbed by the Croatian elements.\" Wa ys and means to enact such a scheme were swiftly adopted. The most radical and most ruthless: mass removal of Serbians from the contested zone. According to the Ministers, one-third of these were to be transported to Serb ia proper, one-third would be \"persuaded\" to embrace Catholicism, and the remainder would be \"disposed of\" by other means. \"Other means\" soon signified bi ological exterminati on, and \"persuasion\" fo rcible conversion. Conversion and extermination spelt one thing: the total annihilation of the Orthodox Church. That, in fact, turned out to be the offici al policy of the New Catholic St ate of Croatia. Such a policy was \"The Pit of Death\" An Orthodox Serb being thro wn alive into a mass grave in the notorious concentration camp of Jasenovac, in 1942. \"The Pit of Death\" was reserved for those Se rbs who challenged thei r Catholic converters. The camp, when run by the Franciscan Monk, Fath er Filipovic, squalled in horrors Dachau Concentration Camp. These horrors, however, we re often committed in rural districts as well.

The barbarity created such a commotion, ev en among the Nazis, that they set up a Committee to exhume the bodies and took photogra phs as evidence. The oral process was incorporated in an official Nazi document, \"Ustachenwerk bet Bjelovar.\" Corpses of children starved to death in the notorious Concentration Camp of Jasenovec, whose Commandant at one time was a Francisc an Monk, Father Filipovic. Father Filipovic, following the advice of Father D. Juric, let more than 2,000 other Orthodox children die while the camp was still under his rule, Jasenovac Concentration Camp distinguished it self because of the number of young inmates sent there. In 1942 the Camp held ove r 24,000 Orthodox youngsters. Twelve thousand of them were murdered in cold blood by the Commandant. Special camps for children were set up in many pa rts of Croatia. Those who were sick or too old to change their religion were made to pe rish through neglect or where simply massacred. An Ustashi named Ante Urban, a pious Catholic, protested indignantly at his trial after the war when accused of having killed hundreds of children. He asked the Judge to consider the accusation a lie, \"Since,\" he explained, he had kill ed personally \"only sixty-three of them.\" formally put forward in Parliament by, among others , Dr. Mirko Puk, the Ustash i Minister of Justice and Religion: \"I shall also make re ference to the so-called Serbian Or thodox Church,\" he said. \"In this regard I must emphatically state that the Independen t Croatian State cannot a nd will not recognize the Serbian Orthodox Church.\" [2] Pavelic's triple programme was made to opera te simultaneously everywhere, following the establishment of the New State. Its execution was si mple, direct, and brutal. It ranged from hurried decrees—like that issued by his new Mi nister of Public Instruction only four days after Hitler's attack (April 10, 1941), which barred members of the Serbian Orthodox Church from entering the University"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"unless they had given up the Orthodox faith be fore April 10, 1941—to wholes ale deportations, like those carried out on July 4 and 5, 1941, by the Ustash i in Zagreb; to the massacre of men, women, and children, like that of Kljuch, on July 31, on A ugust 31, on September I and 2, 1941, when the \"Flying Ustashi\" summarily executed approximately 2,000 Serbs. [3] In a State insanely bent on a polic y of racial-religious extermination, laws and legality, when observed, were nothing but tragic mockeries. The Courts Extraordinary alrea dy mentioned, for instance, always condemned regardless of evidence, did not permit the right to appeal , and their sentences had to be carried out within three hours of pronouncement. Thus, these courts sentenced an immense number of people to death without offering them any opportunity for defense, and their sentences were strictly applied. In most cases the courts punished \"collectively,\" under the guise of \"trials.\" One bench alone, for instance, that of Zagreb, within two days —August 4 and 5, 1941—sentenced to death 185 persons; that of Stem, from August 3 to 25, 1942, 217 persons; the proceedings at the mobile court at Ruma on August 3, 1942, lasted only two and a half hours, during which twenty-s ix persons were sentenced to death. At Stara Pazova, on August 8, 1942, the court proceedings lasted on ly half an hour, and eighteen people received the death sentence. At Ruma on August 10, 1942, a defending counsel appointed by the Ustashi handled the defe nse of twenty-five persons, whom he met for the first time at the trial, the chairman of the bench allowing him only two minu tes for each person. The Tribunals, a most tragic mockery of justice, were veritable instruments of extermination, as pr oved by the fact that within four years one bench alone of the mobile court extr aordinary of Zagreb, headed by Ivan Vidnjevic, sentenced to death 2,500 citizens. But while the Tribunals had at l east a semblance of legality, the Ustashi found means to exterminate thousands of persons by a quicker method—i.e. by dispatching them to concentration camps and disposing of them there. The institution and supervision of these camps were exclusively in the hands of Pavelic, who personally attended to their management. The arrests and deportations to these camps rested with the Ustashi, who could send to them a nyone they judged to be an \"unreliable person,\" and who had absolute authority to ki ll immediately on arrival anyone ta ken there. Indeed, there \"was agreement,\" to quote Ljubo Milos, Commandant of the Jasenovac concen tration camp, \"that all sentenced to three years, or not sentenced at all, were to be liquidated at once. \"3 By virtue of this, inmates of the camps were murdered indiscriminatel y, either individually or collectively, without even a legal excuse. Thus, in March, 1943, the inmates of the Djakovo Camp were purposely infected with typhus, causing the deaths of 567 persons; on Septem ber 15, 1941, all those inmates of the Jasenovac camp who were unable to work, numbering between 600 and 700, were killed; in the camp of Stara Gradiska, 1,000 women were kill ed. Of 5,000 Orthodox Serbs being ta ken to Jasenovac camp at the end of August, 1942, 2,000 were killed en route, the remainder were tr ansferred to Gradina, where on August 28 they were put to death with hammer s. In the Krapje Camp, in October, 1941, 4,000 prisoners were murdered; while in the Brocice Camp, in November, 1941, 8,000 prisoners were killed. From December, 1941, to February, 1942, at Velika Kosutarica, at Jasenovac, over 40,000 Orthodox Serbs were massacred, while in the Jasenovac ca mp, in the summer of 1942, about 66,000 Orthodox Serbs, brought from the villages of the Bosnian Marches, were slaughtere d, including 2,000 children. Children were not spared, and special concentration camps were set up fo r them. Nine of these were at Lobor; Jablanac, near Jasenovac; Ml aka; Brocice; IJstici; Stara Gradiska; Sisak; Jastrebarsko; and Ciornja Rijeka. The destruction of infants in these places would be incredible, were it not vouched for by eyewitnesses, one of whom has testified:"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"At that time fresh women and children came daily to the Camp at Stara Gradiska. About fourteen days later, Vrban [Commandant of the Camp] ordered all children to be separated from their mothers and put in one room. Ten of us were told to carry them there in bla nkets. The children crawled about the room, and one child put an arm and leg through the doorway, so that the door could not be closed. Vrban shouted: 'Push it!' When I did not do that, he banged the door and crushed the child's leg. Then he took the child by its whole leg, and banged it on the wall till it wa s dead. After that we continued carrying the children in. When the room was full, Vrban brought poison gas and killed them all. [4] At his trial, Ante Vrban proteste d that he had not killed hundreds of children person ally, \"but only sixty-three.\" [5] In 1942 there were some 24,000 children in the Jasenovac camp alone, 12,000 of whom were cold- bloodedly murdered. A very large portion of the re mainder, having subsequently been released following pressure by the International Red Cross, perished wholesale from intense debilitation. One hundred of these infants, aged up to twelve months , for instance, died after release from the camp because of the addition of caustic soda to their food. Dr. Katicic, Chairman of the Red Cross, shocked by these mass murders, lodged the strongest protest, threatening to denounce to the world this mass slaughter of infants. As a reply, Pavelic had Dr. Katicic flung into the concentrati on camp of Stara Gradiska. That was not all. Even worse horrors—if worse th ere could be—took place in Pavelic's concentration camps. There were cases when the victims were burned alive: The cremation at Jasenovac took place in the spring of 1942. In this they mean t to imitate the Nazi camps in Germany and Poland, so Picilli had the noti on of making the brickworks into a crematorium, where he did succeed, out of 14 ovens (7 a side) in making an oven for cremating people. There was then a decision to cremate people alive , and simply open the huge iron door and push them alive into the fire already alight there. That plan, however, excited terrible reaction am ong those who were to be burned. People shrieked, shouted and defended themselv es. To avoid such scenes, it was resolved first to kill them and then to burn them. [6] The representatives of the \"only true Church\" not only knew of such horrors: not a few of them were authorities in these same concentration camps, a nd had even been decorated by Ante Pavelic—e.g. Father Zvonko Brekalo, of the concentration cam p of Jasenovac, who was decorated in 1944 by the leader himself with the \"Order of King Zvonimi r\"; Father Grga Blazevitch, Assistant to the Commandant of the concentration camp of Bosanski-Novi; Brother T ugomire Soldo, organizer of the great massacre of the Serbs in 1941; and others.

At the last na med place victims were wired together in groups of twenty, taken to the e dge of a 1000 feet cliff, where the Ustash i killed the first persons only, so that they dragged the others down alive with them. Pavelic participated personally even against Croat villages—e.g. on December 1, 1941, when Cerje, Pasnik, and Jesenje were razed, on which occasion seven women, four children, and nine old men were killed and thrown into a burning hou se; or in 1945, when the village of Jakovlje was razed, after most of its inhabitants had been murdered. In April, 1941, in the village of Gudovac, 200 Serb p easants were killed by Ustashi, followed by larger groups in the villages of Stari Petr ovac, in the district of Nova Grad iska, and in Glina. There, in the early days of May, 1941, Ustashi from Karlovac, Sisa k, and Petrinja gathered together all males over fifteen years of age, drove them in trucks outside the town, and executed them all. Often the executions were committed in the homes of the victims, with the most primitive weapons. Some Ustashi specialized in dispos ing of their charges by crushing thei r skulls with hatchets, or even with hammers. Incredible but authenticated atroc ities were committed wherever the Ustashi appeared. At Dubrovnik, Dalmatia, for instance, Italian sold iers took pictures of an Ustashi wearing two \"necklaces.\" One was a string of cut-out eyes, the other of torn tongues of murdered Serbs. [1] Mass deportations and mass executions, mainly in is olated small towns and villages, were well- planned operations. As a rule, the procedure was a simple one. Ustashi authorities summoned groups of Serbs under the pretext of recruitment for milit ary service or public works. Once rounded up, they were surrounded by detachments of armed Ustashi, taken outside the village, and executed. In the mountainous regions of Upper Da lmatia, like Bosnia and Herzegovina, women and children were taken to remote spots and massacr ed. In Brcko, the home town of Dzafer Kulenovic, Ustashi Deputy Prime Minister, the prisoners were executed on bridges and then thro wn into the river. At the beginning of May, 1941, the Ustashi besieged Glina, and, having gathered all Orthodox males over fifteen years of age from Karlovac, Sisak, and Pe trinja, drove them outside the town and killed all 600 of them with guns, knives, and sledge-hammers. The following day all the other Serbs were also murdered. The center of the massacre was in the village of Bosanski Grabovac."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"On August 3, 1941, over 3,000 Serbs were Likewise massacred in Vrgin-Most. On July 29, 1941, Bozidar Cerovski, chief of the Ustashi police in Zagreb, arrived in the lo cality of Vojnic; having rounded up more than 3,000 Serbs from Krnjak, Kr stinje, Siroka Reka, Slunj, Rakovica, and other villages, he led them to Pavkovitch, where he had them all massacred near a village mill. In the villages of Baska, Perna, and Podgomolje, Bosa nska Krupa district, in the summer of 1941, 540 women and children were locked in hous es, which were then set on fire. In the village of Crevarevac about 600 people were burned in their houses . In the district of Cazin, at Mlinici Smiljanic, more than sixty women and children were burned to death. Five hundred people were massacred at Bugojno. At Slavonska Pozeg a, 500 peasants, brought from Bosnia, were Ustashi cutting the throat of one of their Serbian Orthodox vic tims. Notice how a Ustashi is holding a vessel to collect the fi rst spurt of blood and thus pr event their uniforms from being blood stained. The brutal crime—one of many—look place near Cajaice in 1943. This type of execution was not exceptional. So me Ustashi specialized in dispatching their Orthodox prisoners in this manner. Catholic priests, friars, and, indeed, even so me of their pupils, followed their example. The case of Peter Brzica is undoubtedly one of the mo st incredible in this category. Brzica was a law student and an ardent member of the fore mast Catholic organization called the Catholic Crusaders. During the day and night of 29t h August 1942, Brzica cut the throats of 1300 prisoners in the Concentration Camp of Jase novac. He was rewarded with a gold watch and proclaimed King of Cutthroats. Dr. Nikola Kilolic, a Croat and a Catholic, was an eyewitness to the deed. "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"From left to right: Djuro Vranje sh, the author, and Slanko Djokie. Djuro Vranjesh, Orthodox Serb, wa s born at Selo Cetina, Velika, Dalmatia. His uncle, Illija A. Vranjes, one day in July 1941 was arrested by a detachment of Ustashi, who without even bothering to give any legal excuse tortur ed him to death, hacking him to pieces, while still alive. This they did with such horrifyi ng fiendishness that once he was finally dead, his nephew, Djuro Vranjesh, seen above, had to us e a blanket in which to collect the chopped members of the body. On the 30 January 1942 the Ustashi descended on the village of Bosanska Ribnica, where Stanko Djokic (above, right) lived with his family. While he was up in the woods the Ustashi dragged his wife and her five childre n to the banks of the nearby little river of Ribaica, and without even asking them if they wanted to become Ca tholics, massacred the lot. Six months later, when Stanko Djokic came back, he found the six corpses of his family still lying there where they had been k illed. He buried them with his own hands. killed. In some districts of Stem, in the summ er of 1942, over 6,000 Serbs were killed. At Bihac, within one single day in June, 1941, 2,000 Serbs were killed; while during July and August of the same year over 12,000 more were massacred. In the Bosans ka Krupa district, in the summer of 1941, a total of 15,000 people were killed. Such mass murders were carried out in the most sy stematic fashion, and were often planned directly from Zagreb. At times they were semi-legalized by statutory orders. For in stance, On October 2, 1941, Pavelic issued a \"statutory order\" th at in any case of attack against the Ustashi, as a reprisal, without any court procedure, ten persons to be chosen by the police were to be shot. On October 30, 1943, in another \"statutory order\" he orde red reprisals by shooting, hanging, or sending to concentration camps hostages to be chosen by the poli ce, together with their parents, children, and spouses. On June 30, 1944, he appointed a special Deputy for pronouncing such measures of reprisal. Under these orders a large number of citizens were shot, hanged, or take n to concentration camps without any trial. At Ruma on August 14, 1942, for instance, ninety hostag es were shot; at Sremska Mitrovica, on August 19, 1942, another ninety; and at Vukovar, on August 24, 1942, 140 hostages. The worst atrocities, strange as it may seem, were carried out by members of the intelligentsia. The case of Peter Brzica is undoubtedly one of the most incredible in this cat egory. Peter Brzica had attended the Franciscan College at Siroki Brijeg, Herzegovina, was a law student, and a member of the Catholic organization of the Crusaders (Krizari). In the concentration camp at Jasenovac, on the night of August 29, 1942, orders were issued for executions. Bets were made as to who could liquidate the largest number of inmates. Peter Brzica cut the th roats of 1,360 prisoners with a specially sharp butcher's knife. Having been proclaimed the prize-wi nner of the competition, he was elected King of the Cut-throats. A gold watch, a silver service, a nd a roasted sucking pig a nd wine were his other rewards. A doctor, Dr. Nikola Kiloli c, himself a Croat, was an eyewitn ess in the camp when the event took place, and subsequently testified to the authenticity of th is astonishing deed. [2] Mass murders were supplemented by the massacre of i ndividuals and of small numbers, as part of the well-calculated policy of the Government, which had th em carried out uninterrupted ly in rural districts, with a view to terrorizing the popul ations. Cases of the utmost feroci ty which occurred all over Croatia would be unbelievable were they not authenticated. In September, 1942, the Ustashi carried out a raid"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"on the village of Dukovsko, and killed anyone on sight . Among other deeds they threw eight men into a pit. One of these saved himself by getting hold of a protruding rock. The Ustashi, noticing this, amused themselves by hurling heavy stones at him until he dropped to the bottom and died. Others— mostly people who were related, or members of the same family—w ere tied together and similarly thrown into a pit. In July, 1941, a youth of sixteen, Slavko Popovic, wa s taken by the Ustashi to a field, ordered to dig a grave, killed while doing so, and buried in it. On Se ptember 20, 1942, a group of escaping people were caught by the Ustashi. A ll of them—fifty-four men and women—were massacred, their bodies heaped up and set on fire. In June, 1943, the Ustashi, passing through the village of Zijimet, rounded up those who had not had time to escape—seventy-four old men, women, and children—put them into a shed, which they se t on fire. All were burned alive. Among them were the aunt and her two children of Vojislav Zivanic, who lost twenty-five memb ers of his large family, including his father and brother, mass acred by the Ustashi during these raids. [3] These were not isolated instances. The Ustashi more often than not massacred all the inhabitants of Serb villages, callously torturing and killing even children, and then setting the villages on fire. In the village of Susnjari, for instance, th e Ustashi, after having k illed most of the inhabitants, led away about twenty surviving children, whom they tied to the th reshold of a big barn, which was then set on fire. Most of the children, of an aver age age of about ten, were burne d alive. The few who survived, horribly scorched, were eventually killed. [4] Eye-witnesses testified to similar occurrences: In the village of Gorevac, on September 13, 194i, chil dren of about 3 years of age were impaled. In some places mothers threw themselves down with ch ildren in their arms, and one stake perforated mother and child. Some young girls had their breasts tied or cut, othe rs had their hands made to pass through them. Men had their ears and noses sawn away, and eyes had been uprooted from their sockets.\" [5] On April 28, 1941, Ustashi encircled the villages of (Judovac, Tuke, Brezovac, Klokocevac, and Bolac, in the district of Bjelovar, Orthodox worshippers, when not dispatched to concentration camps, suffered the same fate us their clergy. Congregations, unless willing to change their religion, were not only persecuted, hunted down and arrested; but, at tim es, besides being massacred by the Ustashi bayonets or machine guns, they were ki lled within their own churches. There were instances even when they were burned alive within them. To terrorize the population into becoming Ca tholic, the Ustashi very often hanged lay Orthodox Leaders and their Orthodox parish pr iests during mass executions under the very"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"eyes of the faithful. This was one of the most tangible methods of \"persuasion\" whenever the Orthodox proved obdurate. Those who escaped with their lives were sent to concentration camps, while about 700 that is, one quarter of the total number of Orthodox priests—were murdered by the Ustashi in this manner. Above, Orthodox priests and Serbs, hanged together for defying the policy of the Ustashi and of the Catholic clergy. The ordinary Orthodox clergy became the target of Ustashi Catholic ferocity. Priests were imprisoned, hunted down, or simply massacred. Orthodox priests, before being executed or hanged, very often were horribly tortured, e.g. Father Branko Dobrosavlievich, from Velinn, w ho had to read the obituary of his own son, whom the Ustashi killed in his presence after horribly mutilating him. On April 20, 1941, in the village of Svinjica, the Ustashi arrested the Orthodox priest, Father Babic, and after knifing him all over bur ied him, still alive, in an upright position. Within a few weeks the Ustashi, encouraged by Catholic Padres, murdered 135 Orthodox priests, of whom eight-five came from one single Orthodox diocese. Hundreds of Orthodox clergy perished thus only because they were priests of a religion which refused to join \"the true Church.\" In this photograph: two Orthodox priests hange d in public, without trial, by the Catholic Ustashi. arresting 250 Orthodox peasants, among whom wa s Stevan Ivankovitch and the Orthodox priest, Bozin. Having led them all to a fiel d, the Ustashi ordered them to dig their own graves; after which their hands were tied behind their backs and they were pushed alive into their graves . This feat created a commotion even among the Nazis, who set up a Committee charged with the specific task of exhuming the bodies and taking photographs as eviden ce. The \"oral process\" wa s incorporated in an official document of Nazi Germa ny, under the title of Ustachenwerk bet Bjelovar. In a memorandum"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"drafted by an officer sent to protect the Orthodox population of Eastern Bosn ia during the terrible massacre of August, 1941, there was, among other things, the following: During our journey towards the hill of Javor, near Srebrenica and Ozren, all th e Serbian villages which we came across were wholly deserted. But inside the houses very often we find whole families massacred. We even came across some barrels filled wi th blood. In the villages between Vlasenica and Kladanj we discovered children who had been impa led upon stakes, their small members still distorted by pain, resembling insects stuck upon pins.\" [6] In the town of Sisak the Ustash i arrested an Orthodox Serb industr ialist, Milos Teslitch, well known for his kindness, and burned him alive. One of thos e most responsible for this crime was Catholic Ustashi Faget. [7] To crown all these horrors, some Ustashi did not hesita te to crucify their victim s. To mention only two: Luke Avramovitch, former member of Parliament, a nd his son, who were both crucified and then burnt in their own home in Mliniste , in the district of Glamoc. [8] Such atrocities occurred with a frequency that shocke d even the Ustashi's ideological allies: the Italian Fascists and the German Nazis. This to such an ex tent that on more than on e occasion both the Italian and German authorities not only de prived the Ustashi of the command of whole regions, but actually ousted them altogether, replacing th em with Italian or German troops , to prevent a repetition of the terrible individual and mass murders committed by Pavelic 's Catholic units. It will suffice for us to mention two typical cases which led to such a re placement. On August 2, 1941, the Ustashi authorities of Vrgin-Most and of Cemernica announced that all Serbs who did not wish to be molested had better assemble on the following day at 3 a.m. in Vrgin-Most, Mass executions, with the Ustash i, took sundry forms. Often they assembled the members of the village outside, and then shot the lot. Or they shut a whole c ongregation inside their church and then set fire to it. When in a hu rry, however, they became experts at individual and mass hangings. Their expertise was a regular feature of their barefaced terrorization. This was particularly so during th e last years of their regime. Here are a few examples. On August 7, 1944, they hanged ten persons: on August 26 at Jablanac, near Zapresic, thir ty-six people. On September 30th, between the stations of Pusca, Bistra and Luka, ten pe rsons. On October 4, at St. Ivan, twenty-nin e persons. On October 5, again at Zapresic, five persons. On October 6th, Cucerje, twenty persons. On October 9, at Velika Gorica, thirteen persons . On the same at Svetaa Nedjelja, near"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Samobor, eighteen persons. On December 28, at Krusljevo Selo, fifty persons. Above, one of their last mass hangings, in Saraje vo, prior to the collapse of Ustashi Croatia in 1945. where Catholic priests would be waiting to conve rt them to Catholicism. About 5,000 people followed this advice. Instead of Catholic priests, units of Ustashi, armed with machine guns, encircled the assembled crowd, who were held prisoners until th e following day, when they were all massacred. Among them were thirty-seven ch ildren under ten years of age. [9] Not long afterwards, on August 20, 1941, another unit of the Ustashi arrested all Serbs in the neighboring region of Lijevno, took them to the w oods of Koprivnica, between Bugojno and Kupres, and killed them all. A few days later they arre sted all the surviving families, whom they also massacred on the same spot. Before the massacre, women and even young girls were raped, after which most of them had their br easts cut and arms and legs br oken. Some old men, before being executed, were blinded by way of having their eyes cut with knives or torn from their sockets. [10] Five hundred women and children were hurled into pits in the hills of Tusnica and Komasnica, while another eighty women and children we re massacred in the village school of Celebic. The Italian Fascist authorities were so shocked by such incredible crue lty that, in addition to di spatching their troops to protect the surviving population and occupying th e region of Lijevno and neighbouring places, they dispersed the Ustashi and sent a protest to Zagreb. Ustashi were committing no less abominable atrocities in other parts of the country. In the town of Prijedor, for instance, during th e night of July 31-August l, 19 41, they massacred 1,400 men, women, and children, leaving their corpses to rot in the houses and in the stre ets. The Nazis nearby, horrified at such wholesale butchery, entered the town, compelli ng the Ustashi to leave. The Nazis had records of massacres of their own second to none. Yet the horrors committed by Pavelic's Ustashi troops proved to be of such bestiality as to shock even them: a most crushing evidence that the Ustashi massacres had surpassed anything experienced even by the Germa ny of Hitler. The magnitude of the butchery can best be gauged by the fact that within the fi rst three months, from April to June, 1941, 120,000 people perished thus. Proportionately to it s duration and the smallness of the territory, it had been the greatest massacre to take place anywhere in the West prior t o, during, or after that gr eatest of cataclysms, the Second World War.

"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Chapter 6 \"CHRIST AND THE USTASH I MARCH TOGETHER\" If the first ingredient of Usta shi super-nationalism was race, the second was religion. The two could hardly exist independently, having been so closely intertwined as to have become almost synonymous. The word Croat, in fact, signified Catholic, as much as, in Croatia, Ca tholic came to signify Croat. If this was useful to Ustashi racialism, it was no less beneficial to Catholicism, in so far as, once the theory had been established that Catholic meant Croa t, the idea that Croatia had to be totally Catholic not only became firmly rooted: it was turned into one of the basic tenets of the new State. The results of such an identification were porte ntous. For, while nationalism had embarked upon a policy of 100 per cent raci alism, the Catholic Church had embark ed upon an inevitable parallel policy of 100 per cent Catholicism. The two policies were in effect one single policy, the political authorities automatically furthering the religious interests of Ca tholicism, while the religious authorities furthered the political interests of Ustashi racialism. The actual process of integrating th e two into an inseparable organic, religio-political unit, not only was conducted by individual Catholic s or Catholic organizations, lik e the Crusaders, or Catholic political leaders like Macek: it was promoted by the Catholic clergy prior to the birth of the Ustashi State. Catholic priests, in fact, vigorously pr eached Fascism before the Second World War. The Catholic Press, controlled by them, became Fascism' s mightiest propaganda organ. In it they advocated the Fascist Corporate State, praised the Fascist Cat holic dictators, and preach ed racial theories—e.g. the theory that the Croats were not of Slav descen t, but were Gothic German. One of the founders of this race theory was a well-known Catholic priest , Kerubin Segvic, who as far back as 1931 wrote a book entitled, The Gothic Descendance of the Croats, with a view to creating racial odium against the Slavs, which was synonymous with \"Orthodox.\" Fascist nations were hailed as glorious examples for the future Croatia. In its issue of Ap ril 3, 1938, for instance the Catholic daily, Hrvatska Straza , praised Fascist Hungary for \"sol ving the social problem by accepti ng the main principle of the Christian Corporate State.\" The same paper, on March 2, 1938, greeted the Anschluss with: \"Young Croatia for Anschluss.\" The Catholic Press preached Catholic Nazism on th e model of that planted in Slovakia by the Catholic Nazi dictator priest, Mgr. Tiso. The Zagreb Katolicki List, the organ of Archbishop Stepinac, in January, 1940, carried an article entitled \"Catholic ism and Slovakian National Socialism,\" which read in part: In a modern state, which placed the interests of th e people above all other considerations, the Church and the State must cooperate in order to avoid a ll conflicts and misundersta ndings. Thus, in accordance with the teachings of Chri st, the Church in Slovakia had already ex erted itself to arrange a new life for the Slovakian people. The views of Dr. Tuka are fulfilled by the formation of a 'people's Slovakia, which has the approval of the President of the Repub lic, Mgr. Dr. Josip Tiso. In the National-Socialist system in Slovakia, the Church will not be persecut ed. Persecutions will be used against the opponents of National-Socialism. The achievements of Catholic Fascism were continua lly glorified in Hungary, in France under Catholic Petain, in Spain under Catholic Fr anco. The chief Catholic daily, Hrvatska Straza, the editor of which, Dr. Janko Shimrak, became a bishop under Pavelic, open ly and consistently pr aised Hitler's successes"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"in domestic and foreign policy. In the issue of March 12, 1938, Hitler's occupation of Austria was defended and praised. Later this paper hailed Hitler 's successes in Czechoslovakia, Poland, and France. The Katolicki Tjednik , organ of Catholic Action, published unde r the direction of the Archbishop of Sarajevo, Dr. Ivan Saric, printe d articles entitled \"A New Order Must Come\" (e.g. in issue No. 4, 1941), before Hitler attacked Yugoslavia. The Catholic Press, by propagating Nazi-Ustashi ideas, played a tr emendous role in conditioning the people to what eventually happened, reaching as it did people in all walks of life. Its influence was great, and helped to an enormous extent to represent Pavelic and th e Ustashi as having been sent by God to the Croatian people. It became especially skillful in sowing the seeds of religious hatred towards the Serbs, racial hatred towards the Jews , and hatred for Yugoslavi a. Immediately after the proclamation of the Independent State of Croatia it placed itself unreservedly at the disposal of the Ustashi, thus following the example of the Catho lic clergy, who took an activ e part in helping the Ustashi, with weapons in their hands, in the disruption of the Yugoslav Kingdom. At many points Catholic priests, a nd even Catholic friars, helped to form treacherous Ustashi armed bands with the precise objective of attacking the Yugoslav Army from the rear. Many of these clerics boasted openly of their military activities. The explo its of others who fell in battle were recalled in their obituaries. The Catholic weekly, Nedelja , in its issue of June 22, 1941, describe s in an article entitled, \"The Last Convulsion of Yugoslavia on the Island of Pag,\" the manne r in which the priest on that island took part in disarming the Yugoslav Army: Late at night younger Croatians would follow the de velopment of events. The Reverend Stipanov in Vlasici on Pag would also listen to th e news and ride to inform the o fficers and soldiers. Thus the news events found us prepared and enthusiastic. It wa s decided to disarm th e officers from Serbia The Ustashi paper, Hrvatski Narod, on July 4, 1941, hailed the Franci scan priest Dr. Radoslav Glavas as a great organizer of the Usta shi. The article said in part: A young and energetic Franciscan, Dr. Radoslav Glavas, came to Siroki Greg and placed himself al the head of the struggle. A plan was even drawn to prevent the mobilization of the Yugoslav Army. Thus the historic day of April 10 was welcomed, and in the night between Apr il 10 and 11 the Ustashi disarmed the local gendarmerie and captured the post office. The Ustashi periodical, Za Dom , No. 1, of April, 1941, adds: Another priest, joining forces with two customs guards, captured two generals and 40 officers, while a Franciscan brother, with the help of a number of youths, disarmed an entire Serbian company. Hrvatski Narod , No. 251, of June 4, 1944, page 3, carried a death notice, written by priest Eugen Beluhan, of Chaplain Ivan Miletic, which in describing his Ustashi acti vities asserted: \"As a priest he assisted in the disruption of the Y ugoslav Army during the revolution.\" Th ere is an endless list of such reports in the files of the War Crimes Commission. Following the fall of Yugoslavia and the rise of the independent State of Croa tia, the Catholic Press came all out for Pavelic and his Ustashi. Vjesnik Pocasne Straze Srca Isusova (The Courier of the"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Honourable Guards of Christ's Hear t) contained, in issues Nos. 5 a nd 6, 1941, an article entitled, \"The Banner of Croatia—the Heart of Chri st,\" in which the \"resurrection\" of Croatia was compared to that of Christ: In the early spring the Croatian people experienced th eir resurrection at the time of Christ's resurrection. The great son of th e Croatian people returned and gave them their liberty and ancient rights. And this is also the work of God; the Lord did it all and that is why it is strange to our eyes. Glasnik Biskupije Bosanske i Sremske (The Voice of the Bosnian and Srem Bishoprics), No. 13, of July 15, 1941, imitating Pope Pius XI, who had calle d Mussolini the man sent by Divine Providence, called Pavelic a man of Providence: Holy is this year of the resurre ction of the Independent State of Croatia. The gallant image of our chieftain appeared in the rainbow. It can and it must be said of him that his is a man of Providence. Glasnik Sv. Ante (The Voice of Saint Anthony), in its issue of December 12, 1941, went further, declaring that the birth of the Indepe ndent State of Croatia was God's work: The Croatians, who are mostly a Ca tholic people, consider such a great histor ical event as some fortunate accident, or as a stroke of luck. No, this is the work of God and Providence. Even this was not enough. The Ustashi were compared to no one else but Chri st. Witness the voice of the Crusader movement, Nedelja , which, in its issue of June 6, 1941, in an article ent itled, \"Christ and Croatia,\" declared the following: Christ and the Ustashi and Christ and the Croatians march together through history. From the first day of its existence the Ustashi movement has been figh ting for the victory of Christ's principles, for the victory of justice, freedom, and truth. Our Holy Savi our will help us in the future as he has done until now, that is why the new Ustashi Croatia will be Christ's, ours and no one else's. Catholic leaders, priests, and i ndeed bishops were given positions in the Ustashi State. Immediately after Pavelic assumed power many priests were appoint ed to local and provinci al administrative posts in the newly created Ustashi State. To mention only a few: the Catholic prie st Ante Klaric Tepelun, from the village of Tramosnica, district of Gradacac, who in Ap ril, 1941, became an Ustashi tabornik, and took part in disarming the Yugoslav Army. Fath er Emanuel Rajich, priest in Gornji Vakuf, who participated in disarming the Yugoslav Army, or ganized Ustashi rule in Gornji Vakuf, and was appointed Ustashi tabornik, in whic h capacity he organized the first Ustashi army unit in Gornji Vakuf. Novi List , No. 54, in 1941, reported the appointment of priest Stjepan Lukic to the post of logorni pobocnik (camp adjutant) of the Zepce camp. Cecelja Mar tin, priest in Recica, District of Karlovac, was appointed to the post of Ustashi tabornik for th e county of Recica. Dr. Dragutin Kamber, priest in Doboj, was appointed in April, 1941, to the post of Ustashi commandant for the District of Doboj, with all political and civil powers t hus concentrated in his hands. No. 34 of the same paper, dated July I, 1941, carried an order of the Government appointing priest Didak Coric to the post of tabornik in Jaska; Ante Djuric, priest in the village of Divusa, to the post of tobornik for the district of Drvar; and prie st Dragan Petranovic to the post of logornik in the camp of the district of Ogulin."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Catholic leaders directly under the orders of the Hierarchy were given the highest positions—e.g., the President of Crusaders, priest Dr. Felix Niedzielsk i, who was made Ustashi Vice-Governor of Bosnia during the first days of Pavelic regime.

In an article entitled, \"Crusaders in the In dependent State of Croatia,\" the same paper pointed to the fact that many pers ons trained in the Crusader organization were now occupying high offices, which was indeed true. A collection of Catholic newspapers issued in Ustashi Croatia, all showing Pavelic's portrait. The press, including the Diocesan and Epis copal papers, all supported and praised the Ustashi, from the first to the last. Besides the propagation of Nazi-U stashi ideas, the Catholic press played a tremendous role in conditioning the Croatian people to the horrors that were eventually to occur once Croatia came into being. It represented the Pavelic Regime as the in strument of justice and the vengeance of God. It became especially skillf ul in sowing religious hatred against the Orthodox Serbs. The official organ of the Archbishopric of Zagreb, Katolicki List , No. 16, 1941, declared that Ustashi Croatia had been created by an all powerful Providence. So did Glasnik St. Ante (The Voice of St. Anthony), December 12, 1941: \"This is the work of Cod.\" The paper Nedelja, June 6, 1941, the organ of the Catholic Crusader movement, declared \"Christ and the Ustashi march together.\" The active participation of so many Catholic lead ers and Catholic clergy in the formation of the Ustashi State of Croatia had been possible only thanks to one th ing: the consent of, and indeed instructions from, the leaders of the Catholic Hierarchy. This was proved from the very first by the incontrovertible fact that high and low clergy cooperated whole-hear tedly with Pavelic. Catholic parishes, as well as Catholic Cathed rals, and, indeed, the very radio, we re used as a political platform for Pavelic and the Ustashi. Witness Radio Zagre b, which on April l l, 1941, the day after Kvaternik and the German Army had entered the Croatian capit al, instructed the people to welcome the German Army and \"to seek answers to all questions from the Catholic parish offices, where instructions will be given about the future work.\" The official organ of the Archbishopric of Zagreb, Kato-licki Lis t, No. 16, 1941, declared that the independent State of Croatia had be en created by an all-powerful Pr ovidence. The Catholic Church, it concluded, prayed God that the New Croatia should find its fulfillment. The same paper went farther,"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"and soon afterwards published \"The Principles of th e Government of the Inde pendent State of Croatia and of the Ustashi Movement,\" to acquaint its readers with the basic directives regulating the life of every individual in the new puppet State. These directiv es soon helped Pavelic to convert Croatia into a virtual concentration camp. Arc hbishop Stepinac, on April 28, 1941, issued a pastoral letter, in which he asked the clergy to respond without hesitation to his call that they ta ke part in the exalted work of defending and improving the Independent State of Croatia, declaring th at from then onwards in the \"resurrected\" Croatian State the Church would be ab le in complete freedom to preach \"the invincible principles of eternal truth and justice.\" The pastoral letter, which was also published in Nedelja and Katolicki List on April 28, 1941, said the following: Honourable brethren, there is not one among you who did not recently witness the most significant event in the life of the Croatian people among whom we act as herald of Christ's word. These are events that fulfilled the long-dreamed-of and desire d ideal of our people.... You should, therefore, readily answer my call to do elevated work for th e safeguarding and the progress of the Independent State of Croatia.... Prove yourselves, honourable bret hren, and fulfill now your duty toward the young Independent State of Croatia. The pastoral letter was read in ev ery Croatian parish. It was also r ead over the radio. The impression it had on the people, and especially on the clergy, was indicated by Father Pete r Glavas, who, during his trial after liberation, said in his own defense: \"The order given by Archbishop Stepinac to the people over the radio to fight for the Independent State of Croatia constituted a political directive to the clergy.\" Like any other priest, he had to obey. The Ustashi section of the clergy, which had been activ e in terrorism even before the war, did not need this circular to tell them how to act. Yet ma ny who until then had hesitated, after Stepinac's instructions accepted his directives and actively engaged in supporting the Ustashi. The Catholic clergy did not join the Ustashi merely to chant Latin hymn s. They joined in order to carry out the Ustashi racial and religious terror programs. When Pavelic returned from Italy to Zagreb, to a ssume leadership of the New Croatia, he stopped in the town of Ogulin, on April 13, 1941, where he confe rred with one of his most fanatical lieutenants, the Ustashi Catholic priest Canon Ivan Mikan. On that same day, in a pu blic speech, Canon Mikan foretold the shape of things to come: \"There will be purges,\" shouted priest Mikan. \"Yes, there will be purges.\" On the same evening, not far from that re gion, the first Ustashi punitive expedition attacked individual Serbs in several villages. Were these massacres committed only by the follower s of Pavelic? They were often promoted and carried out by Catholic priests claiming to be the followers of Christ and the representatives of a Church trumpeting to the four winds that she preached universal love. It will suffice for us to mention only a few. The first Ustashi commandant in the Dist rict of Udbina was the Franciscan priest, Mate Mogus, who had organized the Ustashi militia and di sarmed Yugoslav troops. At a meeting in Udbina on June 13, 1941, he gave the following homily: \"Look, people, at these 16 brave Ustashi, who have 16,000 bullets and who will kill 16,000 Serbs, after wh ich we will divide among us in a brotherly manner the Mutilic and Krbava fields\"—a speech which was the signal for the beginning of the slaughter of Serbs in th e district of Udbina. In Dvor na Uni, priest Anton Djuric kept a dairy of his activiti es as an Ustashi functionary. The diary shows that on his orders the Us tashi plundered and burne d the village of Segestin, where 150 Serbs"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"were murdered, and that in the village of Goricka he arrested 117 people, who were sent to a concentration camp, where most of them were killed. A group of Franciscan priests, who to rtured and finally killed twenty-fiv e Serbs in the village of Kasle, took photographs of their victims. In the village of Tramosnica, priest Ante Klaric became the first Ustashi commissar, the personally led Ustashi units in attacks on Serbian vill ages. He organized the Ustashi militia and, according to witnesses, spoke from the pulpit as follows:\" You are old women and you s hould put on skirts, for you have not ye t killed a single Serb. We have no weapons and no knives and we should forge them out of old scythes and sickles, so that you can cut the throats of Serbs whenever you see them. Priest Bozo Simlesa, in the village of Listani, wa s one of the most active members of the Ustashi. He held the post of chief of the district of Livno. Duri ng the slaughter of the Serb s in the county of Listani he told the people from the pulpit that the time had arrived to exterminate all Serbs living in Croatia. He personally organized the Ustashi militia and obta ined arms for them. On July 27, 1941, he held a meeting in the village, and when he was informed that all Serbian men had been murdered and that women and children were to be killed that night, he told them not to wait for the night, for twenty-four hours had already passed since the chief had issued his order that not a single Serb must be left alive in Croatia. The Catholic Dean of Stolac, in Herzegovina, prie st Marko Zovko, was responsib le for the murder of 200 persons, whose bodies were thrown into a ditch in a field in Vidovo. Franciscan Mijo Cujic, of Duvno, personally gave instructions for the massacre of Serbs in the villages of Prisoje and Vrila, where not one person was allowed to remain alive. Were these the abominable deeds of some few individuals maddened by religious a nd racial fanaticism? Indeed they were not. They were an integral part of the official policy of the Catholic C hurch, which, screened behind the mantle of the Independent State, had inspired and promoted all the horrors whic h soaked the historical land of Croatia in a sea of blood.  "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 CATHOLIC FRIARS, PRIESTS, EXECUTIONERS, BISHOPS AND MURDERERS As Ustashi racialism had embarked upon a policy of Serbian extermination, it followed that its twin counterpart, Catholicism, could do no less than embark upon the exterm ination of its main religious foe: the Orthodox Church. State and Church, consequently, to implemen t their mutual scheme of total racial-religious exclusiveness, set out to pursue parall el policies, epitomized in the extermination of the racial elements, the Serbs, by the political authori ties, and in that of the religious elements, the Orthodox, by the Catholic Hierarchy. The Catholic Church did not leave the execution of a religious war to the secular arm, as she had done in similar circumstances in bygone centuries. She cam e down into the fighting field, full tilt, shunning precautions and brandishing the sword against those whom she had decided to exterminate, with a directness that had not been seen for a long time. Many of the Ustash i formations were officered by Catholic priests, and often by friars, who had ta ken an oath to fight with dagger and gun for the \"triumph of Christ and Croatia.\" Many of them did not hesitate to carry out the most infamous tasks, glorying in deeds that would have fi lled with shame any average \"heathen or barbarian from the East.\" All in the name of religion. Thus, while some, as we have already seen, took charge of concentration camps, others led the armed Ustashi in the clos ing of Orthodox churches, in the confiscation of Orthodox records, in the persecution, arrest, and, yes, even in the murder of Orthodox people, including Orthodox priests. At Banjaluka, for instance, an official order directed that all the Orthodox Church records of marriages , baptisms, and burials be delivered fo rthwith to Catholic parishes, while at Pakrac Catholic priests took possession of the Serbian Bishop's re sidence, following the locking and sealing of the Orthodox cat hedral (April 12, 1941). Orthodox churches were converted into halls—e.g. that of Prnjavor, on July 10, 1941. Others were transformed into Catholic churches, when they we re not pulled down altogeth er—e.g. in the provinces of Lika, Banija, and Kordun, where 172 churches were totally destroyed. Orthodox monasteries shared the same fate. At Fruska Gora fifteen Serbian Orthodox monasteries and churches were given to Catholic monks of the Franciscan order, as was also done with the Church properties at Orahovica, Pakrac, Lepavina, and other places. The monaster y of Vrdnik-Ravanica, wh erein were buried the remains of King Lazar, who led and di ed in the historical battle of Kosovo against the Turks in 1389 in defense of Christianity, was also taken over, as was Sremski Karlovci, the former seat of the Orthodox Patriarchate. There the great cathedral was first plundered of all va luables, then closed, after all its physical properties had been taken over by the Catholic Bishop. Within a short period 250 Orthodox churches were pillaged or destroyed. In the di ocese of Diakovo, mentione d before, twenty-eight Orthodox churches became Catholic churches. Together with the destruction of Orthodox churches, Ca tholic ferocity struck at the very backbone of the Orthodox Church: i.e. at the Orthodox clergy. Orthodox priest s were imprisoned, sent to concentration camps, hunted down, or simply massacred. Hundreds of them, including Orthodox Bishops, perished, only because they were priests of the religion hostile to the \"true Church.\" Orthodox priests, before being ex ecuted or hanged, were often horri bly tortured—e.g. priest Branko Dobrosavljevich, from Veljun, who was compelled to read the obituary of his own son, whom the Ustashi first killed in his presence, this precedi ng his own torture and death, which became the signal for the mass execution of hundreds of Orthodox insi de the Orthodox churches of Kladusa, Veljun,"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Slusnica, Primislje, and other places. On April 20, 1941, in the village of Svinjica, the Ustashi arrested the Orthodox priest, Babic, and afte r torturing him buried him in an upr ight position to his waist in the ground. Within a few weeks the Ustashi and Catholic priests murdered 135 Orthodox priests, of whom eighty-five came from one diocese. The higher clergy were not spared. On the night of June 5, 1941, on orders from the Ustashi chief, Gutic, the Orthodox Bishop Platon, of Banjaluka in We stern Bosnia, together with several Orthodox priests, some of whom were former members of the House of Representatives, was taken to the outskirts of the town by the Ustashi. There the ol d Bishop's beard was torn out, a fire lit on his naked chest, then, after prolonged tortur e, he and all his companions were killed with hatchets, and their bodies thrown into the Vrbanja River. Dositej, Orthodox Bishop of Zagreb, capital of the Independent State of Croatia, where Archbishop Stepinac had his residence, lost his reason as a result of the tortures inflicted upon him before his expulsion to Belgrade. Three Orthodox Bishops, Peter Zimonjic of Sarajevo, Sava Trlajic of Plaski, and Platon of Banjaluka, were murdered. [1] Numerous Catholic priests and monks, some of whom were not even attached to the Ustashi formations, carried out indiscrimi nate executions with their own hands. Many of them methodically and with precision took part in the most incredible orgies of blood. Canon Ivan Mikan, already mentioned, made daily rounds of the prison and me rcilessly beat Orthodox Serbs with a bull-whip, scolding the Ustashi for being lax in their work, personally ordering that th e Orthodox monastery of Gomirje be looted and its inmates sent to a con centration camp, where they were all executed. Fra Anto, a Catholic priest of Tramosnjica, organized Ustashi bands with the object of capturing as many Orthodox Serbs as he could, whom very often he tortured personally, as he did at Brcko. Simic Vjekoslav, a monk of the monaster y at Knin, personally killed nu merous Orthodox. Sidonije Sole, a monk of the Franciscan monastery in Nasice, de ported the Orthodox populati on of whole villages, while the Catholic priests Guncevic and Marjanovich Dragutin, in addition to acting as police officials, ordered the arrest of hundreds of Orthodox, whom they tortured and then killed, taking an active personal part in their execution. [2] German Castimir, abbot of the monastery in Guntic personally directed the mass murder of the Orthodox Serbs of Glina, a hundred of whom were murdered inside the Orthodox church there. The na mes of many others have been put on record by the Serbian Eastern Orthodox diocese of the USA and Canada, by the Orthodox Church of Yugos lavia, by the Yugoslav Government, and by other official agencies. [3] The purpose of all this terror was to destroy the en emies of Catholicism. Yet, while the Catholic Church, whenever given total power, can become a ruthless destroyer of her enemies, bursting with dreams of expansion, she can simultaneously fo llow a no less ruthless campaign of absorption. Absorption can be accomplished by only one means: by conversion. In the village of Mikleus, 1942, a Catholic pa rish priest \"converting\" in bulk hundreds of peasants. Many Catholic priests were at the head of th e Ustashi. Witness priest Mate Mogus, of the parish of Udbina, in the provi nce of Like. \"We Catholics,\" he told the to be forcibly converted Serbs, \"until now have worked for Catholicism with the cross and with the book"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"of the Mass. The day has come, however, to work with the revolver and with the gun.\" Father D. Juric, a Franciscan, was appointed h ead of a Ministry charged with plans for the systematic conversion of all those Orthodox who bad been spared from Concentration Camps or massacre. Most of the forcible conversions were dul y announced by diocesan bulletins. Witness, Katolicki List , organ of the Bishopric of Zagreb, c ontrolled by Archbisbop Stepinac. In its issue No. 31, 1941, it reported that \"a new pari sh of over 2,300 souls\" bad been created in the village of Budinci, as a result of the entire villag e having been re-christened to the Catholic Faith. Collective resistance was met by ruth less collective punishment. \"Converting\" the Orthodox Serbs, December 21st, 1941, Friars, besides Priests, participated in forcible conversions. They were no le ss ruthless than the parish clergy, e.g. Monk Ambrozjie Novak, Guardian of the Capucine Monastery in Varazdin, who, utter surrounding the village of Mostanica with Ustashi con tingents, told the people: \"You Serbs are condemned to death, and you can only escape th at sentence by accepting Catholicism.\" Catholic Padres did not hesitate to liquidate those who resiste d. Witness Father Dr. Dragutin Kamber, a Jesuit priest and a sworn Ustashi, who ordered the kil ling of 300 Orthodox Serbs in Doboj and the court martia l of 250 more, most of whom were shot. Or Father Dr. Branimir Zupanic, who had more than 400 people killed in one village alone: Ragoije. Father Srecko Peric, of the Gorica Monaster y, near Livno, advocated mass murders with the following words: \"Kill all Serbs. And when you finish come here, to the Church, and I will confess you and free you from sin.\" This resulted in a massacre, on August 10th, 1941, during which over 5,600 Orthodox Serbs in the di strict of Livno alone lost their lives. A Franciscan monk converting Orthodox vill agers in Mikleus, near Kutina."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"On their murderous expeditions, the Ustash i were always accompanied by Catholic Padres—most of these themselves Ustashi officers—whose task was to supervise the operations and, above all, to ensure that the Orthodox Serbs were convert ed to the Catholic Church. Conversion meant the avoidance of arre st, loss of property and even of life. Father Dionizio Juric, Ante Pavelic's confe ssor, was quite blunt about it. \"Any Serb who refuses to become a Catholic should be condemn ed to death,\" he declared at Staza, in the district of Banjia. With Catholic storm troopers nearby the threat was a reality. There were instances where those who refused conversion we re executed on the spot. Witness the case of Father Ilja Tomas, of the village of Klepac, who promis ed safety to the fleeing Orthodox if they became Catholics. Because they changed their minds, however, the Ustashi murdered the lot. The Orthodox churches became the main targets of the Catholic storm troopers, the Ustashi, and even of the Catholic clergy. These churches were seized, evacuated, closed, transformed into Catholic churches, or burned down altogether. In the province of Lika, Banija and Kord um, in 1941, 172 Orthodox churches were totally destroyed.. At Fruska Gora, 15 Orthodox mona steries and churches were given to Franciscans. Out of 189 churches in the dioces e of Gornjo Karlovachka, 175 were destroyed or burned down. There were cases when the Ustashi, after ha ving shut the Orthodox worshippers inside their church, set fire to the building. The worshi ppers were machine gunned when attempting to escape. Thousands perished in this way, killed by bullets, falling masonry, or burned alive. In 1941 Glina witnessed such a spectacle. The photograph shows the remains of an Orthodox church burned there by the Ustashi with about 2,000 men, women and children who had gone to pray in it."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" Catholic Brothers, and Monks, when visiting villages to \"convert \" the Orthodox population, were always escorted by the heavily arme d Catholic storm troopers, the Ustashi. The terrible reputation of the Ustashi for ruthlessness was often sufficient to \"persuade\" people to embrace the Catholic Church and thei r bayonets helped the Catholic Padres to baptize those who hesitated. Th e alternative, the preachers wa rned, was seizure of their property, arrest, concentration camps, or even execution. Father Franjo Pipinic, the pa rish priest of Pozega, for instance, towards the end of 1941 converted thousands, \"assisted\" by the Ustash i Captain Peranovic. He always began and ended his sermons by explaining that \"conversion\" was the only way to stay alive. The sight of the grim, armed Ustashi nearby induced whole communities of Orthodox to embrace the \"true\" Church. The Commission for Investigating War Crimes reported how hundreds of cases of such Catholic \"persuasion\" had occurred throughout Croatia. Above, Franciscan Padre, Bozidar Braie, is seen while delivering a sermon to the soon to be converted Orthodox congregation at Zemun, July 12, 1942, escorted by Ustashi.

Father Fili povic was the Commandant of the terrible concentration camp at Jasenovac. Father Filipovic, chief ecclesiastical murderer of Croatia, although a Monk of the Order of St. Francis, was a fanatical Ustashi long befo re the Second World War. His political and religious ruthlessness can be judged by the f act that, while addre ssing a battalion of the armed Ustashi in the village of Drakulic, he killed an Orthodox child with his own hands. Resenting the Orthodox reluctance to be \"re-bap tized,\" he told the armed Ustashi to \"re- Christen these degenerates in the name of God. Y ou follow my example.\" One thousand five"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"hundred Orthodox Serbs were executed in one single day. As Commandant of the Jasenovac Concentrati on Camp, Father Filipovic, aided by Father Zvonko Brekalo, Father Z. Lipovac, and Fath er Culina, caused the death of 40,000 men, women and children during the pe riod of his administration. The non-Catholic population in Catholic Croatia were give n two basic alternatives: conversion or death. Their church es were closed, parish documen ts destroyed, ecclesiastical buildings burned down. Orthodox worshippers very often were arrested inside their own churches, and kept there or in local halls while awaiting their fate: i.e. forcible conversion, concentration camps or execu tion. Their survival, more often than not, depended upon the whim of the Ustashi Commandants of the Catholic Padres accompanying them. There were occasions, however, when the Or thodox Serbs were given no chance at all to escape with their lives. Some Catholic Priest s being implacable. Witness the Abbot of the Monastery in Guntic, Father German Castimir , who personally directed the mass murder of the Orthodox Serbs of Glina, a hundred of wh om were massacred inside their Orthodox Church there. In this photograph, Orthodox worshippers inside their church at Hrvats ka Dubica, prior to their all being mu rdered, August 21, 1941. Once inside the sundry concentration camps, the inmates were still liable, not only to be tortured, but to be executed as well. The cam p Commandants had unwritten authorization to kill anyone taken there. Indeed, to quote Ljubo Milos, Commandant of the Jasenovac Concentration Camp, there was \"an agreement\" that all prisoners sentenced to three years were to be \"liquidated\" at once. By virtue of this, inmates at times were murder ed indiscriminately wit hout even the slightest legal excuse. Justification for mass killings was sometimes of the flimsiest nature."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"For example, on September 15, 1941, all those inmates of the Jasenovac Camp unable to work, numbering between 600 and 700, were execu ted. In the Camp of Stara Gradiska, 1000 women were killed. In the Krapje Camp in October 1941, 4000 prisoners were murdered. To save themselves physical trouble, at times the Ustashi used typhus, e.g. in March 1943 the inmates of the Djakovo Camp were purposely infected with typhus, causing the death of 567 persons. In the photograph, corpses of victims taken out of water wells at the Lepoglava Camp. Bodies of Orthodox Serbs executed by the Us tashi contingents at Sinj on August 26,1941. The Ustashi perpetrated countless mass murders on th e slightest pretext, it being the official policy of their Government to get rid of the Orthodox Serbian population in their midst, since Catholic Croatia must be inhabited ONLY by Catholics. By virtue of such a principle, the Ustashi arrested, tortured and slaughtered their Orthodox prisoners without pity. This even when the pr isoners had been designated to Concentration Camps. Witness the case of the 5,000 Orthodox prisoners who, in August 1942, having been assigned to the notorious Concentration Camp of Jasenovac, were decimated by the Ustashi en route. Two thousand of them were murder ed in cold blood. Those who survived were transferred to Gradina, where on August 28,1942 they were all put to death by the Ustashi with the butts of their rifles and with hamme rs. The corpses were then buried in common graves or cremated in rudimentary ovens. The Ustashi not only detained, arrested a nd \"punished\" people whom they considered hostile, they tortured and even executed them , regardless of any legal justification. During their first years of indiscriminate power they carried out numberless executions. Single individuals or small groups were punished or massacred on the spot. Whole Orthodox families were wiped out. More often than not, the pleading victims were not"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"spared, even when some of them, to save their lives, made ready to be \"re-baptized\" into the Catholic Church. Later on such willingness save d thousands on the advice of the Catholic padres, who accompanied the Ustashi contingents. In 1945, however, when the fall of Independent Catholic Croatia loomed inevitable, the fleeing Ustashi resumed their ancient ru thlessness and massacred without any discrimination. When retreating from Sisak, for instance, they massacred the 380 prisoners of that camp in cold blood. The victims were then hurled into the river. This photo shows some of the corpses of those thus murdered on the banks of the Sava. Another case of throat cutting, which took place in Croatia in 1943. The photograph was found in the pocket of a dead Us tashi. One of his companions is holding up the already severed head of a victim, fo r his friend to take a photo. The Ustashi committed the most execrable crimes with the utmost indifference. Frequently they amused themselves with prolonging the to rtures of their prisone rs, to pass the time. They did not spare women or children. To quote only one instance: In the villages between Vlasenica and Kladanj the Nazi occupationa l troops discovered ch ildren who had been impaled upon stakes by the Ustashi, their members still distorted with pain. Catholic priests, too, advocated the killing of child ren. Witness Father D. Juric. \"Today it is no longer a sin to kill a child of seven,\" he said, \"should such a child be opposed to our movement of the Ustashi.\" Mass murders were supplemented by the massacre of individuals, mostly in rural districts. Instances of the utmost ferocity occurred. The Ustashi very often used the most primitive weapons, such as forks, spades, hammers and sa ws, to torture their victims prior to their execution. They broke their legs, pulled off th eir skin and beards, blinded them by cutting their eyes with knives and even tearing them from their sockets, as a survivor, Marija"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Bogunovitch, testified. Sometimes executions were committed on the home ground of victims, carried out with conventional guns and revolvers. Some Ustashi sp ecialized in disposing of their \"charges\" by crushing their skulls with hatchets or even hammers. At Dubrovnick, Dalmatia, Fascist soldiers ha d photographs of an Ustashi wearing two necklaces. One was a string of cut-out eyes, the other of torn out tongues of murdered Orthodox Serbs. In this photograph Ustashi are torturing an Orth odox Serb with a saw prior to executing him. Somewhere in Bosnia, in 1943. The photograph was found in the pocket of a dead Ustashi in 1945. Indiscriminate mass deportations and muss executi ons became one of the most characteristic features of the Ustashi. Very often the lif e or death of the prisoners depended upon the whims of the local Commander or even the local Catholic priest. Ustashi authorities would summ on the Orthodox Serbs to perform public works or to listen to some new law. Once they were gathered in a given place, they would be surrounded, marched outside the village or tow n, and executed without further ado. In the most remote regions of Upper Dalma tia, like Bosnia Herzegovina, there took place such veritable extermination. Women and children were not spared. Some detachments of Ustashi, with the idea of saving themselves the trouble of burying the bodies, shot their victims on bridges. In Br cko, for instance, the home town of Deafer Kulenovic, the Ustashi Prime Minister, the Or thodox prisoners were all executed on the local bridge and then immediat ely hurled into the river.

He spoke, plot ted and acted as the veritable Ustashi leader that he was. He exhorted his clergy to act as Ustashi and to \"employ revolutionary methods to the serv ice of truth (i.e. the Catholic Church), declaring that it was \"unworthy of the disciples of Christ to th ink that the struggle...s hould be conducted...with gloves on.\" Many Catholic priests, bishops and monks were sworn officers of the Ustashi, e.g. Father Ivan Miletic, who led guerrillas against the Central Government of Belgrade. Or Father Kadoslav Glavas, a Franciscan Monk, who on April 10 and 11, 1941, disarmed the local police and captured the Post O ffice. In Herzegovina, the centre of the Ustashi movement was a Franciscan monastery. The Orthodox Church became one of the prime ta rgets of Catholic Croatia, which, very often, used the German armies of occ upation, outside Croatia, to round up obstinate Orthodox Serbs. One of the most effective means of paraly zing any resistance of the Serbian Orthodox Church was that of asking the Nazi authori ties to arrest the Ort hodox clergy. The policy was carried out throughout Yugoslavia. The result was that soon Orthodox resistance became very weak and, in fact, in certain parts of o ccupied Yugoslavia, even tacitly cooperated to avoid deportation and even execution. The po licy was carried out everywhere. In this picture Dr. Gavrilo Dozitch, the Orthodox Patr iarch is arrested by the (Gestapo, in the convent of Ostrog, in Montenegro. The Ustash i cooperated with the Nazis wherever they could harass, embarrass and destroy the Orthodox Church, which they considered the mortal enemy of the Catholic Church."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The Catholic Church has never believed in pers uasion, which is used only when she cannot enjoy absolute power. Her actions have always been base d on one of the most incontrovertible and typical Catholic dogmas: naked force. This, not only to smite, but also to conve rt. In Croatia she used force to do both, destruction and conversion ha ving been, in all her wars of re ligion, two facets of the same grand strategy. It was thus that, while demolishing Orthodox churches, while massacring Orthodox clergy and bishops, she was at the same time converting their c ongregations to Catholicis m, using a \"persuasion\" behind which stood boycott, threats, force, and even death. Catholic priests became the natural leaders of this specialized operation, prie sts and monks competing to see w ho could convert most Orthodox to the \"only true faith.\"The spirit in which the campa ign was conducted can best be judged by a typical leaflet, issued in 1941, by the dioces an journal of Djakovo, which read: The Lord Jesus Christ said that there shall be one pasture and one shepherd. Inhabitants of the Greek- Eastern faith, hear this friendly advice.... The Bi shop of Djakovo has already received thousands of citizens in the Holy Catholic Church, and these ci tizens have received certif icates of honesty from State authorities. Follow these br others of yours, and report as soon as possible for re-Christening into the Catholic Church. This was not a unique example of Catholic \"persuasion\" backed by the bayonet. Priests openly told Orthodox to become Catholics if they wished to avoid persecution, concentration camps, and extermination. Franjo Pipinic, priest of Pozega, for instance, carried out mass conversions of Serbs towards the end of 1941, with the as sistance of the Ustashi Captain Peranovic, telling the Serbian people that acceptance of Catholicism was the only way in which they could save themselves from death in concentration camps. In the files of th e Commission for Investigating War Crimes there are hundreds of cases of this \"persuasion,\" of which we quote only a few. One of the most fanatical missionaries for conversion was priest Ante Djuric, in the district of Dvor. He ordered the slaughter, plunder, and burning of many villages, and sent hundreds of Serbs to the concentration camp in Kostajnica. He personally mutila ted and killed Serbs from Bosanska Kostajnica. In his speeches he always emphasized that the Serbs in his district \"have only three ways out: to accept the Catholic faith, to move out, or to be cleansed with the metal broom.\" Priest Ambrozije Novak, Guardian of the Capucine monastery in Varazdin, in 1941 went to the village of Mostanica, accompanied by Ustashi, and ordered the Serbian people to assemble, telling them: \"You Serbs are condemned to death, and you can only escape that sentence by a ccepting Catholicism.\" Priest Mate Mogus, of the parish of Udbina, in the province of Lika , was even more explicit: Until now, my brothers,\" he preached in his church, \"we (the Catholics) have worked for our Catholic religion with the cross and the book of Mass; the day, however, has now come to work with the revolver and the gun.\" Some, however, wanted to us e guns to bring an abundant crop of forcible conversions on a far larger scale. The words of Father Petar Pajic, publishe d in the organ of the Archbishop of Sarajevo, b ear witness to that: [4] Until now, God spoke through papal encyclicals...And? They closed their ears.... Now God has decided to use other methods. He will prepare missions. European missions. World missions. They will be upheld, not by priests, but by army commanders, le d by Hitler. The sermons will be heard, with the"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"help of cannons, machine guns, tanks and bombers. The language of these sermons will be international. Such sentiments were shared by priests holding the most influential positions—e.g. Mgr. Dionizije Juric, one of the heads of the Ministry of Cults, and, more important still, th e confessor of none other than Ante Pavelic himself. When in Staza, in the district of Banija, Father Juric put the matter of forcible conversions in a nutshell: Any Serb who refu sed to become Catholic should be condemned to death, he said, because \"today it is no longer a sin to kill a child of seven, should such a child be opposed to our movement of the Ustashi.\" The Ustashi had committed and were committing ma ssacres beyond counting. Yet the devout Catholic Mile Budak, in an address at Karl ovac on July 13, 1941, did not hesitate to declare that \"the movement of the Ustashi is based upon religion.\" Cathol ics who had any qualms about it could reassure themselves simply by examining the professions of many of the leaders of the Ustashi, a great proportion of whom were monks, priests, and even bishops—e.g. Dr. Ivan Saric, the Archbishop of Sarajevo, an Ustashi since 1934. This pillar of the Holy Catholic C hurch, as soon as Catholic terror descended upon Croatia, spoke and acted as the verita ble Ustashi that he was, inciting his subordinate clergy to act as Ustashi, and ind eed, \"to employ revolutionary methods to the service of the truth, of justice and of honour\"; words which he repeatedly printed in his Katolicki Tjednik , where he never tired of declaring that \"it is unworth y of the disciples of Christ to th ink that the struggle against evil (sic) could be conducted in a noble manner and with gl oves on.\" This in addition to writing poems to Pavelic, and inciting all Catholics to follow Pave lic's example and the example of the Ustashi. [5] But if open refusal of conversion spelt death, acceptance of \"the tr ue faith,\" although very often an insurance of terrestrial life, was not always a guarant ee of safety. The slightest reluctance on the part of the Orthodox individuals, any obvious indication that they were becoming Catholic as a means of saving themselves, very often aroused Catholic veng eance. Apart from that, there were times when the call to conversion became only an excuse for wholesale massacre. Curate Ilija Tomas, from the village of Klepac, fo r instance, was responsible for the death of hundreds of Serbs in that district. In order more easily to capture frightened victims who were fleeing to the mountains, he promised that no harm would befall them if they would embrace the Catholic religion. When many, believing this, called on him, he turned th em over to the Ustashi, who murdered them all. In the village of Stikade, in Lika, Catholic priest Mo rber, leader of the Ustashi, invited the Serbs to be converted to the Catholic religion. Because those who accepted his proposal to be converted showed some reluctance, the Ustashi surrounded and massacred them with rifles and hammers and threw their bodies into a ditch. When the bodies were dug up late r it was established that many had been alive when buried. Josip Orlic, priest in Sunja, an old sworn Usta shi, compelled the Serbs in his district to accept Catholicism by threatening them with concentrat ion camps. A great majority of the Serbs there changed to Catholicism, in fear for their lives. Bu t as many of those re-christened made it clear that they did so to save their lives, they were carr ied away to the Jasenovac concentration camp in May, 1942, where practically all of them were killed. So me priests and monks specialized in forced mass conversions. The Ustashi priest Dionizije Juric, th e Franciscan and close friend to Pavelic whom we have already mentioned, was appointed to head this division, which devised a plan for the systematic conversion of those Serbs who had been sp ared from persecution and massacre."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The daily mass murders taking place before th em became the most powerful weapon of mass persuasion. Many followed the \"frie ndly advice\" and were \"converted.\" Conversions of individual and mass character became increasingly frequent. Most of these were duly announ ced in the Catholic Press. Katolicki List, organ of the Bishopric of Zagreb, contro lled by Stepinac, in its issue No. 38 in 1941, for instance, reported that \"a new parish of ove r 2,300 souls\" had been crea ted in the village of Budinci, as a result of the entire village having been re-christened to the Catholic Faith, and added that preparations for the re-christening had been made by a Franciscan from Nasice, Father Sidonije Solc. A similar mass conversion in the vicinity of Os ijek, carried out by Father Peter Berkovic, was described in Ustaska Velika Zupa , No. 1372, of April 27, 1942: His work covers the period from preparation of the members of the Eastern Orthodox Church for conversion to Catholicism until they were actuall y converted, and thus in the counties of Vocin, Cacinci, and Ceralije, he converted more than 6,000 persons. An Ustashi administrator, Ante Djuric, priest of Di vusa, forced all heads of families to assemble round their local teacher, bringing a 10 diners tax stamp, in order to write out pet itions for conversion for themselves and their families. The alternative: forfeiture of their residences and posts. The curate of Ogulin, Canon Ivan Mikan, charged 180 diners for each forced conversion, so that in one Serb village along—Jasenak—he collected 80,000 diners. A frank admission of how these mass c onversions were made was given by Nova Hrvatska , an Ustashi paper, on February 25, 1942: \"The re-Christening was carried out in a very solemn manner by the curate of Petrinja, Michael Razum. An Ustashi company was present at this solemn occasion .\" The re-christenings, as they were euphemistically la beled, were frequently cel ebrated with, in addition to water, blood. Priest Ivan Raguz had no inhibitions about it. He re peatedly urged th e killing of all Serbs, including children, so that \"even the seed of these beasts is not left.\" His worthy colleague, the curate Bozidar Brale, from Sa rajevo, took part in Serbian liqui dation with gun in hand, loudly postulating the \"liquidation of the Serbs without compromise.\" The Sp iritual Board of the Archbishop of Sarajevo was eventually to see Br ale. As a culprit before an ecclesiastical tribunal? Far from it. As that Catholic body's President. With the Catholic Hierarchy as the brains of such a policy of terror, with the ruthless armed Catholic bands at their disposal, the expected occurred. Indi viduals, whole families, entire villages, and even small towns embraced Catholicism. Their official entry into the \"true C hurch\" usually took place during mass ceremonies performed by Ustashi priests, \"watched\" by armed units of Ustashi. Refusal, or even postponement, on the part of the pr ospective converts brought upon them immediate requisitioning of property, threats against themselv es, their relatives, a nd their very lives. Thousands embraced Catholicism in this manner. Following their \"conversion,\" the new Catholics wound in a procession to the local Catholic Churc h, as a rule escorted by units of piously armed Ustashi, chanting about the happiness of having at last become the children of the true Church, and ending up with Te Deums and prayers for the Pope. As if this were not sufficient, the villages where Serbs had been re-christened had to send congrat ulatory telegrams to Stepinac. For the eager Archbishop had, as befitted a good sh epherd, ordered that the news of any mass conversions performed in any parish throughout Croatia be sent directly to him. Telegrams bearing such happy tidings were printed in the Ustashi paper, Nova Hrvatska , as well as in Stepinac's own official Diocesan Journal, Katolicki List . In its issue of April 9, 1942, the former prin ted four such telegram s, all addressed to"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Stepinac. In these, the mass entries into the bosom of Mother Church were laconically and succinctly described. One, for example, read: 2,300 persons assembled in Slatinski Drenovac, from the villages of Drenovac, Pusina, Kraskovic, Prekorecan, Miljani and Gjursic, ac cepted today the protection of th e Roman Catholic Church and send their profound greetings to their Head. Thirty per cent of Orthodox Serbs in the New Cr oatia were converted to Catholicism within a remarkably short period. The use of fear of losi ng property, or even life, however, was still not sufficient for most members of the Catholic Hierar chy engaged on this type of proselytization, and whenever resistance was encounter ed, Catholic clergymen ordered and, in fact, themselves often carried out the execution of many Orthodox. When co llective resistance was met, ruthless collective punishment was inflicted upon the reluctant Orthodox. More often than not that meant torture and even execution. Instances of such priest ly murderers are many. Suffice it to men tion a few. For example, Father Dr. Dragutin Kamber, a sworn Ustashi, but also a Jesuit pr iest. Father Dragutin orde red the killing of about 300 Orthodox Serbs in Doboj, and the court martial of 250 others, most of whom were shot. Or Father Dr. Branimir Zupanic, who had more than 400 men, women, and children killed in one village alone, Ragolje, and who was a personal friend of Ante Paveli c. During one of his sermons in the church of Gorica, Father Srecko Peric, of the Gorica mona stery near Livno, advocated mass murders with the following words: \"Kill all Serbs. First of all, kill my sister, who is married to a Serb, and then all Serbs. When you finish this work, come here to the Chur ch and I will confess you and free you from sin.\" This resulted in a massacre, on August 10, 1941 , during which over 5,600 Orthodox Serbs in the district of Livno alone lost their lives. The chief ecclesiastic murderer, however, was neither a mere Catholic clergyman nor a fanatical Jesuit. He was no less than a member of the Order of meek St. Francis: Nliroslav F ilipovic, an Ustashi since long before the war, and a Franciscan monk. Father Filipovic killed a child with his own hands in the village of Drakulic, while addressing a battali on of Ustashi: \"Ustashi,\" was his curt brotherly exhortation, \"I re-Christe n these degenerates in the name of God. You follow my example.\" One thousand five hundred Orthodox Serbs were then ex ecuted on one single day. Jasenovac, an Ustashi concentration camp which equalled Dachau in horror, not long afte rwards received a new Commandant: Father Filipovic. In his new role, Filipovic, cooper ating with Father Zvonko Brekalo, Zvonko Lipovac, and Father Culina, caused the d eaths of 40,000 men, women, and children in the camp during the period of his administrations. [6] The losses inflicted by these frenzied attempts of the Catholics to destroy the Orthodox Church were immense. The material damage amounted to 7 m illiard pre-war gold diners. Out of twenty-one Orthodox bishops in Yugoslavia, one was taken to in ternment in Italy, two were forcibly removed from their sees and sent to Serbia, one was imprisone d with Patriarch Gavrilo, and then sent to Dachau concentration camp, two were beaten and sent to Serbia, where they di ed shortly afterwards, two died in internment camps, and five were murdered in cold blood. [7] About 400 Orthodox pr iests were sent to concentration camps, while about 700 (one-quarter of the total number of Orthodox priests) were killed. One-quarter of monasteries and churches were completely de stroyed, about half of the total number were damaged, an unknown number were tran sformed into Catholic churches or Catholic halls. Out of 189 churches in the Gornjo Karlov achka diocese, for instance, 175 were burned and destroyed.

In Pavelic's New Ustashi State, in fact, between Ap ril, 1941, and the spring of 1945, thanks to Ustashi units, Ustashi police, and concentration camps, at least 850,000 members of the Orthodox Church and citizens of Yugoslavia, including numerous Croats (plus 30,000 Jews and 40,000 Gypsies), perished thus. [9] Hundreds of Catholic priests and Catholic friars contributed, eith er directly or indirectly, to this colossal massacre. To say that these were the deeds of individuals suffering from religi ous mania, or that these same individuals had discarded the most elementary rules of humanity, ac ting on their own initiative after scoring the admonitions of their Church and rebelling against her au thority, is untrue. The Ustashi massacres, all the atrocities committed by either Cat holic officials, priests, or monks, fell within a coolly calculated scheme for the total elimina tion of the Orthodox masses, actively or passively resisting their absorption into the Catholic fold. Indeed, it was the premeditated policy of the Catholic Hierarchy, acting on behalf of its true inspirer, the Vatican. Footnotes 1.

The history of man has proved th is to have been true, not only in the past, but, more portentous still, now in the present. Ustashi Croatia is the most frightening instance of modern times. There the identification of Church with State, of civil with religious authority, of spiritual with military ruthlessness, was found to produce individuals who committed barbarities unimagined even by themselves. Cassocks and tonsures have never given moral strength to clergymen nor rendered them immune to human frailty, passion, or vice. Th e murdering Catholic priests in Croatia were the victims of primitive frenzy. As such, they should be judged more with pity than with execration. Can, however, the master minds in Zagreb and in Rome, calmly exploiting the blind emotionalism and even wickedness of their clerical subor dinates, be acquitted from th e condemnation which history has already passed on them? Their calcul ated promotion of the Ustashi te rror cannot be either minimized, excused, or condoned. For the mass murders carried out by individuals appareled in clerical garb truly were instigated from the archiepiscopal palaces of the Catholic Hierarchy. That Hierarchy knew, nay, it approved and tacitly encouraged th e sanguinary task. Not one single me mber of their clergy, while the Independent Kingdom of Croa tia lasted, was ever called to account by them. Not a single priest was by them ever punished, suspended, or unfrocked. Arc hbishop Stepinac, or any Catholic Bishop, could have done that at any time, had he been willing, no t only when dealing with the most flagrant crimes, but also with minor tran sgressions—e.g., clerical A Catholic priest \"converting\" a whole village. As a rule this meant collective mass baptism, particularly when villages had been surr ounded by Ustashi detachments. The Catholic padres often used shock tactics to speed up matters, e.g., Father Ante Djuric, of the District of Dvor, who always opened his sermons with the following preliminary: The Orthodox of this district have only three wa ys out: to accept the Catholic faith, to move out (leaving behind them all th eir possessions), or to be cl eansed with the metal broom.... The higher clergy were no less explicit. W itness Bishop Mgr. Aksamovitcb, of Djakovo, who sent the following proclamation to all Orthodox Serbs in his diocese: Up to now I have received into the fold of th e Catholic Church several dozens of thousands of Orthodox.

For those who refused, or rebelled, the altern ative was persecution, arrest, concentration camps, or even death. The Ustashi, after raiding some Orthodox village, as a rule deported the women and children, either to concentration camps or to th e nearest convent, where the \"heretics\" were re-baptized. This task was car ried out by \"Caritas,\" a Cat holic organization run by the Hierarchy. Very often, however, women and childre n were massacred with the rest. In the village of Susnjary, for instance, after k illing most of the inhabitants, the Ustashi led away about twenty surviving children, whom th ey tied to the threshold of a barn, which was then set on fire. Most were burned alive. Th e few who survived, horribly scorched, were then killed. As testified by ey e witness Gjordana Friendle nder, the Ljubo Milos case.

Canon Law is very sp ecific on this matter. It decrees this: \"Any priest who writes articles in daily pa pers or periodicals without permission of his own Bishop contravenes Canon 1386 of th e Code of Canon Law.\" Yet what happened? Clerical incitements to hate, to convert by force, and to massacre app eared in the ordinary Pr ess without the Bishops uttering a single word of reprimand. They were even printed in the very eccl esiastical Press of the Catholic Hierarchy. Indeed, many bishops became the open advocates of forcible conversion, as proved by Mgr.

Follow the example of these brothers of yours, and send, without any more delay, your request for your prompt conversion to Catholicism.

Th eir bishops brought pressure upon them, to compel them to carry out the policy of forcible conversions. This was tes tified by none less than Bishop Aksamovic's chaplain, Dr. Djuka Maric, at a heari ng before Yugoslav authorities: I and my friend and colleague, Stjepan Bogutovac,\" sa id the chaplain, \"were forced by our Bishop, Aksamovic, to go as missionaries to the Orthodox towns of Paucje and Cenkovo and to perform there the rituals of re-Christening all the inhabitants within a week's time.\" The result was that, in the Bishopric of Djakovo, under the personal leadership of Bishop Aksamovic, there took place one of the biggest mass-convers ions of Orthodox in the whole of Croatia. The responsibility of the head of the Catholic Hier archy is further demonstrat ed by the fact that he could have used disciplinary authority, in addition to having at his disposal canonical power. Stepinac, in fact, was not only the Chairman of the Bishops' Conference; he had supreme control over the writing of the entire Catholic Press as Chairman of Catholic Action. Had he been willing to do so, he could have silenced any member of his clergy preaching th e extermination of non-Cat holics. Further to that, Archbishop Stepinac was invested with civil power, which he could have use d, being a fully fledged Member of Parliament. Such power he shared wi th other prelates, among them: Mgr. Aksamovic, Bishop of Djakovo; Father Irgolitc h, of Farkasic; Father Ante Lon acir, of Senj; Father Stjepan Pavunitch, of Koprivnica; Father Jura j Mikan, of Ogulin; Father Matija Politch, of Bakar; Father Toma Severovitch, of Krizevci; Brother Boniface Sipitch, of Tucepa; Franjo Skrinjar, of Djelekovac; Stipe Vucetitch, of Ledenice. With such authority Stepinac could easily control a nd direct all the Catholic clergy. Had he been met with open defiance, he could simply apply military sanctions. For Stepinac was not only the highest ecclesiastical authority in the land: he had been created Supreme Military Apostolic Vicar of the Ustashi Army at the beginning of 1942. All priests at tached to the Ustashi un its were directly under him, as military subordinates. And, as a rule, these were the ones who either incited the soldiers to commit crimes or committed them themselves. That the Catholic Hierarchy were the veritable prom oters of the campaign of forcible conversions is further demonstrated by the fact that forced membership of Catholicism was made legal by governmental decree on May 3, 1941, when the Ustash i Government published a \"Law concerning the conversion from one religion to another.\" Additional measures on this matter followed. For instance, in June, 1941, the Ustashi Prime Minster set up (decr ee No.11,689) an Office on Religious Affairs, in charge of \"all matters pertaining to questions conn ected with the conversion of the members of the Eastern Orthodox Church.\" Did Stepin ac or the Catholic Hierarchy prot est at the decree? Far from it; they whole-heartedly supported the law. In fact, they saw to it that the Depart ment had at its head a priest, that same intimate friend of Pavelic whom we have already encount ered, Father Dionizije Juricev. This office came into being following the ve ry private audience with Pius Xll accorded to Pavelic a month earlier. And perhap s of even greater significance is the fact that on June 30, 1941, the Minister of Justice and of Religions sent an official letter to all Ca tholic bishops, in which the Ustashi Government confirmed what had already been agreed with Archbishop Stepinac—namely, the"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" The Bishops and Archbishops of Croatia gave fu ll support to the Ustashi. Indeed, many of them were themselves Ustashi long before Ustashi Croatia came into being, e.g. Dr. Ivan Saric, the Archbishop of Sarajevo, who had b een an Ustashi agitator since 1934. Or Mgr. Dionizije, one of the Heads of the Ministry of Cults, dealing with forcible conversions, who was Ante Pavelic's confessor. Others became full fledged members of the Ustashi Parliament, e.g. Mgr. Aksamovic, Bishop of Djakovo. The Hierarchy were the insp irers of the forcible mass conversions. A Committee of Three dealing with them was composed of the Bishop of Senj, the Bishop of Krizevci, Dr. Simrak, and Archbishop Stepinac himself, working in conjunction with the Ustashi Minister of Justice. The whole Hierarchy gave canonical sanction to forcible conversions, following a Bishops' Conference in Zagreb, November 17, 1941. Ante Pavelic's regime stood upon the Hierarchy's unqualified support. Here, he is seen surrounded by the Croatian Bishops and Archbishops during one of their frequent conferences with him. The Vatican was well informed of what was going on inside Ustashi Croatia. Not only because the Catholic Hierarchy sent the Pope regular reports, but because the Pope had his own personal representative there. The duty of the Papal Legate was to send regul ar and accurate information on the exertions of the Catholic clergy and Bishops. Also on th e political and military doings of the Ustashi Government and of its leaders. Pope Pius XII's representative on the spot was the Papal Legate, Mgr.

Only the poor Orthodox population must be converted.\" The fanatical determination of the Catholic Hierarc hy to destroy the Orthodox re ligion at its very roots is demonstrated by their cold-blooded attitude towards the surviving Or thodox children who, unlike their parents, had escaped extermination. All these children were placed in public homes directed by Catholic priests or Catholic sister s, under the auspices of Caritas, th e Catholic organization run by the Hierarchy. In many cases they were put in the care of private Catholic families. What was the real objective of such extraordinary Catholic compassion? Th e implanting into their \"lost souls\" of \"the true faith,\" as a prerequisite for thei r bodies being saved. Their religious assimilation was speedy, ruthless, and efficient. Officially converted to Catholicism, re-baptized with Catholic names, growing up in Catholic surroundings, these childre n, under continuous relentless Catho lic pressure quickly lost all contact with their or iginal ethnic and religious group. The inev itable result was that they were soon absorbed into the Catholic fold. Their assimilation was so thorough that even after Pavelic's collapse it became impossible to trace most of them, documents re lating to their origin of ten having been willfully destroyed. Fleeing Ustashi took a number of such child ren with them to their main country of refuge, the Argentine. Others were taken to Italy. Th e wholesale kidnapping of Orthodox children was a characteristic feature of the forcible conversion, through terror , of Orthodox adults. The former Apostolic Administrator and Bishop of Krizevci, Dr. Simrak, like many of his episcopal colleagues, publicly promoted, disc ussed, and encouraged plans for the whole campaign, and published directives to his clergy in the official Bishopric Ne ws of Krizevci, No. 2, 1942. Part of the text reads as follows: Directive regarding the conversi on of the members of the Easter n Orthodox Church in Slavonia, Srijem and Bosnia. Special offices and church committees must be cr eated immediately for thos e to be converted.... Let every curate remember that these are historic days for our missions and we must under no circumstances let this opportunity pass.... Now we must show with our work what we have been talking about for centuries in theory. We have done very little until now b ecause....we are afraid of complaints from the people. Every great work has someone opposing it. Our universal mission, the salvation of souls and the greatest gl ory of our Lord Jesus Christ, is invo lved in this issue. Our work is legal because it is in accord with official Vatican policy and with the directives of the saintly congregations of the Cardinals for the Eastern Church. [1] If these extraordinary directives had been issued by one single bishop, or even by several bishops, their significance would have incriminated the Catholic Church beyond excu se. But when it is considered"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"that the Bishop of Krizevci, far from acting on his own, was offici ally following the instructions promulgated by his own very Primate, then the gr avity of such instructions assumes a meaning transcending the deeds of a local Hierarchy and tr espassing into fields affecting the most sacred principles of religious liberty of all men. The pr ogramme of forcible conve rsions was given canonic sanction after Stepinac had convened a Bishops' C onference in Zagreb on November 17, 1941—that is, the year before. From that date onward the entire Catholic Hierarchy adopt ed a programme which was officially followed until the fall of Pavelic. Indeed, the programme whic h gave hierarchic al sanction to the policy of forcible conversions was further strengthened by the actual setting up of a Committee of Three.

Pope Pius XII's representative participated in most of the official a nd semi-official functions of Ustashi Croatia. He was an eyewitness to the promotion of Pave lic and to Stepinac's policies of terrorization and Cathol icization of Croatia. He knew of the atrocities and horrors taking place. He watched the progress of the forcible conversions, was aware of the wholehearted participation of the clergy in the wholesale massacre of thousands of Orthodox Serbs. All these things he faithfully reported to Pope Pius XII. In addition, Croatian Bishops wrote dispatches on the Us tashi horrors to the Pope, e.g. Dr. Ujchich, Catholic Archbishop of Belgrade. The purpose of Homes for Children was usually to re-baptize Orthodox orphans and thus convert them to the Catholic Church."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" Catholic Religious Orders gave total and c ontinuous support to the Ustashi. Before the establishment of the Independent Stale of Cr oatia (1941) their convents were hiding places for Ustashi terrorists, concealed Ustashi presse s and were depositories of Ustashi subversive literature and even of hand grenades, guns and dynamite. The Ustashi carried out their activities screened by the members of Religious Orders, male and female. Nuns prepared uniforms, em blems and medical equipment for Ustashi detachments. Nuns looked after \"poor little orphans,\" i.e. children whose parents had been murdered by the Ustashi, all of which children were re-bapti zed into the Catholic Church. In this manner thousands were converted to \"the true faith.\" Hundreds of Catholic nuns became specialized in the \"conversion\" of the young.

Every missionary shall obtain permission for his sp iritual work from the nearest local church authority... 3. It is necessary that for conversions to be achieved, a psychological basis should be created among the Serbian Orthodox followers. With this obj ect in view they should be guaranteed not only civil rights , but in particular they s hould be granted the right of personal freedom and also the right to hold property . [2] Thereupon the Conference of these holy men releas ed a complementary resolution (No. 253). In this they explained in more detail how certain forcible conversions were to be carried out. Then a second committee, which was directly under the Conference of the Catholic bishops, wa s set up, with the task of putting into practice the policy of forcible conversions. The list of its five members is significant: Dr. Franjo Hermann, Professor of the Theological Faculty of Zagreb; Dr. Augustin Juretitch, Adviser to the Conference of the Catholic Bishops; Dr. Janko Kalaj, Professo r of Religious Education; Dr. Krunoslav Draganovitch, Professor of the Theological Faculty of Za greb; and Mgr. Nikola Boritch, director of the Administration of the Archbishopric of Zagreb."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"When examined without the frills and obscurities of their official phraseol ogy, the various directives issued by these Hierarchical bodies tu rn out to be but faithful copies of similar instructions repeatedly given for centuries throughout the Ch ristendom of the darkest Middle Ag es. For that is what in reality they are. That a Catholic Hierar chy should have been permitted to re-issue them in the middle of the twentieth century is certainly one of the most sinister social phenomen a of a civilization in swift decay. The revival of a policy of forcible conversion assu mes an even more portent ous significance when one remembers that it occurred with the tacit approva l of the Vatican. Had the Vatican disapproved, not a single priest could have taken part in the massacres or forcible conversions. A village priest can act only with the approval of minor Hierarchs who themselves cannot move without the permission of their Bishop, while the Bishop, in his turn, must act according to the instructions of his Archbishop; the Archbishop only on those of the Prim ate; the Primate on the direct instructions of the Vatican. The Vatican is the personal dominion of the Pope. The Pope being the central pivot of the vast Hierarchical machinery, it follows that the ultimate responsibility for all members of the clergy—or, to be more precise, for the collective action of any given nati onal Hierarchy—rests with him. This cannot be otherwise. For policies of great import must be submitted to him before their promotion by all Hierarchies the world over, the Pope being their sole authority. If th e responsibility for the monstrous persecutions rests with the head of the National Hierarchy—i.e. Stepinac—it has automatically to rest also with the Head of the Universal Church, with out whose consent the Catholic Hierarchy would not have dared to act—i.e. with Pius XII. Pius XII could not plead ignorance of what was going on in Croatia by bringing forward the excuse of the obstacles of war. Communication between Rome a nd Croatia was as easy a nd as free as in peace- time. From the very beginning of hos tilities the Nazi Ambassador at the Vatican was treated as of far greater importance than all the A llied diplomats. In 1940-2 the Vati can was on the most cordial terms with Hitler. Political and religious Ustashi leaders came and went be tween Rome and Zagreb as freely as did the Germans and Italians, th e Ustashi State then being a satell ite of Nazi Germany, and hence a province of the Nazi Empire. Moreover, the Pope knew what was happening in Croatia, not only through the Hierarchical administrative machinery, wh ich kept him up to date on all Croatian events, but also through other reliab le sources. They were: (a) The Papal Legate. Pius XII, it should never be fo rgotten, had a personal repr esentative in Croatia, whose task was to implement Vatican policy and coordina te it with that of Pavelic, as well as reporting on religious and political matters to the Pope himself. The Papal Legate to Croatia was Mgr. Marcone, who openly blessed the Ustashi, pub licly gave the Fascist salute, a nd encouraged Catholics (e.g. when he went to Mostar) to be \"faithful to the Holy Se e, which had helped that same people for centuries against Eastern barbarism \"—that is to say, against the Orthodox Church and the Serbs. Thus, the Pope's official representative openly instigated re ligious persecution, as we ll as praying for victory \"under the leadership of the Head of the State, Pavelic,\" against the Yugoslav Nati onal Liberation Army in 1944-5. (b) Cardinal Tiseran, head of the Holy Congregation of Eastern Churches. This congregation's specific task was to deal with Eastern Churches. Cardinal Ti seran received detailed reports of every forcible conversion and massacre in Croa tia. Between April and June , 1941, over 100,000 Orthodox Serbs were massacred; yet Cardinal Tiseran, on July 17, 1941, had the audacity to declare that Archbishop Stepinac would now do a great work for the development of Catholicis m in \"the Independent State of Croatia...where there are such great hopes for the conversion of those who are not of the true faith.\""},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"(c) Ante Pavelic, who, by his representative to the Vatican, through whom Pi us XII sent \"special blessing to the Leader (Pavelic),\" forwarded regular reports, at times straight from the Minister of Religions, about the \"rapid\" progress of the Catholicization of the New Croatia. (d) Last but not least, Archbishop Stepinac himself, who in person visited Pius XII twice, and who supplied His Holiness with figures of the forcible conve rsions. In an official document, dated as late as May 8, 1944, His Eminence Archbishop Stepinac, head of the Catholic Hierarchy, in fact, informed the Holy Father that to date \" 244,000 Orthodox Serbs\" had been \"converted to the Church of God.\" [3] Monks and Friars were the backbone of the policy of forcible conversions. Many participated in acts of terrorism. E.g. Simi c Vjeckoslav, a Monk of the monastery at Knin, who killed dozens of Orthodox with his own hands. Sidoniie Solo, another Monk of the Franciscan monastery in Nasice, deported th e Orthodox population of whole villages. The Abbot of the monastery of Gunlic, Father G. Castimir, directed the massacre of hundreds of Orthodox at Glina. Father Dr. Dragutin Kamber, a Jesuit, orde red the killing of a bout 300 Orthodox in Doboj, and the court martial of 250 others, most of whom were shot.

The latter not only accepted the \"gifts\" but transferred to the Catholic Church the property of the Orthodox parishes. Such property included the baptism registers and all other official and semi-official documents. Catholic padres and the Ustashi asked for mone y also as a condition fo r saving the lives of those they converted, e.g. the Catholic priest of Ogulin, Canon Ivan Mikan, who charged 180 diners for each forced conversion. In the Or thodox village of Jasenak alone he collected 80,000 diners. Catholic Monasteries became gorged with Or thodox valuables and goods. Many of these were sent to the Catholic Bishops.

At first they received hardly any credence. That people should be killed for their religion could not be accepted in the middle of the 20th Century. Yet the tales of individual witnesses, when added to the stories of Italian Fascist troops and even Nazi ones, could not be ignored forever. In view also of the fact that ma ny described the Croatian horrors in their letters home, some having even taken \"snaps\" of the deeds. When, finally, these could no longer be denied, counterru mors began to circulate to the effect that they were anti-Catholic propaganda, an ti-Croat lies. Indeed, even \"Gesta po-cooked\" inventions. The Croats and their Catholic supporters accuse d the Nazis, the Communists, the Serbs, and even the Allies, in turn, of having started th e atrocity stories. Since evidence, however, went on accumulating, they were finally compelled to adopt three well defined tactics, which they carried out with simulta neous consistency: (a) the prevention of the arrival of fresh news; (b) the playing down or minimizati on, and even denial, of what had already become known; and (c) a smear campaign against all and sundr y engaged upon telling about events in Croatia. The intrigues, lies, plots and utte r falsification directed to these ends became a grand strategy in themselves. We shall content ourselves with a few ch aracteristic examples, since each is typical of the methods adopted from the very beginning. In 1941 Dr. Milosh Sekulich, then in Nazi-occupied Yugoslavia, was charged with a mission of a military, political and ecclesiastical nature: to take certain important documents to the Allied Headquarters in London. Those who sent him: General Mihailovich, leader of the Chetnik forces, and the Bishops of the Orthodox Church of Serbia. Having accepted, he undertook the perilous journey, left Yugoslavia and succe ssfully reached Istanbul, Turkey on 27th September, 1941. The exiled Yugoslav Government in London, having been informed of Dr. Sekulich's task, proposed on 6th October, 1941, on the initiative of their Premier, General Simovich, that the trip to London be financed by th e Government. In view of the importance of the Doctor's mission, the Premier's mo tion was unanimously accepted. Assured of the blessing of the Yugoslav Governme nt, Dr. Sekulich then proceeded to Egypt. From Egypt he went to the Sudan, from there to the Congo, a nd finally to Lagos. It must be remembered that at this period the Fascist and Nazi armies were in control of North Africa and of the Mediterranean. Once in Lagos, however, he had to stop. The fund s had been cut short. What had happened? A Minister of the Yugoslav Government in char ge of Finances, a devout Catholic Croat, had withdrawn the necessary money. Unable to proceed further, Dr. Sekulich, with his doc uments, would have to remain in deepest Africa for \"the duration.\" The evidence of the forcible c onversions and Catholic massacres in this manner would never reach the Allies. Or, at least, would be greatly delayed."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"The Croat's plan almost succeeded. But for the genero sity of a Czechoslovak, the Manager of Bata in Lagos. Dr. Sekulich brought to London two important documents : one hidden in the sole of his shoes and the other sewn into the lining of hi s suit. (A) A map of Mihailovich's Chetnik Headquarters, (B) two Appeals by the Serbian Orthodox Church, sent first to General Schroeder, Co mmander-in-Chief of the Nazi occupational forces in Serbia and then to General Dunkelmann, w ho had replaced General Schroeder. In these two appeals, the Serbian Ort hodox Church asked the Nazi Generals to intervene with Ante Pavelic to stop the massacre of the Serbs. The documents began as follows: \"The persecutions of the Orthodox Serbs started from the very be ginning of the existence of the Independent State of Croatia... Follo wing the departure of the German and Italian occupying troops (in 1941) persecution, plunder, torture of the Serbs, which until then had been checked, turned into a veritable program, directed at a complete extermination of the Orthodox Serbian people. Catholic Croatian Minister, Dr. Lile Budak, Dr. Milovan Za nic, Dr. Mirko Puk, and the Ustashi leader Dr. Victor Gutic competed against each other to in cite the Croatians against the Orthodox Serbs. \"As a result of such policy, thousands of Serbs we re taken to concentration camps, Orthodox priests and their families were arrested, the birth, marriages and deaths registers of the Orthodox Church were handed over to the Catholic diocesan authorities , Orthodox Churches were destroyed, monasteries plundered, and the Serbian people fo rced to abandon their Orthodox re ligion and adopt Catholicism. We are sorry to have to relate that in all these misd eeds, the Catholic clergy also participated.... \"We estimate that, so far (August 8th, 1941), the number of people killed surpasses 180,000.... \"One of the first victims of Ustashi terror was Pl aton, Bishop of Banjaluka, t ogether with the Orthodox Canon Dusan Subotich, of Bosanska Gradishka.

Their bodies were thrown into the river Vrbanja.... \"Canon Branko Dobosavljevic, of Vljuna district of Slunj, who was ordered by the Ustashi to dig the grave of his own son, a student....

Brancovic, a Member of Parliament, was executed without even the presence of le gality. Prior to his murder, the Ustashi amused themselves by sl ashing his chest with knives and ultimately scooped his eyes from their sock ets. He was a close friend of Dr. Milos Sekulich (third from left), the man whom the Orthodox Church of Se rbia charged with taking their appeals and documentation of the Ustashi atroci ties to the Allies in London. The Ustashi tortured and executed Members of Parliament, including Orthodox clergy and Bishops. Very often they seized their relatives, whom they se nt to concentration camps or forced to become Catholics. The Ustashi persecuted Orthodox personalities even after the collapse of Hitler and of Ustashi Croatia. Going so far even as to terro rize their fellow Croatians abroad by extorting \"contributions\" from them for the cause and by planting bombs in homes and public places, e.g., West Germany in 1964, Australia in 1965, and the USA in 1967.

To re alize the seriousness of these measures, it should be remembered that there are ei ght Orthodox Dioceses in the Independent State of Croatia, with a large number of clergy, all of whom are now missing... In this manner the Serbian people are entirely without their spiritual leaders, left to the mercy of the Ustashi and of the Catholic clergy....\" The Appeals thereupon gave numerous accounts of th e crimes committed until then by the Ustashi, some of which we have already examined. F aced by such circumstantial evidence, Catholic propagandists then engaged upon a campaign of vitupera tion and distortion. They began by saying that Dr. Sekulich was a Gestapo Agent. This, although as soon as he arrived in London Dr. Sekulich had been received by Mr. Leopold Amery, Minister of State for India and right-hand man of Winston Churchill, then British Premier. At the same time they asserted that the \"atroc ity stories\" were lies. Sava Kosanovich, Yugoslav Minister, declared from the USA \"This is the work of Nazi and Fascist propaganda... to which some people have lent themselves as naive accomplices.\" (November 1941). Others affirmed that only the Ustashi had committed the crimes. \"I repudiate a ll attempts to associate the Croatian people with Pavelic and his Ustashi,\" said Catholic Croat Dr. Subavich, Governor of Croatia in exile, \"or to accuse them of the massacres which are going on...if they are going on, \" he ended. (15th November 1941). In spite of denials and distortions , the fact remained that the Croa tian atrocities had occurred. And no one knew about their authenticity better than the members of the Yugoslav Government. Should they lend their authoritative voice to the A ppeals of the Serbian Orthodox Church? There followed a serious crisis. Croat and Slovene me mbers, all Catholics, threatened the Government with an irreparable split. At this time it must not be forgotten that the paramount concern of the exiled Government was to remain united. That is, to keep together the three main nationali ties—Serbs, Croats and Slovenes— which formed Yugoslavia, and so prevent the disi ntegration of the Kingdom, while at the same time offering a united front against Hitler. To avoid a major split, the Government finally d ecided NOT to publish the news of the massacres. Indeed, to remain silent, and even to deny altogether that they had occurred. Notwithstanding this decision, howev er, the news soon leaked out. The News Chronicle published an article about them (3rd January 1942), \"180,000 die in Serb Terror. Mass murders of men, women and children are described by the Ar chbishop of the Serbian Orthodox Church in a document which has reached the Yugoslav Legation in London. It is the mo st ghastly record of bestiality yet compiled during the present war....

More than 600 people were killed in and around Krupa between July 25th and 30th. Most of them had been cut to pieces with knives, axes and scythes. In one place, four Orthodox Serbs were crucified on the doors of their houses, tortured and fina lly killed with knives,\" reported the Daily Telegraph (3rd January 1942). \"It is suggested that the names (of the criminals) should go befo re an international court of justice to be se t up after the war...\" The Press releases created a sensation. There were protests on both sides of the Atlantic, led by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Ca tholics set in motion a by-focal campaign of minimization and defamation. One of its most successful promoters was an American Catholic le ft-winger, of Slovene origin, Louis Adamic. Adamic set out to prove to the American people that the massacres were not true. Or that, if true, they had b een rigged. And, last but not least, th at the \"Chetnik Courier,\" as he labeled Dr. Sekulich, was a Nazi Agent. Since Adamic's tactics were univers ally adopted during and after the war, it might be instructive to glance at them.According to him: \"the atrocities were all propaganda...to stir up anti-Catholicism...\" However, to give the impression of \"impartiality ,\" Adamic eventually explained, in a book entitled My Native Land , how he dealt with the issue. \"What could we do,\" he wrote, referring to the news of the Croatian horrors. \"The re just might be some basis for these horrible stories... (note his reluctant admission).... None of our little group in New York could get into occupied Yugoslavia to investigat e the facts. The nearest we could get was London. \"The following resume includes facts learned and co rroborated,\" he continued. \"Large scale massacres of Serbians in Croatia occurred. But,\" he commente d, \"the total number of victims was not anywhere near 180,000 (the lowest figure prev iously reported). Reliable estimates from inside Yugoslavia were TENS OF THOUSANDS ONLY. \"Secondly, \"the massacres were not perpetrated by the Croatian people, but by the Ustashi.\" Thirdly, \"Yes, Catholic priests converted the Or thodox,\" Adamic admitted, but \"Catholic priests in Croatia accompanied Ustashi murder squads and 'converted' thousands of Orthodox Serbians to Catholicism under the threat of death from Ustashi guns, much as the Spanish padres accompanying the conquistadors 'converted' the Ce ntral and South American Indians. \" Adamic could not deny the existence of photographs . But no one should believe them, he commented. Here are his words: Photographs of the massacres exis ted. I saw them. Some were horri ble beyond utterance. There were pictures of vast piles of bodies, of stacked up head s, tubfulls of necklaces of human eyes... But only a few looked authentic...it was clear that most of them were arranged by Gest apo photographers. In two or three pictures, men in the garb of Catholic priests were among Ustashi. After which Adamic drew his own conclusion:"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"ALL OR MOST of the pictures,\" he said, \"were taken by Gestapo ag ents, who turned them over to Serbian Orthodox clergymen... The Ort hodox priests reacted just as th e Gestapo had expected... They must get this information to th e Yugoslav Government in London... The Gestapo helped to arrange this. A Serbian messenger, Dr. Sekulich, got out of Axis-occupied Yugoslavia with a German and a Quisling passport...and gave the photographs, the re port of a puppet bishop, and other documents - all Gestapo approved - to the Yugoslav di plomatic officials in Istanbul. Th e material was then rushed to London by the same courier, Sekulich... British authori ties arrested him...as a Nazi Agent...but he was released on the insistence of the Yugoslav Governme nt's inner clique....\"The inner clique,'' continued Adamic, \"relayed the Gestapo information about the massacres by diplomatic pouch to Fotich in Washington and elsewhere... It also submitted the st ory to the Bishop (sic) of Canterbury, who reacted just as the clique, and Hitle r, desired....\" and so on. Adamic's tactics were too good to be ignored. He was the Catholic spearhead of another Catholic master truth-distorter who was to plague the US A a decade later, Senator Joseph McCarthy. As with Senator McCarthy, so also with Adamic the ponder ous Catholic machinery was set in motion to promote the Adamic line. The Catholic and Catholic-controlled Press and Ra dio of the U.S.A. and Allied Governments followed suit. Result: the atrocities were minimized, their genuineness questio ned when not attributed to anti- Catholic propaganda, and finally they were forgo tten. Had the Adamic lobby b een confined to that, it would have been bad enough. But it succeeded in prev enting the truth from reaching quarters with sufficient authority to prevent the prolongation of the situation, e.g. the Pres ident of the USA. For Adamic and his supporters had, indeed, managed to get the ear of Presiden t Roosevelt himself. The insidiousness of the Adamic t echnique can be judged by the fact that Adamic was eventually to give account to Dr. Sekulich in court. Another wr ongly accused victim: Winston Churchill. Adamic's book, Dinner at the White House, (to quote the Law Report, January 15th, 1947, High Court of Justice) \"purported to be a description of a dinner party given at the White House by the late President Roosevelt, at which Mr. Winston Ch urchill, then Prime Minister, and the author were present. With this dinner as the starting point, the book proceeded to a criticism of both Mr. Churchill personally . . . and of his actions and supposed pol icy in relation to the war...\" In this book Mr. Adamic insinuated that \"the motives of the British Policy in Greece were at least partly linked to the fact that Hambro's Bank of London, the chief British cr editors of Greece (getting up to 17 per cent on their loans) had bailed Winst on Churchill out of bankr uptcy in 1912....\"A grosser libel upon a public man holding the hi gh position which Mr. Churchill he ld is difficult to conceive... But the reflection made upon his solvency is as nothing to the suggestion that in his capacity of Prime Minister he had allowed hi s private feelings and his private inte rests to sway and influence the policy and conduct of public affairs by the G overnment of which he was the head, and especially in regard to operations of war in which blood was shed.\" [1] Churchill, like Sekulich, issued a writ for libel action. Four years later, in 1951, Mr. Adamic was shot dead in Milford, USA. The reality of the Catholic massacres and forcib le conversions remained hazy to many people: not only because of their incredible nature, but also because of the Catholic lobby. The present author himself for some years remained skep tical about them. Used as he was to the saturation technique of war propaganda (being, at that time, em ployed in the Intelligence and Political Warfare of the Allies' war machine), even after meeting Dr. Sekulich he accepted the Croatian atrocities with skepticism. It took some years before finally he became convinced of their veracity. During this time"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"he contacted Yugoslavs of all cl asses. From General Mirkovich, th e man who caused the overthrow of the Yugoslav Government when the latter signed a p act with Hitler and thus brought his country into the Allies' camp (1941) to the humblest manual worker. Not content with this, the author personally interrogated numerous Or thodox Serbs, and even Catholic Croats, who had been eyewitnesses of the Ustashi massacres. Indeed, he even met victims who had escaped them. In addition to which, on the 20th May 1951, Dr. Sekulich, General Mirkovich and he held a special meeting in London. This was attende d by victims of the Usta shi residing in England, from whom further documentation was received. All authenticated with names, dates and places.A typical case was that related by a su rvivor of the Ustashi, Vojislav Zivanic (father, Duko; brother, Bogoljub), from Dukovsko, before witnesses and under oath, which we have already mentioned elsewhere. In June 1943 an Ustashi contingent, passing through the village of Zijimet, rounded up seventy-four villagers, put them into a shed, and set this on fire. Among the victims were the aunt of the eyewitness and her two children. This man lost twenty-five memb ers of his family, all burned alive. The author of this book was not the only doubter of the Croatian nightmare. Thousands of others shared his skepticism. The result of the insidi ous Catholic brainwashi ng propaganda, promoted by Catholics who had adopted Adamic's techniques. An early victim was an illustrious personage who, because of her status and that of her husband, ga ve added significance to the damage which the Catholic Adamic falsifications of history worked in responsible places. Not long after Mr. Winston Churchill took Adamic to Court ( 1947), the present author, at a pr ivate dinner party in Upper Brook Street, Mayfair, London, met Mrs. El eanor Roosevelt, wife of the late American President. Since, at this period, the author was engaged upon his inquirie s concerning the authenticity of the Ustashi, he asked Mrs. Roosevelt whether she had ever heard of them. One of the worst, if not the worse, crimes of the war, was her prompt reply. I heard of them in the winter of 1941-2. Neither I nor my husband at first believed them to be true. \"I did not believe them either,\" the present author commented. I assumed them to be propaganda.\" We thought the same, replied Mrs. Roosevelt. \"The Catholic lobby was the most successful at the White House for years.\" Had she ever heard of an American author, L. Adamic? She had. One of the many who had persuaded her husband that the atrocity st ories from Croatia had been co ncocted by the Nazi propaganda machine. Could she explain why these Catholic at rocities were not as well known as the Nazi ones? Nazi Germany is no more,\" replied Mr s. Roosevelt. \"The Catholic Chur ch is still here with us. More powerful than ever. With her own Press and the World Press at her biddi ng. Anything published about the atrocities in the future will not be believed....\"The present author thereupon told her he was writing a book about them.\"Your book might convince a few,\" she commented. \"But what about the hundreds of millions already brainwashed by Catholic propag anda?\" A few years later, in 1953, when the book was eventually published, although two editions were sold within week s, no part of the British or American Press dared even to mention it. The Yugoslav Government bought a few thousand copies , which were distributed free to the members of the House of Commons and House of Lords.

[2] During 1942, however, news of the massacres fina lly reached the outside world. And while the majority of Catholics denied or minimized them , not a few condemned them, e.g. Dr. Ivan Chok, a Catholic Slovene, who on 15th March 1942 ended a br oadcast by saying \"the long arm of justice will surely reach the guilty ones, to punish them me rcilessly.\"Another Slovene, Dr. Kuhar, a Catholic priest, in the Catholic Herald, 20th February 1942, and in the Catholic Times , 22nd February 1942, repudiated the Croatian methods of forcible conversion. \"We as Cathol ics...have the right and have the duty to condemn with all our might any conversion to our faith by force,\" he wr ote. Dr. Vilder, a Croat and a Catholic, during a broadcas t condemned not only the atrociti es but also those who tacitly encouraged them. \"Orthodox people are being forcibly converted to Catholicism, and yet we do not hear one single word of protest from Archbis hop Stepinac,\" he said (1 6th March 1942). Another Catholic Croat, Mr. Jerich, who escaped from Y ugoslavia, issued a decl aration jointly with a Dalmatian Croat, Mate Ruskovich (23rd July 194 3): \"We protest against mass massacre and forced Catholicization of Serbian Orthodox population....\" Catholics and non-Catholic s alike not only protested, but addre ssed themselves to the Catholic authorities, both in Croatia and in Rome. Their protests, howeve r, fell upon deaf ears. While Archbishop Stepinac and Pope Pius Xll went on giving ever more fre quent thanks to a merciful God for the increasing number of forcible conversions, a dditional protesting voices began to be heard with mounting insistence within a nd without Croatia. The sneers of those who at first had regarded the news as a crude form of anti-Catholic propaganda, as re liable information began to leak out ceased and gave way, first to astonishment and then to horror. App eals were made to Stepinac, the Pope and the Allies from all over Europe. Not only from Serbs, who ha d every reason for letting the world know, but also from Catholics, who could not accept such a bl oody degradation of their religion. Some lodged horrified protests with Archbishop Stepinac, and, i ndeed, direct with the Va tican. Perhaps one of the most outstanding was that written by Prvislav Grizogono. Grizogono was a Minister of the Kin gdom of Yugoslavia, a Croat, a nd a devout Catholic. Yet nothing could more eloquently indict his Church than his letter, the words of whic h were most carefully considered and scrupulously weighed:\" Your Grace: I write this to you as man to man, as a Ch ristian to a Christian. Since the first day of the Independent Croatian State the Serbs have been ma ssacred (in Gospich, Gudovac, Bos. Krajina, etc.) and this massacring has continued to this day. He follows with a detailed enumeration of some of the crimes perpetrated. Af ter which he concludes:\" Why do I write this to you? Here is why: In a ll these unprecedented crimes , worse than pagan our Catholic Church has also participated in two ways. Fi rst, a large number of priests, clerics, friars and organized Catholic youth actively part icipated in all these crimes, but more terrible even Catholic priests became camp and group commanders, and as su ch ordered or tolerate d the horrible tortures, murders and massacres of a baptized people. N one of this could have been done without the permission of their Bishops, and if it was done, they should have been brought to the Eccl esiastical Court and unfrocked. Since this di d not happen, then ostensibly the Bishops gave their consent by acquiescence at least. The Catholic Church has used all means to Catholicize forcibly the remaining Serbs... The province of Stem is covered with the leaflets of Bishop Aksamovitch, printed in his own"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"printing shop at Djakovo. He calls upon the Serbs, through these leaflets, to save their lives and property, recommending the Catholic faith to them.' Wh at will happen to us Croats if the impression is formed that we participated in all these crimes to the finish? Again it is the dut y of the Church to raise its voice: first because it is a Church of Christ; se cond because it is powerful. I write to you this, about such terrible crimes, to save my soul, and I leave it to you to find a way to save yours. Signed, Prvislav Grizogono, former Minister of the Kingdom of Yugos lavia. At Zemun, February 8, 1941. Not content with that, Dr. Grizogono di spatched another letter to the Catholic Archbishop of Belgrade, Dr. Ujchich, who seemed sympathetic to his request. In it the Catholic former Minister of Yugoslavia begged the Archbishop to ask the P ope to order the Catholic Hierar chy to stop the mounting Ustashi terror by the prompt enforcement of ecclesiastical discipline and, if necessary the use of papal authority. Did the Archbishop of Belgra de state that the persecutions were pure fabrications or, at least, were grossly exaggerated? The Ar chbishop denied nothing. In fact, by his reply he confirmed their authenticity. Indeed, he disclosed that he was fully conversant with what was then happening. Here is what he wrote to Dr. Grizogono: I thank you for your letter. The information about th e massacres we have al ready received from many different sources. I have forwarde d everything to the Vatican, and I believe that everything possible will be done. [3] The outcries of the civilized world ec hoed as vainly in the halls of the Catholic Hierarchy as in those of the Vatican. The saintly Pope and the worthy Archbishop were mute. Th eir silence cost the lives of 850,000 men, women and children, the bl oodiest religious massacre of the century. Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum—Such evil deeds could religion inspire.

This, not so much to confer on them eternal bliss, as to further th e Church militant—that is, her expanding dominion on earth. Archbishop Stepinac and Pope Pius XII, therefore, let th e terror in sealed Cr oatia take its course to the very end. Indeed, far from ever attempting to curtail it, they kept it alive, until the Kingdom tumbled with the fall of Fascism. And yet before the echoes of the dictators ceased to be heard the Vatican suddenly appeared by the side of the victors, in a stealthy attempt to save moribund Fascism wherever it could. Following consultations with Rome, Archbishop Stepinac and Ante Pave lic set in motion a joint plan to prevent their model State from crumbling as Fascist Europe was doing all around them. This consisted of: (a) preventing the Yugoslav Government from scattering the Ustashi armies; (b) persuading the Allies to occupy Yugoslavia, so as to prevent the Central Government from taking over the Independent Cat holic State of Croatia. The two set out with desperate determination to implement their new policy, sustained by the belief that the Vatican would use its influence among the big Powers to save them. While waiting, however, they began to reorganize the Usta shi armies, with the specific object ives of (a) preventing the collapse of Ustashi Croatia, and (b) of resisting and possi bly destroying the new Central Yugoslav Government. To the latter, such stubborn hostili ty was of the utmost seriousness, as at that period it was busily engaged in cleansing the country of resisting pockets of Nazi troops. The fight it had simultaneously to maintain against the Ustashi bands, therefore, put a considerable additional strain on the new Central Government. This was rendered even graver by the fact that in the in ternational sphere Yugoslavia was considered a pawn for the already quarreling vict orious great Powers, each of which was ready to negotiate with anyone, in or outside that country, to advance its own projects. Stepinac and Pavelic did all they could to see that Yugoslavia mi ght be occupied by the \"right\" Allies—that is to say, by those willing to strike a deal with the Vatican for continued \"independence\" of Croatia. The true nature of th eir exertions can best be gauged if it is remembered that since 1941 Yugoslavia had been one of the Allies herself. St epinac and Pavelic approached the Supreme Allied Command for the Mediterranean, and duly submitted a memorandum, openly outlining their policy: indeed, asking specifically for a prompt Allied o ccupation of the whole country. Anglo-American armies should be dispatched with speed, they sa id. Ustashi troops would welcome them, and more would join them. The \"right\" Allies must not lo se another day. Civil war had broken out all over Yugoslavia. They must intervene. Having invoked the guns of the \"right\" Allies, the good Archbishop set out to use the spiritual guns of the Church. On March, 24, 1945, he summoned his own bishops to a conference. Result: the blatant use of the spiritual authority of the Church for the promotion of political and military designs."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Stepinac, backed by most of the bishops, issued a past oral letter. After duly prai sing Ante Pavelic, their lordships attacked the Yugoslav National Liberation m ovement with all the pious venom of which they were capable. Thereupon they ordered all Croats to help the Ustashi bands to fight the Yugoslav troops. Only thus they thought w ould Ustashi Croatia survive. As the situation worsened it became necessary to ta ke another step. Following hasty consultations with the Vatican shortly before the total disintegration, An te Pavelic asked a trusted friend to take hold of the reins of Ustashi Government. His name? Archbishop Stepinac. [1] It was a shrewd move. A last desperate attempt to unite the Ustashi State into a truly compact unit. Stepin ac—or rather the Vatican, which had inspired it—had fancied that, once the spir itual, political, and military forces of the State were centralized in the head of the Catholic Hi erarchy, the Archbishop's au thority would delay the disintegration of the State—indeed, by strengthening its fabric, might even prevent its collapse, and thus enable Vatican diplomacy in the meantime to exert its growing pressure on certain Allies, until these consented to save the Ustashi State from obliteration. The move neither stopped the swiftl y advancing Yugoslav Army nor save d from total collapse the fast- tumbling European Fascism. The Ustashi State had b een doomed long before Stepinac tried to save it. In a losing battle to prevent its inevitable fate , Pavelic and his bloody bands, months before, had unloosed such a reign of terror as almost to surpass the previ ous ferocity. People were hanged, executed, or liquidated as hostages on the slightest suspicion. To take the city of Zagreb and its immediate envi rons, in the course of only seven months (From August, 1944, to February, 1945) 379 hostages were publicly hanged. On August 7, 1944, between the villages of Precec and Ostrono, ten persons were ha nged; on August 26, at Jablanac, near Zapresic, thirty-six persons; on September 30, on the railway between the stations of Pusca Bistra and Luka, ten persons; on October 4, at St. Ivan, twenty-nine pers ons; on October 5, again at Zapresic, five persons; on October 6, at Cucerje, twenty persons; on October 9, at Velika Gorica, thirteen persons; on October 28, at Djurinac, twenty persons; on the same day at Sveta Nedjelja, near Samobor, eighteen persons; on December 1, at Brezovica, ten persons; on December 20, at Odra, thirteen persons; on December 28, at Krusljevo Selo, fifty persons; on January 4, 1945, at Zitnjak, twenty-five pe rsons; on January 25, at Konscina, forty persons; on Februa ry 3, again at Zitnjak, ten pers ons; on February 10, at Remetinac, thirty persons; on February 13, at Vrapce, twenty persons; on February 22, again at Vrapce, another twenty persons. Notwithstanding all this, the end approached fast. W ithin a few days, Zagreb, the Croatian capital, was liberated. The Ustashi tried to save what they coul d. At the end of April, 1945, Pavelic, with the full consent of Stepinac, ordered the burial, in the Fr anciscan monastery in Za greb Cathedral city, the Capitol, of thirty-six chests of plundered gol d and valuables—rings, jewelry, gold watches, gold dentures, gold fillings which had been wrenched from the jaws of victims whom the Ustashi had massacred—and about two truckloads of silver. Then, when the collapse was complete, having entrusted to the care of Stepinac hi mself their most important documents, [2] the Ustashi ran for their lives. Some were executed. Many escaped. Pavelic fled to Austria, where he was made a prisoner by the American forces near Salzburg. While preparati ons for his official trial were well on their way, a \"mysterious intervention\" stopped the proceedings. Why! Pavelic was released unconditionally. Pius XII, through Stepinac and the Archbi shop of Salzburg, had seen to it th at his protégé did not suffer the fate of many other war criminals who were ha nged. Pavelic, rendered immune by the powerful papal protection, traveled to Italy and found it in the Vatican City, wher e he waited for easier times."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"After a while, to avoid scandal, th e Pope, now a pillar of the victor ious democracies, required Pavelic to quit Rome. Pavelic went from one monastery to another in monkish disgui se under various aliases, Father Benares, or Father Gomez. Meanwhile in Croatia—Stepinac, in accord with the Holy Father, continued his ominous preparations for war. The Ustashi, instead of disbanding, became gue rrillas. They were, as in olden times, to fight in the hills and woods of \"occupied Croatia.\" Their ne w enemy: the Central Government of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, which had repl aced the Yugoslav kingdom. Their new terrorist activities were to be cl oaked again in innocent-so unding religious organizations . The old name of \"The Crusaders\" was adopted. After clan destinely meeting with the Ustashi Chief of Police in September, 1945, Stepinac summoned another Bishops' Conference in Zagreb. Once more their Graces, claiming to be men of peace, incited to war. In a pastoral letter they asked the people in so many unctuous words to rise and overthrow the Government. Before such battle orders were issued, a flag, a sy mbol of the great holy ar my of the Ustashi, was consecrated to the Ustashi Crusaders' forces. Wher e did the ceremony take place? In Stepinac's chapel. On November 8, 1945, the good Archbishop received an agent who brought from Salzburg the \"Pledge of Ustashi intellectuals\"—to fight the Yugoslav Government till the end \"for the liberation of the Croatian people.\" The pledges of the surviving Usta shi, the activities of Archbis hop Stepinac, were no shadow of resistance, but concrete and real. Stepinac employed dangerous, ruthless individuals. To cite only one, the former Ustashi Chief of Police. This indivi dual launched a progra mme of sabotage and of assassination of the officials of the New Yugoslav Republic, with the Archbishop's approval. Stepinac furthermore established contact with the scattered armed bands of the Ustashi, directing priests and monks to act as liaison with them. These holy men traveled all over the count ry, keeping the illegal Crusader groups in communication with one anothe r. They zealously reporte d their position, strength, and equipment to Stepinac in Zagr eb. The Archiepiscopal Headquarter s saw to it that such reports reached the Vatican, which, as a genuine champion of all democracies, forwarded them to the USA. [3] The chain—Ustashi, Stepinac, Vatican, USA—was not merely a clandestine news agency. It was something more: a bait to induce ce rtain Allied forces to promote a timely military intervention against Yugoslavia. For, indeed, Stepinac and his illegal bands based their hope of ultimate success upon that. The Vatican, far from counseling moderation, encourag ed the Ustashi resistan ce, and added continual fuel to their burning hopes with repeated assuran ces of forthcoming military intervention. The Allies would come to their help. They must hold on, as the international situation was bound to change in their favour. The Western Powers were going to turn against their recent ally, Soviet Russia. A war of liberation was in preparation. Once that had be gun, Yugoslavia would be wiped out, and Ustashi Croatia would spring again to the fore. The Ustashi guerrillas talked of nothi ng else. Stepinac saw to it that their expectations were maintained at the highes t level, lest their enthusiasm change to despair, and thus cause the total collapse of organized military resistance. To this effect, the prestige and authority of re ligion were once more unscrupulously employed. \"The Fathers\"—that is, the various Catholic padres whom the Archbishopric of Zagreb had duly attached to the illegal terroristic Ustashi ba nds—went from hideout to hideout, encouraging the impatient Ustashi troops to endure a little longer. Th e British and Americans were just coming. But they must be patient, as, naturally, to plan a good military expedition took time. The assurances of the Catholic padres were repeated day in and day out, until they became a refr ain for the Ustashi loops, expecting \"the day\" as,"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"simultaneously, their day of deliverance and the new bi rthday of a more glorious Ustashi Croatia. This was not merely the conviction of the underground Ustashi formations or th at of the priests. It was that of Stepinac himself, sure that once the Allies in tervened, the Ustashi would be given help by the peasants, who \"one day will rise.\" [4] The Archbishop, however, was not cont ent only with wiping out Yugoslavi a as a political unit in order to ensure the resurgence of a new Catholic Croatia. He was allured by visions of superb grandeur— nothing less than that an Allied in tervention would be a stepping-stone leading them to Belgrade and, then, to Moscow. The issue, according to conser vative forecasting, rested on conventional military weapons. Stepinac, however, although a Catholic Ar chbishop, was a man of progressive ideas. He believed in the power of scientific achievements, such as the recently discovered atomic energy. The atom bombs dropped without a warning on Hiroshima and Nagasaki had in a few seconds blotted out of existence 100,000 men, women, and children. Catholic Providence had not given the Christian West atomic bombs for nothing. It was th e duty of the Western Allies to use them. Stepinac was a logical man. If he had used the Ustashi to impose Cat holicism upon the Serb Orthodox, it was perfectly natural for him to look \"upon the West to use it s atomic power to impos e Western civilization on Moscow and Belgrade, before it is too late.\" The ruthlessness of such advocacy was typically Cat holic. Christianity (that is, Catholicism) could be—indeed, had to be—imposed upon those rejecti ng Christian civilization, and, failing persuasion, this must be done by force. Such Catholic reason ing had made Ustashi Croatia possible; the same Catholic reasoning now had begun looking on wider hor izons, to make a new Ustashi regime of a whole Continent. Was that the personal whim of Archbishop Stepin ac? It was the basic Ca tholic policy emanating directly from the Vatican. This was proved only thr ee years later (1949) when another pillar of the Catholic Church—i.e. Cardinal Mindszenty of Hungary—having planned to overthrow the Hungarian Government, reckoned on the military intervention of the \"right\" kind of Allies. Such intervention would have meant general war, and hence the use of atomic bombs. Cardinal Mindszenty had acted on the assumption that the overthrow of the Hungarian Government, with the cons equent \"restoration of the Hungarian Catholic Monarchy of Hapsburg in its place, could be achieved with help from abroad...in case a new world war created su ch a situation,\" to quote his own words. [5] \"I regarded it (the outbreak of the third world war) as a basis, \" said the Cardinal. Minds zenty could well think and act in this fashion, in the comforting knowle dge that behind him stood the Vatican, bent upon furthering its vast political scheme s, on the assumption of a third worl d conflict. Vatican political post- war designs had precisely that \"as a basis.\" Are these speculations? Actions speak louder than words. Pius XII at th is same period was not idle. He held talks with prominent military leaders of the \"right\" Allies upon whom first Stepinac and then Mindszenty had counted so much. British and, above a ll, American generals came and went in endless procession to and from His Holiness. To give one typical example: On one single day in June, 1949, Pius XII received five USA generals in succes sive audiences; General Mark Clark, wartime Commander of the U.S. Fifth Army in Italy, and subsequently Comman der in the Korean war; Lieut.- General J. Cannon, Commanding General of the U.S. Air Force in Europe; Major-General Robert Douglass, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Armed Forces in Europe; Major-General Maxwell Taylor, Deputy Commander, European Command; and Lieut.-General Geoffrey Keye s, Commanding General of the U.S. forces in Austria. [6] All these went to see, not the self-styled papal Prince of Peace; they went to talk with the Pope, like them, a man of war. [7] "},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"With the Vatican as a busy center of vast war designs , it was inevitable that some of its dignitaries in various countries should become its political refl ections or spokesmen. Ar chbishops and Cardinals consequently spoke and acted on the assumption of war, and hence the use of atomic bombs. The Vatican, which within an astonish ingly brief period had developed the most intimate relations with certain malign forces in the USA, was not merely indulging in wishful thinking when it passed on such information to its emissaries abroad. It informed them of what was going on behind the scenes in certain quarters. That this was a most sinister, incredible reality was demonstrated to a stunned world the following year. On August 27, 1950, Mr. Franci s Matthews, during a speech in Boston, called upon the United States to become the first aggressor for peace . [8] In plain words, to launch a third world conflict. That is, to initiate an atomic war. Mr. Francis Matthews was neither a crank nor an irresponsible citizen. He was a powerful man in the American Government: none other than the Secretary of the American Navy. But Mr. Matthews was also something which at this juncture was perhaps even more ominous. He was a fanatical Ca tholic, honoured many times for his services to Catholic welfare work; and, more than that, Mr. Ma tthews had been the head of the most villainous Catholic organization in the whole of the USA—that is, the Knights of Columbus . And, as if that were not sufficient, he was nothing less than a secret Papal Chamberlain of Pope Pius XII. With individuals so highly placed, the Vatican coul d not help being so well-informed of what was brewing in certain quarter s preparing to be the first aggressors for peace . The information it passed to the Servants of the Church, theref ore, moulded the policies of bishops and Cardinals, such as Stepinac and Mindszenty, playing the complicated Vatican ga me on the chessboard of postwar Europe. The declarations of secret Papal Cham berlains, of Cardinals, and of Archbishops, consequently, far from being the personal opinions of indi viduals, were the expression of hope s and policies entertained at the source which, as early as 1946, had already inspired all the main schemes and beliefs of Stepinac— namely, the Vatican.

"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 THE CATHOLIC CHURCH PREP ARES FOR THE FUTURE It is the duty of any State, inde pendently of its religious or ideol ogical nature, to defend itself when threatened by domestic or external enemies. The Central Government of Yugoslavia, aware of Archbishop Stepinac's activities, past and present, c ould not continue to watc h them indefinitely and aloof. Sooner or later, it had to consider steps to end them. If the Government had had to deal with a simple political or military leader, the solution would have been ready at hand. But here the i ssue was complicated by the fact that a political leader was also the head of the Catholic Hierarchy. Hi s arrest would raise complex reli gious repercussions at Rome, and therefore practically th roughout the Western world. The Yugoslav Government decided to solve the problem tactfully, by removing Stepinac, without raising the religious hornet's nest issue. To that end, it approached Pius Xll, demanding the Archbishop's withdrawal from Zagreb. The Vatican, true to its reputation as a master of Sibylline moves, in October, 1945, charged an American in Y ugoslavia, Bishop J.P. Hurle y, of Florida, at that time acting as the Vatican Apostolic Nuncio there, to investigate the case and report on it direct to the Pope. Bishop Hurley made extensive inquiries and wrote a comprehensive memorandum, which was speedily sent to Pius XII. Pius XII read it, mu sed upon it, and then decide d to proceed as already planned with regard to Stepinac. Hurley's findi ngs were promptly pigeonholed, and never heard of again. The Yugoslav Government waited. As the head of the Government himself testified, \"waited four months without receiving any reply.\" [1] The Vatican was silent because Pius XII planned a war of his own, in which Stepinac was to play a very prominent role. It was the beginning of a psyc hological papal cold war. In this war religion would be used as the main instrument, directed at stirri ng up emotional hatred for political ends. Stepinac had to be sacrificed to the requireme nts of Catholic world diplomacy. [2] Having embarked on this course, the Vatican first contacted, not the waiting Yugosl av Government, but Archbishop Stepinac, whom it ordered to carry on. When the War Crimes Commission, which, mean while, was collecting documentation on war criminals, produced its evidence con cerning the head of the Catholic Hi erarchy, and presented it to the Yugoslav Government, the latter, af ter further vain attempts with the Vatican, decided to act. On September 18, 1946, Archbishop Stepinac was arrested. Th e utmost care was taken that the trial should be fair, in view of the fact that it was certain to raise all kinds of religious and political complications within and outside Yugoslavia. A lthough only about one-third of th e Yugoslav population is Catholic, the Government saw to it that all the officials at the trial were Cr oatian Catholics. The world Press was invited to attend, which it did. On October 11, 1946, after a ten days' hearing, the Court—composed, it should be remembered, of Catholic s—sentenced Archbishop Stepinac to sixteen years imprisonment. The Vatican uttered a cry of horror, instantly amp lified a thousandfold by the Catholic Hierarchies, Catholic agencies, and Catholic Press the world over. Pope Pius Xll ordered the ex communication of"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"all those who had taken part in the trial, from Tito himself down to the last official connected in any way with Stepinac's indictment. All received a sole mn Catholic guarantee of eternal damnation in genuine Catholic brimstone and inextinguishable infernal fire. The thing was made even more fearsome by a papal afterthought, which promised the personal attention of Lucifer himself on all those so excommunicated. The Prince of Devils would torture all the unChristian persecutors of the Archbishop during eons wit hout end. Papal authority had decreed so. Amen. Had such authority been exercised only in hell, it would have worried fewer Christians than is generally believed. Infernal candidates must first em igrate to the next world, and no case has as yet been authenticated of anybody dying because of the scor ching effect of the spir itual papal bolts. With millions of the living, however, this same papal authorit y is neither problematic nor fictitious. It is real, widespread, and dangerous. It can tap vast sources of power at will, whether to help its friends and allies or to dismay its enemies. Last but not least, it can engender th e darkest currents of religious and political emotionalism, to contro l and use the deceived masses of Ca tholics and non-Catholics alike to further its own interests. The case of Step inac once more strikingly demonstrated this. The Pope set in motion the vast machinery of Ca tholic propaganda, which in no time flooded the world with such mountainous distortions and such plain dis honesty as to shame the most deceitful of all the devils in hell. Overnight Stepinac, the authoritarian leader, the poli tical plotter, the politician, the promoter of the forcible conversions , the tolerator and indirect instig ator of the Ustashi massacres, was made to appear as Stepinac the defender of true democracy, the most holy Archbishop, the courageous champion of religious freedom, the persecuted and th e martyr. Millions accepte d the Catholic version. The result was that soon large sections of the Western world, who until then had not even bothered with the whole thing, hailed Step inac as the pitiful victim of anti-Christia n barbarism. The lay Press followed suit, exalting Stepinac as th e champion of Christianity fighting the powers of darkness. Religious and political l eaders joined in the chorus. Fore ign Offices, heads of States, and, indeed, whole Governments of Cath olic and non-Catholic lands sent official protests against \"such unheard-of religious persecution.\" Qu estions were heatedly asked in the British House of Commons, in the French, Italian, and Belgian Chambers of Deputie s, in the American Hous e of Representatives and Senate. In the USA. President Truman was subjec ted to a tremendous pressure to force him to intervene on behalf of the \"m artyred Stepinac.\" A worldwide m ovement was set up to induce the United Nations to come to the rescue of a man who had defended all the religious and civil liberties for which the United Nations was said to stand. The emotional mass distortion engineered by the mast er minds at the Vatican soon began to yield its poisonous harvest, not so much in the religious r ealm as where it was poten tially a thousandfold more dangerous: that is, in the political field. At this period, it must be remembered, the Cold War was still in its earliest stage. The blind emotionalism engendered by the trial and its aftermat h was used to widen the growing gap between the Russian Dominated Communist and the American-led capitalist worlds. Soviet Russia slowed down its de mobilization and kept a large st anding land army on a war footing. The USA pushed ahead its war preparations to such an extent that, after the Stepinac trial had taken place, it had already spent the co lossal sum of almost one billion dollars on stock-piling. [3] By 1947 the military forces of the world numbered 19 million, and were maintained at an annual cost of 27,000 million dollars. This, less than two years after the fa ll of Hitler. From then onward military expenditure"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"rocketed to astronomical figures. By the time th at Yugoslavia—who, meanwhile , owing to ideological developments, had leaned towards the West—par tially set Archbishop Step inac free (winter 1951-2) and Stepinac, from Archbishop, became a Card inal (1953), the world had been split asunder. [4] The American factories were made to hum, while the American Air Force, Army, and Navy were posted throughout the world in main strategic places, rea dy to strike. Colossal expenditures for war were voted by the American Administration—e. g. 129,000 million dollars, voted by Congress within less than two years (1950-2) for military armaments and constructions. [5] By early 1953 in Europe alone the USA. had already built more than a hundred airfields, many specially equipped for atomic operations, as defensive-offensive bases against Russia. [6] In Communist Russia preparations of the same ma gnitude as a defensive-offensive war policy were carried out, with impetus to match their Western count erparts. Within a few brief years from the end of the Second World War billions of roubles were appropriated for m ilitary purposes. In no time, while Soviet Russia became the arsenal of the East, the US A became the arsenal of the West, and its most powerful political military leader. The nations of the world, although not yet out of the second world massacre, made ready for the oncoming third. Politi cians, generals, heads of governments, spoke of atomic wars. Armies reassembled, ready to march. A bloody rehearsal of anot her global slaughter, in imitation of the Spanish Civil War of 1939, where th e USA ideologically hostile armies rehearsed a small conflict to be ready for a big one, was staged in Korea in the summer of 1950. A gigantic armaments race undermined the economy of whole nations, thus rendering war between the two mighty Eastern and West ern blocs not so much probable as inevitable. While the increasingly powerful militaries asked for ever more colossal appropriations, from Vatican Hill came unctuous slogans for peace mingled with veiled threats, invocat ions to religion, and sanctimonious condemnations of the \"atheistic enemie s of Christianity.\" In cynical betrayal of the masses of honest, humble believers, the Vatican was plotting feveri shly in the political-diplomatic fields to further its designs. Then one day, above all this, voices were heard—the official voices of the reorganized bands of Ustashi, calling to their me mbers not to scatter, as the hour when they, the Catholic Ustashi of Croatia, would fight side by side with the democratic defenders of Western civilization was fast approaching. Th e glorious battalions of the Ustashi had to make ready. But while they were willing to fight for world liberty, they had to prepare to do so only in the name of Catholic Croatia, in Catholic units, and unde r the Croatian flag. No Ustashi, therefore, was permitted to join a foreign army. The appeal of the resuscitated terr orist bands—with the headqua rters in the USA.—ran thus: Headquarters of the V. assembly of Croatian Armed Forces, having jurisdiction over all subjects of the Croatian Armed Forces (Hr or Sn) living on the territo ry of the European Stat es. It has been learned that some persons, unauthorized, are endeavouring to persuade individuals to enlist in foreign armies. By the order of the Supreme Command of all Cr oatian Armed Forces, all subjects living in any European State be notified that no individual person is authorized for such activity, nor is it permitted enlisting in foreign armies in any capacity, with out a special authorized permit. The Supreme Command of all the Croatian Armed forces will call its forces to arm against Bolshevism when the time arrives to fight side by side with other anti-C ommunistic nations, under our own flag and within our Croatian army formations. Headquarters V. Assembly,"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"General Drinyanin, August, 1950. [7] These were noble words. The words of an ideal ist longing for liberty to prevail on earth. Many acclaimed the new defenders of freedom. In certain quarters, however, they knew better. For General Drinyanin was the alias of former Chief Commandant of all the terrib le Catholic concentration camps of Croatia, the leader of the bloody \"Ustashi Defe nse\" formations responsible for the massacre of 200,000 prisoners in the camps of Ja senovac, the \"protector\" of a ll the jackbooted or soutaned monsters who, a few short years before, had been enga ged in the forcible conve rsions to Catholicism, under the aegis of Step inac, now Cardinal. While the Ustashi, protected in the Western Hemi sphere, were sounding a new trumpet-call from the north, their leader, Ante Pavelic, was busy in the south on the same type of activity on which he had been engaged prior to the Second World War. For Pavelic had in 1948, thanks again to Vatican help, managed to leave Europe. Supplied with false docume nts given in Rome on an international Red Cross passport, he went to another Cathol ic country harbouring Nazi leaders: [8] the Argentine. [9] The false passport which had brought him to safety wa s furnished by another Catholic priest, a former Ustashi, Father Draganovic, residing in Rome. Priest Draganovic, to make sure that the former Chief should reach the Argentine safely, accompanied him personally as far as Buenos Aires. There he briefed certain high Argentine Hierarchs, after whic h he duly returned to Ro me (end of 1949). Priest Draganovic had acted not only as a z ealous Catholic, as a priest and as an Ustashi, but also as the representative of the Vatican, which was concerned w ith the future of a man, Ante Pavelic, and of an idea, ruthless Ustashi-ism, both of which, because they had succeeded in establishing a model Catholic State once, might succeed in rees tablishing it in a future which was, perhaps, not far ahead. Pavelic at once became active. Most of his meetings were held in Catholic parish halls in Buenos Aires. Catholic priests and friars participated in them—e.g. at the meeting held on February 5, 1951, five Catholic fr iars attended. [10] The majority of these meetings and similar activities were organized by priests, prominent among them the Ustashi Catholic Padre, the Rev. Mato Luketa. [11] Pavelic took to the Argentine three things: (a) Papal blessing, as good an intr oduction to the Argentine Hierarc hy, and hence to the Government, as any; (b) loot from Croatia; [12] (c) the Ustashi programme. While some of his lieutenants kept Ustashi-ism al ive in the USA and in Europe, Pavelic set about coordinating it in the Argentine. Meetings were held, papers were published, Ustashi abroad were organized. In 1949 Pavelic established the Hrvatska Drzavotvorna Stranka . In that same year he held six large meetings of the Ustashi, most of them in parish halls such as the Catholic Croat Parish Hall on Avenida Belgrano. Pavelic counseled that \"all honest Croats in exile should belong\" to his movement. Thereupon he instructed them all not to ta ke Argentine nationality, so that they would be able to leave the country without any hindrance. Pavelic talked of war and of blood. The titles of his article s told their tale: The Ideological War (La Guerra Ideologica),' [13] and The Call of Blood , the latter being an introd uction to the proclamation of"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"the resurrected Party. The basis of Pavelic's new policy was war. Like another pillar of political Catholicism before him—i.e. Cardinal Mindszenty—s o also Pavelic hoped for the outbreak of the Third World War. \"War will soon break out,\" he foretold on May 13, 1949, \"and then the liberation of Croatia will come.\" The next year, as we have already seen, the Un ited States Secretary of the Navy, the secret Chamberlain of the Pope, shocked the world by openl y asking the USA to start a \"preventive atomic war\" against Russia, in order to \"liberate\" the people of the earth. The Republican platform adopted in Chicago (July, 1952), after demanding an end to \"the negative futile and immoral policy of containment, which ab andons countless human beings to a despotism and godless terrorism,\" [14] asked for a policy directed at the spec ific promotion of sa botage, raising of resistance movements, industrial di sturbances, and, last but not leas t, the establishm ent of émigré governments. The American people went to the polls (November 4, 1952) and sent to power the Republican Party. With few exceptions unbounded rejoicing greeted the Republican victory throughout the Catholic world. The Pope himself, on hearing that General Ei senhower had been elected President, hastened to send by cable his \"divine blessing up on yourself and your administration,\" 15 Pavelic, in the Argentine, asked all the Ustashi to hail the Republican triumph. Ustashi priest s gave special thanksgivings in South and North America, as well as in Europe. Te Deums were sung. Divine Providence was again coming to the rescue. It had sent into power an Am erican Government which was determined to create \"political task forces\" to free \" captive\" countries. Indeed, to establ ish \"émigré governments.\" Were not the reorganized Ustashi a \"politi cal task force?\" Was not Catholic Croatia a \"captive\" country? Nobody could deny that Pavelic's new Ustashi Government was an \"émigré government.\" For truly, Pavelic had set up a new Ustashi Government. The New Ustashi Gove rnment had in fact been officially established by him in 1951, in the Argentine. It s religious and political programm e had not changed an iota from that of the old Ustashi dictatorship.With the Repub lican Administration in the White House, with a General determined on a strong foreign policy as Pres ident, with a Soviet Ru ssia preparing ruthless counter-measures, the world continued to move fast er and faster towards cat astrophe. Fanatical groups prepared and waited for \"the day.\" That is, fo r the outbreak of a third world war, when the establishment of \"émigré governments\" would ta ke place, among them the New Government of Croatia, ruled by the Ustashi and the Church. Ante Pavelic in South America, General Drinyani n in the USA, Father Draganovic in Rome, like hundreds of Catholic priests, friars, and laymen everywhere, had begun once more, as before the Second World War, to pray and work for World War III, so that they might be enabled again to bring \"freedom\"—namely, to unloose their reign of terro r upon a newly devastated Croatia.To such depths can the ideal of Liberty be made to sink.

In the words of Marshal Tito: When the Pope's representative to our Government, Bi shop Hurley, paid me his fi rst visit, I raised the question of Stepinac. \"Have him tran sferred from Yugoslavia, I said, fo r otherwise we shall be obliged to place him under arrest. We waited four months without receiving any reply. Tito, Zagreb, October 31,1946. 2. This was later confirmed by Stepinac himself, whe n, during an interview with C.L.

Such things do not depend upon Marshal Tito. They depend only upon the Holy Father, the Pope, and upon no one else.\" See also Universe, November 17, 1950. This policy subse quently led to the breaking of Yugoslav/Vatican diplomatic relations (December 18, 1952) prior to and after Stepinac being made a Cardinal (January, 1953) and the projected visit of Marshal Tito to Britain in 1953. In an attempt to embarrass the British Government and the United Nations, the British Hierarchy attacked the Marshal as a persecutor of Catholics. At the same time an e ffort was made to whitewash Stepinac. Articles with these aims appeared in the Tablet and were reprinted in pamphlet form by the Sword of the Spirit . These efforts would have been comic, if the Brit ish public had not been ready to believe them. 3. The USA began war preparations less than one year after Hitler's death ( 1945). These consisted of stockpiling essential raw materi als, a 100 percent war measure. On July 23, 1946, the USA passed Public Law 520 of the 79th Congress, approved by bot h Houses, for this purpose. The combined stock- piling in 1946 stood already at 4,536,000,000 dollars. From 1946 to 1950, before the Korean war began in June, the USA stockpile stood at 8,300,000,000 dollars. No figures were available from the USSR. 4. Owing to the split of Communist Yugoslavia from Soviet Russia, Yugoslavia became financially and militarily partially dependent upon the USA. American loans were asked for and granted. Tito himself publicly acknowledged that Yugoslavia had received over 1,000 million dollars' worth of aid from the West (Marshal Tito, Belgrade, March 16, 1952).

After the main actors of the Nazi regime, following the Nuremberg Trial, were executed by the victorious Allies, thousands of minor war crim inals took cover under the protective wings of the Catholic Church. Many sought refuge, literally in conv ents, monasteries, seminaries or other religious and semi-religious institutions. Catholic authorities acted mostly in the name of \"Christian\" ch arity or on humanitarian grounds, as many of them had already done with the Jews, when these were persecuted by the Nazis. Others, however helped the fleeing war criminals, for purely ideological motives. Amongst these not only heads of Catholic institutions, but also Bishops, and indeed even Cardinals. Because of the latter, many important war criminals, those who had prominen tly assisted the Vatican to set up the Catholic satrapies of Croatia or Slovaki a, were welcomed within the walls of Vatican City itself. The result of such \"hospitality\" was that in no time Vatican City became overcrowded with \"guests\" whose main concern appeared to be not piety, but an obvious anxiety to avoid identification. Thanks to the tacit cooperation of the Vatican authorities, th e \"guests\" obtained practical immunity from any official or semi-official investigation. Even th en, curiosity of newsmen or of nosey anti-Fascist organizations and individuals, were car efully avoided and successfully shunned. The Vatican campaign of protective secretiveness was maintained, owing to the fact that Vatican City was considered a sovereign state. This was also due to the fact that many of the victorious Allies did not wish to antagonize the Pope, whose notorious pa st had become part of recent history in his relationship with the Nazi regime. The immunity given by the Vatican offered the be st hope for many war criminals, who had been officially branded as such, from falling into the hands of the Allies. Since the protection of the Vatican offered the best guarantee of avoiding arrest a nd prosecution, the number of those seeking protection augmented until the secretive corridors of the Vatican could no longer contain them. Many therefore were given Roman abodes or were pla ced with Catholic families where they could live undetected; protected as they were by the discretion of their hosts, all pious Catholics, or if not pious, at least eager for the money thus paid th em by clergy charged with their welfare. The discreet patronage of the local parishes and busy monsignori going to and from the Vatican offices, and the even more discreet mobilization of Catholic institutes, soon accommodated very large numbers of \"refugees\" feveri shly seeking concealment."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Vatican City meanwhile became a veritable beehiv e of bureaucratic operations, mostly centered upon paperwork. Birth certificates, vi sas, passports, and similar ot her such documentations were manufactured, prepared, and delivered with professional efficiency. Even more important such documents were \"activat ed\" with such proficiency as to defy the most scrupulous scrutiny on the part of any over-zealous official at the s undry frontiers of the victorious Allies. The efficiency of such false documents astonished the authorities and the Allies themselves. It soon became an industry, even outside the Vatican walls. The explanation of course was a simple one. First of all the Allies, or rather certain departments of the Allies, had issued discreet instructions that certain passports, even if of a su spicious nature, should not be over-s crutinized. The instructions were tacitly followed. This resulted in thousands of mi nor officially branded war criminals escaping the official net. Thousands managed to flee to the South American Re publics, to Australia and even to the USA itself. The influx of \"wanted refugees\" in those countries b ecame such a controversial issue that it affected the relationship of various Allied governments when it became obvious that there had been put in operation a general policy directed at sa ving fleeing war criminals from Europe. The suspicions had been anything but baseless. The policy had been made to operate since the collapse of Nazi Germany. And, curiously en ough, it had been conceived by none ot her than certain sections of the USA Intelligence. The CIA at that time did not ye t exist, but the equivalent of its predecessor did; certain elements within were already making prep aration for a forthcoming war against the Soviet Union. Hence the discreet help to potential recruits for a potential USA-Allies invasion of the Russian provinces, as we shall see presently. The success of the joint policies of the Vatican and th e USA, directed at the concealment and escape of thousands of war criminals, was due also the fact that secretive gates had been created across the frontiers, with that specific purpose. Frontier official s had been briefed with th e task of \"detecting and protecting\" individuals holding \"spe cific\" documents; that is false papers, visas and sundry documents, beginning with phony passports. These, if and when recognized as false by officials not in the know, were made to become \"positive.\" In other words, certain officials were authorized to accept them as \"officially\" genuine, thus permitting their holders to enter into the various countries of des tination which included the USA. Such general travesty would have been impossible ha d it been left exclusively to the various \"false documentation\" factories of Europe, beginning with those based in Italy, starting with that of the Vatican. "},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Chapter 13 THE MAFIA, THE VATICAN AND THE USA. WHY THEY ENLISTED WAR CRIMINALS, STALIN AND ONE-THIRD OF EUROPE One of the major agencies connected with the operat ion was the Mafia. The Ma fia had been revitalized by the USA, even before the Allies invaded Sicily. The USA in fact \"recruited\" the Mafia altogether into the U.S. Army. It became part and parcel of the USA command. Mafiosi became the principal strategists of the inexpert Americans. The Mafiosi exploited the Americans with the cunni ng of Sicilian foxes and the alertness of keen businessmen, ready for any opportunity to make m oney. They \"advised\" American officers who knew nothing about local or Italian po litics, making them commit blunders of the greatest magnitude. The \"Mafiosi\" never let a golden opp ortunity to make money pass. On ce they heard of the passports and visa factories, they entered in to the field with a vengeance. Thei r expertise in the subtle art of falsification was second to none. They worked for the Vatican and even for the USA itself. Thanks to the protection of the USA and their hist orical cunning, the Mafia eventually prospered to such an extent that in the process it built itself into the mighty Mafia Empire of the future, which spanned the Atlantic for decades to come. It had political results of far reaching importance for Italy itself. It helped mightily to render Sicily a semi-autonomous island where the Mafia ruled supreme, affecting Rome and the Italian Administration, including Italian foreign policy. The relationshi p of the Mafia with the Vatican remained very closed during many years, not only af ter the war but also during the war itself. Indeed, the Mafia, on more than one occasion, acted as a fairy god-mother for the Vatican. The most striking case was when it helped the Vatican transfer tons of pure silver from Naples to Rome to avoid the Germans melting it down, to pay for e xpenses of the German occupation. The present author, who during the wa r had been broadcasting daily to the partisans, ad vising them to harass the Germans who were then in Italy, went to Naples in 1975 and visited the cathedral. There he was struck by an altar, seemingly made of what appeared to be pure solid silver. Upon asking whether that was so, he was told by the alta r's guardian that it was solid silver. The tons of silver, the man then explained, had been saved from the Germans then occupying Naples, thanks to the Mafia. To the present author's stupefaction, th e individual then told a tale. The Vatican, having heard rumours to the effect th at the Germans, then occupying Italy, had made plans to melt down the silver of the altar of St. Januarius to pay for their occupation of southern Italy, contacted the Mafia and asked for their cooperation. The Mafia, w hose members besides being keen businessmen are also immensely religious, accepted the Vatican's proposal with pious alacrity. Since they were cooperating with the Germans in sundry s ecret operations, they were permitted by the latter to transport their wares, food, black-market items and the like, to the North, that is to Rome. The result was that the silver of the altar was transported in Mafia lorries to the very entrance of the Vatican where it was safely deposited. The present author made inquiries as to the veracity of the story. (During the war he had made many broadcasts about the Germans having experimented w ith the \"liquification\" of the blood of the Saint"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"which, according to the Catholic Church is a \"mir acle.\" This is taken as such by the Neapolitan populace. The latter, take it as a good omen if the \"m iracle\" occurs; as a bad one if the \"blood\" does not become liquid.) He discovered that the Mafia, true to its reputation, had worked for all three employers, the Germans, the Vatican and the USA, simultaneously. A masterpiece of \"international cooperation.\" The recruitment of the Mafia would have been re prehensible on the part of both the USA and the Vatican, had it not been for the fact that both wished to he lp the flight of war criminals from Europe, each with its own objectives. Whereas the USA wanted to rescue them to carry out political operations against Soviet Russia and the oncoming Cold War, the Vatican, while thinking upon the same lines, had been motivated by an additional objective. Namely to help former polit ical and religious support ers whom it had blessed during, the reign of terror under the Nazi imperium. The Vatican protective attitudes had been prompted not only by seemingly Christian charity, but also by the c onsolidation of its newly born secret alliance with Washington. The basic motivation of such strange Vatican-USA fellowship, which at fi rst sight seemed to be a most improbable partnership, would have appeared incomprehensible, had not the motivation of both been taken into account. Their joint motivations were deri ved by the necessity of thei r part to recruit, as energetically and as quickly as possible, trustwort hy anti-Russian, anti-Communi st battalions ready to fight against Bolshevik Russia. And where could the Vatican and the State Department find such ready, dedicated, anti-Communist recrui ts, if not in the rank and file of the defeated anti-Communists of Europe, namely in the fleeing war criminals no w seeking asylum in the Americas and the USA? Had they and their comrades not attacked, occupied and almost defeated the Russian hordes, almost single handed, while America was se nding billions to help Stalin? Perhaps now the USA, who had come face to face with Sta lin, had realized at last her mistake. The fugitives from a defeated Europe were now ready to help the USA rec tify her error; that is help the US A fight Soviet Russia, her former ally. Thousands, not necessarily pro-Nazi, sympathized with such thoughts. Many in the USA openly said so. Churchill himself agreed. The general consen sus was that Stalin had become a menace no less horrendous than Hitler. The consensus was supporte d not by speculation, but by menacing facts. The reality facing the victorious Allies was that Stalin had swallowed up whole regions. Indeed, in addition to extinguishing former independent countries, like Estonia, Latvia and others, he had occupied one- third of Europe proper. He had turned prev ious sovereign nations, like Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Hungary, into Russian satellites. Moves were made by Moscow to do likewise in Asia, the Near East, Af rica, and even in the Western Hemisphere, as Cuba was eventually to prove, not long afterwards. The USA and the Vatican were alarmed and decided to act in unison. The results were the first secret moves which, within a very brief period, became known as the Cold War. That culminated with the Korean War of the fifties and the Vietnam War of the sixties and seve nties. The recruitment of proven anti-Communist individuals, from the fleeing war criminals, therefore became part and parcel of the USA Vatican grand postwar strategy. More than ch arity or compassion, or ev en ideological sympathy, it became a positive strategic campaign by both. They wished to recruit the right material for the oncoming anti-Soviet crusade of the near future. Th e battalions composed of the war criminals, still"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"rabidly anti-red and anti-Russian, would have become the spearhead of a new grand crusade against not Hitlerite Europe, but against a Stalinized Soviet Russia and the third of Europe now under the Soviet yoke of control.

"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Chapter 14 THE USA AND VATICAN SECRET CAMPAIGN TO RESCUE WAR CRIMINALS While Vatican City and its many extraterritorial bu ildings in Rome turned into the protective semi- official refuge for hundreds of war criminals, th e USA's State Department became busy integrating many of them within its multi-varied branched su bterranean machinery, operating outside official officialdom. The operations, although secretive, eventually became known. The immediate result was increasing opposition to them all. Because of this, thousands of fleeing war criminals were diverted hastily to South American countries, with the conniv ance of the secret services of the USA. Many were helped to enter the USA itself and to settle there, under different names and phony identities. The State Department and the Secret Services trie d to minimize the disclosures which meanwhile had begun to leak ever more frequently via the media to a shocked postwar world. To millions of war veterans and war victims of both continents, the whole policy of protection of war criminals became offensive. It was repudiated and condemned by a ll, with few exceptions. The spearhead of such universal condemnation were the Jews. The disclosu re of the Nazi concentration camps had shocked the world and, of course, world Judaism. The Eur opean Jews, many of whom had emigrated into the USA, were certainly not going to accept the ambiguous form of Am erican Catholic appeasement towards their former tormentors. The decades of th e Fascist nightmare were still too vivid to be forgotten, forgiven, or to be relegated to past history. The terrorized and wounded Jewish soul thirst ed for prompt merciless revenge. This became encapsulated into the atavistic slogan of \"an eye for an eye.\" The experien ce of the concentration camps, and many of their survivors, maximized the slogan into \"one thousa nd Arian-Christian-Nazi eyes for one Jewish eye.\" Their thirst for revenge, far from remaining encapsulated into a mere verbal blood curdling rhetorical Biblical quotation, became their solid menacing policy from the very beginning. It helped to shape the po licies of the postwar world, even before the Second World War had ended. This was done via the activities of the Je wish Lobby in Washington. A presence which no State Department, Secret Service, poli tical party, or even American Pr esident would ignore at their own peril. The emergence of Israel as the Messianic fulfillment of the Judaic dream, in addition to adding tangible religious dimension to World Judaism outs ide America, made the American Jews the most pervasive ethnic influence of America. This was so since American Judaism, like American Catholicism, having penetrated both political pa rties, could affect the policies of any USA administration. The Jewish campaign, conducted with hammering persistence via a national media, a large proportion of which was controlled by Jewish in terests, affected the policy of the USA. The operations directed at helping a nd recruiting war criminals were curtailed. Discretion became the watchword of both the State Department and the U.S. Secret Service. The more so, since the Jews set out to hunt war criminals, wherever and when ever they could, often with striking results, independently of them both. At the Vatican the campaign had been most unwel come, the more so since the Jews had openly condemned the Pope, not only for no t having helped them during the Hitlerite terror, but also for having been pro-Nazi. The Vatican, however, resented the Jewish campaign because of its long-range political implications. That is, it was imperiling the secret joint Vatican-USA preparation for an anti- Russian crusade, to be eventually identified with the Cold War. Becau se of this Jewish interference"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"with their plans, the Vatican a nd the State Department then form ulated a joint, most secretive promotional campaign of recruitment, whose watc hword became \"immense prudence.\" The new policy permitted their recruitment to operate, as in the past, with efficiency and with impunity, notwithstanding Jewish vigilance. The Vatican-USA new campaign soon became identifie d with the passing of a massive promulgation of equivocal legislation meant to d eal with all kinds of information connected with re cent and current recruitment and protection of war criminals. Legisl ative measures, thus once law, closed the door for good to any curious or mi schievous investigator. The result of such bolting of the door with legal na ils was that identif ication of war criminals, already in the USA or about to arrive th ere, became even more difficult. Even more significant, it became a protective legal umbrella under whic h potential and real war crimin als could take cover and avoid detection. The task of having them identified and arrested became almost an impossible one, protected as they were by obscure official specifications. Many of these never saw even the light. In fact, hundreds became so secret that none, with the excepti on of certain military or intelligence mandarins, could ever lay their hands on them. Most of such doc uments, that is those dealing with war criminals, were declared \"classified,\" that is, they were made inaccessible to anybody except the USA Intelligence. As the years and the decades went by, however, such \"classification\" became \"declassified.\" \"Declassification\" revealed what ha d been suspected all the time, name ly that the USA and the Vatican had helped and indeed had \"shipped\" thousands of war criminals to Australia, Latin America and indeed to the USA and Canada, even before the war had ended. \"Declassification,\" although helpful, nevertheless continued to be obstructed by ri gid legislation which permitted only a glimpse of light to be seen as the time limit expired. As it happened during a news conference, in May 1986, for instance when USA Army Counter-intelligence Corps documents were \"declassified\" and interpreted. [1] The spokesman, who had been tracing U.S. government involvement in helping Nazi war criminals for seven years, said that in vestigation of war criminals conducted by the USA after the War, \"had been a joke.\" As of May, 1986 there were probably 6,500 of an es timated 10,000 Nazi collabo rators who had been assisted by the pro-war criminals orga nization, still living in the U.S. According to The Times of London. \"The U.S. had classified th e documents until now in order to protect allied governments and th e Vatican from the embarrassing revelations in them\", it said. \"They showed that the intelligence agencies of Fr ance and Britain, immediately after the war, revived a former Nazi organization, called Intermarium, he said. The organization was formed originally by a Russian tsarist general shortly after the Bols hevik Revolution in order to fight communism. \"The intelligence agencies of Fran ce, Britain, Australia, Canada, Austri a, West Germany, and Italy, as well as high Vatican officials, had then become i nvolved in recruiting former Nazi war criminals for the organization. They rearmed and funded them while helping them to emigrate, Mr. Loftus said."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"\"The central governments of these countries apparently di d not know about their intelligence agencies' activities. \"The U.S. Army Counter-intelligence Corps found out about the allied involvement in 1947, and the U.S. decided to get involved itself and to keep the entire operation secret.\" [2] Intermarium was only one of the many organizations meant to help war criminals. The U.S. Intelligence had at least a dozen, several of which are still in operational use. Many of them are disguised under equivocal names. The Vatican, how ever, was the senior partner since it had the multiplicity of such agencies. This was so because it had the advantage of th e Catholic Church, which permitted the Vatican to apparel its organizations unde r the disguise of religion. The result was that it became practically impossible to trac k down their identity or nature of operations, whether they had been classified, or declassified. The efforts woul d have stirred up a hornet's nest in the American Catholic World. A hornet's nest, which even the Amer ican Jews had considered prudent not to disturb.

The top Nazis, who had fallen into the hands of the Allies, were brought before the Nuremberg Tribunal. Most of them were hange d. Several escaped. One of these was Franz Von Papen, an official war criminal. Pius XII pleaded for him behind th e scene and Von Papen not only avoided death but after a few years was released. Von Papen was the l eader of the Catholic Party of Germany. At one time he had been Chancellor. He had helped Hitler into power, to such an extent that after Hitler became head of Germany, he made Von Papen his Vi ce-Chancellor. Von Papen was one of the most prominent war criminals saved by the Vatican. The Catholic hierarchies of many countries did the same with minor officials. Therefore, when the Catholic leader s of the Catholic State of Croatia fled the country, they looked to the Vatican as a refuge. Many of th em were helped in their escape by the local clergy or by ordinary Catholics. As we have already seen, Ante Pavelic, after many difficulties, managed to reach Rome where he absconded wearing the hab it of a monk. When he was given a false passport and identity he sailed for South America, where he became active with the open support of the church. Minor war criminals from Croatia were received with a special co rdiality, since they had one clear distinction that most other war criminals had not. The Croat refugees had supported a regime which had been inspired and blessed by the Pope. A Catholic Croatian State which, had Hitler won the war, would have become the model Catholic State of the Balkan regions. One of the principal Catholic personalities to help Hitler into power was Franz Von Papen, leader of the Catholic Party of Germany, frie nd of E. Pacelli, the Papal Nuncio to Munich, later Pope Pius XII. When Chancellor of Germany, Von Papen tried to set up a Catholic-Nazi Coalition. It was he who persuaded Von Hindenburg to ask Hitler to form a Government."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Once Hitler became first Chance llor of Nazi Germany, he made Von Papen his Vice- Chancellor (January 1933). Thus, the Leader of the German Catholic Party was second in command only to Hitler in Hitlerite Germany. Von Papen and Pacelli eventually negotiated for a Concordat in which Hitler pledged to s upport the Catholic Church, and the Catholic Church to support Hitler (June 1933). The Croat refugees were given a privileged welcom e by the Catholic authorit ies all over Rome. They were given facilities which few had had. When the monasteries and seminaries could no longer contain them, they were permitted to enter and hide in se veral convents inhabited excl usively by nuns. At first, the sudden increase in the number of the inmates surprised not a few people. Then, of course, it was realized that the truth was not wh at it appeared to be. Innocent obser vers had noticed that several so- called \"nuns\" were of rough appearance, masculine demeanor and appeared to be unshaven. Then, following a period which varied from weeks to m onths, the nunish populations decreased with the suddeness with which they had originally increase d. The false documents enabled them to travel outside Italy, at which time they sailed to vari ous countries including Aust ralia. The success and speed of their evacuation, and lack of detection by cer tain authorities who should have known better, indicated the efficiency of the Va tican campaign. It must not be for gotten that many officials of the victorious government were devout Catholics. These, in cooperation with the sundry national hierarchies, worked together to ensure the sa fety of the fleeing Catholic Croat \"refugees.\" By the time the Allies began to search for them, they had been dispersed out of their reach. If many of them were still hidden somewhere in Europe, it was a certainty that they were absconded in Catholic institutions in various disguises and under the patrona ge of Catholic lay or re ligious authorities. The genocide in Croatia, although of immense horror, how ever, did not get the publicity which it should have. Its reality, while appreciated by the world at large, was soon minimized. Except for those who had been personally or collectively affected by it, it was almost forgotten by the postwar world. The cause for such oblivion was due to various factor s. First among these was the general background of the postwar world which wished to forget the atrociti es of the conflict. But more than that, the oblivion of the Croatian massacre was caused by the two most powerful lobbies in existence. That of the Jews and that of the Vatican.

This they did in order to set up an independent Catholic State of Croatia once Yugoslav unify had disintegrate d. As a reward for their treachery, Hitler granted the Catholic Croats au tonomy under Nazi tutelage.

But just as anti-Semitic forces denied the figure of the Jewish victims of the Nazi concentration camps, to exculpate Nazi Germany, so did the Vatican follow the same tactic, to exculpate the Catholic Croats and th eir supporter, the Catholic Church. Many allies played into the Vatican's hand by helping the minimization of the Croatian atrocities. The most guilty were the American Catholic officers a nd officials, not to mention the State Department, already working with Pope Pius XII, in preparation for the oncoming Cold War. The process of \"minimization\" of the Croatian atro cities, curiously enough, ha d started long before the end of the war. Indeed, soon after the atrocities were reported to the Allies. The present author, sad to relate, had been one of the earliest culprits. While broadcasting to the partisans of occupied Europe from a secret station in England, he came acro ss a man who had escaped from occupied Europe specifically to report what was happen ing in Yugoslavia, or rather in that part of Yugoslavia which had not been occupied by Hitler, namely in Croatia.

THE AMBASSADOR AND THE CARDINAL—THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY'S FIT OF TEMPER The antecedents of Dr. Sekulich were somewhat su spicious, to say the least. He had many photos, some of which were later proved to have been au thentic, of Croatian atrocities. This was at the beginning of the war in 1942. The horrors of the con centration camps had not been as yet revealed. In fact, it was not generally believed that they existe d at all; or if they di d, they had been only the inconveniences of detention. The Croatian photos, therefore, were seen as a crude propaganda device and acc epted by most as such. When, after months of doubts, the present author finally suggested to Mr. Hulton of the Hulton Press, a Fleet Street magnate, to have an ar ticle about it all in his magazine World Review , Mr. Hulton refused, on the grounds that it was all enemy propaganda. It is interesting to note that Mr. Hulton was a Catholic. Catholics, he had implied, could not do such things. One of his secretaries, a Russian princess, however, insisted that they were genuine. She was a member of the Orthodox Church and cared for the fate of Orthodox believers. During her campaign Hulton fell for the princess, and married her. Dr. Sekulic h meanwhile had been lobbying the many allied governments, then resident in London, with so me success. When additional proof was given, by additional material brought to L ondon by people who had escaped from Yugoslavia, finally the present author accepted the evidence as authentic, as did many others, includi ng Mr. Hulton himself. Soon after the war, the present author had made friends with the repres entative of the Pope in England, Mgr. Godfrey, the Papal Legate. He had met hi m casually while walking in Wimbledon Commons where they both went regularly for afternoon strolls . Mgr. Godfrey had discussed with the present author the book which he was then writing, The Vatican in World Politics. Mgr. Godfrey was most interested in the book and, having a very open mind, even suggested amendments. From left to right: Terzic S. Budislav, th e Rev. V. Maluckov, and the author. Mr. Terzic Budislav fought the Germans, the Communist s and the Ustashi from 1941 to 1945. He was the eyewitness of horrifyi ng atrocities by the latter. In June 1941 the Catholic Ustashi arrived at the small Orthodox vill ages of Stikada and Guduru, in the district of Gracac. They ordered all the villagers to assemble inside the tiny church of St. Peter, where a Catholic padre would come to baptize them. Once the villagers were inside, the Ustashi closed the door and then tossed petr ol bombs through the windows."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"The whole congregation, i.e. the entire Orthodox population of the two villages, six hundred men, women and children, were burned alive.

The total of his relatives thus massacred, thirty-two. In the town of Gracac the Ustashi butchered their Orthodox victims in the local butchers shop. This was discovered by th e local authorities owing to the rivulets of human blood flowing into the gutter. When, however, the Croatian massacres were menti oned, he flatly refused to believe they had occurred. Mgr. Godfrey was basically a very hon est and devout man. But he was the official representative of the Vatican. Eventually he was made an Archbishop and later became the Cardinal Primate of all England. Whether Mgr. Godfrey put the reputa tion of the Vatican before his conscience, or whether he could not accept that his church had connived with the Croatia n massacre, was never clear. His, however, had been a reaction which the present author was to meet again and again with Catholics and others. With that in view, he went to meetings to enc ounter many of those who had escaped death in Croatia. Some were badly mutilated, deformed, or had hor rific burns all over thei r bodies.A young man, about 17, had escaped being burnt alive simply because, upon seeing a group of Ustashi coming surreptitiously into his village, he had hidden hims elf in a nearby ditch. He witnessed a horrific deed. The Ustashi rounded up all his family, shut all the memb ers in a barn full of hay, and then set it alight. Everybody in it was burnt alive. These were some of the many tales related viva- voce by many of the survi vors. Eventually a book concerning the Croatian horrors was compiled by th e present author. The British Press ignored it. Catholic pressure worked against any acceptance of the work. Many book shops, including Protestant ones, refused to sell the book. Fear of offending the Ca tholic interest had already become that great. The Yugoslav government finally decided to br eak such a widespread boycott. They bought 2000 copies of the book and gave a copy free to almost every member of the House of Lords, to every member of the House of Commons, and to member s of the British government. The book was called Terror Over Yugoslavia . Lord Alexander of Hillborough, leader of the opposition in the House of Lords, was horrified.

Notwithstanding, or rather because of the British boyc ott, the present author and the Leader of the Protestants of Northern Ireland, th e Rev.

They identified themselves with the Orthodox Se rbs who had been exterminated by the Catholic Croats. Because the civil war which was to engul f Northern Ireland had just started, the Irish Republican Army, better known as the IRA, had just started a reign of terr or, with bombings and killings, on a scale unprecedented for years.

Because of it, the present author had been welcomed to the Embassy during various national celebrations and during the reception of famous political personalities. It was during one of these receptions that the pr esent author came face to face with an unexpected surprise. After having been introduced to the new Yugoslavian Ambassador and having discussed with him the need of a new Serbian edit ion of the book, the Ambassador replied in a somewhat icy tone that such an edition was no longer necessary. Not only the Serbian edition, he added, but even less an English edition.

Seper, as already mentioned, had been nominated Archbishop of Za greb, as a successor of Archbishop Stepinac who also had been the personal friend and associate of Ante Pavelic, and of Artuckovic, the Interior Minister of the Cathol ic State of Croatia. Mgr. Seper, who personally was a very honest and capable man, proved to be an even more subtle negotiator. He convinced the rabid anti-Vatican Communist Tito that a reconciliation w ith the Vatican would have given Communist Yugoslavia the much-n eeded support of the USA. The U.S.'s financial help, not to say diplomatic prot ection, had become a must since Soviet Russia had sinister designs upon a Yugoslavia that had detached herself from the block of Easter n Europe which had been reduced to the state of Russian satellites. The argument seen in political terms had been a va lid one and, therefore, an acceptable one. Tito decided to accept the Vatican's o ffer.

Yugoslavia wished to forget the holocaust and did not wish to be reminded about it, but above all did not wish to annoy the Va tican with even the memory of it.

An Embassy official thereupon hastened to introduce th e present author to the personage. The personage was none other than the new Papal Nuncio to Great Britain, that is the Pope 's Ambassador. His name was Monsignor Cardinale. A pleasant individual who, while shaking hands, gave an enigmatic smile that indicated a silent victory.

Th e Sacred Congregation which he led was none other than the former Holy Office which, in the past, had been responsible for the Holy Inquisition. The appointment, it must be remembered, t ook place in 1968, several years after the Second Vatican Council which had promoted Ecumenis m and Unity, and during the Pontificate of Pope Paul VI. Why had Mgr. F. Seper's appointment had such great significance for Catholics and Protestants alike? Because Cardinal F. Seper was none other than the Archbishop of Zagreb, the capital of the former Ustashi Croatia. He was the man w ho had succeeded the Archbishop, later Cardinal Stepinac, the friend and associate of Ante Paveli c. Yes, the successor of that same Stepinac who from the same Episcopal See had inspired mass forcible conversions, mass deportations of Orthodox priests and laymen, and who had bl essed the Ustashi murderers of more than half a million people. Soon afterwards the Vatican made an official reconc iliation with Marshal Tit o. Catholic officials and clergy were released and a policy of reconciliation was initiated which, as hinted earlier, culminated with Mgr.

But hundreds of thous ands of Serbs, who had lost more than 675,000 relatives and friends were not.

The arrest and the imprisonment of Archbishop Stepinac and other high Catholic clergy who had participated in the reign of terror of the Catholic State, became the main obstacle. With the passing of time, however, the independence of Tito, from Soviet Russia, which was encouraged by the USA, yielded results. The USA \"pressured\" the Red Dictator to \"conciliation\" with the Vatican. One of the preliminaries of such a step was \"to forget the Croatian experience.\" When such a policy was accepted, a new Ambassador was appointed in London, at the same time that a \"special\" clever Vatican Diplomat became one of the Em bassy's \"principal guests.\" The same evening the author was told by the Ambassador to stop writing about Croatia.

Since the dealings had been leaked, and thus had aroused the suspicion of the Ustashis, he and hi s associates had decided to hold their meeting in Israel. They chose Israel as the best guarded and secure country where terrorists had minimum chances to carry out their activities. He was mistaken. Having gone on a secr et rendezvous in Jerusalem, after only a couple of meetings he found the chief negotia tor murdered next door to his own. A shock not only to Dr. Sekulich but also th e the Security authorities. The present author, although neve r experiencing such a dramatic sample of Ustashi activities, nevertheless had a taste of it; approp riately in Chicago, of all cities. In 1978, he had flown from Los Angeles to Chicago to attend a convention organized by the Serbs of the USA. He had been invited there to deliver a speech and to promote a book which had just been published in the USA, entitled The Vatican Moscow Alliance . As soon as he arrived in Chicago he was ushered into a hall where there wa s a meeting taking place and a spea ker was there delivering a speech. When some people in the crowd re cognized the present auth or, he was asked to climb the rostrum and say a few words. This was done. Soon afterwards, howev er, not a few of those present came to give a warning. \"Please do not accept such invitations unless planned beforehand,\" he was told. The warning had been motivated by the fact that, a few months before, a writer who had delivered a speech from that same rostrum had been shot to death while speaking. A niece of his in the audience, who had gone up to the platform to help him, also had been shot. \"Don't accept impromptu invitations unless checked by the committee,\" he was warned. Two days later there took place a large meeting ju st on the outskirts of Chicago. The meeting was postponed for almost an hour because of the absence of the main organizer. The latter finally arrived in a taxi. He explained the cause of his delay; a bomb had been found under his Cadillac and had to be defused by the police. From the very beginning a tough individual started to shadow the present write r, walking wherever he went, shoulder to shoulder. The indi vidual became so noxious that fina lly he was asked to leave. He refused. When asked if he was a cameramen or a te levision technician, he re fused to answer. Finally, when pressed by a functionary of the conventi on, he opened a bulky leather case hanging from his shoulder, and there appeared a large German revolver. He made the revo lver rotate to show the bullets"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"seemingly coated with brass. He then explained deci sively that he was appointed the present writer's bodyguard for the remainder of the convention. There was a luncheon during which other tough in dividuals hovered upon the guests like menacing angels of silent surveillance, after the luncheon speeches began. These were delivered from a large empty stage, upon which there was a single rostru m and a microphone. The stage was darkened and the speaker was lit by a single light beam, addre ssing the large audience in semi-darkness. Various speakers participated. Amongst these, va rious Orthodox and Serbian Bishops. The speaker preceding the present writer was one Adams, who ha d just written a large book about the life of the Serbs' hero, General Mirkovich. Mr. Adams was a secu rity official of the Senate House in Washington. To the present writer's opinion he said certain things which had been totally in accurate; certain events which he mentioned had been distorted. The present wr iter had been implicated during the war, since he had been dealing with the par tisans in occupied Europe, amongst th ese the partisans of Yugoslavia. Certain Catholic clergy had played a noxious role which had resulted in the arrest and execution of many individuals. That meant, of co urse, on the part of the Ustashis. When the present author finally reached the rostrum, he thanked Mr. Adams for the information but said that he had been inaccurate, or at least he had minimized certain facts, including the cooperation of the Catholic clergy with the Ustashi and cognate events. After having pointed out that and other events, however, the present author told the audience, which was composed of Serbs, most of whom had fled to the USA because they had been terrorized by the Ustashi, that while they should ne ver forget the Croatian Holocaust, they should forgive. And indeed, they should look to the future as citizens of the USA, a country which had welcomed them and given them security and peace. The audience rose and gave the present author a standing ovation. The perf ormance had been even more impressive because amongst the audience were four members of the House of Representatives and a couple of Senators who had come expressl y from Washington to attend the convention. No doubt, to nurse the Serbian vote of the USA. Afterwards, while surrounde d by a large circle of people expressing their appreciation of the speech, many pointed out that the author's advocacy of the right of Catholic Croatia to exist as an et hnic, religious and cultu ral identity was a ris ky thing to say to the Serbs. (The author, in fact, had repeated that several times, saying that both Serbia and Croatia could exist notwithstanding their differe nt religious credos and coul d cooperate in building a new Yugoslavia.) An individual who had been standi ng alone in the distance suddenly opened a passage through the crowd, came straight to the author and shook him by the hand with such strength that the present author had to bend his ha nd to avoid a painful stricture. The man, a tough guy looking like a professional boxer, was brief, abrupt and to the point. \"It is people like you that we need in this country,\" he said. \"Gr eat pity that you are not an American, great pity.\" With that, the man departed. The crowd seemed impr essed. Then they disclosed the identity of the speaker. He was one of the leaders of the Senate. But if his comments had been gratifying, the next encounter, half an hour later, was not. After the crowd had dispersed and many had bought a copy of the book, signed by the author, the pr esent writer was having a drink standing at the bar, when he noticed a man wearing a hat whose brim hid his eyes. He had been observing, pretending to drink. After a while, when the present author was al one, he approached him with an almost feline smoothness. After a few seconds he wh ispered a few words as he looked at the other side of the bar. \"I"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"came to the convention to kill you. Lucky that you said what you did.\" The individual had whispered these words with such a matter-of-fact and unemoti onal tone of voice that it had sounded unreal. He kept a hand, the right hand, under his jacket and had looked significantly at the bulk under it. Then, as people were coming towards us, he asked the pres ent author for a copy of the book, complete with autograph, which he bought. Thereupon having gi ven a courteous greeting, he departed. The bodyguard, who had absented himself, when told of the incident, froze. \"He is one of the most ruthless Usthasi killers,\" he commented. I kept him under surveillance all the ti me. The present author returned to Los Angeles having experienced a matte r-of-fact encounter, a pers onal Ustashi reality.[1] Footnote 1.

"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Chapter 19 FORTY YEARS AFTER—CRIME AND PUNISHMENT The Vatican, and with it the Cathol ic Church, after the disappearance of the Catholic State of Croatia, never claimed any responsibility, not even a partial one, for the atrocities committed there. Indeed, when accused, they disclaimed any connection with the whole Croatian \"experiment.\" When asked to express their abhorrence for the deeds committed by the Ustashis of Catholic Croatia, they both kept their silence. Sile nce means approval. That is why, since the downfall of Independent Croatia, the Catholic Church has co nstantly helped the scattered remnants of the Ustashi at home and abroad. Not only during the pontificate of Pius X II, but equally during those of \"good Pope John XXIII\" and Pope Paul VI. Catholic laymen, Catholic priests and Catholic monks continued to back the Ustashi as actively as ever. Underground organizations were formed in ma ny parts of the world. Ustashi secret headquarters were set up, e.g. in Madrid, Spain, where incidental ly A. Pavelic had installed himself following his attempted assassination in the Argent ine. Indeed, while Pius XII was st ill alive, another no less active centre sprang up in Rome itself. Simultaneous to all this, Catholic clergy within Croa tia exerted themselves as relentlessly as their companions abroad. As typified by a group of nine of them arrested in Os jek, Northern Croatia, and tried in March 1960. While two of th em were theological students the other seven were Catholic padres led by Father Ciril Koss and Father Ivan Kopic. In 1964, the Brotherhood of the Cross, a Cathol ic Croatian organization in West Germany, was dissolved on the orders of the German Government, after a bomb attack in that country. Its leader? Father Madic Skoko, a Catholic priest. Following a three months long trial the Germans condemned him to four years hard labour. In 1965, the Ustashi became so blatantly active in Au stralia, where they terrorized fellow Catholics into supporting their activities that the Australian Government had to take drastic measures against them. Similar cases occurred in other countries, e. g. in the USA where bombs were made to explode simultaneously in sundry localities in 1967. These were not the sporadic exertions of despera dos. But the coordinated activities of the Ustashi waiting for \"The Day.\" One of their headquarters, which after the Sec ond World War had been set up in Rome in 1960, was transferred to the Croatian capital itself, Zagreb. This, it must be re membered, during the pontificate of Pope John XXIII (1958-1963), the father of Ecumenism. The Ustashi correspondence, documents and instru ctions, significantly enough, were found hidden inside the walls of the Franciscan monastery of that city. The Ustashi l eader? A Franciscan monk, Father Rudi Jerak, who had been recruiting member s while giving them religious instruction. Father Jerak was arrested, with fourteen other Catholics who were running te rroristic organizations \"with the aim of creating a separate State of Croatia\" [1] "},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"In 1966, the new socialist, Pope Paul VI (1963-1978), as we have alr eady seen, promoted Mgr. Seper, Cardinal. Seper became Head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. His department became responsible for guarding against \"theological errors.\" Cardinal Seper, it must be remembered, was th e successor of Archbishop Stepinac of Zagreb. The silent but effective protection of the Vatican for the scattered Ustashi continued uninterrupted from the downfall of Ustashi Croatia. Polish Po pe, John Paul II, globe trotting the world with clamorous demands for \"respect and observance of human rights.\" like his papal predecessors, never mentioned or condemned the Ustashi atrocities. The thousands of Ustashi who fled to various countr ies, helped by the Vatican itself, once settled in their host lands were protected, ip so facto, by the local Ca tholic clergy. The loca l clergy and their lay associates, that is Catholic laymen, then set out to see that the Ustashi were protected, not only by absconding themselves within the local population but, above all, und er an umbrella of legalized protection. This was made possible by the passi ng of legislation which could impede the arrest or the extradition of what was termed \"war criminals\" wanted eith er by Yugoslavia, or by the Allied war tribunals.The legislation was inspired and often successfully carried out by Catholic bodies and associated Catholic politicians on a regional and even national level. The campaign was pa rticularly effective in Australia, Canada and the USA. The Catholic Church, having provided a legisl ative umbrella, then helped the \"Ustashi refugees\" financially, w ith jobs and with a pr udent integration into their new community. Many managed to be integrated and vanished. New identities or legalized camouflages helped with their absorption into the community. During the firs t few years their integra tion went smoothly. Then, however, as their true identity became known steps were taken, either by the authorities in Europe or those in the countries of their adoptio n, to bring them to justice; even to extradite them to the localities of their crimes. Several were arrested and suffered expulsion, some appeared before tribunals. Most of them, however, protected as they were by the Catholic Church, managed to escape the lega l net. This was done not only by minor former Ustashis, but equally by major ones. The most notorious case was that of Andrija Artukovic, Croatian Mini ster of the Interior and later Minister of Justice. In the Croatian Cabinet, he was the spokesman for Archbishop Stepinac. Artukovic was born in Croatia and was educated in Franci scan schools. He studied law at th e University of Zagreb, where he became a fanatical advocate of the Catholicity and independence of a self-governing Catholic Croatia. After the Croatian Government collapsed, when Tito partisans joined the S oviet armies, Artukovic, like thousands of other Ustashi, fl ed the country, helped by Catholic clergy. They lived in adjacent countries, mostly in Switzerland, Austria, and also in Catholic Ireland. Many reached the shore of the USA. Artukovic went to the USA in July 1948, under a visitor's visa issued to him in the name of Aloys Anich. The visa and other documents were obtained via the"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Catholic organizations at the Vatican and in th e USA. The Knights of Columbus helped, since Artukovic became a Knight of Columbus. In 1949, Artukovic applied for residence status u nder the Displaced Person Act. In March 1951, however, the Yugoslav Government made a formal dema nd that Artukovic be returned for prosecution \"as a war criminal.\" Immediately, the whole of the Ca tholic machinery in the USA was set in motion to protect Artukovic. How did Artukovic manage to flee Cat holic Croatia after its collapse? Artukovic like Pavelic took refuge in Italy, hiding in various monaster ies and residing even in Rome. Under the direct protection of the Vatican, he was s upplied with false documents and went to Catholic Ireland where the vigilant Catholic hierarchs looked after him. Th ey provided him with other false documents which allowed him into the USA where Catholic Irish officials saw to it that he was welcomed, settled and protected. The Catholic protective umbrella, however, did not prevent his identity from becoming known. The result was that proceedings were taken, with the view of his arre st by the USA as a war criminal. The Catholic authorities, however, with the aid of lay Catholic legal orga nizations, managed to pass certain legislative measures on a local and national level, as already indi cated, which protected him from arrest. When steps were taken for his extr adition, these also were nullified, by legal, semi-legal and equivocal or conflicting legal quib bles, which rendered him practically immune. The protection of the Catholic Church of America s eemed impregnable. This was demonstrated by the fact that it took the USA and Y ugoslavia decades to have Artukovic extradited from the USA. Artukovic lived peacefully for over 40 years in the U.S. and was finally extradited from there in February 1986 after a legal battle which lasted well over 30 long y ears. A sombre spectacle of the tremendous power of the Catholic Church in America. Brought before a court in Zagreb, frail and haggard, th e former Interior Minist er, known as the Balkans Butcher, was pronounced guilty of war crimes and sentenced to death. Throughout the four weeks trial he pled his innocence. Artukovic was convicted of four specific crimes, including the murder of civilians and prisoners of war. The authorities, and above all the Catholic pr ess world wide, beginning with the USA media, emphasized that he was convicted of \"the mass murder of Jews, Gypsies, and others.\" Some specified \"and of Serbs.\" The distortion of the specific racial-sectarian motive, which had motivated the Catholic lay and clerical authorities for conniving with the Ustashi ma ssacre of almost 700,000 Orthodox Serbs, would be incredible had it not happened."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"The American mass media never mentioned the reli gious motivation, plus the racial one, which had inspired the Croatian massacre. The Catholic Church was never blamed, or even mentioned as having had any part in the Croatian affair. Not a word of condemnation, criticism or even impartial reminder of her responsibility. The State Department saw to it that it should be so. Since, by then, the USA and the Vatican had exchanged ambassadors, and the Papal Ambassador in Washington had seen to it that the Catholic mass media of the USA be br iefed about what to say. The emphasis of the media was that Artukovic had been sentenced to death because of the mass murder of Jews and Gypsies and, as if by chance, al so of Serbs. The fact that the mass murder had been of Serbs and of Orthodox Serbs, was never ev en given a hint. This exculpated the Catholic Church. Indeed, to millions, the Vatican and th e Church had nothing to do with the massacre whatsoever! To render the sentence more convinc ing, and to make it appear as ha ving nothing to do with Catholic religious persecution, the court of Zagreb, which had previously disc ussed the whole trial with the USA and the Vatican authorities, then accused Art ukovic of ordering \"a mass acre of civilians in 1942, the murder of 450 civilian deportees on the road to a concentration camp, the murder of a prominent lawyer in 1941, and the killi ng of captured Yugoslav part isans in 1943\" (Reuter reports) [2] Not a word or even a hint of the re ligious nature of the massacre, or of the fact that Catholic padres and monks had been in charge of concentration camps where hundreds of thousands had been tortured and murdered, or had been forced to accept Catholic bap tism to save themselves from torture or execution.

In fact, in many articles dealing with the four weeks court trials, the Catholic Church was hardly mentioned. The particular sectarian charac ter, and anti-Orthodox nature of the Croatian massacres, were never indicated, with rare exceptions, by either the British or the American media.

A taboo word. Most of the Protestants have contributed, with the Vatican, to make the world forget th e atrocities of Catholic Croatia. In short, Artukovic had been a minor war criminal who had executed a few hundred civilians simply for military or political motiva tion. Religion had been totally om itted. Indeed, had not even been mentioned. A proof if there needed to be one of th e tacit concordance reached between the Vatican, the USA and the communist authorities of Y ugoslavia long before the trial itself. But the mendacity of the nature of the trial became even more glaring, by the fact concerning the omission of the proportionally immense massacre of the Orthodox Serbs during the Croatian Regime. During the trial not only was the Catholic Church ne ver mentioned; there had been not even a single hint concerning the horrendous real ity that, hidden behind that gene ral over-simplification—namely that those who had been murdered had been mainly Jews and Gypsies, adding as an additional item \"and Serbs\" to the other no less hor rendous reality that \"and Serbs\" m eant ninety-nine percent of the total victims, most of th em belonging to the Orthodox Church. Al so the fact that the Serbs had been made to perish because they belonged to a Church, which the Catholic State of Croatia had considered inimical to the Catholic Church, and to the plan of the Vatican, which had connived the birth of the Croatian State itself. During the Zagreb trial of Artukovic, the world press never dared to me ntion these facts. The collective silence of the European and American media would be incredible, had it not been a sad reality that most of it had been silenced by fear of the reaction of the Catholic Church of the USA, whose silent pressure had been felt in the editorial offices of newspaper and TV stations. The trial which was concluded in May 1986 thus seemed to have closed a chapter of history, one of planned genocide and, perhaps even worse, of religi ous persecution carried out with the connivance of the Vatican, which had protected those who had acted as the instruments of the horrendous Croatian experience. [3] The Vatican had not only been exculpated from its pa rticipation in the whole affair, it was not even mentioned. Indeed, the Catholic Church, whose exerti ons had loomed so prominently in the Catholic concentration camps, was made to look like a helpless w itness: indirectly some organs of the American media had gone so far as to hint that it had helped the vic tims of Croat Nazism. The Protestants of the USA, with few exceptions, act ed likewise. Their cowardice, plus the Catholic operational energy, and the collaboration of the Ameri can media, had all contri buted to the distortion of the historical truth.

Indeed, it had been considered a blessing by Artukovic, Ante Pavelic, all thei r Ustashi battalions, by Archbishop Stepinac, by Cardinal Mindzenty, and by certain experts. It had been expected with no less eager ness in certain quarters of the USA, and by the highest aut hority at the Vatican, the Pope himself. Pope Pius XII, diplomatic and political arch-intri guer, was a firm believer in its inevitability. More than that, he conditioned millions of Catholics to accept it as such. Indeed, to welcome it as an instrument for the propagation of the power of the Catholic Church. He justified it on the assumption th at the Virgin Mary was his all y. Since in 1917, the year of the Russian Revolution, she had appeared to three illite rate children in Fatima, a desolate locality in Portugal. Her apparition had been accompanied by a somewhat strange miracle : The sun became pale, three times it turned speedily on itself, like a Catherine wheel... At the end of these convulsive revolutions it seemed to jump out of its orbit and co me forward towards the people on a zig-zag course, stopped, and retu rned again to its normal position. This was seen by a large crowd near th e children and \"lasted twelve minutes.\" [1] The Fatima Cult derived from the alleged appear ance of the Virgin Mary to three sickly children at Fatima, Portugal, in 1917. Following the appearance of Bolshevik Russi a and World Communism between the First and Second World Wars, the Cult was soon tran sformed into an ideological crusade. The Virgin's prophecy that Bolshevik Russia, unless annihilated, would bring destruction to all nations became a powerful religious and ideological weapon in the armory of the Catholic Church and her political allies; this particularly during the rise of Hitler, who"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"preached exactly the same doctrine. The Fatima Cult, with its anti-Russian message , was magnified by Pope Pius XII, who gave it a new impetus when Russia was attacked by Hitler in 1941. After the War, Pius XII used it in his conduc t of the Cold War. Monster pilgrimages, totaling one million people each, were organized to the Fatima Shrine. The Pope used to send his own Papal Legate to give official sa nction to the political message of the Virgin Mary. The fact that the other two thousa nd million human beings in the worl d never noticed the sun agitate, rotate and jump out of its orbit did not bother the Catholic Church in the least. On the contrary, the Catholic masses were told to believe that the sun, on the appearance of the Virgin Mary, had truly moved on \"a zig-zag course\" as proof of the authen ticity of her presence. And, of course, of \"her messages.\" The Virgin's messages had been to induce the Pope to bring about \"the cons ecration of the World to her immaculate heart,\" to be followed by \"the consecr ation of Russia.\" \"Russia will be converted,\" she foretold. \"The Holy Father will consecrate Russia to me.\" But, she warned, should this not be accomplished \"her (Russia's) errors will spread th roughout the world, causing wars and persecutions... different nations will be destroye d...\" In the end, however, the Virgin promised, by way of consolation, that the Catholic Church would tr iumph, after which \"the Holy Fath er will consecrate Russia to me.\" Thereupon \"she (Russia) shall be converted and a period of peace will be granted to the world.\" These quotations are from the authenticated messages of the Virgin Mary herself, as related to one of the children and fully accepted by the Catholic C hurch as a genuine revelation by the Mother of God. [2] Within a few years the Cult of Fatima had grow n to great proportions. The number of pilgrims multiplied from sixty on June 13, 1917 to sixty thousand in October of that same year. From 144,000 in 1923 to 588,000 in 1928. The total for six years: two million. [3] The Vatican took the promises seriously. Mgr. Pacel li, the future Pope Pius XII, then the grey eminence behind Pope Pius XI, sponsored a policy s upporting Fascism in Italy and then the Nazis in Germany, to help the prophecy come true. To such an extent that he was the chief instrument in helping Hitler to get into power. This he did by urging the German Catholic Party to vo te for Hitler at the last German general election in 1933. [4] The basic idea was a simple one. Fascism and Nazi sm, besides smashing the Communists in Europe, ultimately would smash Communist Russia. In 1929 P ope Pius XI signed a Concordat and the Lateran Treaty with Mussolini and called him \"the man sent by Providence.\" In 1933 Hitler became Chancellor of Germany. In 1936 Franco started the Civil War. By 1938 two-thirds of Europe had been Fascistized and the rumblings of the Second World War were heard more and more ominously everywhere. Concurrently, however, Europe had also been Fa timaized. The Cult of Fatima, with emphasis on the Virgin's promise of Russia's conversion, havi ng been given immense prominence by the Vatican."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"In 1938 a Papal Nuncio was sent to Fatima, and almost half a million pilgrims were told that the Virgin had confided three great secrets to the children. Thereupon, in June of that year, the only surviving child—advised by her confessor, always in touch with the Hierarchy and hence with the Vatican— revealed the contents of two of the three great secrets. The first was the vision of Hell. (Som ething well known to the modern world.) The second was more to the point: a reiteration that Soviet Russia woul d be converted to the Catholic Church. The third was given, sealed in an envelope, and put in the custody of the ecclesia stical authority, not to be revealed until 1960. The dramatic reiteration of the revelation of the second secret about Soviet Russia immediately assumed a tremendous religious and political signif icance. The timing of the \"disclosure\" could not have been better chosen. The Fascist Dictatorships we re talking the same langua ge: the annihilation of Soviet Russia. The following year, 1939, the Second World War br oke out. In 1940 France was defeated. The whole of Europe had become Fascist. In 1941 Hitler invaded Russia. The Virgin's prophecy at long last was about to be fulfilled. At the Vatican there was re joicing. Since by now Pacelli had become Pope under the name of Pius XII (1939). Pius XII encouraged Catholics to volunteer for the Russian front. Cat holics—most of them devotees of the Virgin of Fatima—joined the Nazi armies fr om Italy, France, Ireland, Belgium, Holland, Latin America, the USA and Portugal. Spai n sent a Catholic Blue Division. In October 1941, while the Nazi armies rolled near Moscow, Pius XII, ad dressing Portugal, urged Catholics to pray for a speedy realizat ion of the Lady of Fatima's promise. The following year, 1942, after Hitler had declared that Communist Russia had been \"definitely\" defeated, Pius XII, in a Jubilee Message, fulfilled th e first of the Virgin's injunctions and \"consecrated the whole World to her Immaculate Heart.\"\"The apparitions of Fatima open a new era,\" wrote Cardinal Cerejeira in that same year. \"It is the foresha dowing of what the Immaculate Heart of Mary is preparing for the whole World.\" The new era, in 1942, was a totally Nazi fied European Continent, with Russia seemingly wiped off the map, Japan conquering half of Asia, and World Fascism at its zenith everywhere. The Fascist Empire vanished with the collapse of Hitler. In 1 945, the Second World War ended. And Soviet Russia, to the chagrined surprise of Pope Pius XII, emerged the sec ond greatest power on Earth. The Cult of Fatima, which had suffered a devotional recess with the defeat of the Nazi armies, now, with the suicide of Hitler, was suddenly revive d. And in October 1945 the Vatican ordered that monster pilgrimages be organized to the Shrine. In 1946, our Lady was solemnly crowned before ha lf a million pilgrims.

Hatred against Communi st Russia was promoted, headed by the Vatican which sent a statue of our Lady of Fatima, with her \"message\" on a \"pilgrimage\" around the world. She was sent from country to country to arouse anti-Russian odium. W hole Governments welcomed her. Within a few years, as the Cold War mounted, th e statue had gone to Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas and Australia and had visited fifty-thr ee nations. The East-West split continued to widen. In 1948 the frightful American-Russi an atomic race started. In 1949 Pius XII, to strengthen the anti- Russian front, excommunicated any voter supporti ng the Communists. And soon afterwards American theologians told the USA that it was her duty to use atom bombs [6] The following year, in 1950, the \"pilgrim statue\" of our Lady of Fatima, who had started to travel in 1947, the very year of the outbreak of the Cold War, was sent by airplane, accompanied by Father Arthur Brassard, on the direct inst ructions of Pope Pius XII... Wh ere? To Moscow. There, with the warm approval of Admiral Kirk, the American Ambassador, she was so lemnly placed in the Church of the foreign diplomats. For what specific reason ? \"To wait for the imminent liberation of Soviet Russia.\" Not content with this, Our Lady ap peared in person fifteen times to a nun in the Philippines. She repeated her warning against communism. After which a shower of rose petals fell at the nun's feet. An American Jesuit took the miraculous petals to the USA, to revive th e energy of fanatical Catholics, headed by the criminal Senator McCarthy and many of his supporters. [7] American warmongers, led by prominent Catholics, were meanwhile feverishly preparing for an atomic showdown with Russia. Top Catholics in the most responsible positions were talking of nothing else. On August 6th, 1949, Catholic MacGrath, Attorney General, addressing the Catholic \"storm troopers\" of the USA—namely the Knights of Co lumbus—at their convention in Portland, Oregon, urged Catholics \"to rise up and put on the armour of the Church militant in the battle to save Christianity.\" (Christianity, of c ourse, meaning for a Catholic the Ca tholic Church.) He further urged \"a bold offensive.\" In that same year another Catholic, one of the mast highly placed personages of the U.S. Government, James Forrestal, the main crusader against communism at home and abroad, helped Pope Pius XII to win the elections in Italy by sending American money. Plus money from his own pocket. James Forrestal, who was in very frequent contact with the Vatican and with Cardinal Spellman, knew better than anybody else what was goi ng on in certain Catholic and American quarters. For one simple reason: he was none other than the American Secretary for Defense. One day, upon hearing a civil aircraft overhead, he dashed along a Washington street with a most fateful message: \"The Russians have invaded us!\" he shouted.

Stalin's ruthless intransigence and the West's fear of communism were skillfully exploited by Pope Pius XII, who permeated the moun ting Russian-American antagonism with a spiritual and ideological mystique. This he did with the use of religion and the unscrupulous prom otion of the Fatima Cult. The Cult's paramount prophecy: Orthodox Russia would become Catholic. The prophecy's fulfillment implied the military invasion and occupation by the West of Russia. J. Forrestal, methodically briefed by the Va tican on the Communist menace, became so convinced of the inevitability of a USA-Russian atomic showdown that be even helped Pius XII to win the elections in 1948-9 by contributin g funds from his own sa lary to the Italian Catholics. One day he dashed along a Washington street, shouting that the Russian armies had landed in the capital. During the night of 21-22 May, 1949, he jumped from a window on the 16th floor of the Bethseda Naval Ho spital and was killed instantly. jumped from a window on the 16th floor of a buildi ng in the American Cap itol, yelling that the Russians had better be destroyed before it was too late. [8] The following year another fanatical Catholic was appointed to another impor tant post. Mr. Francis Matthews was nominated Secretary of the American Navy. On the morning he took the oath of of rice (in June 1949) Mr. Matthews, his wi fe and all their six children cont ritely heard Mass and received Holy Communion in the chapel of the Naval station in Washington. A few months afterwards (Octobe r 1949) Cardinal Spellman was summoned to Rome by the Pope, with whom he had repeated and prolonged private sessions. Although giving rise to sharp speculation, they remained a well guarded secret. The new Catholic Secretary of the U.S. Navy, strangely enough, soon afterwards began unusually active contacts with other prominent American Ca tholics. Among these, Father Walsh, Jesuit Vice President of Georgetown University; Cardinal Spellm an; the Head of the Amer ican Legion; the leaders of the Catholic War Veterans. And with Senato r McCarthy, the arch-crimi nal Senator who, upon the advice of a Catholic priest, was just beginning his infamous campai gn which was to half paralyze the"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"USA for some years to come. The Catholic Pr ess began a nationwide campaign of psychological warfare. Open hints of a quick atomic war were given once more. The culmination of all these ac tivities was a speech delivered in Boston on the 25th August 1950 by Mr. F. Matthews. The arch-Catholic Secretary of the U.S. Navy, the spokesman of certain forces in the States and in the Vatican, called upon the USA to la unch an attack upon Soviet Russia in order to make the American people \"the first aggressors for peace. \" \"As the initiators of a war of aggression,\" he added, \"it would win for us a proud and popular title: we would become the first aggressors for peace.\" The speech created a sensation, both in the USA a nd in Europe. France declared that she \"would not take part in any aggressive war ... since a preventive war would liber ate nothing but the ruins and the graveyards of our civilization.\" [9] Britain sent an even sharper protest. While the people of the World shuddered at the m onstrous proposal, George Craig of the American Legion declared (August 1950) that, yes, the USA should start World War III \"on our own terms\" and be ready when the signal could be given \"f or our bombers to wi ng towards Moscow.\" The fact that the advocacy of a \"preventive atom ic war\" was first enunciated by a Catholic was no mere coincidence. For Mr. Matthews , the head of the most important branch of the American armed forces, the American Navy, the larg est naval war instrument in the world, had become the mouthpiece of his spiritual master, Pope Pius XII. Arch-Catholic Matthews was not only the frequent ring kisser of the members of the Catholic Hierarchy in America. He was one of the most activ e promoters of Catholicism in action in the USA. In addition to which, this super-Catholic Secretar y of the American Navy was the Chairman of the National Catholic Community Service and, more sinist er still, the Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, [10] the shock troops of Catholic power in the USA. And, last but not least, a secret Privy Chamberlain of Pope Pius XII. The Catholic Hierarchy, the Catholic Press, the Knights of Columbus all supported Matthews' advocacy of a preventive atomic war. Jesuit Father Walsh, the foremost Catholic authority in the USA and a former Vatican Agent in Russia (1925), told the American people that \"President Truman would be morally justified to take defensive measures proportionate to the danger.\" Which, of course, meant the use of the atom bomb. [11] When the USA went ahead with the manufacture of the hydrogen bomb, even the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, Senator Brian MacMahon, sh rank in horror at the pr ospect of the sure massacre of fifty million people with such a monster weapon. [12] Yet Catholics approved of its use. Father Connell declared that the use of the hydrogen bomb by the USA was justified, because \"the Communists could utiliz e their large armed fo rces...to weaken the defenders of human rights.\" Advocacy of a preventive atomic war by a Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus—i.e. Mr. Matthews—assumed horrifying significance when it wa s remembered that the Secretary of the US"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Navy's war speech did not come as a surprise to certain selected Catholic leaders or, even less, to the Vatican. How was that? Simply that Mr. Matthews had disclosed the contents of his Boston speech to t op Catholics prior to its delivery. In fact, days before it was delivered. Chief among these Catholics were top people and the head of the USA Catholic Hierarchy, Cardinal Spellman. Now, it must be remembered that Cardinal Spellman was in continuous personal contact with Pope Pius XII, whose intimate friend and personal adviser in political matters he had been since the Second World War. Cardinal Spellman, moreover, was th e counselor and personal friend of most of the influential military leaders of America. So that whatever of importance was known at the \"Little Vatican\" in New York, as Cardinal Spellman's residence was called, was instantly known at the Vatican in Rome, and vice-versa. Pope Pius Xll had been kept well informed about the whole process long before Matthew's Boston speech. Indeed, the evidence is that he was one of its main tacit instigators. The continuous visits at this time of top USA military leader s to the Pope (five in one day), th e frequent secret audiences with Spellman, the unofficial contacts with the Knights of Columbia, all indicated that Pius XII knew very well what was afoot. [13] A few years later, in a hate crusade speech broad cast simultaneously in twenty-seven major languages by the world's main radio stations, Pius XII reiterated \"the morality... of a defens ive war\" (that is, of an atom and hydrogen war), calling for, as the London Times somberly described it, \"what almost amounts to a crusade of Christendom\" and what the Manchester Guardian bluntly called \"The Pope's blessing for a preventive war.\" [14] Ante Pavelic, Archbishop Stepinac (whom Pius had promoted Cardinal ) and all the Ustashi battalions, at such papal war cry, made ready. This time they w ould not lose. Since their Protector Pope Pius XII had now allied himself, instead of to Hitler, to a new supporter a nd partner: the mightiest nation on earth, the victorious United States of America. Footnotes 1.

"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Chapter 21 THE GRAND CENTRAL EUROPEAN PLOT-THE POPE,   THE CARDINAL AND THE CIA If a Third World War did not break out in 1952, as predicted by Colliers and expected by certain personages at the Vatican and elsewhere, the subterra nean exertions to provide it continued unabated. The curious amalgamation of sundry national, dynast ic, religious and ideologi cal elements increased, until at last, only three or four years later, its visi ble effects came to the fore with an insurrectional tornado in Central Europe. The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 had been planned well in advance. Not so much by the regional and local forces which were eventually to take active pa rt in it, but by its two gr and inspirers, Pope Pius XII and the CIA. The latter, while the organizer of its physical aspects, needed the active participation of the Vatican, since Catholic Intelligence inside Hungary was far more effective than any foreign agency, no matter how well equipped. Without Rome's blessing, the whole of Catholic Intelligence and hence of the Catholic Hierarchy and of the Church would have remained inactive, thus paralyzing all the exertions of the CIA. Pius XII at this period was at hi s most critical political and relig ious phase. He was suffering from recurrent and dangerous fits of de pression. He considered himself a failure. All his original pre-war and post-war anti-Red policies had been reduced to naught. The promises of Fatima had remained unfulfilled. And while it was true that he had allied the Church to the mightiest nation on earth, the USA, and that he had helped to paralyze Communism in Europe by resurrecting political Catholicism, it was nevertheless also true that Russia was still there, more menacing than ever. He thought of resigning from the Papacy. An unpreced ented step. Rumours to that effect began to circulate in Rome. His nervous ailm ents increased. He fell ill, until finally the Lord Jesus Christ Himself came down to console him in person, as we have seen. It may have been a coincidence. But the fact is th at such alleged divine vi sitation occurred during the most critical period of the Hungari an Revolution, 1955-56. Pius XII's late st move to self-sanctification (i.e. Christ's visit), which he prom ptly disclosed to the world, going so far as to use the official organ of the Vatican for the purpose, had not been the naive fumbling of a neurotic patient. But the well calculated move of a mastermind aware that the plo tting forces in Hungary and elsewhere would draw renewed vigour from the disclosure of his divine visitor, Central European Catholicism being more susceptible than any other to the religious a nd political influen ce of the Papacy. Pius XII's serious illness occurred in the late autumn of 1955, the ye ar the Hungarian insurrection had been carefully planned to \"happen. \" The CIA's a nd local plans misfired, and the date had to be postponed to the following year, 1956. The tension a nd anxiety which this produced were among the principal causes of Pius XII's nervous illness. One of the main figures in this new drama was, once more, Cardinal Mindszenty. The Cardinal had be en designated a key pa rt in a \"successful insurrection.\" That is, he had been appointed jointly by Pius XII, th e Hungarian insurrectionists and the"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"CIA as \"Premier\" of Liberated Hungary. Once Catholic Hungary had a Cardinal as its Prime Minister or as Regent, the remaining unfoldment of Pius' grandiose schemes would be greatly facilitated. Sundry paramount national and inte rnational interests played no me an role. Whether \"spontaneous\" popular forces joined them of their own volition it is for history to judge. What, however, was indisputable from the very beginning was that Pius XII, prior to and during th e Hungarian tragedy, had a leading hand in the whole affair. Cardinal Mindszenty, as one of his most devoted \"c reatures,\" played his pa rt as zealously but as awkwardly as he had done almost a decade before. We have already seen how the Cardinal, soon after the Second World War, had hatched a plot meant to overthrow the Hungarian Government in order to install one headed by himself, followed by the re storation of the super-Catholic monarchy of Hapsburg. The plot, blessed and encouraged by Pius XII, had miscarried, Joseph, Cardinal Mindszenty, Archbishop of B udapest and Primate of Hungary, with his liberators outside his residence in Buda pest, October 31, 1956, after his release. Mindszenty was a fanatical \"cre ature\" of Pope Pius XII, who used him to further his religious and political schemes in Central Europe. With the connivance of Pius and of na tionalistic Catholic elements, Mindszenty, immediately after World War II, became the cen tre of a plot to overt hrow the Government and to restore a Catholic Monarchy in Hungary, with himself as Regent. The plot failed. Mindszenty was jailed (1946). Ten years later Mindszenty became once more th e focus of the Revolution. He returned to Budapest...the Capital, escorted by three Hunga rian tanks...(October 1956) to head a new Hungarian Government, as the only public figure to command wide popular support. The uprising, however, proved another failure. It was crushed by a ruthless Russian military intervention. Mindszenty took refuge in the USA Legation of Budapest, where he was a \"guest\" for more than twelve long years (1956-1968), notwithstan ding USA and Vatican pressure to dislodge him."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"due chiefly to the undiplomatic political obtuseness of Cardinal Mindszenty himself. The Catholics and other personalities in the USA who had helped wi th political protection and money, although aghast, bade their time. The CIA, however, now took over, lock, stock and barrel. The Catholic Pretender, Otto, and others were relegated to the background. Even Catholic In telligence became subject to the supreme direction of the CIA. The insurrection, this time, could not be permitted to fail. Too much was at stake. The ClA-Vatican novel efforts we re crowned with a spectacular success. The Hungarian Government, taken by surprise, was duly overthrown. Cardinal Mindszenty, the innocent \"martyr\" who had been whiling away hi s time inside a monastery, became once more the focus of the revolution. When, in October 1956, the insurrecti onists took over the Hungarian Ca pital, what was one of their first, most ominous moves? This is how an authoritative organ described the event: The Prince Primate Cardinal Mindszenty returned to Budapest today for the first time since 1948. The Cardinal, who was freed last night from the monast ery in which he was confined... drove into the Capital escorted by three Hungarian tanks...Thousa nds of the faithful crowded round his house when the news spread that he was back, and knelt in the dust as the Cardinal gave them his blessing. ( Manchester Guardian , Nov. 1956) [1] After the Cardinal's return \"in triumph,\" the revol utionary forces, now in command, \"fully pardoned him.\" Then—note the timing—within th e next twenty-four hours speculati ons arose to the effect that \"Cardinal Mindszenty might head a new Hungarian Government, as the only public figure to command wide popular support.\" The significance of the forthcoming appointment of th e Cardinal being, of course, but the first phase in the unfolding of the Papal-CIA grand design. Sin ce Hungary in reality wa s nothing but a stepping stone to its fulfillment. Once Mindszenty had become Head of the new Hungary, Pius XII and the CIA would have had a free hand to promote the second pha se of their grand policy: namely, the invasion, occupation and conversion of Russia. The plan misfired. A few days later, the counter-r evolution was suppressed by the ruthless intervention of Russian tanks and troops. For a while there loomed the peril of a USA-Russian armed confrontation. That is, the spectre of World War III rose, immediate and real, on the horizon. At the Vatican, all the forces charged with manni ng the grand apparatus concerned with the invasion— or, rather, the \"occupatio n\" and \"conversion\"—of Russia were alerted. Religious fervour was mobilized. Special novenas, prayers and vigils were organized in the churches and convents of many countries, including Hungary. Our Lady of Fatima was i nvoked, that her prophecy might at long last be fulfilled. The expected war did not take place, although the worl d went once more to \"the brink.\" Fear gripped the nations of Europe. At the Vatican, however, the Pope, instead of appealing for peace and working for the prevention of hostilities, initiated a mass hate campaign, unparalleled by any modern Pontiff. He went so far, in his daily incitement of the Catholic millions against the Reds, as to stir up such"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"belligerency that even London's sober The Times described \"what almost amounts to a crusade of Christendom.\" [2] The counter-revolution came to naught. The CIA gna shed their teeth, overruled, for once, by the common sense of President Eisenhower. Even so, th ey could not abandon their Catholic Agents in Russian occupied Hungary. Plane lo ads of Catholic \"refugees\" were flown overnight to the USA. Among them, of course, were those who had been mo st compromised in the venture as the direct Agents of the CIA and of the Vatican. Their principal \"creature,\" the Premier designate of Hungary, Cardinal Mindszenty, however, was not so lucky. Or, rather, his task was not yet wholly accomplished. When the insurrection finally collapsed, thanks to the Russian mailed fist, the Cardinal disa ppeared. Then, after rumours had it that he might have fallen into the hands of the Communists, lo and behold! the Cardinal appeared, safe and sound, and wholly out of any danger of arrest or of hang ing. Where? Inside the very building of the American Legation in the Hungarian Capital. [3] There, protected by diplomatic i mmunity, he celebrated Mass at an altar bedecked with American flags. The Amer ican Legation was forbidden, by very specific USA regulations, to give asylum to a ny political refugees. The CIA, however , waved this aside. They could not abandon a man who had served them so well, even though he was such a spectacular failure. Besides, the future might yet be kind. Three ti mes lucky, as the popular saying goes. The Russian- backed Hungarian Government perhaps thought th e same. After a decent period had elapsed, they began discreet negotiations with the Vatican and indeed, with the American Government itself. Did they wish to have Cardinal Mindszen ty, either in Rome or in Washi ngton? They were ready to let the \"prisoner\" go free, a nywhere outside Hungary. Some naive Catholics replied, \"Let the \"martyr\" Card inal join the Roman Curia, or go to the USA.\" Cardinal Mindszenty, however, refused to budge. The reason? His two mighty sponsors, Pope Pius XII and the CIA had other plans. They had decided to continue to make political capital out of the Cardinal's forced \"asylum\" in the U.S. Legation in Budapest. Since, as long as Mindszenty remained in Catholic Hungary, he would be th e symbol of a potentially explos ive political issue and hence the potential source of a military dynamism capable of furthering Pius XII's grand schemes. Cardinal Mindszenty remained an American \"guest\" for over twelve consecutive years, the exertions of two Popes failing to \"dislodge\" him. Indeed, wh en in 1967 the USA and Hungary restored normal relations and the U.S. Ambassa dor, Mr. Hillebrand, asked Mindsze nty to go, the latter stubbornly refused to leave the Legation. How close to war the world had come at this ju ncture was eventually disclosed by the highest American authority who knew more than anybody el se what had been going on behind the scenes: namely, John Foster Dulles, the U.S. Secretary of St ate. He knew simply because he was one of the main organizers of the grand Vatican-CIA \"Fatima\" scheme. [4] John Foster Dulles at this time was the verita ble foreign policy maker of the USA. General Eisenhower, the President, knew more about war than about the intricacies of foreign policies. As a result he left practically the entire field in the hands of Dulles, whose paramount obsession was Communism. Such obsession matched that of Pius XII. Dulles mobilized all the immense resources of the USA to deal with it the world over. He turned into the staunchest as sociate of Pius XII."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"The partnership became one of the most formidab le working partnerships of the period. Dulles conducted his policies very often without the approva l or even knowledge of th e American President. He was helped in this by the fact that, in addition to the regular USA diplomatic machinery, he used more than anything else the secretiv e and omnipotent apparatus of the CI A. Indeed, it can be said that he conducted American foreign policy via the CIA. So mething that was facilitated by the ominous fact that the inspirer, director and ma ster controller of the whole CIA wa s none other than his own brother, Alan Dulles. The two brothers worked so closely together that Pr esident Eisenhower more than once had his official policy \"nullified\" by the CIA. The most spectacu lar example being the collapse of the American Russian Summit Meeting of 1960, when the CIA sent a spy plane over Russia so as to prevent the American President and the Russian Premier from te rminating the \"cold war.\" The meeting, thanks to the CIA's plane, was canceled. It was one of the ClA's most sensational triumphs John Foster Dulles (whose son, incidentally, became a Jesuit) and Alan Dulles, in total accord with the Vatican Intelligence, conducted a foreign policy based on threats of \"Mas sive retaliation\"—that is , of atomic warfare. At the height of the Hungarian insurrection—that is, in 1955 John Foster Dulles openly acknowledged to the horrified world that the US A had stood on the brink three times: Mr. Dulles admitted that the USA had on three occasions in the past eighteen months come closer to atomic war...than was imagined as the London and New York Times somberly reported. [5] The Third World War had been avoided,\" they fu rther commented, \"only because Mr. Dulles...had seen to it that Moscow and Peking were informed of the USA's intention to use atomic weapons.\" What did Pope Pius XII do during thes e terrible crises? Part icularly since he, more than anyone else in the highest positions, knew what was going on behind the scenes between the USA and Russia? He intensified the Cult of Fatima. The Cult was gi ven added luster and impetus. Catholic churches prayed for the \"liberation\"—that is, for a speedy fu lfillment of the \"prophecy\" of Our Lady. This also in view of the fact that the th ird \"secret\" of Our Lady of Fatima had to be revealed within a few years—that is, in 1960. Hitler welcomes Mgr. Tiso, a Catholic priest, whom he made Chief of State of Nazi sponsored Slovakia—January 20th, 1941. Mgr. Tis o, leader of the Catholics of Slovakia,"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"cooperated with Hitler in th e final disintegration of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Before the Second World War he led Nazified Catholics against the Central Government of Prague. He was in continuous contact respectiv ely with Pope Pius XII, from whom he took political directives, and Adolf Hitler, with whom he plotted for the ultimate military occupation of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Like Ante Pavelich, who helped to bring about the disintegration of Y ugoslavia to set up his Independent Catholic State of Croatia unde r Nazi protection, so Mgr. Tiso worked incessantly for the final ruin of Czechoslovakia to create the Independent Catholic State of Slovakia, which he ruled as a Nazi Quisling State. Although he never matched the terrorization of Croatia, nevertheless Mgr. Tiso set up a Catholic Dictatorship in which the Church was declared supreme and where Catholic-Nazi doctrines were ruthlessly enforced upon all and sundry. After the fall of Hitler, Mgr. Tiso was liquidated by the Allies. Pope Pius XII pr otested, saying that Mgr. Tiso had been a martyr for \"religious freedom.\" Although no one knew what the Fatima \"secret\" was, it was whispered that it was the imminent liberation and conversion of Russia. Pope Pius XII, of course, could not let Our Lady's third and last \"secret\" remain a secret from him too. He had the s ealed letter, containing the secret according to one of the children who had spoken to Our Lady at Fatim a, opened. He then related that, upon reading it, he had almost fainted with horrified astonishment. It was as good a meth od as any to incite the Fatima frenzy to even higher expectations. Not content with this, Pius XII came to the fore personally to condition the Catholic World to the oncoming war. This so much so that during the winter of 1956-57 (note: immediately following the failure of the Hungarian counterrevolution) he brazenly called upon all Catholics to join in a veritable Fatima Crusade by urging them to take part \"in a war of effective self-defense,\" asking that the United Nations be given \"the right and the power of fore stalling all military intervention of one State into another.\" Indeed, at this very terrible period when the USA a nd Russia were truly on the brink of an atomic war, he went so far, as we have already quoted, as to reiterate \"the morality of a defensive war,\" thus echoing the very words of his secr et Chamberlain, the Secretary of the U.S. Navy, Mr. Matthews, in his famous Boston speech. In fact, Pope Pius XII on this occasion called for what even the London Times described as \"what almost amounts to a crusade of Christendom,\" and the Manchester Guardian bluntly called \"the Pope's blessing for a preventive war\" (with atom a nd hydrogen bombs, it should be remembered). [6] While Pius XII was waiting for the outbreak of World War III, the leader of the Catholic Ustashi, Ante Pavelic, and his followers were making ready. They incr eased their efforts to resuscitate the Ustashi at home and abroad. Encouraged by the direct and indire ct help of Pius XII, of the CIA, and of sundry Catholic Hierarchs and lay Catholics inside and outside the USA and other countries."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"In the Argentine, for instance, where his \"Croat Government in Exile\" was functioning, he was openly subventioned and protected by the Argentine Hierar chy. Not to mention certain military groups, who refused his extradition from the country. Notwithst anding this, in 1957 Pavelic was attacked and almost killed, two bullets having hit him. The following year (October 1958), Pius XII, assailed by ever more frequent attacks of nerves, asthma and a general neurosis and a victim of the immense amount of drugs th at had sustained him for years, possibly the real cause of many hallucinations, prom ptly accounted as \"miracles\" by his admirers, died. The World Press promptly acclaimed him as the Pr ince of Peace. Representatives from fifty-four countries attended the final requiem. Most promin ent and most ominous was a USA delegation, headed by none other than Pius XII's secret partner, Mr. John Foster Dulles, U.S. Secretary of State and, no less significant, Mr. John McCone, Chairman of th e USA Atomic Energy Commission (19th October, 1958). Shortly afterwards, Pius XII's speci al protégé, Ante Pavelic, also passed away. A year later (1960) Cardinal Stepinac, too, went. Thus, within a brief sp an of two years the three main protagonists of the Catholic Croatian nightmare vanished from the stage. Whatever the merits or demerits of the mutual American-Russian antagonism, the fact remains that Pius XII, far from labouring to diminish the peril, di d his utmost to aggrandise it, in order to overthrow an ideological enemy, the better to overcome a religious foe—namely, the Russian Orthodox Church— whom the Vatican had been fighting vain ly for the preceding one thousand years. The occupation of Russia by the West would have sp elled the potential control of the Orthodox Church by the Papacy. Catholic control would have mean t but one thing: Orthodo x absorption into the Catholic fold via persuasion or force, throughout the Russian o ccupied territories. In short, a repetition of the Cr oatian experiment on a scale in volving no longer one, but hundreds of millions of Orthodox believers. In Pope Pius XII's daring calcula tions, therefore, the outbreak of World War III would have done for the Orthodox Church of Russia what World War II had done for the Orthodox Church of Croatia.

In that year there took place an historical political struggle upon whose outcome would depend the Island's future status. The Catholic Church, as was to be expected, played no mean role in the pro ceedings. But, as always when she can do so, she used religion to promote her political intere sts and politics to promote her religious ones. This she did with the utmost disregard for the ba sic tenets of democracy, liberty and honesty. Her influence being paramount, she could impose her will upon all and sundry in mora l, ethical, social and thus even in political matters. As proved by the f act that the Maltese law on marriage was the law of the Catholic Church, as codified in the Catholic Canon Law, and th at the Roman Catholic Apostolic religion was the religion of Malta. Prior to the 1962 election, the main political opponent of the Chur ch, the Maltese Labour Party, promised the electorate to reduce the overwhe lming power of the Church by a reasonable liberalization. The Church came to the fore boldly, brazenly and determined to win, cost what it may. The civil authorities were alr eady under her thumb while her oppone nt was hamstrung in all possible directions. Catholic leaders, priests and others had complete freedom to speak, to preach and to hold assemblies; her opponents had to run the gauntlet of the Catholic police who, when they c ould not brazenly veto meetings, resorted to tricks borderi ng on the dishonest and the illegal. In addition, the election commissioner and his assistants were all ha nd-picked by the Catholic Church via the colonial administration.Tha t was not all. Catholic organiza tions and the priests often openly disturbed their opponents meetings. Indeed, it was an open secret that prie sts organized veritable religious-political expeditionary Ca tholic gangs with the specific purpose of breaking up assemblies. The Catholic crusaders were not all adults. T housands of school childr en were taught genuine democracy in a practical way by being supplied by thei r parents with hooters and whistles, which they used en masse whenever they came across Labour speakers, often preventing the speeches from being delivered. A friend of the author, Mr. To m Driberg, a prominent member of the House of Commons, who happened to be visiting the island at the time, was persistently hoot ed by hundreds of school children, who pursued him wherever he we nt, having taken him for a potenti al speaker, which he was not. The Catholic clergy surpassed themselves in their vigo rous activities to defend the spiritual interests of Holy Mother Church (and, we must not forget, one solid third of the island which she owned) by using their brains as well as their muscles to silence the devilish enemies. And so the very bells of their belfries were made to work whenever the whistles of their children (who, presumably, were put to bed exha usted) had no more wind in them. The clergy's method was certainly a sonorous one. And most effective. For it not only silenced the Labour speaker s, but deafened them and their listeners and those who did not want to listen at all, th e Catholic themselves."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"So it came to pass that when the former Maltese Pr emier, now enemy number one of God and of Saint Peter, began to address an open air meeting, th e bells of a nearby Church began to toll.

Then, since the ringing turned into a kind of pandemoni um, they concluded that somebody had already won the elections (still weeks ah ead) or that there must be a carnival to celebrate some forgotten Saint or other. The bells, however, were in no mood to rest. On the contrary, they tolled and pealed and rang with increasing energy, stopping periodically only for a few minutes, to let the speaker begin his first sentences, to start anew with devilish merriment. On this occasi on the bells rang continuously for THREE SOLID HOURS, not one minute more and not one minute less. When the Labour listeners, now prac tically stone deaf, lost their pa tience and attempted to take the bells by their ropes... via a well c onducted siege of the be lfry, they found the be lfry and the Church unassailable. A massive police cordon had surrounded the sacred building, to prevent those vociferous silvery proclaimers of the rights of the Church from being silenced. Dom. Mintoff, the speaker who had not been permitte d to speak, and the parish priest who had ordered that the bells be rung had sufficient energy left to write. So, while the first wrote pr otests to his own press, the latter wrote a justific ation of his sonorous in terpretation of freedom of speech to the Times of Malta (February 3, 1962). That journal one morning printed an illuminating letter from Father Innocenzo Borg, of Luqa (the place where th e bells had tolled for three solid hours). What? He, anti-democratic? he asked. What an insult! Like the Catholic Church and the Archbishop of Malta, he, too, was a firm believer in freedom of sp eech. Had he made the bells toll? Yes, he had. But, assured Father Innocenzo, he had given the Labour speakers severa l opportunities to stop speaking...and if that was not democracy, could anyone tell him what true democracy meant? Here are the very words which the good Father Innocenzo (i.e. Innocent) wrote in his letter of explanation: As regards the ringing of the bells which continued l ong after sunset, may I say that the pealing of bells stopped when the loudspeakers with their irreligious and scandalous talk did stop. The bells rang, in fact, as a protest against this ki nd of speech... and a speaker began to attack the church teaching and his Grace the Archbishop. Several times, the ringing of the bells for a very short time had unsuccessfully warned this speaker to stop his ir religious speech, before the din of the bells as Mr. Mintoff put it, \"attempted to interfere w ith the public meeting taking place in the public square.\" [1] In addition to the mobilization of belfries, that of th e porches of churches follo wed suit, as well as of their walls, internal and external. For posters of all sizes, colours and kinds appeared all over Malta, decorating the sacred buildings with slogans in which the Devil, the Labour Party, all the Saints of the Calendar and even God Himself, not to menti on the Catholic Church figured prominently. \"Vote as directed by the Diocesan Junta,\" said a poster on a Young Christian Workers Club. \"God will be watching you. God will judge you.\" \"If you vote for th e enemy of the Church,\" said another, on the walls of Gudja Parish Church, \"you will be defy ing the Bishop, you will be defying God (sic).''"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Parish priests sent letters to the voters. Witness the one received by the parishioners of Marsa, Malta, written by Father Felicjan Bilocca of the Order of St. Francis: Before you cast your vote, say unto yourself: I have but one soul. Am I going to lose it because of Mintoff? A picture at the top of the circul ar showed Father Felicjan blessing the new Church at Marsa dedicated to Our Lady of Tears. [2] Whether the voters thus addressed shed tears of joy at the Father's polit ical counsel is not recorded. But in all probability, remembering thei r souls, they voted as he told them to vote. Thousands more did likewise. Father Felicjan Bilocca was not the only one to use religious fear to compel voters to vote for the Church. Following threatening words with deeds, the Church ordered whoever she could mobilize to vote according to her dicta. All young seminarians who had never voted before, for instance, were compelled to go to the polls. All the sick and th e infirm of Malta were mobilized. Witness the following extracts from a stenciled circular se nt to bedridden voters before polling day:\" We know that many of you never leave your home, not even to hear Holy Mass. This time, however, YOU MUST COME OUT. God knows your good intentions, and He will give you the help you need. We must vote for those whom we know not to be agai nst the priests, against the Church and against the Archbishop. Do your duty, dear brethren, so that you will share in the Victory for Catholic Malta. [3] After which there was the following warning: Our volunteers will be wearing a badge mounted with a coloured photograph of Mons. Archbishop. Do not accept lifts to the polling booths from persons who are against the Church. That was not all. The Catholic Church mobilized her most feared spiritual weapons and unblushingly used religious \"terror\" to compel voters to vote her way. Imitating Pope Pius XII, who years before had done the same, they told the Maltese, in no uncertain terms, that unless they voted for the political party favoured by the Church they would be grilled in the flames of Hell for endless millions of years. Purgatory, in this case, was to be bypassed altogether . Priests all over the island told voters that it was a mortal sin to vote for Labour. Th e Archbishop himself gave specific instructions to that effect: Preachers can indeed be of great se rvice for the reassertion of the C hurch both in civil and political matters, as the occasion demands... and for the rec uperation of souls lost on account of political matters... In their sermons or speeches they should e xplain the divine influence of the Church for the formation of a perfect society both private and public; about the divi ne power of the Church and her unerring judgment, EVEN IN CIVIL LA WS; about the gravity of mortal sin... the utility of Catholic associations. [4] "},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"The Archbishop's words were confirmed by the Bis hop of Gozo who, in April of the same year, published a circular telling Catholic voters that to belong to the La bour Party or even to attend its meetings was \"a mortal sin.\" To coordinate the individual and collective fear thus engendered by the Hierarchy, the Vatican then dispatched to Malta from Rome some of its best \"org anizers,\" specialized in that very type of warfare generated directly by religi ous pressure and the fear of the punishment of God. These specialists were veterans in that kind of religious-pol itical pressure, since they had used it in exactly the same way on a larger sc ale in Italy several times before. For instance, back in 1949, Pope Pius XII had excommunicated all and sundry who either directly or indirectly supported the Communists or their allies the Soci alists, in order to compel them to vote for the Catholic Party, inspired and backed by the Vatican itself. In 1959 the Holy Office had reiterated the excommunication, followed by another one in 1965, when Ca rdinal Ottaviani said that the Holy Office decrees were still in force. [5] Tacticians\" like Father Rotondi, a Jesuit, led by none other than Professor Gedda, a former President of Italian Catholic Action, descended upon Malta and coordinated the re ligious pressure to yield the maximum political results at the voting stations. Professor Gedda, a brilliant organizer, had even fu ller cooperation from the Maltese Hierarchy than he had received from the Hierarchy in Italy, where th e Church, notwithstanding he r boldness, has to tread with a certain care. In Malta, the Church went furthe r than anywhere else. That is, she transformed the sacrosanct confessional in to a polling ballot box. Confessors were or dered to tell penitents how to vote. Disobedience meant refusal of absolution.On the days of Our Lord January 29 and 30, 1962, His Grace the Archbishop called a secret meeting of all FATH ER CONFESSORS only, at the Catholic Institute, Floriana, and ordered them orally—under a THRE AT OF EXCOMMUNICATION—to \"ask penitents whether they were voting Labour and to refuse them absolution if the penitents persisted.\" And so it came to pass that one morning—or, perh aps, evening—the stupefied Maltese Catholics discovered that their confessionals , those havens of secrecy and sp iritual comfort which they had always assumed were dedicated exclusively to whis perings between them and their spiritual fathers concerning interesting private misdeeds (mostly conf ined to love and money), now had become places of veritable political confabula tion, whence the Archbishop of Malta ordered them how and for whom to vote. In case readers should doubt the authenticity of these archiepiscopa l instructions, we quote a few. They are an ad litteram translation of the Latin text distributed by ha nd on March 7, 1962, to parish priests only: Methods of Procedure for Father Confessors and Preachers: [6] A. As regards the Father Confessors 1. First of all, confessors should inquire of the penitent whether he voted or not. 2. If the penitent did not vote, th e confessor should ask him why he shirked to fulfill such a heavy obligation."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"(a) If the penitent shirked this obligation through mere negligence while conscious of the gravity of such a thing, he is to be accused of a serious omission... (b) If he shirked this obligation be cause he had no faith in any of the candidates...he should be argued with...; he should, however, be RE FUSED ABSOLUTION unless he fait hfully accepts the relevant directions issued in May 1961 agai nst the spokesmen of the political party hostile to the teaching of Holy Mother Church. (c) If indeed he shirked this obligation through malice he shou ld be REFUSED ABSOLUTION... 3. If the penitent voted for the part y hostile to the Church, the confe ssor should ask whether in so doing the penitent had sinned in private or in public (such public action im plies either making ones intention manifest or canvassing for that party). (a) If the penitent declared himself to have sinne d privately, whether he should be absolved or not depends on his sincerity... (b) If on the other hand he sinned in public, he should NOT BE ABSOLVED, unless and until he makes his atonement public...and honestly promises th at wherever possible he will make reparation to the same extent that he had wrought damage to the Church, Bishops, Priests, and all those he may have offended. [7] So much for the sacrosanct sacrament of the conf ession which, Catholics never tire of repeating, is inviolate and dedicated exclus ively to spiritual matters. Having terrified the voters in the secretiveness of the confessionals, the Ma ltese Hierarchy now came into the open and inflicted a sp iritual leprosy upon their politic al opponents by hurling their bolts against the members of the National Ex ecutive Party. Here are their words: Their lordships... feel compelled to inflict from now the canonical penalty of personal interdiction according to canons 2291-2 and 2275 on all those who at the meeting of the National Executive of the Malta Labour Party held on March 15, 1961, took part in the drawing up of the statement or approved of it by their votes... [8] In short, the members of the part y opposed to the Church had been put out of bounds to all Catholics by the canonical penalty of \"personal interdiction.\" The result of this state of affairs can be gauged by th e fact that foreign visito rs to the island at that period were, to quote a well known member of the Br itish Parliament who was among them, \"treated with such ferocious hostility and discourtesy \" that the car they were in was shot at. [9] The Church's vengeance against he r political opponents went even further. Not content with the mobilization of terror in this worl d, she mobilized terror of the next that would pursue them beyond the tomb.Thus Joseph Mercer, Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, who died in September 1961, was not given burial where Christians were usually interred, but was laid in a spot popularly known as the \"refuse dump.\" He had not even been present at the Executive Meeting of March 15, and was a practicing Catholic. Another Labour Party me mber was refused burial in the same way. [10]"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"As the election day approached, the Church intensif ied her pressure upon all and sundry. News agents were forbidden to sell literature opposing the Ca tholic party, Catholics were forbidden to put advertisements in Labour journals. Over 80 per cent complied, for fear of reprisals. Children were questioned by priests as to the political attitudes of their parents, while parents not conforming to the political dicta of the Church were denied the sacraments. Finally, on the eve of the elections, crucifixes draped in mourning were paraded in village squares with the caption: \"Why are you voting against Me?\" Last but not least, during polling day itself, to complete the camp aign of terror against the already cowed Maltese Catholics, cohorts of black robed priests, nuns and monks appeared at the voting queues and stationed themselves in front of the vote rs, chanting and saying the rosary, while bedridden and practically dying faithful were carried on stretc hers to vote \"for the Church and for God.\" The result?

This is incorrect. Since the Vietnamese tragedy had its origin in the religious and ideological influence exercised by the Catholic Church in the affair s of that country from its very beginning. We are not here dealing with the rights or wrongs of the Vietnamese war. But only with the paramount role which religion, with particular reference to the Catholic Churc h, has played in its inception. The Vietnamese tragedy was precipitated by a zealous Cat holic trio formed by a Catholic President, a Catholic Head of the Secret Police, and a Cathol ic Archbishop. All were determined to impose the religious and political writ of th e Church upon a non-Ch ristian culture. How did it happen, particularly in view of the fact that South Vietnam was an Asian Buddhist land? Here is a bird's-eye view of the events which im mediately preceded the outbreak of the Vietnamese- USA war. One day in early June, 1963, a 73 year old Buddhi st monk named Thich Quang Duc stopped in a busy street in Saigon, the Capital City of South Vietnam, and, after havi ng been soaked with gasoline by a fellow monk, sat down cross-legged; thereupon, having calmly struck a match, he burned himself to death. Prior to this, however, he had written a message to President Diem: \"Enforce a policy of religious equality,\" the message read. President Diem, a zealous Catholic, gave a prompt response. He clamped martial law upon the city, sealed most of the pagodas, ordered his secret police force to arrest Buddhist leaders, and mobilized his troops to truncheon any Buddhist m onk or any Buddhist crowds who dare d to protest at his increasing discrimination against their religion. The self-immolation of Thich Quang Duc was th e culmination of an increasingly virulent discriminatory campaign against Buddhism by a Roma n Catholic Premier, President Ngo Dinh Diem, of South Vietnam. President Diem by this time had ruled the country for about nine years, helped by his two brothers, Ngo Dinh Nhu, head of the secret police, and Ngo Dinh Thuc, Archbishop of Hue. The trio had been inching for years toward veritabl e religious persecu tion of the vast majority of the country's population of 15 million, only 1,500,000 of whom were Catholics. The spark to the Buddhist revolt was set only a few days before in Hue, the ancient Vietnamese capital, now the See of the Archbishop, who reigned, ruled a nd dominated Catholics and non-Catholics alike in his role of a spiritual guide to his two brothers, th e president and the head of the secret police. At a celebration to honour the Archbishop, the Catholic c ontingent at Hue flew the flag of the Vatican, without any Buddhist objection. When, three days later, the whole count ry celebrated the 2,507th birthday of Buddha and the Buddhist s unfurled their religious flag, th e Archbishop, via the authorities,"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"forbade them to do so. This, it must be remember ed, in a country eighty pe r cent of whose population are practicing Buddhists. The Buddhists staged a peaceful de monstration march against the ed ict. As a reply, the government sent troops and armoured cars and fired at the demonstrators, k illing nine Buddhists. The Hue massacre caused demonstrations all over S outh Vietnam. Buddhist de legations in Saigon demanded the removal of restrictions on their relig ion and the discriminatory laws imposed against them. The government arrested many of the demonstrators. In Hue, meanwhile, when another demonstration of Buddhists paraded the cit y, troops dispersed them, using tear gas bombs. Result: sixty-seven people were taken to hospital with chemical burns. The USA protested. President Diem seemed to take note, but discriminations against the Buddhists continued unabated. Arrests of Buddhist monks multiplied. Pagodas were declared out of bounds, closed and at times even attacked. Catholic soldiers fought with Buddhi st soldiers within the national army, engaged upon a life or death war against the co mmunist regime of the North. The war, supported by American arms and by 16,000 American President Ngo Dinh Diem, of South Vietnam. President Diem was a fanatical Catholic w ho ruled South Vietnam with an iron fist. He transformed the Presidency into a virtual Ca tholic Dictatorship, which he used to crush his religious and political opponents with the utmost ruthlessness. He persecuted non-Catholics, and particularly the Buddhists. By his discriminatory methods he caused the disruption of the Army and Government. This eventually was to lead to the USA's military intervention in South Vietnam. He ruled with the spiritual and political terro rization of his two equally fanatical Catholic brothers, the Chief of the Secret Police and the Archbishop of Hue. President Diem had originally been \"planted\" into the Presidency by Cardinal Spellman and Pope Pius XII. Buddhist monks committed suicide by fire, burni ng themselves alive in protest against his"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"religious persecutions. He, with one of his brothers, was murdered immediately after he aring mass on Nov. 2, 1963. (3 weeks before Kennedy's death)!! \"advisors,\" was jeopardized by the ra pidly deteriorating relig ious strife. President Kennedy, a Catholic, put pressure upon the Catholic trio in Vietnam. But, since this seem ed to have no effect, he finally suspended, among other heavy USA subsidies, part of the American Central Inte lligence Agency's two million dollars monthly payment to the South Viet nam \"special forces\" and stopped the funds which financed the super-Catholic head of the secret police. Although protests from all over the world went on, th e Catholic trio continue d in their set policy: Catholicization of South Vietnam. Hasty promotions of Catholics in the government and in the army were increased, and this to such an extent that many Buddhist officers became converted to Catholicism solely with a view to swift promotion. President Kennedy changed ambassadors in an effort to persuade the three brothers to alter their policy. In July, 1963, he sent President Diem a personal message of confidence via Ambassador Nolting. Kennedy's efforts once more were of no avail. On the contrary, the head of the secret police, with the excuse that Red elements had been found amongst the Buddhists, turned the harsh discriminatory campaign against the Buddhi sts into actual religious persecution. Buddhist monks, Buddhist nuns and Buddhist leaders were arrested by the thousand. Pagodas were closed or besieged. Buddhists were tortured by the police. One day another Buddhist monk burned himself alive in public, to draw the attention of th e world to the Catholic persecution. President Diem, undeterred, continued in his policy. The secret police packed the jails with more monks. The third monk committed suicide by fire, and then another. Within a brief period, seven of them had burned themselves alive in public. Vietnam was put unde r martial law. Troops now occupied many pagodas and drove out all monks offering resistance. More Buddhist monks and Buddhist nuns were arrested and taken away in lorries, including a large number of wounded. Many were killed. Ten thousand Buddhists took part in a hunger strike in blockaded Saigon, while a giant gong tolled from the tower of the main Xa Loi Pagoda in protes t against the persecutions. At Hue, in the North, monks and nuns put up a tremendous struggle at the main pagoda of Tu Dam, which was virtually demolished, while eleven Buddhist students burned themselves inside it. The USA applied even stronger pressu re and threatened to cut off all aid to President Diem. Again, all to no avail. South Vietnam's Ambassador in Wash ington, a Buddhist, resigned in protest. President Diem's brother and sister-in-law, Mrs. Nhu, advocat ed even harsher treatment of the Buddhists. Mrs. Nhu scoffed openly at the Buddhist monks who had committed suicide by setting themselves alight, declaring that they had used \"importe d gasoline\" to \"barbecue\" themselves. By this time the Buddhist leader, Thich Tri Quang, had to seek asylum in the American Embassy, to escape with his life. [1] The American government had grow n openly impatient. The USA State Department issued an official declaration deploring the repressi ve actions the South Vietnamese government had taken against the Bu ddhists. \"On the basis of informa tion from Saigon it appears that the government of the Republic of Vietnam has instituted serious repressive measures against the"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Vietnamese Buddhist leaders,\" it sa id. \"The action repres ents direct violation by the Vietnamese government of assurances that it was pursuing a polic y of reconciliation with the Buddhists. The USA deplores repressive ac tions of this nature.\" [2] Vietnam was split. The army became openly restiv e and put up passive resi stance, not against the communists, but against their own government. Re sult: the war against the communist North was being rapidly lost, since the population at large, upon whose support the str uggle ultimately rested, refused to cooperate. At long last the USA, realizing how its strategy in th at part of Asia was in serious danger of collapsing, took action. The American Central Intelligence Ag ency (CIA), in cooperation with Vietnamese Buddhist elements successfully engineered a \"coup.\" President Diem and his brother, the head of the secret police, had to run for their lives, but were soon discovered by rebel troops hiding in a small Catholic Church in Cholon. Both men were killed a nd their bodies laid in St. Joseph's Hospital a few hundred yards away from the Xa Loi Pagoda, the reli gious centre of the Buddhi st resistance to their authoritarianism. [3] So ended one of the most Catholic regimes of r ecent times. What the world at large, which had followed the religious strife with horrified fascination, did not know was the pressure of conflicting policies within the Catholic ci rcles themselves—in Washington, South Vietnam and the Vatican. Kennedy, the first Catholic President of the USA, when inheriting the Am erican policy in South Vietnam, inherited also Catholic President Diem. In different circumstance s, the sharing of common religious beliefs might have helped in the conduct of a common policy, since th e political interests of the two counties ran parallel. With Catholic Diem pursuing such anachronistic religious persecutions, however, Catholic Kennedy felt increasingly ill at ease, since he was too astute a politician to compromise his political career or to sacrifice the interests of the USA for the sake of a fellow Catholic who, after all, was incurring the opprobrium of the va st majority of Americans, most of whom still looked upon Kennedy's Catholicism with suspicion. Hence the Kenne dy Administration's blessing upon the final overthrow of the Diem regime. The disastrous policy of the South Vietnamese Ca tholic government was th e dire result of the campaign initiated by the political grand strategy of two men: J ohn Foster Dulles for the USA and Pope Pius XII for the Vatican. The Diem dynasty wa s put into power by them both when the cold war was at its zenith: that is, after the French were soundly defeated in the Indo-China war and the USA stepped in to fill the vacuum in what eventually became known as South Vietnam. From the beginning the USA decided to back a govern ment headed by an individual who would give a guarantee not to show any quarter to the communis ts, either at home or abroad. The person chosen: Diem. Diem was a man with a stro ng inclination to mysticism, a practicing and quietly fanatical Catholic. In his early youth he had wanted to become a Catholic priest, but ironically enough, was dissuaded from so doing by his brother, the future Ar chbishop of Hue, who told him that the vocation of a Catholic priest would be too soft for him. That the advice was not a jest was subsequently proven by the fact that when Diem, during the French crisis , was forced to go into exile to the USA, and to Belgium, he always chose to stay in Catholic mona steries, leading the auster e life of their inmates. To Dulles and to Pius XII, this religious asceticis m was the surest guarantee that Diem would execute their joint policy with the utmost fidelity. And in this they were right, as subsequent events demonstrated. People who knew better, however, were not of the same opinion about Diem's"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"suitability. The American Embassy, for instance, advised against him from the very beginning. The Embassy's warning was completely ignored by Wash ington, and, although the State Department itself was against the choice, the Special Operations Branch of the Pentagon insisted on Diem. It had its way. What was the explanation? A cert ain clique at the Pentagon, insp ired by another in the Central Intelligence Agency with intimate links to the Cathol ic lobby in Washington and certain Cardinals in the USA, and consequently in perfect accord with th e Vatican, had decided to have a staunch Catholic in South Vietnam. It must be remembered that the period was when the Cold war was at its worst, when its arch- exponents, the Dulles brothers—one at the State Depart ment and the other at th e CIA—and Pius XII at the Vatican, were conducting a joint diplomatic, polit ical and ideological grand strategy embracing both the West and the Far East, of wh ich Vietnam was an integral part. The choice proved a disaster for Sout h Vietnam and for the USA's Asian policy, since, as we have just seen, the religious issue was eventually to stultify the whole grand American strategic pattern there. But it is often the case with Catholics in authority that whenever the circumstances permit, and their power is no longer restricted by eith er constitutional clauses or othe r checks, they tend to conduct a policy more and more consonant with the spirit of their religion. The result being that, by combining the interests of their coun try with those of their ch urch, more often than not they create unnecessary social and political disturbances which ultimate ly are bound to generate opposition in both religious and political fields. When this state of affairs is nearing a crisis owing to the resistance of the non-Catholic opposition, then the Catholics exerting political or military power will not hesitate to use that power against those who oppose them. At this stage, the interests of their church will, as a rule, oust those of their country. This formula proved to be correct in the case of South Vietnam. Pr esident Diem, having provoked such a crisis, disregarded the in terests of the country, no le ss than those of its protec tors, the USA, to pursue what he considered were th e interests of his church. Whereas political and military factor s of no mean import played a lead ing part in the ultimate tragedy, the religious factor, in fact, which by obscuring the political and military vision of President Diem, led him to disaster. President Diem, in spite of, or beca use of, his religious asceticism, was in his political conduct greatly influenced by his brot her, the head of the secret poli ce, who did not hesitate to unleash a veritable religious persecuti on of monks, nuns and Buddhist leaders, as already seen. An even more potent religious f actor behind them was the fanatic ism of the third brother, the Archbishop of Hue. The Archbishop was the \"spiritual guide\" of both the head of the police and the president. It is no coincidence that the open flaring up of the religious war began in his See, in Hue. The Archbishop was the driving power behind the sy stematically mounting religious discrimination against the Buddhists. Supporting the Archbishop was Pope Pius XII. The similarity between the fanatical Catholic Pres ident of South Vietnam and the Archbishop of Hue, and Croatian Dictator Ante Pavelic and the Archbi shop of Zagreb, could not be more striking. Thus, whereas the political and military machinery cont rolled by the South Vietnamese and Croatian dictators was put at the disposal of the Catholic Church, the Cathol ic Church put her spiritual and"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"ecclesiastical machinery at the disposal of the two dictators, who made everyone and everything subordinate to her religious a nd political totalitarianism. Both Diem and Pavelic, aided by their respec tive Archbishops, pursu ed three objectives simultaneously: (a) the annihilation of a polit ical enemy, i.e. Communism; (b) as justification for th e annihilation of an enemy Church, i. e. the Orthodox Church in the case of Pavelic and Buddhism in the case of Diem; (c) the installation of Catholic religi ous and political tyranny in each country. Notwithstanding the different circum stances, and geographical and cultur al backgrounds characteristic of Croatia and South Vietnam, the pattern and ul timate goal pursued by the two Regimes was exactly the same: anything and anyone not conforming or submitting to Catholicism was to be ruthlessly destroyed via arrest, persecution, co ncentration camps and executions. With the result that, by relegating th e interests of their country to th e background, so as to further the interests of their religion, both dictators finally brought their la nds into the abyss. In the case of President Diem, when he put Catholic ism first, he alienated the vast majority of the South Vietnamese masses and of the South Viet namese army who, it must be remembered, were Buddhists and on the whole supported him politically. Th is brought the collapse of the anti-Communist front upon which Diem's policy stood. The chaos which ensued in its turn set in motion USA military intervention. The South Vietnamese and Croatian Ca tholic dictatorships, therefore, are the most striking examples of how the spirit of Catholicism can stultify the mo st diverse political systems and cultures with the bacillae of intolerance. It cannot be otherwise. Since her claims to uniqueness and hence to religious supremacy will be identified with those who are ready to accept them as basic truths upon which the fabric of society must rest. An Eskimo and a Central African or, in our cas e, a Croat and a South Vietnamese, therefore, notwithstanding all their racial and cultural differences , by the very fact that they are members of the same anti-libertarian Church, will automa tically scorn democracy and abhor freedom. The import of this is portentous. The implication bei ng that the Catholic Church is potentially capable of carrying out the ghastly experiments of both Croatia and South Vietna m in other countries, independently of their political systems. Which means that, given the favourable circumstances, she would not hesitate to repeat them anywhere in the world, wherever there are Catholics. And, since there are Cat holics in practically every country, the risk of another Croatian or South Vietnamese \"experiment\" in th e near or distant future, becomes not a theoretical speculation. But a possibility."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"In the case of Vietnam, the role played by the Catholic Church has been paramount. Not only during the conflict, but also duri ng the agonizing period of its termination. It was then that the Vatican struck a deal with the Communists of the North, while th e USA went on fighting.

The consecration of the United Communist Vietnam was done by good Pope John XXIII, and seconded by Pope Paul VI.

The strength and the weakness of th e Catholic Church is her unshakable belief that she is the ONLY repositor of Truth; since it is the right of truth to eliminate error, it follows that it is her duty to eliminate anything which is not consonant with Truth , namely with HER truth. Because there cannot be two truths, any truth which is not hers are ipso facto errors. Because truth has the right to eliminate error, it is the duty of the Catholic Church to oppose and annihilate the latter. That means that she is empowered to use any means, persuasion if possible but force if necessary, to prevent error from opposing trut h; that is to oppose her Truth . Her logic is faultlessly uncompromising, hence her dogmatism, both theological and operational. These have not been confined to abstractions, mora l issues, or eschatological speculations. They have trespassed into the fields of concrete policies an d have permeated her conduct from the beginning. As soon as Constantine gave official recognition as a religion, she star ted to harass both Christians and non-Christians, who were not conson ant with her. Her harassment of those not conforming with her commenced as early as the Fourth Century AD. Such behaviour became a tradition. It lasted and pr ogressed for more than a thousand years. The apex of her intolerance eventually became epitomized by the Inquisiti on. The latter, in the Spanish Inquisition, which terrorized the whole of Europe for more than five centuries. Her claims of being the ONLY holde r of truth, the fountain-spring of her historic intolerance, has never been revoked by her. She has maintained it with ever increasing resoluti on and ferocity until our own days. All her past actions be speak of the constancy of such immutable intolerance. Since the Fourth Century AD her conduct has been patterned on nothing else. The immutability of her resolv e to compel everything and ev erybody to accept her belief, is compounded by her other belief that it is her duty to save the souls of ALL CHRISTIANS. A charge which culminated with the other belief, extens ion of such Catholic salvation to all mankind. Hers is not a sporadic theologi cal caprice of overzealous individua ls. The Church has made it an official policy and objective of her own since the earliest times. Pope Innocent gave precise instru ctions to all Inquis itors to enforce such regulations throughout Europe. Eventually it was made Statute Law. The regul ar clergy proved reluctan t, so the Popes turned to the most fanatical, intolerant and narrow-minde d section of the Church structure, the sundry monastic orders. The two which excelled in their infamous task were the Dominicans and the Franciscans. Armed with practically unlimited power from the Popes, these I nquisitors swarmed all over Europe like theological hornets, setting up tribunals wherever they appeared."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Soon individuals, communities, nations, and indeed, th e very hierarchy trembled at the mere mention of their names. Wherever they came, denunciations , accusations, treachery, perjury, torture, woe and death resulted. The hooded Inquisitors did not content themselves with establishing their court in the sundry lands of Europe. Pope Gregory IX appoint ed a Dominican Grand Inquisitor for the whole of Armenia and Russia. Pope Urban VI ordered th e General of the Dominicans to a ppoint Inquisitors for Armenia, Greece and Tartary (China). Pope Nicholas IV asked the Patria rch of Jerusalem to create Inquisito rs from the mendicant friars in his land. Pope Gregory XI granted author ity to the Franciscan Provincial in the Holy Land to act as Chief Inquisitor in Syria, Pa lestine and even Egypt. When an Inquisitor arrived everybody was comma nded, in obedience to the Pope and to Mother Church, to disclose the name of anyone susp ected of the slightest deviation from the Faith . The Inquisitors issued a compelling threat and a promis e. A denouncer would get an indulgence of three years. Those avoiding their du ty would be excommunicated. Some denunciations were factual but many were concocted by veng eance, spite or jealousy. Those denounced, even on the flimsiest accusation or mere suspicion, would be arre sted and flung directly into prison. This usually was a common dungeon. Cold and damp, it lacked light or sanita tion, and contained cut- throats, thieves and the like. Among these the fr iars would plant spies to induce the accused, by pretended friendship, threats, or other methods, to admit his guilt. If this first step proved insufficient, the suspected heretic would be chained with heavy irons and left to starve in a dark, foul hole called the durus carcer —\"cruel prison.\" The accused was then brought before the inquisitorial tribunal composed of friars. If he asked the names of his accusers, he was told that only his judges had the right to know their names. He had no such right. He was asked to confess to his gui lt. If he pleaded innocence, he woul d be sent back to prison. On a second or third appearance before the Court, if he persisted he was put to torture. The whole purpose of his trial, of course, was to force a confession of heresy. Torture was inflicted without solid proof of guilt. Two complainer s or even one single accuser was sufficient for subjection to the agonies of torture, even if the accused man had, until then, been of unblemished character, pristine honesty and genuine piety. The methods, kinds and degrees of torture were endless. The thr ee basic ones employed were hoisting the man to the ceiling by his hands tied behind his back, breaking him on the ra ck, or greasing his feet and thrusting them into the fire. If, following all the exquisit e devices of torture, the heretic refused to recant or to admit his guilt, then the Inquisitors would pass capital sentence for he resy. To complete the macabre farce, the Holy Inquisitors would ask these same temporal powers, in the name of the Chur ch, not to kill the poor accused. This formality was a mere legalistic device to make the Church appear innocent of the blood which was about to be spilled—or rather, burned."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"The civil authorities could not heed this hypocritical plea, however, lest the Holy Inquisition fall upon them. Refusal to burn the heretic would have placed the temporal au thorities themselves on trial for their lives. For heresy, of course! Soon no one was safe from potential arrest. The spying, denunciation, and hunting down of heretics reached cleric or lay, men or women, noble or common. No one was immune from the terrorizing omnipresence of the Holy Inquisition. This reign of Catholic terror last ed for centuries. Hundreds of thousands of men, women, and yes, even children were murdered...burned alive at the stake. Simply because they dared to disagree with the Holy Catholic Church or with her Popes. This Vatican terror officially ended less than two hundred years ago. As recently as 1762 a Protestant pastor was condemned to death in France. Why? Si mply because he was a Protestant! By whom? By the Catholic Church! Yes, by that same church which now pretends to lo ve her \"dear separated brethren.\" Indeed, in Europe torture was still enforced by all the Tribunals of the Holy Inquisition until the last century, the Pope being forced to abolish it only in 1816. It was Napoleon, who entered Madrid in 1808, who wa s to abolish the Inquisition. When the Spanish Parliament in 1813 declared it incompa tible with the Cons titution, the Vatican protested . Super- Catholic Ferdinand VII restored it in 1814, with the full approval of the Church. The Holy Inquisition was finally suppressed by the Liberals in July, 1834. The Vatican protested for decades, because Spain had suppressed the Inquisition. Why? Because the Catholic Church was persuaded, as in the past , that she had the righ t to IMPOSE her truth. The belief, that it is still her duty to do so, is as alive today. It will remain so in the near and in the distant future. The apologists of the Church assured the contempor ary world that the horrors of the Inquisition will never be repeated, ever again. Bu t the Catholic State of Croati a proved them wrong. The attempted coup of Hungary, when Cardinal Mindszenty tried to se t up a totalitarian Catho lic State, proved them wrong. The Catholic terrorism of Vietnam proved th em wrong. The Catholic terrorism of Catholic Ireland proved them wrong. The Catholic Church's sudden espousing of Ecumenism was a classic device to make people forget that her basic spirit of intolerance is still within her. It must be remembered that if the Inquisition wa s banned, against her will, only during the middle of the last century, the Holy Office, its inspirer and instrument was \"abolished\" only a few years ago. In fact, that it is operating, disguised under a specious name, in the sile nt walls of the Vatican of today.

Since the contem porary world at large know very little about the true nature and the background religi ous intrigues of these two most re prehensible episodes of Catholic fanaticism. And this to such a degree that, unlike Hitler's and St alin's horrific concentration camps, the Croatian ones and the Buddhists self-immola tion in Vietnam, as a protest against the Vatican's religious terroristic interference, have already become taboos to the mass media of the world. A dangerous triumph of contemporary Catholic pre ssure and its ecumenical and political associates. Forgetfulness and, even more, ignorance are dangerous twin brothers in our turbulent world. Since they are the breeders of unscrupulous ideological and ecclesiastical intrigues, and thus of potential new Croatias and new Vietnams. The basic Catholic claims have never changed one si ngle iota. The Catholic Church's insistence about her own uniqueness has remained as gr anitically firm now, as it has always been. These are the same claims which produced the Inquisition, Croatia and the Catholic Dictatorship of Vietnam.

When His disciples wanted to call down fi re from Heaven on a city for not receiving Him, He sternly rebuked them: \"And they did not receive him, because his face was set to go to Jerusalem. And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou th at we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them, even as Elias did? But he turn ed and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them\" (Luke 9: 53-56). Again in the parable of the tares and the wheat Jesu s told His disciples to let the true and the false believers grow together until the harvest at the end of the world: \"Let both grow together until the harv est: and in the time of harvest I wi ll say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn\" (Matt. 13:30).

The State Department released a German document detailing the activities of Dinko Sakic, 76 who was arrested at his home south of Buenos Aires after Argentina received Croatia's formal request for his extradition to stand trial. The full death toll at the Jasenovac camp has not been determined. Se rbian politicians use figures of 600,000 to 700,000 Serbs, Jews and Gypsies, while Cr oatian President Franjo Tudjman speaks of 30,000. Until now, leaders of Zagreb's tiny Jewish community have used estimates of 80,000 to 100,000. In newspaper and television interviews, Sakic said he served in senior co mmand posts at the Jasenovac camp for three years and commander for one year. But he has denied that anyone died at the camp other than from illness. Meanwhile, Croatia's national archives has been unable to locate the gover nment's documentation on the Jasenovac camp except for three documents, accordi ng to Croatian press reports. Friday, the U.S. State Department welcomed Sakic's arrest and Croa tia's plan to put him on trial and, bearing in mind the missing documents, produced the first evidence from U.S. war crimes archives. The document, handed out to reporters, was a to p-secret December, 1943, German Wehrmacht report on senior officers of the Ustasha, the Croatian fascists, who took power in 1941 with support from Nazi Germany and fascist Italy. It said the first commander of the Jasenovac ca mp, Ustasha Maj. Max Luberic, had ordered 80,000 people executed at Alt-Gradiska, a subsidiary ca mp to Jasenovac, 120,000 at Jasenovac and 20,000 at other camps. The report called Lube ric a \"pathological personality\" who had personally taken part in the slaughters, \"a willing tool of the Poglavnik [Ust asha leader Ante Pavelic] capable of anything\" and \"the driving force for the bloody developments in Croatia.\" The German military, it said, \"has repeatedly called for Luberic's removal, but with out success.\" Shortly after the report was issued, Luberic was sent to Zagreb and Sakic took charge. Sakic had married Luberic's sister and, in an interview with the Zagreb weekly Magazin , in 1995, said he had been Luberic's \"most trusted and closest soldier.\" Sakic was named camp commander after Luberic.
