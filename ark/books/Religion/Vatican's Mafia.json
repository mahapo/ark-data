I dedicate this work of many years of philosophical, biblical theological, scientifical and historical investigation to all those which, as this servant, are seeking to know and discover for themselves what th e Vatican is, and if the Mafia really exists in her. It has been no easy matter to document oneself concerning the Vatican's Mafia, and to be able to prove it by the secret archives of the Catholic chu rch and Catholic governments and civil just ice tribuna ls. The fear of Satanic reprisal always subjects one to having to live in fear and hiding from Catholic fanaticism, which through the centuries the Vatican has utilized against her opposers and the Christian reformers. It has cost this Servidor a whole life. But the Lord takes care of me and keeps his angles.

It has been possible to single out through history such famous criminals as Al Capo, etc.. The untouchables appear in films, and voluminous books have been wri tten which always aquaint these Mafias with the Vatican' s Sacred Mafia. For that reason, I invite the lector to read the following books and authors so he can know, in his doubts, the true history and the reality of the Vat ican's Mafia.

We should review the papacy's history as written by true uncensured historians. I repeat a thousand tim es that history has been satanically falsified. I urge you to find out what Christianism is and what Catholicism is. That is, one a church of christ, and the other of t he Pope(s). One is celestial with Christian spiritual values. The other values a church of Romanism. Therefore, we can be sure that the leaders of the M afia are the Pope. Of the 299 popes, which falsely appea r as being from Peter to John Paul II, it can be prov ed historically that 146 are rich aristocrats which al lowed themselves to be suborned; 72 died violently, eithe r poisoned or assassinated; 26 were proven homosexuals; 28 died while bearing arms, as well as their cardinals and bishops.

They will never accept Rome's theological and biblical errors; even though Rome wants to appear, with their Scholastic arguments, as if they are going to correct them. They have demonstrated through (the) centuries of ecumenical councils that , at the hour of truth, everything they decree and write is a LIE. The Christian Mexican author Dr. Luis Rodriguez, in his book \"Ecumenism,\" 1969, dedicated to all sincer e evangelicals and Catholics who want to know the truth, tells us the reality of the ecumenism which the Vatican and her agencies and Catholic churches want to impose.

The sciences of the study of biology and th eir effects on human beings their necessary conduct and the laws which correspond to them can not be mutilated, and less in the name of a religion in wh ich God prohibits all sexual degeneration."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"The Vatican Mafia 111 GENERAL CONCLUSIONS Investigate the pages of the history of Christianit y, and even the very history of Catholicism, we find a ple yade of writers which have wanted to reform the Vatican and consequently her Catholic Churches, Hierarchies , Priests and monks. These writers have been persecut ed and their writings excommunicated and ignored by th e majority of Catholics: They have wanted to destroy the Vatican's Mafia. But they have been assassinated an d their voices silenced. I have not the space in my b rief articles to include so many Christian authors and teachers which, as this servant, have wanted to cor rect the corruption of Catholicism biblically, historica lly, theologically and morally. For the Vatican and her Roman Churches have apostasized so much from authentic Christianity that today, in the 21th cent ury, there remains little Christianity in Catholicism: I t has converted itself in a Political party of National Catholicism, A Fascist Dictatorship and powerful Terrestrial Empire which for almost two millenniums has been accumulating incommensurable riches of gold, real estate, lands, jewels etc . . . To help you document yourself and understand the truth about th is Catholic Corruption, I recommend the following books: 1, The writings and books of reformers who have existed from the foundation of the Christian Church in the first Century. 2. The Evangelical counsels and teachings of Jesus Christ as found in the four gospels and apostolic epistles: you will find the fraternal corrections to the pagan and judaic devia tions of the first Christian Communities. 3. The writings of apologists of both the East and the West in the Ecumenical counils since the second century. 4. The"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"112 Monsenor Rafael Rodriguez Guillen writings of Middle Age writers who wrote against th a false scholasticism and resurgence of the monasteri es and founders of Christian ascetism and Mysticism, who separated themselves from Rome and lived according to Monastic rules. Disgracefully, papal astuteness martyred their founders whenever they criticized the Vatican's corruption and preached Salvation through Christ alone, and not through Pet er the Vatican's rock and foundation. 5. The dozens of writers of the Protestant Reformation. One should at least read the selection of Martin Luther's writings on the corruption to which the Vatican had degenerated, which John Dillenberge r writes about. And above all, the book \"The Freedom of Christians,\" called from the captivity of Babylo n. 6. The book \"Protestantism ,\" edited by J. Leslie Dunstan, about the true history of the Reformation. 7.\"The Reformation of the Sixteenth Century,\" writt en by Roland H. Bainton. 8. \"Paganism in Christianity,\" by Charles Edgar Pra tt. 9. \"We know Roman Catholicism\" (in Spanish), written by Rick Jones. All these writers, intellect uals, philosophers, theologians, historians,encyclopedist s, and humanists are prohibited in the \"INDEX VATICANUM\" for telling the truth and criticizing th e Vatican's corruption. Theirlectures are prohibited and excommunicated in the INDEX. I insert a list at the end of this book of Vaticanologists who, as this servant, write about t he Vaticn's Mafia. You shall be able to better underst and my affirmations and proffs."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"The Vatican Mafia 113 EPILOGUE My job of investigating the existence of the Vatica n's Mafia I have based on the light of history and on m any Catholic writers who have been excommunicated and persecuted, as this servant, for presenting the rea lity of the Vatican's dark side, which is still unknown. I may appear to be an enemy of the Catholic Church and to infer uneasiness to the millions who believe in the papal divinity and sublime esteem of their clergy, but I am their friend, and my books are a zeal to reform their apostasies away from Jesus Christ message of Salvation; and to rest ore a Catholic Church which has deviated from Christianit y and its biblical teachings by her Catholic canons and d ogmas, which lead her astray Satanically from authentic Christianity. The false history that we have been t aught for centuries about the Vatican and her popes, Cardinal s bishops and priests is why we could never have susp ected the decay of the corrupt government which directs u s. For that reason, I want to finalize my conclusions by recommending Peter de la Rosa's book 'Vicars of Chr ist the Dark Side of the Papacy,\" and David A Yallop's \"In God's Name.\" wherein the Vatican's Mafia's power ar e documented through more than 800 pages. We are offe red the opportunity to know a forbidden and silenced re ality, with the luxury of details, names, dates, Mafioso personages and photographs. They could help you understand my investigation and those of other Vati canist writers. I attach Photos of the Vatican's Mafia on the cover to expose to public forum the true image of J ohn Paul II complicated with and surrounded by the Mafi a, which always accompanies him during his voyages. Di d you know it exists? I discovered it at 73 years old : THE VATICAN'S MAFIA."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"114 Monsenor Rafael Rodriguez Guillen BIBLIOGRAPHY 1.
