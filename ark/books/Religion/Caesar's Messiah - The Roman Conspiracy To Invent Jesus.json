For a number of reasons, however, I did n ot share this cer- tainty. There were many gods worshiped during Jesus ' era that are now seen as fictitious, and no archeological eviden ce of his exis- tence has ever been found. What contributed most to my skepticism was that at the exact time when the followers of Je sus were pur- portedly organizing themselves into a religion that urged its mem- bers to \"turn the other cheek\" and to \"give to Caes ar what is Cae- sar's,\" another Judean sect was waging a religious war against the Romans. This sect, the Sicarii, also believed in th e coming of a Mes- siah, but not one who advocated peace. They sought a Messiah who would lead them militarily. It seemed implausible t hat two diamet- rically opposite forms of messianic Judaism would h ave emerged from Judea at the same time. This is why the Dead Sea Scrolls were of such inter est to me, and I began what turned into a decade-long study of them. Like so many others, I was hoping to learn something of Chr istianity's ori- gins in the 2,000-year-old documents found at Qumra n. I also began studying the other two major works fro m this era, the New Testament and War of the Jews by Flavius Jo sephus, an adopted member of the imperial family; I hoped to d etermine how the Scrolls related to them. While reading these tw o works side by side, I noticed a connection between them.

My ef forts to understand this relationship led me to uncover the amazing sec ret that is the subject of this book: This imperial family, the Fla vians, created Christianity, and, even more incredibly, they incor porated a skillful satire of the Jews in the Gospels and War of the Je ws to inform pos- terity of this fact. The Flavian dynasty lasted from 69 to 96 C.E., the period when most scholars believe the Gospels were written. It consisted of three Caesars: Vespasian and his two sons, Titus and Domi tian. Flavius Josephus, the adopted member of the family who wrot e War of the Jews, was their official historian. The satire they created is difficult to see. If it were otherwise, it would not have remained unnoticed for two millennia . However, as readers may judge for themselves, the path that the Flavians left for us is a clear one. All that is really needed to wal k down it is an open mind. But why then has the satirical relationship b etween Jesus and Titus not been noticed before? This question is esp ecially apt in light of the fact that the works that reveal their satire —the New Testa- ment and the histories of Josephus—are perhaps the most scruti- nized books in literature. The only explanation I can offer is that viewing th e Gospels as satire—that is, as a literary composition (as oppos ed to a history) in which human folly is held up to ridicule—requires t he reader to contradict a deeply ingrained belief. Once Jesus wa s universally established as a world-historical individual, any o ther possibility became, evidentially, invisible. The more we believ ed in Jesus as a world-historical figure, the less we were able to u nderstand him in any other way. To understand why the Flavians decided to create Ch ristianity, one needs to understand the political conditions th at the family faced in Judea in 74 C.E., following their defeat o f the Sicarii, a movement of messianic Jews. The process that ultimately led to the Flavians' co ntrol over Judea was part of a broader and longer struggle, th at between Juda- ism and Hellenism. Judaism, which was based upon mo notheism"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Introduction 3 and faith, was simply incompatible with Hellenism, the Greek cul- ture that promoted polytheism and rationalism. Hellenism spread into Judea after Alexander the Gre at con- quered the area, in 333 B.C.E. Alexander and his su ccessors estab- lished cities throughout their empire to act as cen ters of commerce and administration. They set up more than 30 Greek cities within Judea itself. The people of Judea, in spite of thei r historical resist- ance to outside influences, began to incorporate ce rtain traits of the Greek ruling class into their culture. Many Semites found it desir- able, if not necessary, to speak Greek. Wealthy Jew s sought a Greek education for their young men. Gymnasia introduced Jewish stu- dents to Greek myths, sports, music, and arts. The Seleucids, descendants of Seleucus, the command er of Alex- ander's elite guard, gained control over the region from the Ptolemies, the descendants of another of Alexander's generals, in 200 B.C.E. When Antiochus IV (or as he preferred, Epiphanes—th at is, god manifest) became the Seleucid ruler in 169 B.C.E., he began Judea's nightmare. Antiochus was openly contemptuous of Judaism and wa nted to modernize Jewish religion and culture. He installed high priests who were supportive of his policies. When a rebellion a gainst Helleniza- tion broke out, in 168 B.C.E., Antiochus ordered hi s army to attack Jerusalem. Second Maccabees records the number of J ews slain in the battle as 40,000, with another 40,000 taken cap tive and enslaved. Antiochus emptied the temple of its treasury, viola ted the holy of holies, and intensified his policy of Hellenizat ion. He ordered the observances of the Hebrew cult be replaced with Hel lenistic wor- ship. He banned circumcision and sacrifice, institu ted a monthly observance of his birthday, and placed a statue of Zeus on the Tem- ple Mount. In 167 B.C.E., the Maccabees, a family of religious ly zealous Jews, led a revolution against Antiochus' impositio n of Hellenistic customs and religions. They sought to restore to po wer the religion that they believed was mandated by God in his holy land. The Mac- cabees compelled the inhabitants of the cities they conquered to convert to Judaism.

After a 20-year struggle, the Maccabees eventu- ally prevailed against the Seleucids. To quote 1 Ma ccabees, \"the yoke of the Gentiles was removed from Israel\" (13:41). Though the Maccabees went on to rule Israel for mor e than 100 years, their kingdom was never secure. The Seleucid threat to the region was replaced by an even greater one from Rom e. Roman expansionism and Hellenistic culture constantly thr eatened to engulf the religious state that the Maccabees had e stablished. In 65 B.C.E., a civil war broke out between two Maccabean rivals for the throne. It was at this time that Antipater the Edom ite, the wily father of Herod, appeared on the scene. Antipater helped b ring about a Roman intervention in the civil war, and when Pompe y sent his legate Scaurus into Judea with a Roman army, it mar ked the begin- ning of the end of the Maccabean religious state. For the next 30 years (65-37 B.C.E.), Judea suffere d through one war after another. In 40 B.C.E., the last Macca bean ruler, Mat- tathias Antigonus, seized control of the country. B y this time, how- ever, the Herodian family was firmly established as Rome's surrogate in the region and, with Roman support, defeated Mat tathias' army and gained control of Judea. Following the destruction of the Maccabean state, t he Sicarii, a new movement against Roman and Herodian control, em erged. This was a movement of lower-class Jews, originally call ed Zealots, who continued the Maccabees' religious struggle against the control of Judea by outsiders and sought to restore \"Eretz Isr ael.\" The efforts of the Sicarii reached a climax in 66 C .E. when they succeeded in driving the Roman forces from the coun try. The Emperor Nero ordered Vespasian to enter Judea with a large army and end the revolt. The violent struggle that ensue d left the country devastated and concluded when Rome captured Masada in 73 C.E. In the midst of the Judean war, forces loyal to the Flavian fam- ily in Rome revolted against the last of the Julio- Claudian emperors, Vitellius, and seized the capital. Vespasian return ed to Rome to be proclaimed emperor, leaving his son Titus in Judea to finish off the rebels. Following the war, the Flavians shared control over this region between Egypt and Syria with two families of powerf ul Hellenized"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Introduction 5 Jews: the Herods and the Alexanders. These three fa milies shared a common financial interest in preventing any future revolts. They also shared a long-standing and intricate personal relationship that can be traced to the household of Antonia, the moth er of the Emperor Claudius. Antonia employed Julius Alexander Lysimarchus, the abalarch, or ruler, of the Jews of Alexandria, as her financial steward in around 45 C.E. Julius was the elder brother of the famous Jewish p hilosopher Philo Judeaus, the leading intellectual figure of H ellenistic Judaism. Philo's writings attempted to merge Judaism with Pl atonic philoso- phy. Scholars believe that his work provided the au thors of the Gospels with some of their religious and philosophi cal perspective. Antonia's private secretary, Caenis, was also the l ong-term mis- tress of Vespasian. Julius Alexander Lysimarchus an d Vespasian would therefore have known one another through thei r shared con- nection with the household of Antonia. Julius had two sons. The elder, Marcus, married Her od's niece Bernice as a teenager, creating a bond between the Alexanders and the Herods, the Roman-sponsored ruling family of Ju dea. Marcus died young and Bernice eventually became the mistress of Vespasian's son Titus. Bernice thereby connected the Flavians and t he Alexanders, the family of her first husband, to her family, the Herods. Julius' younger son, Tiberius Alexander, was anothe r important link between the families. He inherited his father' s entire estate after the death of his brother Marcus, making him one of the richest men in the world. He renounced Judaism and assisted the Flavians with their war against the Jews, contributing both money and troops, as did the Herodian family. Tiberius was the first to publicly declare his allegiance to Vespasian as emperor and thereby help ed begin the Fla- vian dynasty. When Vespasian returned to Rome to as sume the man- tle of emperor, he left Tiberius behind to assist h is son Titus with the destruction of Jerusalem. Though the three families had been able to put down the revolt, they still faced a potential threat. Many Jews cont inued to believe that God would send a Messiah, a son of David, who would lead them against the enemies of Judea. Flavius Josephus records that what had \"most elevated\" the Sicarii to fight again st Rome was their"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"6 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH belief that God would send a Messiah to Israel who would lead his faithful to military victory. Though the Flavians, Herods, and Alexan- ders had ended the Jewish revolt, the families had not destroyed the messianic religion of the Jewish rebels. The famili es needed to find a way to prevent the Zealots from inspiring future uprisings through their belief in a coming warrior Messiah. Then someone from within this circle had an inspira tion, one that changed history. The way to tame messianic Jud aism would be to simply transform it into a religion that would c ooperate with the Roman Empire. To achieve this goal would require a new type of messianic literature. Thus, what we know as the Chr istian Gospels were created. In a convergence unique in history, the Flavians, H erods, and Alexanders brought together the elements necessary for the creation and implementation of Christianity. They had the fi nancial motiva- tion to replace the militaristic religion of the Si carii, the expertise in Judaism and philosophy necessary to create the Gosp els, and the knowledge and bureaucracy required to implement a r eligion (the Flavians created and maintained a number of religio ns other than Christianity). Moreover, these families were the ab solute rulers over the territories where the first Christian congregat ions began. To produce the Gospels required a deep understandin g of Judaic literature. The Gospels would not simply replace th e literature of the old religion, but would be written in such a way as to demonstrate that Christianity was the fulfillment of the prophe cies of Judaism and had therefore grown directly from it. To achiev e these effects, the Flavian intellectuals made use of a technique u sed throughout Judaic literature—typology. In its most basic sense typology is sim- ply the use of prior events to provide form and con text for subse- quent ones. If one sits for a painting, for example , he or she is the \"type\" of the painting, the thing it was based upon . Typology is used throughout Judaic literature as a way of transferri ng information and meaning from one story to another. For example, the Book of Esther uses type scenes from the story of Joseph in the Book of Gen- esis, so that the alert reader will understand that Esther and Morde- cai are repeating the role of Joseph as an agent of God."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Introduction 7 JOSEPH Rises to high position in the Egyptian government through his beauty and wisdom Josephs good deed (interpreting the butler's dream) is forgotten for a long time A character refuses to listen— \"she spoke to Joseph every day but he refused to listen\" (Gen 38:10) Pharaoh's chief servant is hanged Joseph reveals his identity to Pharaoh after a feast ESTHER/MORDECAI Esther rises to high position in the Persian government through her beauty and wisdom Mordecai's good deed (saving the king's life) is forgotten for a long time Character refuses to listen— \"they told him every day but he refused to listen\" (Est. 3:4) The king's chief servant is hanged Esther reveals her identity to the king after a feast The authors of the Gospels used typology to create the impres- sion that events from the lives of prior Hebrew pro phets were types of events from Jesus' life. In doing so, they were trying to convince their readers that their story of Jesus was a conti nuation of the divine relationship that existed between the Hebrew prophe ts and God. At the very beginning of the Gospels, the authors c reated a crys- tal-clear typological relationship between Jesus an d Moses. The authors placed this sequence at the beginning of th eir work to show the reader how the real meaning of the New Testamen t will be revealed. The sequence begins in Matthew 2:13, where Joseph i s described as bringing Jesus, who represents the \"new Israel,\" down to Egypt. This event parallels Genesis 45-50, where a previou s Joseph brought the \"old Israel\" down to Egypt. The authors of the Gospels associated their Joseph with the prior one by means of more than just a shared name and a journey to Egypt. The New Testament Joseph is described, li ke his counter- part in the Hebrew Bible, as a dreamer of dreams an d as having encounters with a star and wise men."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"8 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH Both stories regarding the journey of a Joseph to E gypt are immediately followed by a description of a massacre of innocents. The stories concerning the massacre of innocents ar e not exactly parallel. Jesus is not, for example, saved by being put in a boat on the river Jordan and then by being adopted by Herod 's daughter. The typology used within Judaic literature does not req uire verbatim quotations or descriptions; rather, the author take s only enough information from the event that is being used as th e type to allow the reader to recognize that the prior event relate s to the one being described. In this case, each massacre of the innoc ents' story depicts young children being slaughtered by a fearful tyran t, but the future savior of Israel being saved. The authors of the New Testament then continue mirr oring Exodus by having an angel tell Joseph, \"They are de ad which sought the young child's life\" (Matt. 2:20). This statemen t is a clear parallel to the statement made to Moses, the first savior of Israel, in Exodus 12: \"All the men are dead which sought thy life.\" T he parallels then continue with Jesus receiving a baptism (Matt. 3:13 ), which mirrors the baptism of the Israelites described in Exodus 1 4. Next, Jesus spends 40 days in the desert, which parallels the 4 0 years the Israelites spend in the wilderness. Both sojourns i n the desert involve three sets of temptations. In Exodus, it is God who is tempted; in the Gospels, it is Jesus, the son of Go d. In Exodus, it is the Israelites who tempt God. They first tempt him by asking for bread, at which time they learn t hat \"man does not live by bread alone\" (Ex. 16). The second time is a t Massah, where they are told to not \"tempt the Lord\" (Ex. 17). On the third occa- sion, when they make the golden calf at Mount Sinai (Ex. 32), they learn to \"fear the Lord thy God and serve only him. \" Jesus' three temptations are by the devil and are a mirror of God's temptations by the Israelites, as his respons es show. To his first temptation (Matt. 4:4) he replies, \"Man shall not l ive by bread alone.\" To the second (Matt. 4:7) he replies, \"Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.\" And to the third (Matt. 4:10) he replies, \"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and only him shalt thou serve.\" Though the parallels between Jesus and Moses are ty pological and not verbatim, the sequence in which these event s occur is.

What has not been widely recognized is that the story also revea ls the political per- spective of the authors of the New Testament. In th e Hebrew Bible it is the Israelites who tempt God, but notice that th e devil takes their place in the parallel New Testament story. This equ ating of the Israelites with the devil is consistent with what t he Flavians thought of the messianic Jews, that they were demons. Moreover, the parallel sequences demonstrate that t he Gospels were designed to be read intertextually, that is, i n direct relationship to the other books of the Bible. This is the only w ay that literature based on types can be understood. In other words, a s the example concerning Jesus' infancy illustrates, to understan d the Gospels' meaning a reader must recognize that the concepts, sequences, and locations in Matthew are parallel to the concepts, sequences, and locations in Genesis and Exodus, where their contex t has already been established. By using scenes from Judaic literature as types for events in Jesus' ministry, the authors hoped to convince thei r readers that the Gospels were a continuation of the Hebrew literatur e that had inspired the Sicarii to revolt and that, therefore, Jesus was the Mes- siah whom the rebels were hoping God would send the m.

Further, the Messiah was not the xeno phobic military leader that the Sicarii were expecting, but rather a multiculturist who urged his followers to \"turn the other cheek.\" If the Gospels achieved only the replacement of the militaristic messianic movement with a pacifistic one, they woul d have been one of the most successful pieces of propaganda in history. But the authors wanted even more. They wanted not merely to pacify the religious warriors of Judea but to make them worshi p Caesar as a god. And they wanted to inform posterity that they had done so. The populations of the Roman provinces were permitt ed to worship in any way they wished, with one exception; they had to allow Caesar to be worshiped in their temples. This was incompati- ble with monotheistic Judaism. At the end of the 66 -73 C.E. war Flavius Josephus recorded that no matter how Titus tortured the Sicarii, they refused to call him \"Lord.\" To circum vent the Jews' reli- gious stubbornness, the Flavians therefore created a religion that worshiped Caesar without its followers knowing it. To achieve this, they used the same typological met hod they had used to link Jesus to Moses, creating parallel conc epts, sequences, and locations. They created Jesus' entire ministry as a \"type\" of the military campaign of Titus. In other words, events from Jesus' min- istry parallel events from Titus' campaign. To prov e that these typo- logical scenes were not accidental, the authors pla ced them in the same sequence and in the same locations in the Gosp els as they had occurred in Titus' campaign. The parallel scenes were designed to create another story line than the one that appears on the surface. This typo logical story line reveals that the Jesus who interacted with the disc iples following the crucifixion, the actual Jesus that Christians have unwittingly wor- shiped for 2,000 years, was Titus Flavius. The discovery of the Flavian invention of Christian ity creates a new understanding of the entire first century C.E. Such a revelation is disorienting, and the reader will find the follo wing points useful in understanding the new history that this work pre sents. • Christianity did not originate among the lower cl asses in Judea.

I shall show that i ntellectuals working for Titus Flavius, the second of the three Flavian Caesars, created Christianity. Their main purpose was to rep lace the xeno- phobic Jewish messianism that waged war against the Roman Empire with a version of Judaism that would be obedient to Rome. One of the individuals involved with the creation o f the Gospels was the first-century historian Flavius Josephus, w ho, as he relates it, led a fabulous life. He was born in 37 C.E. int o the royal family of Judea, the Maccabees. Like Jesus, Josephus was a child prodigy who astounded his elders with his knowledge of Juda ic law. Jose- phus also claimed to have been a member of each of the Jewish sects of his era, the Sadduccees, the Pharisees, and the Essenes. When the Jewish rebellion against Rome broke out, i n 66 C.E., though he had no described military background and believed the cause hopeless, Josephus was given command of the r evolutionary army of Galilee. Taken captive, he was brought befo re the Roman general Vespasian, to whom he presented himself as a prophet. At this point, God, rather conveniently, spoke to Jose phus and informed him that his favor had switched from the Jews to th e Romans. Jose- phus then claimed that Judaism's messianic propheci es foresaw not a Jewish Messiah, but Vespasian, whom Josephus pred icted would become the \"lord of all mankind.\" After this came to pass, so to speak, and Vespasian was pro- claimed emperor, he rewarded Josephus' clairvoyance by adopting him. Thus, the Jewish rebel Josephus bar Mattathias became Flavius 12"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The First Christians and the Flavians 13 Josephus, the son of Caesar. He became an ardent su pporter of Rome's conquest of Judea, and when Vespasian return ed to Rome to be crowned emperor, Josephus stayed behind to assis t the new emperor's son Titus with the siege of Jerusalem. Once the city had been destroyed, Josephus took up residence within the Flavian court at Rome, where he enjoyed the patronage of Vespasian and the subsequent Flavian emperors, T itus and Domitian. It was while he was living in Rome that J osephus wrote his two major works, War of the Jews, a description of the 66-73 C.E. war between the Romans and the Jews, and Jewish Ant iquities, a his- tory of the Jewish people. Josephus' histories are of great significance to Ch ristianity. Vir- tually all that we know regarding the social contex t of the New Tes- tament is derived from them. Without these works, t he very dating of the events of the New Testament would be impossi ble. Josephus' histories provided Jesus with historical documenta- tion, a fact that is widely known. They also provid ed Jesus with another kind of documentation, a fact largely forgo tten. Early Chris- tians believed that the events Josephus described i n War of the Jews proved that Jesus had been able to see into the fut ure. It is difficult to find even one early Christian who taught another position. Church scholars such as Tertullian, Justin Martyr, and Cyprian were unanimous in proclaiming that Josephus' description of the con- quest of Judea by Titus Flavius in War of the Jews proved that Jesus' prophecies had come to pass. As Eusebius wrote in 3 25 C.E.: If any one compares the words of our Saviour with t he other accounts of the historian [Josephus] concerning the whole war, how can one fail to wonder, and to admit that the fore- knowledge and the prophecy of our Saviour were trul y divine and marvelously Strange. 2 One example of the foreknowledge that so impressed Eusebius was Jesus' prediction that the foes of Jerusalem wo uld encircle it with a wall, demolish the city and its temple, and level its inhabitants. And when He was now getting near Jerusalem . . . He came into full view of the city, He wept aloud o ver it, and exclaimed,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"14 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH For the time is coming upon thee when thy foes will throw up around thee earthworks and a wall, investi ng thee and hemming thee in on every side, and level you an d your children within you, and they will not leave one st one upon another in you; because you did not know the time o f your visitation. Luke 19:37-43 Josephus recorded in War of the Jews that all the p recise details Jesus foresaw for Jerusalem did indeed come to pass . Titus ordered his soldiers to \"build a wall round about the whole city.\" 3 Titus, like Jesus, saw the encircling of the city as an event s anctioned by God, who inspired his soldiers with a \"divine fury.\" Josephus also recorded that Titus did not merely bu rn Jerusalem and defile its temple, but ordered that they should be left exactly as Jesus has foreseen, with \"not one stone upon anothe r.\" [Titus] gave orders that they should now demolish t he entire city and Temple . . . 4 Jesus stated that these calamities would befall Jer usalem's inhab- itants because they did not know the \"time of your visitation.\" The coming visitation was to be made by someone he call ed the \"Son of Man,\" a title used by the prophet Daniel for the Je wish Messiah. 3 While it has been universally believed that Jesus w as referring to himself when he used the expression the \"Son of Man ,\" he usually spoke of this individual in the third person and no t as himself. Jesus repeatedly warned the Jews that during the Vi sitation of the Son of Man various disasters, like those he foresaw above, would occur.

I tell you in solemn truth that the present generat ion will certainly not pass away without all these thin gs having first taken place. Matt. 24:33-34 Jews of this era saw a generation as lasting 40 yea rs, so Titus' destruction of Jerusalem in 70 C.E. fit perfectly i nto the time frame Jesus gave in his prophecy. However, while Jesus di d accurately pre- dict events from the coming war, there was a flaw i n his foreknowl- edge—that is, that the person whose visitation actu ally brought about the destruction of Jerusalem was not Jesus bu t Titus Flavius.

There was little written between the fifth and the 15 th centuries commenting on the numerous parallels between the ev ents Josephus recorded in War of the Jews and Jesus' predictions. This is not sur- prising, as the church is known to have actively di scouraged scrip- tural analysis during this time. What evidence was left, however, suggests that during the entire Middle Ages Christi ans viewed Jose- phus' depiction of the war between the Romans and t he Jews as proof of Christ's divinity. Icons, carvings on caskets, a nd religious paint- ings from this era all portrayed the 70 C.E. destru ction of Jerusalem as the fulfillment of Jesus' doomsday prophecy. The importance of Josephus' works to Christians dur ing this period can also be gauged by the fact that some of the Eastern Chris- tian churches of Syria and Armenia actually include d his books as part of their handwritten Bible.

Newton's position was the same as Eusebius'. Both s cholars believed that Josephus \"designed nothing less\" than to honestly record the war between the Romans and the Jews. The events that Josephus recorded seemed to be the fulfillment of Jesus' pro phecy and did not strike them as in any way suspicious. On the contra ry, they saw the relationship between the two works as proof of Jesu s' divinity. They were in no way unusual in holding this view; it was held by the majority of Christian scholars until the end of the 19th century. The belief that Josephus' depiction of the destruct ion of Jerusalem proved that Jesus had seen into the futur e was largely for- gotten during the 20th century. Only one denominati on of Chris- tians, the Preterists, still cites the parallels be tween War of the Jews and the New Testament as a proof of Jesus' divinity . Currently, most Christians either believe that the apocalypse Jesus envisioned has not yet occurred or they ignore these prophesies al together. As Chris- tianity's third millennium begins, few of its membe rs are even aware of the parallels that were once of such importance to the religion. However, I believe that Eusebius was correct in sta ting that when one compares War of the Jews to the New Testam ent, one must admit to a relationship that, if not divine, is at the least strange.

Of course, before accepting any phenomenon as miraculous, one should first determine if a nonsupernatural explanation for it e xists. The pur- pose of this work is to present such an explanation . All scholars have faced the same difficulty in tryi ng to under- stand first-century Judea: a lack of source materia l. Before the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered, the important literatu re describing first- hand the events of first-century Judea were the New Testament and the works of Josephus. For two millennia, only thes e two works illu- minated an era so seminal to Western civilization. This absence is unusual. In Greece, thousands of pi eces of writing from the same era have been discovered. Jesus const antly complained about scribes, who, one must assume, were writing s omething. Jesus began to explain to His disciples that He mus t go to Jerusalem, and suffer much cruelty from the Elders and the High Priests and the Scribes. Matt. 16:21.30 Rome's occupation of Judea spanned the entire first century. Josephus records that during this period a movement of Jewish Zealots called the Sicarii continually staged insur rections against the Empire and its surrogate, the family of Herod. The Sicarii, like the Christians, were messianic and looked forward to th e arrival of the son of God, who would lead them against Rome. Josep hus dates the origin of this messianic movement to the census of Quirinus, curi- ously also given in the Gospels as the date of the birth of Christ. This movement existed for over 100 years, but until the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered, no document that could possibly ha ve been part of its literature had ever been found. The literature of the Sicarii movement is most like ly missing because the Romans destroyed it. A number of the De ad Sea Scrolls (found hidden in caves) describe an uncompromising sect that awaited a Messiah who would be a military leader.

The only works to have survived this century of rel igious war- fare, the Gospels and the histories of Josephus, ha d a pro-Roman perspective. In the case of Josephus' histories thi s is hardly surpris- ing, as he was an adopted member of the imperial fa mily. It is notable, however, that the New Testament also has a point of view positive to the Romans. The first century was not a time when one would expect that a Judaic cult with a viewpoint fa vorable to the Empire would have emerged. Yet the New Testament te xts never portray Roman soldiers in a negative light, and act ually describe them as \"devout\" and God-fearing. There was a certain man in Caesarea called Corneliu s, a centurion of the band called the Italian band, a de vout man, and one that feared God with his entire house, whic h gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God always. Acts 10:1-2 The New Testament also presents tax collectors, who would have been working for the Romans, in a favorable li ght. The Apos- tle Matthew, for example, is actually described as a publican, or tax collector. The citizenship espoused in the works of Josephus a nd the New Testament would have been seen favorably by Rome. E ach work pro- claims the holiness of subservience. And each takes the position that as it is God who has given the Romans their power, it is therefore against God's will to resist them. For example, the Apostle Paul teaches that Roman judges and magistrates were a threat onl y to evil-doers. Therefore the man who rebels against his ruler is r esisting God's will; and those who thus resist will bring pu nishment upon themselves.

Indeed what can it be that hath stirred up an army of the Romans against our nation? Is it not the impiety of the inhabitants? Whence did our servitude commence? Was it not derived from the seditions that were among our forefa- thers, when the madness of Aristobulus and Hyrcanus , and our mutual quarrels, brought Pompey upon this city, and when God reduced those under subjection to the Roma ns who were unworthy of the liberty they had enjoyed? 6 Thus, the only works that describe first-century Ju dea share a pos- itive viewpoint toward Rome.

This message reveals that the \"Jesus\" who interacted wit h the disciples following the crucifixion was not a Jewish Messiah but himself. Unable to torture the Jews into forgoing their reli gion and worship- ing him, Titus and his intellectuals created a vers ion of Judaism that worshiped Titus without its followers knowing it. W hen his clever literary device was finally discovered, Titus would be able to show posterity that he had not failed in his efforts to make the Jews call him \"Lord.\" Though always seen as a religious docum ent, the New Testament is actually a monument to the vanity of a Caesar—one that has finally been discovered. Titus backdated Jesus' ministry to 30 C.E., thereby enabling him to foresee events in the future. In other words, Je sus was able to accurately prophecy events from the coming war with the Romans because they had already occurred. As part of this scheme, the ficti- tious histories of Josephus were created so as to d ocument the fact that Jesus had lived and that his prophecies had co me to pass. While the above claims will, and should, trigger sk epticism, one needs to remember that as Christianity describes it s origins, it was not only supernatural but also historically illogic al. Christianity, a movement that encouraged pacifism and obedience to Rome, claims to have emerged from a nation engaged in a century- long struggle with Rome.

Somehow, Judea left little trace on the form of a religion that purportedly originated inside of it. Early Christianity was also Roman in its worldview. That is, like the Roman Empire, the movement saw itself as ordain ed by God to spread throughout the world. Before Christianity, n o religion is known to have seen itself quite so destined to conq uer, to become the religion of all mankind. The type of Judaism de scribed in the Dead Sea Scrolls, for example, was very selective a s to who was allowed to join its community, as the following pas sage from the Damascus Document shows: No madman, or lunatic, or simpleton, or fool, or bl ind man, or maimed, or lame, or deaf man, and no minor shall enter into the community for the Angels of Holiness are w ith them . . . 9 This exclusionary approach was the mirror opposite of Chris- tianity.

For example, consider Jesus' instruction in M atthew 5:41: \"when anyone conscripts you for one mile, go along two.\" Roman military law permitted its soldiers to conscr ipt, which is to demand that civilians carry their 65-pound packs for a length of one mile. Roman roads had mile markers (milestones) , so that there would be no dispute over whether or not this requir ement had been met. Why would the Messiah foreseen by Judaism's xe nophobic world- ruler prophecies urge Jews to \"go the extra mile\" f or the Roman army? When one compares the militaristic Messiah describe d in the Dead Sea Scrolls and other early Judaic literature with the pacifistic Messiah described in the New Testament and Josephus ' Testimonium, one aspect of the lost history of Judea seems visib le. An intellectual battle was waged over the nature of the Messiah. Th e New Testa- ment and Josephus stood together on one side of thi s struggle, claiming that a pacifistic Messiah had appeared who advocated cooperation with Rome.

I d isagree, and shall show that not only did Josephus \"believe\" Vespasian to be \"god,\" and Titus therefore the \"son of god,\" but that his histories were entirely constructed to demonstrate that very fact. There was nothing unusual in Josephus' recognition of Ves- pasian as a god. The Flavians merely continued the tradition of establishing emperors as gods that the Julio-Claudi an line of Roman emperors had begun. Julius Caesar, the first diuus (divine) of that line, claimed to have been descended from Venus. Th e Roman Sen- ate is said to have decreed that he was a god becau se a comet appeared shortly after his death, thus demonstratin g his divinity. In 80 C.E., Titus established an imperial cult for his father, who had passed away during the previous year. The cult was politically important to Titus because Vespasian's deification would break the Julio-Claudian line of divine succession and thereb y secure the throne for the Flavians. Because only the Roman Senate could bestow the titl e of diuus, Titus first needed to convince them that Vespasian had been a god. There was evidently some difficulty in arranging th is, however; Ves- pasian's consecratio did not occur until six months after his death, an unusually long interval. 19 Titus also created a priesthood, the flamines, to administer the cult. The cult of Vespasian was n ot isolated to Rome, and appointments were made throughout the pro vinces. In the areas surrounding Judea, a Roman bureaucracy ca lled the Com- mune Asiae oversaw the cult. Notably all seven of t he Christian \"churches of Asia\" mentioned in Revelation 1:11 had agencies of the Commune located within them. Upon her death, Titus also secured the deification of his sister, Domitilla. In going through the process of deifying his father and sister and establishing their cults, Titus received an education in a skill few humans have ever possessed. He learned how to c reate a religion. Titus not only created and administered religions, he was a prophet.

As Pontifex Maximus, Titus was responsible for a large collection of prophecies (annales maxim i) every year, and officially recorded celestial and other signs, as w ell as the events that had followed these omens, so that future generation s would be able to better understand the divine will. Titus was unusually literate. He claimed to take sh orthand faster than any secretary and to be able to \"forge any man 's signature\" and stated that under different circumstances he could have become \"the greatest forger in history.\" 20 Suetonius records that Titus possessed \"conspicuous mental gifts,\" and \"made speeches and wrote verses in Latin and Greek\" and that his \"memory was extraordi nary.\" 21 Titus' brother Domitian, who succeeded him as emper or, also used religion to his advantage. In addition to deif ying his brother, Domitian attempted to link himself to Jupiter, the supreme god of the Roman Empire, by having the Senate decree that the god had mandated his rule. Not only did the Flavians create religions, they pe rformed mir- acles. In the following passage from Tacitus, Vespa sian is recorded as curing one man's blindness and another's withered l imb, miracles also performed by Jesus: One of the common people of Alexandria, well known for his blindness . . . begged Vespasian that he would deig n to moisten his cheeks and eyeballs with his spittle. A nother with a diseased hand prayed that the limb might fee t the print of a Caesar's foot. And so Vespasian . . . ac complished what was required. The hand was instantly restored to its use, and the light of day again shone upon the blin d. 22 The Gospels record that Jesus also used this method of curing blindness, that is by placing spittle on a blind ma n's eyelids.

Another tale described an ox coming into Vespasian' s dining room and literally falling at the emperor's feet and low ering his neck, as if recognizing to whom its sacrifice was due. Circulating tales that suggested they were gods was no doubt thought by the Flavians to be a good tonic for hoi polloi. The more an emperor was seen by his subjects to be divine, t he easier it was for him to maintain his control over them. The Flav ians certainly focused on manipulating the masses. To promote the policy of \"bread and circuses\" they built the Coliseum, where they staged shows with gladiators and wild beasts that involved mass slaughter. Imperial cults that portrayed Roman emperors as god s and workers of miracles appear to have been created sol ely because they were politically useful. The cults seem to have evo ked no religious emotion. No evidence of any spontaneous offerings a ttesting to the sincerity of the worshipers has ever been discovere d. The advantage of converting one's family into a suc cession of gods appealed to many Roman emperors: 36 of the 60 emperors from Augustus to Constantine and 27 members of thei r families were apotheosized and received the title diuus. Of course, inventors of fictitious religions must h ave a certain cynicism in regard to the sacred.

W hile the exact dates of Juvenal's birth and death are unknown, it is believed that he lived during the era of the Flavians.

He is described in The Catholic Encyclop edia as the first pope about whom \"anything definite is known,\" 29 and was recorded in early church literature as being a memb er of the Flavian family. Pope Clement was the first pope who had individuals known to history refer to him and who left behind written wo rks. He purport- edly wrote the Epistle of Clement to the Corinthian s, quoted previ- ously. Thus, Clement is of great significance to th e church's history. In fact, while The Catholic Encyclopedia currently lists Clement as the fourth \"bishop of Rome,\" or pope, this was not the assertion of many early church scholars. St. Jerome wrote that i n his time \"most of the Latins' held that Clement had been the direc t successor of Peter. Tertullian also knew of this tradition; he w rote, \"The church of Rome records that Clement was ordained by Peter. \" 31 Origen, Eusebius, and Epiphanius also placed Clement at the very beginning of the Roman church, each of them stating that Clem ent had been the \"fellow laborer\" of the Apostle Paul.

Perhaps early church officials preferred not to use a list stating that Clement was Peter's direct successor, because of the traditional view t hat he was a mem- ber of the Flavian family. The notion that Pope Clement was a Flavian was reco rded in the Acts of Saints Nereus and Achilleus, a fifth- o r sixth-century work based on even earlier traditions.

Owing to the purely le gendary character of these Acts, we cannot use them as an a rgu- ment to aid in the controversy as to whether there were two Christians of the name of Domitilla in the family o f the Christian Flavians, or only one, the wife of the Co nsul Flav- ius Clemens. 34 The Talmud records the genealogy of Christianity's purported first pope differently than does the Acts of Saints Nereus and Achilleus.

In fact, Titus ordered the publication of War of the Jews. In his autobiography, Josephus writes that Titus \"was so desirous that th e knowledge of these affairs should be taken from these books alon e, that he affixed his own signature to them and gave orders for their publication.\" 37 Perhaps the most unusual connection between Christi anity and the Flavians, however, is the fact that Titus Flavi us fulfilled all of Jesus' doomsday prophecies. As mentioned above, the parallels between the description of Titus' campaign in War o f the Jews and Jesus' prophecies caused early church scholars to b elieve that Christ had seen into the future. The destruction of the te mple, the encir- cling of Jerusalem with a wall, the towns of Galile e being \"brought low,\" the destruction of what Jesus described as th e \"wicked gener- ation,\" etc. had all been prophesied by Jesus and t hen came to pass during Titus' military campaign through Judea—a cam paign that, like Jesus' ministry, began in Galilee and ended in Jerusalem. Thus the Flavians are linked to Christianity by an unusual num- ber of facts and traditions. Early church documents flatly state that the family produced some of the religion's first ma rtyrs, as well as the pope who succeeded Peter. The Flavians created much of the litera- ture that provides documentation for the religion, were responsible for its oldest known cemetery and housed individual s named in the New Testament within their imperial court. Further, the family was responsible for Jesus' apocalyptic prophecies havin g \"come to pass.\" These connections clearly deserve more attention th an they have received. Some explanation is required for the numerous tradi- tions linking an obscure Judean cult to the imperia l family—con- nections that include not merely converts to the re ligion, but, if the Acts of Nereus and Achilleus and Eusebius are to be believed, the direct successor to Peter. If Christianity was invented by the Flavians to ass ist them in their struggle with Judaism, it would merely have b een a variation upon a long-established theme. Using religion for t he good of the state was a Roman technique long before the Flavian s. In the fol- lowing quote, which could well have been studied by the young Titus Flavius during his education at the imperial court, Cicero not only prefigures much of Christian theology but also actually advo-"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"34 C A E S A R ' S M ESSIAH cates for the state to persuade the masses to adopt the theology most appropriate for the empire. We must persuade our citizens that the gods are the Lords and rulers of all things and what is done, is done by their will and authority; and they are the great benefact ors of men, and know who everyone is, and what he does, an d what sins he commits, and what he intends to do, an d with what piety he fulfills his religious duties. Cicero, The Laws, 2:15-16 Rome attempted not to replace the gods of its provi nces but to absorb them. By the end of the first century Rome h ad accumulated so many foreign gods that virtually every day of th e year celebrated some divinity. Roman citizens were encouraged to gi ve offerings to all these gods as a way of maintaining the Pax Deor um, the \"peace of the gods,\" a condition that the Caesars saw as b eneficial to the empire. The Romans also used religion as a tool to assist t hem in con- quest. The leader of the Roman army, the consul, wa s a religious leader capable of communicating with the gods. The Romans devel- oped a specific ritual for inducing the gods of the ir enemies to defect to Rome. In this particular ritual, the devotio, a Roman soldier sacri- ficed himself to all the gods, including those of t he enemy. In this way the Romans sought to neutralize their opponents ' divine assis- tance. Thus, when Rome went to war with the Zealots in Jud ea it had a long tradition of absorbing the religions of its opponents. If Romans did invent Christianity, it would have been yet another example of neutralizing an enemy's religion by maki ng it their own, rather than fighting against it. Rome would simply have transformed the militant Judaism of first-century Judea into a pacifist religion, to more easily absorb it into the empire. In any event, it is certain that the Caesars did at tempt to control Judaism. From Julius Caesar on, the Roman emperor c laimed per- sonal authority over the religion and selected its high priests.

Jud aism would not permit its God to be just one among many, and Rome was forced to battle one Jewish insurrection after another.

Bruno Bauer, a 19th-century G erman scholar, believed that Christianity was Rome's attempt to cr eate a mass reli- gion that encouraged slaves to accept their station in life.

On its surface level they are, of cours e, a description of the ministry of a miracle-working Messiah who rose from the dead. However, the New Testament was also designed to be understood in another way, which is as a satire of Titus Flavius' military campaign through Judea. The proof of this is simply that Jes us and Titus share parallel experiences at the same locations and in t he same sequence. Those parallels are both too exact and too complex to have occurred by chance. That this fact has been overlooked for t wo millennia rep- resents a blind spot in scholarship as large as it is long. The Gospels were designed to become apparent as sat ire as soon as they were read in conjunction with War of the Je ws. In fact, the four Gospels and War of the Jews were created as a unified piece of literature whose characters and stories interact. T heir interaction gives many of Jesus' sayings a comical meaning and also creates a series of puzzles whose solutions reveal the real i dentities of the New Testament's characters. Understanding the New T estament's comic level reveals, for example, that the Apostles Simon and John were cruel lampoons of Simon and John, the leaders of the Jewish rebellion. Throughout this work I refer to Jesus' ministry as a satire of Titus' military campaign. I do so because the minis try was based on the campaign and was intended to be seen as humorou s when viewed from that perspective. However, the relation ship between these two \"ministries\" was not simply satirical. I shall show that Jesus' ministry was designed to prove that he was t he Malachi, or messenger, of the \"true\" Messiah—Titus Flavius. Malachi means \"my messenger\" in Hebrew and was used as a cognomen for the prophet Elijah. This is because Ju daic prophecy foretold that the Messiah would be preceded by the appearance of Elijah, who would act as the messenger of his immin ent coming. But I shall send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.

Key incidents in Jesus' ministry were created to be see n as the \"type,\" or prophetical basis, for events from Titus' campaign and thereby \"prove\" that Jesus had been the Malachi of Titus. I will also show that Josephus falsified the dates of events in War of the Jews to create the impression that the proph ecies of Daniel came to pass during the war between the Romans and the Jews. This was done to provide \"proof for the New Testament's claim, on its surface level, that the \"son of God\" foreseen by Da niel was Jesus. The histories of Josephus and the New Testament are perhaps the most scrutinized works in literature and 1 enco urage skepticism of my claim to have discovered a new, \"true\" way of understanding them. Throughout the ages, the New Testament has be en an intel- lectual kaleidoscope within which fantastic prophec ies and codes have often been \"discovered.\" Extraordinary claims require extraor- dinary evidence, and I would not be presenting this work if I could not meet that criterion. However, it was the case that the Flavians possesse d both the motivation and the capacity to create a version of Judaism aligned with their interests. Any honest seeker of Christia nity's origin must, therefore, at least consider the possibility that t he Flavians produced the Gospels. Further, the core of Jesus' prophecies —the Galilean vil- lages \"laid low,\" Jerusalem encircled with a wall, the temple left with not a single stone atop another, and the \"wicked ge neration\" destroyed—all share one characteristic. Each is a m ilitary victory of the Flavian family. Thus, the oft-cited principle t hat history is writ- ten by the victors suggests that that family should be the first group we investigate. This is why we should attempt to understand the Gos pels as they would have been understood by someone familiar with the conquest of Judea by Titus Flavius, emperor of Rome .

They proclaim the divinity of Caesar."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 Fishers of Men: Men Who Were Caught Like Fish To begin to explain the relationship between Jesus' ministry and Titus' campaign that my analysis indicates is a sat ire, I point to the following passages. In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus is described at the onset of his ministry asking Simon and Andrew and the \"sons of Z eb'edee\" to \"follow me\" and to become \"fishers of men.\" From that time Jesus began to preach. \"Repent,\" He said, \"for the Kingdom of the Heavens is now close at han d.\" And walking along the shore of the Lake of Galilee He saw two brothers—Simon called Peter and his brother And rew- throwing a drag-net into the Lake; for they were fi shers. And He said to them, \"Come and follow me, and I wil l make you fishers of men.\" Matt. 4:18-19 The same story is represented in the Gospel of Luke as follows: While the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennes'aret. And so also were James and John, sons of Zeb'edee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Sim on, \"Do not be afraid; henceforth you will be catching men.\" Luke 5:9-10 In another passage from the New Testament, Jesus fo resees that cities on Gennesareth Lake (better known as the Sea of Galilee) will face tribulation for their wickedness. 38"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Fishers of Men: Men Who Were Caught Like Fish 39 Woe to you Chorazain! Woe to you Bethsaida! And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades. Matt. 11:23 In War of the Jews, Josephus describes a sea battle where the Romans caught Jews like fish. The battle occurred a t Gennesareth, where Titus attacked a band of Jewish rebels led by a leader named Jesus. This lake is called by the people of the country th e Lake of Gennesareth . . . they had a great number of ships . . . and they were so fitted up, that they might undertake a Sea- fight. But as the Romans were building a wall about their camp, Jesus and his party . . . made a sally upon t hem. . . . Sometimes the Romans leaped into their ships, with swords in their hands, and slew them; but when some of them met the vessels, the Romans caught them by the middle, and destroyed at once their ships and thems elves who were taken in them. And for such as were drowni ng in the sea, if they lifted their heads up above the wa ter, they were either killed by darts, or caught by the vesse ls; but if, in the desperate case they were in, they attempted to swim to their enemies, the Romans cut off either their h eads or their hands . . . 39 A first-century peasant who heard Jesus' doomsday p rophecy, which describes what would become of the inhabitant s of the cities on Gennesareth Lake, and also heard the passage abo ve from War of the Jews, which describes their destruction, would have understood the juxtaposition as evidence of Christ's divinity. What Jesus had prophesied, Josephus recorded as having come to pas s. But an uneducated peasant could not have understood that there was another \"prophecy\" that came to pass with in the passages above. I am referring to Christ's exhortation to be come \"fishers\"or \"catchers\" of men, while standing on the spot where Jews would be caught like fish during the coming war with Rome.

The grim comedy is self-evident. These two \"fulfilled\" prophecies exemplify the two levels on which the New Testament can be understood. Jesus' p rophecy regarding the destruction of Chorazain and Capernau m is com- pletely straightforward and meant to be understood literally. The other \"fulfilled\" prophecy that of Jesus' predi ction that his followers would become fishers for men, is not so s traightforward. It could be understood only by someone who, like th e residents of the Flavian court, had knowledge of the details of the sea battle between the Romans and the Jewish fishermen at Genn esareth. Only such individuals could have seen the prophetic iron y in Jesus using the expression while standing on the very beach whe re the Jews would later be caught like fish. If the authors of the Gospels were being less than transparent when they referred to the Jewish rebels as fish, th ey were at least using a metaphor common in the first century. For e xample, Rabban (chief Rabbi) Gamaliel spoke of his disciples throu gh a parable in which they were compared to four different kinds of fish—an unclean fish, a clean fish, a fish from the river J ordan, and a fish from the sea. Roman authors also used the metaphor. Juvenal, a con- temporary Roman poet, specifically compares fugitiv e slaves and informers to fish. 40 The structure of the comedy is important. Jesus spe aks of \"catch- ing men\" in a seemingly symbolic sense. Josephus th en records that Jesus was indeed a \"true\" prophet. His vision of \"c atching men\" at Gennesareth did come to pass, the joke being that i t came to pass lit- erally, and not in the symbolic manner that Jesus s eemed to have meant with the phrase. This is the most common stru cture of the humor created by reading the New Testament in conju nction with War of the Jews. If the New Testament and War of the Jews engage in an interac- tive comedy regarding \"fishing\" for men at Gennesar eth, they also work to create another \"fish\" joke. As mentioned ab ove, in Matthew 11:23 Jesus predicted \"woe\" for \"Chorazain.\""},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Fishers of Men: Men Who Were Caught Like Fish 41 Scholars have always presumed that Jesus was referr ing to a Galilean fishing village. Josephus, however, gave a different defini- tion of the word \"Chorazain.\" The country also that lies over against this lake h ath the same name of Gennesareth . . . Some have thought it to be a vein of the Nile, because it produces the Coracin fish as well as the lake does which is near to Alexandria. 41 So, while at the Sea of Galilee Jesus predicted woe for the Chorazain, and said that henceforth his disciples w ould follow him and become fishers for men. Titus' experience was s trangely parallel to Jesus' prophecies in that he literally brought w oe for the Chorazainians and his soldiers literally followed h im and became \"fishers of men.\" That is, they fished for the inha bitants of the vil- lage named for the Coracin fish. If the irony of ju xtaposing the onset of Jesus' ministry and Titus' campaign was created deliberately, it apparently stemmed from the fact that Titus saw the humor in his \"fishing\" for the Chorazainians as they attempted t o swim to safety. The previous examples, in and of themselves, are no t convinc- ing evidence that there is a deliberate parallel be tween Jesus' min- istry and Titus' campaign. It is, after all, quite possible that it was just an unfortunate coincidence that Jesus chose th e beach at Gen- nesareth as the spot where he described his future ministry as fish- ing for men. I present this example of the two leve ls of interpreta- tion that are possible while reading the New Testam ent in conjunction with War of the Jews, because it occurs near the begin- ning of both Jesus' and Titus' narratives. I show b elow that the sequence of events that take place in the New Testa ment and War of the Jews have a meaning not heretofore understood. However, the parallels that exist between the exper iences of Jesus and Titus at Gennesareth are not limited to c atching men. The first part of Jesus' statement is \"Follow me\" and \" Do not be afraid.\" When one reads the passage from Josephus in which t he Jews were \"caught\" it is also recorded that the soldiers who did the \"catching\" were told not to be afraid and indeed \"followed\" so meone. As the next excerpts show, the person being followed was T itus, who told his troops not to be afraid."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"42 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH \"For you know very well that I go into danger first , and make the first attack upon the enemy.

And again, the Roman soldiers who woul d do the \"fish- ing\" literally followed Titus, creating another con ceptual parallel with Jesus. In fact, the New Testament passage above, in which Jesus asks his disciples \"follow me,\" and the passage from Jos ephus in which Titus asks his troops to follow, so that they can b ecome fishers of men, have a number of other parallels. Like Jesus, Titus had been sent by his father. So he sent away his son Titus to Casarea, that he m ight bring the army that lay there to Scythopolis. 45 While it is hardly unusual to follow a leader into battle or to have been sent by one's father, Titus, again like J esus at Gennesareth, is in a sense beginning his ministry there. He stat es that the battle is to be his \"onset.\" \"Do not you therefore desert me, but persuade yours elves that God will be assisting to my onset.\" 46 The Greek word that Josephus uses here, horme means \"onset\" in English, that is, either an assault or a startin g point. From Titus' perspective the moment can be seen as a starting po int because it is his first battle in Galilee entirely under his comm and.

Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the fi rst and of the other who was crucified with him. But when they came to Jesus and saw him already dead, they did not break His legs. John 19 Identifying Jesus with the symbolic Passover lamb a t his cruci- fixion continued a theme begun at the Passover supp er where Jesus asked the disciples to eat of his flesh. Also during the meal He took a Passover biscuit, bl essed it, and broke it. He then gave it to them, saying, Take this, it is my body. Mark 14:22-27 There is, then, a parallel between the New Testamen t's son of Mary who asks that his body be eaten and the son of Mary Josephus described, who actually has his flesh eaten. Josephus connects the Mary described in his passage to the Mary in the New Testament with another of the detai ls he records."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The Son of Mary Who Was a Passover Sacrifice 4 9 He describes the famine—as Winston translates it ab ove—as having \"pierced through Mary's very bowels.\" In the New Te stament, being pierced through is predicted for only one person, J esus' mother Mary: Then Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary His moth er, Behold this child is destined for the fall and risi ng of many in Israel, and for a sign which will be spoken agai nst (yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul also; that the rea- sonings in many hearts may be revealed.\") Luke 2:35 The fact that the New Testament's Mary and the Mary in War of the Jews both had their heart pierced has, to my kn owledge, never been noticed by another scholar. The reason for the oversight is important. Scholars have not noticed the parallel b etween the two Marys because it is more conceptual than linguistic . In the New Tes- tament the Greek words making up the phase are dier chomai psuche while in War of the Jews they are dia splanchon. Th ough the words that indicate the piercing through, dia 51 and dierchomai, are lin- guistically related (the verb dierchomai having the preposition dia as part of its stem), the words used to describe the p art of Mary that was to be pierced through—psuche and splanchon—are different. Psuche, 53 the word translated in the New Testament above as \"soul,\" can also mean \"heart,\" or \"the seat of emot ions.\" Splanchon, the Greek word that Josephus uses to describe the p art of Mary that was pierced through, is translated above as \"bowels ,\" but is in fact a synonym for psuche, and can mean either \"inward par ts,\" especially the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys, or, like psuc he, it can mean \"the seat of the emotions.\" Scholars have not seen this conceptual paral- lel between the two Marys simply because it was cre ated using dif- ferent words, even though the words mean the same t hing. In other words, if a prophet predicted that \"next w eek a dog will bite a mailman\" and a historian recorded that durin g that week \"a cur sank its teeth into a letter carrier\" the proph ecy, in fact, came to pass even though the prophet and the historian used different words to describe the event. The concept the prophet pred icted was the same as the one the historian recorded."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"50 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH The \"fulfilled prophecy\" of the \"bitten postman\" ca nnot be seen through an analysis of the individual words that th e historian and the prophet used. Likewise, the satirical system th at exists between the New Testament and War of the Jews cannot be see n by analyzing their individual words and nuances of grammar. The system is made up of parallel concepts, not parallel words. Notice also that the parallel \"heart piercings\" of the two Marys are prophetically logical. This is to say that the Mary in the New Tes- tament is the one predicted to have her heart \"pier ced through\" in the future and the Mary in War of the Jews, which o ccurred later, is the one who fulfilled this prophecy. If the New Tes tament had stated that Mary's heart had been pierced through, then th e logic of this prophecy would have been contradicted. And notice a lso that the statement in the New Testament, though innocuous, i s a prophecy. One reason that the comic level of the New Testamen t has remained unseen is because scholars have failed to recognize the many seem- ingly innocuous New Testament prophecies that are f ulfilled within War of the Jews. Josephus has, thus, described a Mary who fulfilled the prophecy made for the Mary in the New Testament, in that she was \"pierced through the heart.\" As this Mary is of the \"House o f Hyssop\" and her son is a \"sacrifice\" who was \"roasted\" and his fles h was eaten, he can certainly be likened to a human Passover lamb, like the one estab- lished in the New Testament. Josephus' use of the w ord \"splanchon\" also builds on this theme—\"splanchon\" being the Gre ek word that was used to describe those parts of a sacrificed an imal reserved to be eaten by sacrificers at the beginning of their feas t. Yet another detail recorded by Josephus also links this passage to the New Testament. Josephus gives the name of Mary's father as Eleazar , which in Greek is Lazarus, the name of the individual whom Jesus r aised from the dead. To summarize, within this short passage Josephus ha s used a number of concepts and names that are parallel to t hose associated with the New Testament's symbolic Passover lamb. Th ese are a mother named Mary; the fact that this Mary was pier ced through the heart; a son of Mary; hyssop; a son who is a sacrif ice; a son whose flesh is eaten; a son who is to become a \"byword to the world,\" one"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The Son of Mary Who Was a Passover Sacrifice 5 1 of Moses' instructions regarding the Passover lamb; an individual named Lazarus (Eleazar); and Jerusalem as the locat ion of the inci- dent. It is unlikely that there is another passage in all of literature that contains, by chance, as many as half the numbe r of parallels with a concept as singular as Christianity's Passov er lamb. When I first recognized these parallels I felt that the si mplest explanation for such an improbable grouping was that it had been de liberately cre- ated and that, therefore, the passage was a lampoon of Jesus. To argue against this proposition one must accept t his idea that Josephus unknowingly recorded these parallels in su ch detail within a passage of less than two pages. However, because Josephus wrote War of the Jews while living in the Flavian court, a place where Christianity flourished, and was one of the few his torians to have recorded Jesus' existence, he would seem to be amon g the authors least likely to have recorded a satire of Christ ac cidentally. For example, if the passage in question had occurre d within a work by Tolstoy, there would be virtually complete agreement that it was a deliberate satire. And notice that when viewe d from such a perspective the passage would certainly be seen as comical, the irony being self-evident of a Messiah who instructs his f ollowers to sym- bolically \"eat of my flesh\" actually having his fle sh eaten by his mother. I shall show in a later chapter that Josephus' pass age shares yet another parallel with the life of Jesus, that of \"M ary's fine portion that was not taken away from her\"—a parallel that w hen seen in combination with those noted above puts the proposi tion that Jose- phus was intentionally satirizing Jesus beyond doub t. If Josephus was lampooning Jesus, what was his purp ose? An obvious explanation is that he wrote the passage to amuse a group on whom the joke would not be lost: he would have c reated it to be enjoyed by the Flavians and their inner circle. This conclusion is especially plausible in light of the fact that there were individuals within the Flavian court who were aware of Christianity around the time Josephus published War of the Jews. Further, there were four colleges in Rome that were responsible for overseeing the religions within the empire. Because religion was an"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"52 C A E S A R ' S M ESSIAH important tool of the state, these colleges had con siderable political power. From Augustus on, the emperor was a member o f all four colleges, one of which, the Quindecimviri Sacris Fa ciundis, was responsible for the regulation of foreign cults in Rome. All the Fla- vian emperors were members of this college and woul d have cate- gorized Christianity as a foreign cult during this era. Moreover, the most obvious reason to believe that t here were Flavians familiar with Christianity is that so much of the New Tes- tament is related to the family. The Flavians broug ht about the ful- fillment of all of Jesus' doomsday prophecies—the d estruction of the temple, the encircling of Jerusalem with a wall, th e towns of Galilee being brought low, and the destruction of what Jesu s describes as the \"wicked generation.\" Titus' mistress, Bernice, and Tiberius Alexan- der, his chief of staff during the siege of Jerusal em, are actually named within the New Testament. A cult whose canon prophesied the accomplishments of the Flavians, named individu als within its inner circle, and actually had converts within the imperial family would certainly have been scrutinized during an era when the regu- lation of religion was so important that the empero r himself was involved with it. Titus is known to have reviewed War of the Jews. As noted above, Josephus wrote that Titus so wished that \"th e knowledge of these affairs should be taken from these books alon e, that he affixed his own signature to them.\" Thus, Titus certainly h ad read the pas- sage describing the Mary who ate her son and, consi dering the tra- ditions connecting his family to Christianity, coul d well have under- stood its ironic parallels with the mother of Jesus . Again, though Jesus seems to be speaking symbolically when he spe aks of having his flesh eaten as a Passover sacrifice, in Josephu s' history we see a literal interpretation of Jesus' words, which rende rs them blackly comic. If the passage is a satire of Jesus, a number of st atements Jose- phus makes within it can be seen as double entendre s. The reader need only read these statements from the perspectiv e that the Fla- vians had invented Christianity and their satirical meaning will become obvious. Some of these are found in Josephus ' narration:"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The Son of Mary Who Was a Passover Sacrifice 5 3 It is horrible to speak of it, and incredible when heard . . . While I am going to relate a matter of fact, the li ke to which no history relate . . . I might not seem to deliver what is so portentous t o posterity . . . I have innumerable witnesses to it in my own age . . . But the most important play on words is found withi n Mary's address to her \"miserable child,\" wherein she state s \"... be thou a fury to these seditious varlets and a byword to the world, which is all that is now wanting to c omplete the calamities of us Jews.\" As I have suggested, this quote seems to have been invented by Josephus. Not only were there no witnesses to hear them, but they are, on their face, dubious. Would a mother who has eaten her son really wish him to become a byword to the world? Fu rther, taken lit- erally, Mary's words seem incoherent. Why would her child become a \"fury\" to the \"varlets\"—that is, the Jewish rebel s against Rome— by being cannibalized? And why would this \"complete the calami- ties of us Jews\"? Within the context of a lampoon of Jesus the meanin g of the phrase becomes clear. The author is not merely ridi culing Christ. He is stating that Jesus will \"complete the calamity\" of the Jews by becoming a byword to the world and that the spread of Christianity will \"complete\" the destruction of the Jews. This interpretation indicates that Christianity was designed to promote anti-Semitism—a concept that is at least pl ausible, histori- cally. A cult that produced anti-Semitism would hav e both helped Rome prevent the messianic Jews from spreading thei r rebellion and punished them by poisoning their future. The New Testament has numerous passages that seem d eliber- ately intended to cause Christians to hate Jews. Th ough Christian apologists have attempted to explain away such pass ages, there are clear examples of this technique throughout the New Testament."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"54 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH The most famous occurs in the Gospel of Matthew, in which Pilate, after having \"washed his hands of the blood of this just person\" tells the Jews that they, not the Roman authorities, must be the ones responsible for crucifying Christ. The Jews respond ed thus: ... all the people answered and said, \"His blood will be on us and on our children.\" 54 Some scholars have speculated that later Christian redactors inserted the anti-Semitism passages into the New Te stament out of hatred for the people who had crucified their savio r. My interpreta- tion of the passage above suggests the opposite. Th e New Testament was designed to promote anti-Semitism. If Christianity had been created by the Flavians to \"complete the calamities\" of the Jews, why had the religion's inventors created a Messiah who was a symbolic Passover lamb? The sym bolism of John 19 and the passage from Josephus we have been analyzing, which set up the symbolic Passover lambs, both stem from Exodus 12, where God tells Moses and Aaron how to observe the Passover \"throughout their generations\": This is the ordinance of Passover: no foreigner sha ll eat it. But every man's servant who is bought for money, an d when you have circumcised him, then he may eat it. In one house it shall be eaten; you shall not carry any of the flesh outside the house, nor shall you break one of its bones. All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. And when a stranger dwells with you and wants to ke ep the Passover to the Lord, let all his males be circ umcised and let him come near and keep it; and he shall be a native of the land. For no uncircumcised person shall eat it. The above passage may have provided one of the moti ves behind the decision to establish a Messiah whose fl esh may be eaten by all humanity. God's instruction to Moses regardi ng how only the circumcised, the Jews, may eat of the Passover lamb is one social marker of the religious separateness of the Jewish people. Judaism's requirement of religious separatism was o ne of the causes of the war with the, Romans. By creating a P assover lamb for"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"The Son of Mary Who Was a Passover Sacrifice 5 5 all mankind, the New Testament was clearly, on one level, ending the religious separatism that made it impossible fo r Judaism to be absorbed into the Roman Empire. However, another pa ssage within War of the Jews may reveal a more comic inspiration for Christian- ity's human Passover lamb. As the number that perished during this whole siege , eleven hundred thousand, the greater part of whom were ind eed of the same nation, [with the citizens of Jerusalem], but not belonging to the city itself; for they were come up from all the country for the feast of the unleavened bread. And were on a sudden shut up by an army, which at the very f irst, occasioned so great a straitness among them that th ere came a pestilential destruction upon them, and soon after- ward such a famine as destroyed them more suddenly. 55 Thus, the Romans were aware that they had besieged Jerusalem at a time when Passover celebrants had swollen its population. As starvation set in, these Passover celebrants, like the Mary described by Josephus, engaged in cannibalism. The Roman hist orian Sueto- nius, writing in the third century, also recorded t hat there was can- nibalism during the siege of Jerusalem. The Jews, meanwhile, being closely besieged, as no chance either of peace or surrender was allowed them, were at length perishing from famine, and the streets began every- where to be filled with dead bodies, for the duty o f burying them could no longer be performed. Moreover, they v en- tured on eating all things of the most abominable n ature, and did not even abstain from human bodies, except those which putrefaction had already laid hold of and thu s excluded from use as food. The cannibalism that occurred during the siege of J erusalem is, therefore, a candidate as the inspiration behind Ch ristianity's \"flesh eating\" innovation. This premise is especially plau sible in light of the fact that so much of Jesus' ministry involved p rophecy, and these prophecies all seemed to have come to pass within W ar of the Jews. In other words, the New Testament's \"son of Mary\" t elling his disci-"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"56 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH ples that they must \"eat of my flesh\" would simply have been another prophecy Josephus recorded as having come t o pass. If the Romans did create the New Testament, they in vented the darkly comic narrative about a human Passover lamb to satirize the grim \"feast\" of the starving Passover celebrants wh o were trapped inside Jerusalem. Josephus' story concerning the \"s tarving Mary\" and the sacrament of communion are both reflections of this comic theme. Though the strange fact that Jesus' flesh was the b asis for the sacrament is not often noted today, this may not ha ve been the case during Christianity's first centuries. Eusebius rec orded that early Christians had to defend themselves against charges of infanticide and cannibalism: . . . she contradicted the blasphemers. \"How,\" she said, \"could those eat children who do not think it lawfu l to taste the blood even of irrational animals?\" And thencefo rward she confessed herself a Christian. 56 Members of the Flavian court could have understood the pas- sage from Josephus as black comedy because such ind ividuals would have seen irony in Jesus telling his followers, par ticularly at Jerusalem, where Jews resorted to cannibalism, that \"the bread that 1 give is my flesh.\" From the Flavian perspective, th e comedy is self- evident. The short chapter in War of the Jews that contains the \"son of Mary\" passage concludes with Titus, having been tol d the story of the mother who ate her son's flesh, delivering a se rmon on the meaning of the sordid affair. But for Caesar, he excused himself before God as to this matter, and said that he had proposed peace and lib erty to the Jews, as well as an oblivion of all their forme r insolent practices; but that they, instead of concord, had c hosen sedition; instead of peace, war; and before satiety and abundance, a famine. That they had begun with their own hands to burn down that temple which we have preser ved hitherto; and that therefore they deserved to eat s uch food as this was.

And at the same t ime that he said this, he reflected on the desperate co ndition these men must be in; nor could he expect that such men could be recovered to sobriety of mind, after they had endured those very sufferings, for the avoiding whe reof it only was probable they might have repented. 57 Titus' use of the word \"repent\" here is interesting . \"Repent\" is, of course, one of the key words of Jesus' ministry and Caesar's usage of it brings the parallels even tighter. Jesus stat es repeatedly, \"Repent, the Kingdom of God is at hand,\" but exactl y what sin does he wish the Jews to repent of? Jesus never gives an answer to this question. However, if my interpretation of the lamp oon is correct, the sin of which Jesus wishes the Jews to repent be comes obvious. It is their rebellion against Rome."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"C H A P T E R 4 The Demons of Gadara When I first came across the passage from War of th e Jews describ- ing a son of Mary whose flesh was eaten and recogni zed its linkage to Christianity, I was perplexed.

It a ppeared to be a disclosure of a different origin of Christianity th an the one that had been passed down to the modern era. That is, that C hristianity had been created to be a \"calamity\" upon the Jews. 1 be gan to analyze War of the Jews to determine if it contained other passages that could be seen as satirical disclosures regarding this dif ferent version of Christianity's origin. That was when it became clear to me that there were humorous parallels between the story line of Jesus' ministry and Titus' cam- paign through Judea, and that among them was their similar experi- ence near the town of Gadara. Each of the Synoptic Gospels tells a story of Jesus coming to Gadara where he meets a man who is possessed by dem ons (in Matthew, Jesus meets two demon-possessed men, a poi nt I shall return to). In the versions of the story found in M ark and Luke, when Jesus asks the demon his name, the demon repli es: My name is Legion: for we are many. Mark 5:9 I found it interesting that the demon would choose to describe himself and his cohort as a component of an army.

The passage in Mark describing the demoniac of Gada ra tells of Jesus' encounter with a man possessed by numerous d emons. These demons leave the man at Jesus' bidding and then ent er into a herd of swine. Once the swine are possessed by the demon s, they rush wildly into the sea and drown. The passage does not reveal what happened to the demons after the swine drown. Note that in the New Testament \"unclean spirits\" are synonymous with dev ils and demons. And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes. And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclea n spirit, Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains: Because that he had been often bound with fetters a nd chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him. And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones. But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipe d him, And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not. For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit. And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are man y. And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"60 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us in to the swine, that we may enter into them.

And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in th e city, and in the country. And they went out to see what i t was that was done. And they come to Jesus, and see him that was pos- sessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afrai d. And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all me n did marvel. 58 In War of the Jews, there is a short chapter that d escribes the bat- tle at Gadara. The chapter begins with a descriptio n of how \"John\" rose to power as a leader of the rebellion. By this time John was beginning to tyrannize . ..

Thus, Josephus described John as a \"tyrant\" into wh ose \"one head\" the \"insolent actions\" of many had been \"redu ced.\" Josephus next describes the Sicarii, the most militant fract ion of the Jewish rebellion, who, he states, were able to undertake \" greater matters\" because of the \"sedition and tyranny\" that John had created. There was a fortress of very great strength not far from Jerusalem ... called Masada.

Josephus then describes the beginning of Vespasian' s pacifica- tion of the Judean countryside. His first assault w as on Gadara, a city held by the rebels. These things were told Vespasian by deserters; Acco rdingly, he marched against Gadara, the metropolis of Perea, which was a place of strength, and entered that city on t he fourth day of the month Dystrus [Adar]; for the men of pow er had sent an embassage to him, without the knowledge of the seditious, to treat about a surrender; which they d id out of the desire they had of peace, and for saving their effects, because many of the citizens of Gadara were rich me n. This embassy the opposite party knew nothing of, but dis covered it as Vespasian was approaching near the city. Howe ver, they despaired of keeping possession of the city, a s being inferior in number to their enemies who were within the city, and seeing the Romans very near to the city; so they resolved to fly. Josephus then states that after being driven from G adara the rebels fled to another town, where they conscripted a grou p of young men into their ranks. This combined group then ran \"lik e the wildest of beasts\" attempting to escape. Eventually many were forced to \"leap\" the river Jordan, where they drowned.

For example, the demoniac in the New Testament's story is described as having a \"Legion\" of demons inside him. The rebel \" tyrant,\" John, is described as having \"the past insolent actions [of the many] reduced to [his] one head.\" Thus, the demoniac of Gadara ca n be likened to Josephus' description of John. Further, Josephus indicates that the Sicarii were o nly able to become a Judea-wide movement because of John's effo rt to establish himself as a tyrant. Before John's \"wickedness\" the y engaged in lim- ited activities—\"at this time they overran the neig hboring countries, aiming only to procure to themselves necessaries; f or the fear they were then in prevented their further ravages.\" Howe ver, once John had divided the country, \"between sedition and tyra nny, they boldly undertook greater matters.\" These \"greater matters\" being recruit- ment and expansion of their movement throughout the countryside and Jerusalem, \"Nor was there now any part of Judea that was not in a miserable condition, as well as its most emine nt city also.\" So, like the demons that sprang forth out of one man at Gadara, the expansion of the Sicarii can be said to have come a bout as the result of the wickedness inside of \"one head.\" In another passage in War of the Jews Josephus repe ats the con- cept of John, like the demoniac of Gadara, filling the \"entire coun- try with ten thousand instances of wickedness.\" Yet did John demonstrate by his actions that these Sicarii were more moderate than he was himself, for he not only slew all such as gave him good counsel to do what w as right, but treated them worst of all, as the most bitter e nemies that he had among all the Citizens; nay, he filled his entire country with ten thousand instances of wickedness. 60 I also noticed that in describing the Sicarii, Jose phus stated that their group was \"too small for an army, and too man y for a gang of thieves.\" There is a word that describes just such a number of fight- ing men—a legion. 61 \"Legion\" being the word that the demons from the New Testament passage above used to describe th emselves.

The infected group is then confronted by the Romans and runs about \"like the wildest of wild beasts,\" which parallels the herd of swine in the New Testament passage who \"ran violently.\" Both the New Testament and Josephus conclude their Gadara stories with a mass drowning and a description of a group that num- bered \"about two thousand.\" In the New Testament, a s I have stated, the author does not tell us what happened to the de mons that infected the swine. He does, however, tell us the n umber of swine that drowned, \"(about two thousand).\" In the Gadara passage in War of the Jews Josephus tells us the number of prisone rs taken captive: \"There were besides two thousand and two hundred ta ken prison- ers.\" Josephus also informs us that, \"A mighty prey was taken also, consisting of asses, and sheep, and camels, and oxe n.\" Notice that there were no swine taken. I questioned whether the similarities between the t wo passages were the result of random chance. Many concepts cou ld be seen as parallel—\"one head\" that contained great evil, a \"L egion,\" this legion infecting another group, the combined group running \"wildly,\" the drowning of the infected group, a group that number ed \"about two thousand,\" the \"missing\" swine, and, of course, the location of Gadara. However, if the parallels between the two p assages had been created intentionally, what was their purpose? As I studied the New Testament passage further I be came aware that there were many unanswered questions within it . Why do the demons wish to enter the swine?

Why does the possessed man cut himself with stones?

I soon reali zed that it is possi-"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"The Demons of Gadara 65 ble to read the Gospel stories of the demoniac of G adara as a satire of Josephus' description of the battle of Gadara, a nd that the two passages could possibly be interactive. The reason that the New Testament's demoniac of Gad ara can be seen as a satire on Josephus' \"tyrant\" John and the battle at Gadara is simply because the two stories follow the same p lot outline. In other words, the characters and events that can be seen a s parallel occur in the same sequence. And it all occurs near Gadara . The satirical ver- sion in the New Testament tells the same story that Josephus does but, as is often the case with satire, the characte rs have different names. In the New Testament the characters are the unnamed demo- niac, the demons, and the swine that the demons inf ect. In War of the Jews the characters are the rebel leader John, the Sicarii, and the group that the Sicarii conscripts. If the New Testa ment's Gadara pas- sage is a satire of Josephus' description of the ba ttle, the demon-pos- sessed man in the New Testament from whom the \"legi on\" sprang would be a satire of John, the rebel leader from wh ose \"one head\" the wickedness came forth. Following this logic, th e legion of demons that sprang from one individual in the New T estament would lampoon the Sicarii in War of the Jews, who a re described as \"too small for an army, and too many for a gang of thieves,\" and the \"swine\" in the New Testament would satirize the gro up that the Sicarii \"infected\" in Josephus' passage. The premise that the characters in the two tales co ncerning Gadara are meant to be understood as the same indiv iduals but with different names also seems to answer my question ab out whether the two thousand demons drowned with the swine they infected. The demons who infected the swine in the New Testam ent must be a satirical representation of the 2,200 Sicarii who escaped drowning and were captured alive at Gadara. Josephus appears to complete this comical interacti on with the New Testament by pointing out that while many diffe rent animals were captured, none were swine: \"A mighty prey was taken also, consisting of asses, and sheep, and camels, and oxe n.\" Why were no swine captured? Because in the New Testament's stor y of Gadara the swine had drowned and therefore could not be captur ed in the par- allel passage in War of the Jews."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"66 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH While the structure of this satire is more complex than the oth- ers I have shown, the humor itself is very straight forward. It simply denigrates the Sicarii as demons and unclean spirit s, and the people they recruited as swine. No doubt this was the way the Flavian fam- ily felt about the rebels. Many of Jesus' prophecies have been long understood to foresee events from the war between the Romans and the Jews . It is there- fore strange that the relationship between the two passages has not been noticed before, the Gospels' Gadara story bein g a \"prophecy\" of an event from the war that Josephus recorded as having \"come to pass.\" This oversight is particularly odd in light of the fact that the Gospels' Gadara story is, in and of itself, incoher ent. Within the con- text of the New Testament there is no theological o r moral principle that can be gleaned from the story of a legion of d emons that enter a herd of swine that then run wildly into the river and drown. How- ever, when it is viewed as a satire of Josephus' de scription of the bat- tle of Gadara, the New Testament passage makes perf ect sense. Another seemingly incoherent aspect of Jesus' encou nter with the demoniac that this interpretation makes clear o ccurs in the ver- sion of the story found in Matthew. Wherein, upon s eeing Jesus, the demon-possessed men cry out, \"What have we to do wi th you, Jesus, you Son of God? Have you come here to torment us be fore the time?\" 62 The question the demons are asking is unanswerable within the literal context of the passage. What \"time\" are they referring to? However, this question is answered by the interpret ation I offer. If the demons are lampoons of the leaders of the Jewish re bellion, the time of their torment is clear. They are prophesying the torment experi- enced by John and Simon at the end of their war aga inst the Romans. Further, if the New Testament's passage is a satire of the battle of Gadara, notice that it is a specific satire of J osephus' passage and not of some tradition regarding the battle that Jos ephus might have shared with the authors of the New Testament. For e xample, the demoniac referring to himself as \"Legion\" only make s satirical sense as a comic parallel to Josephus' unique description of the rebel band as being \"too small for an army, and too many for a gang of thieves.\" This is an important point in that it indicates tha t parts of the New"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"The Demons of Gadara 67 Testament and War of the Jews were designed to be r ead interactively, or intertextually. Josephus' description of the manner in which John h ad spread his \"infection\" is similar to Jesus' description of the \"unclean spir- its\" who left one man and infected many others. \"Now as it is in a human body, if the principal par t be inflamed, all the members are subject to the same distemper.\" This similarity is especially clear when one consid ers that in first-century Judea \"demons\" were considered to be responsible for fevers and other illnesses. The Dead Sea Scrolls ac tually describe a \"fever demon.\" 63 When Josephus uses \"infection\" as an analogy for the Sicarii's activity he is practically likening t hem to demons. I therefore decided to review the New Testament and War of the Jews for examples to support the premise that the N ew Testament lampoons the Sicarii as \"demons.\" During this analy sis it became clear that Jesus and Josephus each referred to the same \"wicked gen- eration,\" the generation that crucified Christ and then rebelled against Rome, as having been infected by \"demons.\" In the following passage, for example, Jesus specif ically foresees that \"unclean spirits,\" or demons, would possess th is \"wicked gen- eration.\" Notice that Jesus makes the point that on e \"unclean spirit\" can infect many, which parallels Josephus' descript ion of the wicked- ness passing from \"one head\" to many. Jesus also st ates that the unclean spirits pass through \"waterless places.\" Wh ich can be seen as a satirical way of stating that demons cannot pa ss through water, thereby linking the passage to what puzzled me rega rding the fate of the two thousand demons. The idea that demons are u nable to pass through water runs through both the New Testament a nd the works of Josephus. When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he p asses through waterless places seeking rest, but he finds none. Then he says, \"I will return to my house from which I came.\" And when he comes he finds it empty, swept, and put in order.

So shall it be also with this evil generation. 64 Jesus' linking of the \"evil generation\" to demonica lly possessed men who infected others mirrors my interpretation o f the New Tes- tament's Gadara passage, wherein 1 concluded that t he \"Sicarii\" were demons who infected others with their \"wickedness.\" When Jesus referred to a \"wicked generation\" he appears to hav e been referring to the Sicarii, who rebelled against Rome. This pro position is espe- cially clear in light of the fact that to Jews of t his era a \"generation\" was forty years, which was the exact time span betw een Jesus' res- urrection and the final destruction of the Sicarii at Masada. The understanding that a \"generation\" lasted forty years comes from the Pentateuch. And the Lord's anger was kindled against Israel, an d he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, unt il all the generation that had done evil in the sight of t he Lord was consumed. 65 Many Christians currently hold a different position regarding Jesus' doomsday prophecies, believing that they do not refer to the generation of Jews that lived during his lifetime. Instead, they believe that Jesus was speaking about some unspecif ied time still in the future. I feel that this \"futurist\" understandi ng is incorrect and has the effect of obfuscating Jesus' words, thereby making it difficult to understand the meaning they conveyed in the firs t century. No real understanding of the New Testament is possible without know- ing what Jesus meant when he used the word \"generat ion.\" The Greek word in the New Testament that has been t ranslated as \"generation\" is genea. Early in the 20th century some Christian scholars began to posit that Jesus' use of this wor d was meant to indicate not the \"generation\" of Jews alive during his lifetime, but rather the entire \"race\" of Jews, which would not p ass away \"with- out all these things having first taken place.\" It is easy to understand their desire for such a de finition. If Jesus is referring to those Jews alive during his lifetim e then his \"Second Coming\" must have occurred in 70 A.D. Such an under standing leaves Christianity in an awkward position. This is because if Jesus'"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The Demons of Gadara 69 \"Second Coming\" had occurred during the war between the Romans and the Jews, why was it Titus and not Jesus who de molished the temple and destroyed the \"wicked generation\"? The Christian theologian C. I. Scofield recognized this dilemma and in his Bible reference switched the definition of the word genea to that of genos, an entirely different word meanin g \"race.\" However, scholars showed that the New Testament's use of gen ea could only be referring to the Jews of Jesus' lifetime and not to the entire Jew- ish race, thereby debunking Scofield's position. 66 The understanding that Jesus was specifically refer ring to the generation of Jews alive at the time he spoke the w ords was certainly the understanding held during the Middle Ages. For example, the following notes were found written alongside Matthe w 24:34 in a Bible dated 1599. \"This age: the word generation or age is here being used for the men of this age.\" 67 We are on solid ground in understanding that Jesus was referring solely to the generation of Jew s who were alive during the 40 years between his ministry and the de struction of Jerusalem. However, if this is correct, then Jesus and Josephus were referring to the same group as the \"wicked generati on.\" Notice in the following passages how similar Jesus' and Josep hus' understand- ing was regarding \"demons,\" the \"wicked generation, \" and the Sicarii. From Josephus: . . . had the Romans made any longer delay in comin g against these villains, the city would either have been swal- lowed up by the ground opening upon them, or been o ver- flowed by water, or else been destroyed by such thu nder as the country of Sodom perished by, for it had brough t forth a generation of men much more atheistical than were t hose that suffered such. 68 . . .

For example, the Hebr ew scholar Joseph Klausner completely missed the connection. H e wrote: At that time even educated people and those who had imbibed of the Greek culture such as Josephus, such nerve cases and cases of insanity as cases of \"possession \" by some devil or evil or unclean spirit, and believed in cures and that certain men could perform miracles. 70 "},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The Demons of Gadara 71 In fact, Josephus did not believe that demons were \"nerve cases\" and gave a precise definition as to what they were. He stated that demons were the spirits of the wicked. Demons . . . are no other than the spirits of the w icked. 71 This definition indicates that Josephus saw the Sic arii as \"demons\" in that he constantly describes the rebels as \"wicked.\" Josephus also links the Sicarii with \"demons\" in an other way. He describes the Sicarii as moving \"with a demoniacal fury\" 72 as they went to kill their families at the end of the siege of Masada. Like Jesus, Josephus makes it clear who the \"wicked\" are . They are the generation of Jews that rebelled against Rome. That neither did any other city ever suffer such mi series, nor did any age ever breed a generation more fruitf ul in wickedness than this was, from the beginning of the world. 73 Thus, Jesus and Josephus share a narrow understandi ng and express it with the same vocabulary: that the gener ation of Jews who lived between 33 C.E. and 73 C.E. were \"wicked\" bec ause they had been \"infected\" by a demonic spirit. This shared un derstanding is suspicious. Jesus could only view the \"wickedness\" of this genera- tion by looking into the future, and yet he not onl y held the same opinion of the generation as Josephus, he used the same words in describing it. Returning to the version of the story of the demoni ac of Gadara found in Matthew, where Jesus meets two demons, in War of the Jews we learn that were two \"tyrants\" or leaders of the Jewish rebellion, John, described above, and a Simon. Since my analys is suggests that the New Testament is satirizing John in the version that describes a single demon of Gadara, it seemed logical to ask wh ether the version describing two demoniacs was satirizing both leader s of the Jewish rebellion, John and Simon.

This event struck me as a par allel to the description of the demon-possessed men \"coming out of the tombs\" in the New Testament. The passage in War of the Jews that describes these caverns con- firms that they are indeed \"tombs.\" The Romans slew some of them, some they carried cap - tives, and others they made a search for under grou nd, and when they found where they were, they broke up the ground and slew all they met with. There were also found s lain there above two thousand persons, partly by their o wn hands, and partly by one another, but chiefly destr oyed by the famine; but then the ill savor of the dead bodi es was most offensive to those that lighted upon them, ins omuch that some were obliged to get away immediately . . . 74 As I have mentioned, the demon-possessed man at Gad ara is described as \"cutting himself with stones.\" 75 Cutting oneself with \"stones\" is, of course, unusual—a stone is not a to ol someone would normally use to cut with. What is the author of thi s passage actually referring to? 1 realized that if the demoniacs of G adara are intended to satirize the rebel leaders, then there was a com ic answer to this question. The phrase in the New Testament where the demoniac is \"in the tombs . . . cutting himself with stones\" shares a c omic relationship with the passage in War of the Jews that describes the \"tombs\" that John and Simon take refuge in. The joke comes from the unan- swered question in Mark 5:5. This question being, w hat does one call someone who cuts himself with stones? In a pas sage in War of the Jews relating to the rebel leader's hiding in t he \"tombs\" we learn the absurdly obvious answer. Someone who cuts himse lf with stones is, of course, called a \"stonecutter.\" This Simon, during the siege of Jerusalem, was in t he upper city; but when the Roman army was gotten with in the walls, and were laying the city waste, he then took the most faithful of his friends with him, and among them so me that were stonecutters, with those iron tools which belo nged to their occupation. 76 "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The Demons of Gadara 73 The version of the Gadara encounter in Matthew does not describe the fate of either of its two demon-posses sed men. How- ever, if the demoniacs were spoofs of the leaders o f the Jewish rebel- lion, then the version in Mark, which describes onl y one possessed man, must tell the fate of John. I reached this conclusion because the passage concl udes with the statement \"Him that was possessed with the devi l, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind , and began to pub- lish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done f or him.\" 77 If the New Testament was lampooning Simon and John, the leaders of the Jewish rebellion, then the individua l who was restored to his \"right mind\" and who went to Decapolis could only have been John. This is because Josephus records that, after being captured, John was given life imprisonment while Simon was ta ken to Rome and executed. Following this logic, it could only h ave been John, then, who \"began to publish in Decapolis.\" So my musings raised the question of whether John t he Zealot, leader of the Jewish rebellion, had assisted the Ro mans in creating Christian literature while he was imprisoned in Dec apolis. And fur- ther, I wondered exactly what literature this indiv idual could have helped the Romans create? The only known Christian literature from this era is the New Testament itself. There wa s, of course, someone named \"John\" who wrote a Gospel. While the premise that the Apostle John was a lampo on of the John who was the leader of the rebellion was based at this point in my analysis as much on imagination as evidence, it was consistent with the style of black humor I felt was in play wi thin the passages analyzed previously. Of course, if the Apostle John is a lampoon of the rebel John, then it would follow that the Apost le Simon is also a lampoon of the other rebel leader, Simon. Since my analysis of the New Testament's Gadara pas sages sug- gest that the Sicarii were lampooned as demons in t he New Testa- ment, I first attempted to determine if there were other New Testa- ment passages concerning demons that might support the proposition regarding the relationship between rebe l leaders John and Simon and the two Apostles. During this search I noticed the"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"74 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH following passage from the Gospel of John, which st ates that the Apostle Judas was the \"son of Simon the Iscariot.\" \"Did not I choose you—the Twelve?\" said Jesus, \"and even of you one is a devil.\" He alluded to Judas, the son of Simon the Iscariot. For he it was who, though one of the Twelve, was afterw ards to betray Him. John 6:70-71 Scholars have commented on the possibility that \"Is cariot,\" the last name of Judas, is somehow related to \"Sicarii, \" the word Jose- phus uses to describe the messianic rebels. As Robe rt Eisenman notes, the only difference between the two Greek wo rds the switch- ing of the iota, or \"I,\" with the sigma, or \"s.\" I concur, and will show below that it is simply one of the many puns that t he author(s) of Josephus and the New Testament use in challenging t he reader to discover that the two works describe the same chara cters. I determined that the following passage from the Go spel of Matthew could be read as a satire on John, the lead er of the rebellion, as well as on the \"wicked generation.\" Notice that \"John\" is accused of having a demon because he is not eating and drin king, which cer- tainly can be likened to the rebel John's situation in the subterranean caverns. John is shown as a mirror opposite of the \"Son of M an,\" who is eating and drinking and is \"the friend of tax gathe rers,\" and who will \"upbraid towns\" \"because they had not repented \"—this descrip- tion of Jesus having a clear parallel in Titus' act ivities in Judea. Therefore, if the passage has the satirical meaning I suspected, then the \"John\" described within the passage is meant to be understood as John, the leader of the rebellion, and Jesus' pr ophecy is actually envisioning Titus' campaign through Judea. But to what shall I compare the present generation? It is like children sitting in the open places, who call to their playmates. \"We have played the flute to you,\" they say, \"and you have not danced: we have sung dirges, and you h ave not beaten your breasts.\""},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The Demons of Gadara 75 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, \"He has a demon.\" The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they exclaim, \"See this man!—given to gluttony and tippl ing, and a friend of tax-gatherers and notorious sinners!\" A nd yet Wisdom is vindicated by her actions. Then began He to upbraid the towns where most of Hi s mighty works had been done—because they had not repented. Matt. 11:16-20 My analysis of the New Testament story of the demon s of Gadara suggests that the \"subterranean caverns\" the Jewish rebels fled into at the end of the siege of Jerusalem were satirized as \"tombs\" within the New Testament. The following passage from the G ospel of John appeared to me to be using this theme. However, not ice that if this interpretation is correct, then in the passage Jesu s is actually com- paring himself to Titus, in that Titus is the indiv idual sent by \"god,\" that is, his father Vespasian, to hand out \"life,\" or \"judgment,\" to the Jews hidden in \"tombs,\" that is, the caverns beneat h Jerusalem. I shall return to this point below. This interpretation also indicates a different orig in for the Christian concept of \"resurrection\" than that tradi tionally held. It is not based only on the Pharisaic belief that God wil l return the dead to life, but rather is a satire on the raising of t he dead, that is, those Jews found buried within the tombs under Jerusalem at the end of the siege. If this is correct, it is another exampl e of the theme of Jesus seemingly speaking symbolically but Josephus' history show- ing a comicly literal meaning to his words. For as the Father has life in himself, so he has gr anted the Son also to have life in himself, and has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man.

Further analysis o f the New Testa- ment produced more examples of this kind but nothin g that pro- vided the clarity 1 sought. Finally, I realized wha t had been staring me in the face the entire time. There is a passage within the New Testament that provides extraordinary support for t he premise that the Apostles Simon and John were lampoons of the Je wish rebel leaders Simon and John. The Gospel of John concludes with a discussion betw een Simon (Peter) and Jesus. Jesus foresees that Simon will b e bound and car- ried \"where you do not wish to go.\" Jesus also tell s Simon that he will have a martyr's death, \"to glorify God.\" In th e midst of this dis- cussion, \"the disciple that Jesus loved,\" clearly m eaning the Apostle John, appears. Simon asks Jesus what the fate of Jo hn is to be. Jesus replies, \"It is my will that he remain.\" The passag e then points out that John \"is the disciple who is bearing witness t o these things, and who has written these things\" referring to the Gosp el of John itself. Below is the entire passage. Notice how the author goes to great lengths to avoid calling the Apostles by their real names, Simon and John. Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, yo u girded yourself and walked where you would; but when you a re old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will g ird you and carry you where you do not wish to go.\" (This he said to show by what death he was to glori fy God.) And after this he said to him, \"Follow me.\" Peter turned and saw following them the disciple wh om Jesus loved, who had lain close to his breast at th e supper and had said, \"Lord, who is it that is going to bet ray you?' When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, \"Lord, what about this man?'"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The Demons of Gadara 77 Jesus said to him, \"If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?

John 21:18-24 This passage, which is the conclusion to Jesus' min istry, is exactly parallel to Titus' judgments concerning the rebel leaders Simon and John at the conclusion of his campaign th rough Judea. Thus, at the conclusion of the Gospel above, Jesus tells Simon \"when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go. \" Jesus tells Simon to \"follow me\" and that his death will \"glori fy God.\" How- ever, Jesus also states that it is his will that Jo hn is to \"remain.\" At the conclusion of his campaign through Judea, Ti tus, after capturing \"Simon,\" girds him in \"bonds\" and sends h im \"where you do not wish to go,\" this being Rome. During the par ade of conquest at Rome, Simon follows, that is, is \"led\" to a \"dea th, to glorify God,\" the god \"glorified\" being Titus' father, the diuus Vespasian. However, it is Titus' will to spare the other leader of the rebellion, John. Notice that in the following passage Josephus recor ds Simon's fate before John's, just as it occurs in John 21. A seemingly innocu- ous detail but one that I will show has great signi ficance. Simon . . . was forced to surrender himself, as we shall relate hereafter; so he was reserved for the triump h, and to be then slain; as was John condemned to perpetual i mpris- onment. 78 Josephus also records that Jesus' vision of Simon \" following\" also comes to pass for the rebel leader Simon. Simon ... had then been led in this triumph among t he cap- tives; a rope had also been put upon his head, and he had been drawn into a proper place in the forum. 79 "},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"78 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH In the passage from the Gospel of John above, notic e that the author does not call the Apostle John by his name b ut rather as \"the disciple whom Jesus loved,\" and as the individual w ho had said at the Last Supper, \"Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?\" Later in the chapter the author identifies this disciple with yet another epithet when he states, \"This is the disciple who t estifies of these things, and wrote these things\"—even here not refer ring to John by name but requiring the reader to determine it by kn owing the name of the author of the Gospel. The author's use of ep ithets here, instead of simply referring to the disciple as \"Joh n,\" seems clearly an attempt to keep the parallel conclusion of Jesus' a nd Titus' \"min- istries\" from being too easily seen. 80 The author also has Jesus call Simon by his nickname, \"Peter,\" for the same reason . The same technique is used throughout the New Testa ment and War of the Jews. To learn the name of an unnamed ch aracter, the reader must be able to recall details from another, related passage. In effect, the New Testament is designed as a sort of an intelligence test whose true meaning can be understood only by those possessing sufficient memory, logic, and humor. For clarification, I present the following table sh owing the par- allels between the ends of Jesus' ministry and Titu s' campaign: 1) Characters are named Simon and John 2) Both sets of characters are judged 3) Both sides of the parallel occur at the conclusion of a \"cam- paign\" 4) In each, Simon goes to a martyr's death after being placed in bonds and taken someplace he does not wish to go 5) In each, John is spared 6) In each, Simon \"follows\" Further, the two events continue the theme of a pro phecy made in one work being fulfilled in the other. In other words, what Jesus predicts, Josephus records as having \"come to pass. \" This group of parallels seems too complex to have o ccurred by chance and provides direct support for my premise t hat the Apos- tles Simon and John were lampoons of the leaders of the Jewish rebellion, as well as my suspicion that the \"Son of Man,\" whose"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The Demons of Gadara 79 coming the New Testament predicts will bring destru ction to Jerusalem, is Titus.

It is, therefore, quite implausible that the New Testa ment describes, by chance, so many episodes that can be seen as satiri zing the events in a single book. Moreover, while it is possible to argue that each N ew Testament episode that appears to satirize an event in War of the Jews does so accidentally, if that were the case then these acci dents would occur in a random sequence and at random locations. It wa s not required that Jesus use the expression \"fishers of men\" whil e standing on the beach at Gennesareth, any more than it was required that he meet the demoniac at Gadara.

The fact that these four e vents occur in the New Testament in the same sequence and at the same location as their parallel events in War of the Jews strongly s upports the con- tention that one work was created with the other in mind. Two four- sided dice, for example, will each land with the sa me side up four times in a row only once in two hundred and fifty-s ix throws. Therefore, the parallel sequences, concepts, and lo cations make the authors' intent clear. In the same way that the y show the first savior of Israel, Moses, to have been the \"type\" of Jesus, the second savior of Israel, through their parallel infancy ex periences, they also \"prove\" that Titus is the last and greatest \"savior \" because Jesus' ministry is the \"type\" of Titus' campaign through J udea. Finally, the parallel sequences of Jesus' and Titus ' \"ministries\" must be considered in the context of their historic al overlaps. As I noted above, Jesus predicted that a \"Son of God\" wo uld come to Judea before the generation that crucified him had passed away, then encircle Jerusalem with a wall and destroy the temp le. Titus is the only individual in history who can be seen as havin g fulfilled these prophecies. Such a combination of historical singularities coul d not occur by chance. This is self-evident. Therefore, the only p lausible explana-"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Demons of Gadara 81 tion for the similar story lines is that these part s of Jesus' ministry were deliberately created to parallel Titus' campai gn through Judea. History has shown, of course, that the comic aspect of the par- allels between the two \"Sons of God\" are not easy t o see. Within the Flavian court, however, where \"foreign cults in Rom e\" were care- fully scrutinized and knowledge of Titus' exploits was common, those responsible for overseeing the Empire's relig ions would have recognized the satirical parallels between Jesus an d Titus and seen them as humorous. The purpose of these parallels, moreover, was not m erely to cre- ate an amusing satire for patricians. I will show i n the following chapter that the authors of the New Testament use p arallelism to create a story entirely different from the one that appears on its sur- face—a story that reveals the hidden identity of th e \"Jesus\" who interacts with the disciples at the conclusion of t he Gospels. Moreover, understanding that Jesus' ministry shares a parallel story line and characters with Titus' campaign crea tes a way to understand a lot about the New Testament. Simply mo ving the events of Jesus' ministry forward forty years in ti me and comparing them to the events of Titus' campaign reveals their satirical meaning. For example, whoever put Jesus' prophecy about the fate of Simon and John at the conclusion of the Gospel of John di d so solely to have the conclusion of the Gospels comically mirror the end of Titus' campaign. The discussion between Jesus and Simon co uld have occurred at any time during Jesus' ministry or been recorded in any of the other Gospels, or not been included at all, since it contains no important theological ideas. This method also reveals the satirical basis for Si mon's nick- name, Peter, which in Greek is Petros, meaning \"roc k\" or \"stone.\" It is a joke relating to Josephus' description of the circumstance of the real Simon's capture. As stated above, in trying to escape Roman-occupied Jerusalem, Simon fled into a subterranean cavern with a group of stonecutters and attempted to dig an escape passage. Unable to c arve through rock and out of food, he was forced to surrender. H e did so in an extraordinary fashion. Josephus writes:"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"82 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH Simon, thinking he might be able to astonish and el ude the Romans, put on a white frock, and buttoned upon him a purple cloak, and appeared out of the ground in the place where the temple had formerly been. 81 The humor is subtle. In the comic logic of the New Testament's Simon's epithet, \"stone\" satirizes Josephus' depict ion of Simon being captured with a group of stonecutters, who, of cour se, cut \"stone.\" As he came \"out of the ground in the place where th e temple had formerly been\" he was, therefore, the first \"stone\" upon which the new \"temple,\" Christianity, was to be built. Once a gain, though Jesus appears to have spoken metaphorically when he tells Simon that he is the \"stone\" upon which he will build a n ew church that will replace Judaism, Josephus records an event sho wing another, comic, meaning to Jesus' words. And I declare to you that you are Peter, and that u pon this Stone I will build my Church . . . Matt. 16:18.14 The depiction of Simon coming out of a cavern that is a \"tomb\" and contains a group of stonecutters also provides satirical confir- mation of the premise that Simon the Apostle and th e demoniac of Gadara were both lampoons of Simon the leader of th e Jewish rebel- lion. This is because the humor regarding \"stonecut ters\" creates a parallel between the demoniac of Gadara and the reb el leader Simon. And since the passages are parallel, the unnamed ch aracter in one would have the same name as his named \"type\" in the other; in this case \"Simon\" is the name of one of the demoniacs of Gadara. Understanding this simple point of logic enables a reader to learn the names of many the unnamed characters in t he New Testa- ment and War of the Jews, and the real identity of Jesus. I will also show that far from being unusual, the use of intert extual parallels to exchange information between passages was commonpla ce in the Judaic literature of this era. The New Testament's comic theme regarding \"rock\" an d \"stone\" appears to be satire on a well-known metaphorical t heme found throughout the Dead Sea Scrolls, that of the \"found ation of rock.\" In the following example from the Thanksgiving Hymn, n otice that the"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The Demons of Gadara 83 author sees himself, like the rebel leader Simon, a s entering a \"forti- fied city\" and \"seeks refuge behind a high wall.\" But I shall be as one who enters a fortified city, As one who seeks refuge behind a high wall Until deliverance [comes]; I will (lean on) Thy truth; O my God. For Thou wilt set the foundation on rock And the frameworks by the measuring cord of justice ; And the tried stones {Thou will lay} 82 The comic logic that links the New Testament to War of the Jews also makes clear the basis for the epithet of the A postle John, which is \"the disciple whom Jesus loved.\" John was the \"love d disciple\" be- cause he was the captive leader whom Titus spared. Further, the real meaning of Jesus' criticism of his disciples—for ex ample, his describ- ing the Apostles \"Simon\" and \"John\" as having demon s—is now also apparent. Having maliciously satirized the leaders of the messianic movement as Jesus' Apostles, the Roman authors of t he New Testa- ment then \"record\" Jesus lecturing his Apostles on their wickedness. In the Gospel of Luke there is a passage that warns Simon of his being possessed by \"Satan\" and reiterates the conce pt that Simon is going to prison and to death \"with\" Jesus. It also repeats the theme of the demoniac of Gadara (Simon), who returns to h is true self after Satan has been repelled. It is another example of J esus making state- ments that seem metaphoric but have literal and com ic meaning when read in conjunction with War of the Jews. \"Sim on\" did indeed go with his \"master\" to prison and death, his \"mast er\" being Titus. Though in the past the following passage has mystif ied scholars, its meaning is now clear. \"Simon, Simon, I tell you that Satan has obtained p ermis- sion to have all of you to sift as wheat is sifted. \"But T have prayed for 'you' that your faith may no t fail, and you, when at last you have come back to your tr ue self, must strengthen your brethren.\" \"Master,\" replied Peter, \"with you I am ready to go both to prison and to death.\" Luke 22:33"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"84 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH Continuing this comic theme in the Gospel of Mark, Jesus actu- ally calls the Apostle Simon \"Satan.\" His strange r emark about the founder of his church is rendered coherent when one understands that Jesus is referring, in the Roman context, to t he rebel Simon. The reader will note that the mysteriousness of many of Jesus' sayings disappears when they are understood within the cont ext 1 suggest. In the passage, Jesus repeats the command to Simon that he gives at the conclusion of the Gospel of John above. That is , to \"follow me\" with a cross to your doom. And Peter took him and began to rebuke him, saying, \"God forbid, Lord! This shall never happen to you.\" But he turned and said to Peter, \"Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me; for you are not o n the side of God, but of men.\" Then Jesus told his disciples, \"If any man would co me after me, let him deny himself and take up my cross and follow me. \"For whoever would save his life will lose it, and who- ever loses his life for my sake will find it.\" Matt. 16:21-25 In the passage above, from Matthew, notice that Jes us tells his disciples to \"take up his cross\" and follow. In the passage below, from Luke, we learn that, in fact, \"Simon,\" called a \"Cyrenaean,\" did indeed \"take up his cross\" and \"follow\" Jesus. Noti ce how deliber- ately the author conveys the idea that a \"Simon\" \"f ollowed\" Jesus with a cross. As soon as they led Him away, they laid hold on one Simon, a Cyrenaean, who was coming in from the country, an d on his shoulders they put the cross, for him to carry it behind Jesus. Luke 23:26 The structure of the comedy involved in Simon's \"fo llowing with a cross\" is familiar. If one interprets Jesus' words metaphori- cally they can be seen to have a spiritual meaning, but if interpreted literally they are black comedy."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The Demons of Gadara 85 The Apostle Paul is also engaged in the lampooning of Simon's execution. But when Cephas [Simon] came to Antioch I opposed h im to his face, because he stood condemned. Gal 2:11 The strange tale of Simon's three denials of Jesus is also part of the sequence of events shared by the New Testament and War of the Jews. The tale is one of the most famous stories in the New Testa- ment and is found in all four Gospels. The maid who kept the door said to Peter, \"Are not you also one of this man's disciples?\" He said, \"I am not.\" Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said to him, \"Are not you also one of his disc iples?\" He denied it and said, \"I am not.\" One of the servants of the high priest, a kinsman o f the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, \"Did I not see you in the garden with him?\" Peter again denied it; and at once the cock crowed. John 18:25-27 When I had determined that the Apostle Simon was a lampoon of Simon the leader of the Jewish rebels, and that there was a paral- lel sequence of events in War of the Jews and the N ew Testament, I was curious to determine if War of the Jews contain ed a parallel to the New Testament story describing Simon's three denial s of Jesus. In fact, just scanning War of the Jews where Simon's \"denial s\" would have occurred, that is, immediately following the captur e on the Mount of Olives, reveals a passage in which Titus states that three times he has exhorted Simon to \"peace\" and three times he ha d been denied. This bridge it was that lay between the tyrants and Caesar, and parted them; while the multitude stood on each side; those of the Jewish nation about Simon and John, wi th great hopes of pardon; and the Romans about Caesar, in great expectation how Titus would receive their sup plica- tion . . .

He then returns to his \"right mind \" and feels remorse. This is a comic depiction of the true Simo n's three refusals to surrender and then his being, as Josephus record s, \"made sensi- ble\" once he has been captured by the Romans. In the Christian tradition, \"Simon the Apostle\" suf fers a martyr's death at Rome. In fact his execution, in the manner and approximate year that the Christian tradition maintains, is des cribed by Josephus. Simon is not, however, a Christian martyr but a Jew ish one. In retrospect, it seems hard to understand why, wit h the excep- tion of Robert Eisenman, scholars have not commente d on the par- allels between the Christian Simon and his Jewish c ounterpart, be- cause they are obvious. Both Simons were leaders of a Judean messianic movement engaged in missionary activity w ho suffered a martyr's death at Rome in approximately the same ye ar. How many such individuals could there have been? The traditional time span given as likely for the C hristian Simon's death is between July 64 C.E. (the purported date o f the outbreak of the Neronian persecution) and 68 C.E. The rebel Sim on was mar- tyred in 70 or 71 C.E. And, as shown above, both ca n be seen as the \"cornerstone\" of the church that replaces one that is destroyed. Fur- ther, both Simons are recorded as having a relation ship with the Fla- vian family. St. Jerome and Tertullian both refer t o the tradition that \"Simon\" ordained Clement, the purported Flavian pop e. This tradition that the early church scholars refer to is signifi- cant in that it not only links the Flavian family t o the origin of Christianity but, if correct, creates a conundrum f or the religion. If"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"The Demons of Gadara 87 Simon did ordain Clement it would suggest that he w as not mar- tyred by Nero, but later, by the Flavians. However, it is hard to imag- ine that Simon would have handed over control of hi s movement to a member of the family that was about to execute hi m. My explanation resolves this paradox. If the rebel Simon and the Christian Simon were the same individual, then his being mar- tyred by the Flavians and also handing control of t he religion over to them becomes understandable. The tradition that Simon ordained a Flavian as pope and then was executed by that fam ily simply reflects the truth. The Flavians executed Simon and then passed control over his messianic cult (now \"Christianity\" ) to family mem- bers. Later Christian scholars attempting to organi ze the history of the religion recognized that such a direct connecti on to the Flavian family was problematic. Therefore, they simply inse rted popes between Simon and Clement. This led to the two list s of popes, the one that the Church officially claims, and the one that Tertullian and Jerome knew of, which had the succession go directl y from Simon to a member of the Flavian family. Scholars have puzzled over why Paul always refers t o Simon as \"Cephas,\" the Aramaic equivalent of Peter. My expla nation is that the authors of the New Testament determined that to refer to the Apostle as \"Simon\" during the period when the real Simon's life is covered in War of the Jews might make the ruse too obvious. Even hoi polloi might notice that the two Simons were su spiciously simi- lar. The authors of the New Testament therefore cha nged the Apos- tle's from \"Simon\" to \"Simon Peter,\" then to \"Peter ,\" and finally to \"Cephas\" as their narration comes closer to the tim e when the real Simon leads the rebellion. The creators of the Roman church had literally used the Sicarii leader as the \"rock\" upon which they \"built\" the ch urch that would worship their pacifistic, tax-paying Messiah. By ap propriating the real Simon's name and position of authority, they w ere able to \"graft\" the Apostle Simon onto the history of Christianity. The New Testament has numerous Simons: 1) Simon the Apostle 2) Simon called Zelotes or the Kanaites 3) Simon, the father of Judas, who betrayed Jesus"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"88 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH 4) Simon Magus, the Samaritan wizard 5) Simon the tanner, Acts 10 6) Simon the Pharisee, Luke 7:40-44 7) Simon of Cyrene who carried the cross of Christ 8) Simon, the brother of Jesus, the son of Cleophas 9) Simon the leper 10) Simon Peter The idea that the New Testament obfuscates the simi larities between the Apostle Simon and Simon, the leader of the Jewish rebellion, by constantly changing the Apostle's nam e suggested to me that all the \"Simons\" in the New Testament might be lampoons of the Jewish leader. Supporting this conjecture wa s the fact that while Jesus gave instructions to \"Simon the Apostle \" to \"follow him\" with a cross, it was \"Simon the Cyrene\" who carried out the prophecy, indicating that these two \"Simons\" were l ampoons of the same individual. Further, it seemed clear that the Simon who was the father of Judas the \"Iscariot,\" was also a lamp oon of the rebel Simon who was likely to have been a Sicarii. Simon the \"Zealot\" also seems a likely epithet for Simon the leader of the Jewish \"Zealots\" in the war against Rome. The idea that the \"Simons\" within the New Testament were cre- ated as a unified comic theme sheds light on a para llel phenomenon within the New Testament, that of the many \"Marys.\" \"Mary,\" like \"Simon,\" is the name of numerous characters within the New Testa- ment. In fact, it is the name of every female chara cter central to Jesus' ministry: 1) Mary, the mother of Jesus 2) Mary Magdalene 3) Mary, the sister of Lazarus and Martha of Bethany 4) Mary of Cleophas, the mother of James the less 5) Mary, the mother of John Mark, a sister of Barnabas 6) Martha, the sister of Lazarus and Mary of Bethany Martha, Lazarus' sister, is on this list because Ma rtha is the Ara- maic approximation of the Hebrew name Mary. The nam es both stem from the word for rebellion. Martha is Aramaic for \"she was rebellious\" and Mary is Hebrew for \"their rebellion .\" 84 "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The Demons of Gadara 89 There is no known Hebrew tradition of giving sister s the same name. The fact that the New Testament records that a family so cen- tral to Christianity's origin had chosen to do so s uggests to me that all the characters named Mary in the Gospels might, as I suspect of all the Simons, be lampoons. A passage in the Gospe l of John that states that Mary the mother of Jesus also had a sis ter named Mary supports this premise. Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother, a nd His mother's sister Mary, the wife of Clopas, and M ary Magdalene. John 19:25 It is quite improbable that the two families most c entral to Jesus' ministry would have each had, by chance, two sister s named Mary. Many scholars have commented on the dubiousness of Mary's sister being named Mary. For example Eisenman wrote, Mary did not have a sister Mary. This confusion was based on either separate and conflicting descriptions of Mary before the redaction of these traditions or simply a gram- matical error in the Greek. Eisenman is correct in stating that Mary did not ha ve a sister with the same name, but there is a better explanati on for the many Marys than \"grammatical error.\" All the Marys in the New Testament, together with t he sole Mary in War of the Jews, the mother who ate her son 's flesh, are part of a comic theme like that created by the various S imons. Given that the name Mary stems from the word \"rebellion,\" I be lieve that these lampoons were not based on a historical individual but on an arche- type. In other words, all the female members of the militant mes- sianic movement the Sicarii would have been known a s Marys to the Romans, because they were all \"rebellious.\" This in sight is impor- tant in understanding Mary Magdalene's key role in the New Testa- ment's satire on the resurrection of Jesus. That the sole Mary in War of the Jews would have su ch a con- nection to the New Testament, a work in which all o f the central females are also named Mary, is unlikely to have be en circumstantial."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"90 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH I would conjecture that during the war \"Mary\" becam e a Roman nickname for female rebels in much the same manner that enemy soldiers have been referred to by a single name dur ing the modern era. For example, Americans soldiers called their e nemy \"Charley\" during the Vietnam War and \"Kraut\" during World War II. One can imagine a Roman centurion ordering all the \"Marys\" to be separated from the men following the capture of a group of Je wish rebels. This theme may have then been continued by the authors o f the New Tes- tament to comically make the point that all the fem ale followers of the Messiah were rebellious. In any event, it is clear that to a reader within t he Flavian court the New Testament's naming of all of the female fol lowers of the Messiah Mary—that is, \"rebellious female\"—would hav e been seen as another comic stroke. Imagine such an individual reading of a savior who told his followers to \"follow me\" and be come \"fishers for men\" on the beach at Gennesareth, and who described his flesh as \"living bread\" at Jerusalem, having both his mother and every other female member of his entourage named Mary. To cogno scenti of the Flavian court, the Gospels were burlesque. Understa nding that the authors of the New Testament created comic themes r egarding indi- viduals with the same name is a critical insight th at will enable one to learn the real identity of Lazarus in the follow ing chapter. Further, knowing that the rebel leaders were transf ormed into the Christian Apostles clarifies the intent the Rom ans had for their religion. The Romans wished to not merely destroy t he militant brand of messianic Judaism that spawned the rebelli on but to rewrite its history in such a way as to make both i ts Messiah and its leaders become the \"founders\" of Christianity. In t his manner, the Romans intended to make the history of the Sicarii movement dis- appear by having its beliefs and key figures become the \"history\" of their new religion. We are also able to understand the plight of John, the leader who was imprisoned by the Romans and was satirized as the Apos- tle John and the demoniac of Gadara. Both Josephus and the authors of the New Testament often made reference to the fa ct that they wrote the truth. I believe that they were sincere i n this claim but"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The Demons of Gadara 91 required the reader to understand the code that the y wrote the truth in. Therefore, I believe that John, after coming ou t of the \"tombs,\" and coming to his \"right mind,\" did cooperate with the Romans and \"publish\" Christian literature at Decapolis. The ending of the Gospel of John specifically ident ifies the \"John\" whom Jesus spared as its author. Understandi ng that the Apostle \"John\" and the demoniac of Gadara were both lampoons of John, along with Simon a leader of the Jewish rebel lion, enabled me to see the real meaning of the following statement concerning the demoniac of Gadara: And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marv el. 85 The passage indicates that John, a leader of the re bellion, was taken to Decapolis, where he provided the Romans wi th details of the messianic movement that were used in creating the N ew Testament. John was used by the Romans to help create the lite rature that poi- soned the future of his own people. The Romans then \"recorded\" their use of John, anticipating that those in the f uture who would learn the truth regarding Christianity's origin would app reciate such irony. This is the disciple who is bearing witness to thes e things, and who has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true. 86 This \"conversion\" by the rebel leader John to Chris tianity, also explains the two Simons' different surnames. The Si mon who is condemned at the end of the New Testament is called \"Simon bar Jonas,\" while the Simon who is condemned at the con clusion of Titus' campaign is named \"Simon bar Gioras.\" Jonas is simply the Hebrew for John—once again the name-switching techn ique—indi- cating that Simon was the son of John. Gioras, mean s \"the convert\" in Hebrew, thus, the rebel Simon's full name was \"S imon the son of the convert,\" a satirical synonym for \"Simon, the s on of John\" because John had become a \"convert\" to the new reli gion.

My analysis indicates that this is , at times, a com- plete misunderstanding, albeit one that was deliber ately brought about. The \"Jesus\" who is speaking to Simon in John 21 did not have love in his heart. What was in his heart can be known by rereading the passage with the understanding that Jesus was describing wh at Titus would do to Simon, the captured leader of the Jewish rebe llion. When these words are read as an address to a man who would be taken to Rome and tortured to death, what was in Jesus' heart is truly revealed. As John the Baptist states, Jesus did not come to bapt ize with water but with fire.

This is especiall y clear at the end- ing of the Gospel of John, when Jesus predicts that Simon will suf- fer a martyr's death and that John will be spared. The only individ- ual in history who can be seen as having fulfilled those prophecies is Titus. At that point in my analysis I saw Jesus and Titus as completely separate individuals, their only connection being t hat Jesus had satirically predicted Titus' \"coming.\" However, 1 w as also beginning to suspect that there was nothing inadvertent withi n the New Testa- ment, that every word of it was somehow part of a c omic system.

I began analyzin g every detail in the two works to determine if there were connection s between Jesus' ministry and Josephus' history that I had not yet n oticed. I was guided in this search by the fact that the parallel s and puzzles I had discovered were all designed to reveal a hidden ide ntity. The question I was trying to answer was an old one: Who is Jesus? The mystery of Jesus' identity begins with his very name. \"Jesus Christ,\" or, as Paul calls him, \"Christ Jesus,\" was certainly not the real name of the founder of Christianity. Christ is the Greek word for \"Messiah\" and Jesus is a Greek homophone (ee-ay-soo ce) for the Hebrew word Yeshua, which can mean either \"God save s\" or, as in the case of Jesus, \"Savior.\" The proposition that Jesus' name was to be understo od as \"Sav- ior\" cannot be disputed because it is confirmed by no less a source than an \"angel of the Lord.\" But while he [Joseph] thought about these things Be hold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream say ing . . . \"And she will have a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins. \" Matt. 1:20-21 The word the angel used to indicate that Jesus woul d save his peo- ple was soteria, 90 a derivative of soter, 91 the Greek word for \"savior.\" However, the angel who named the child Jesus also b egan the confusion over the identity of the \"Savior Messiah. \" Immediately following his instruction to call the child \"Jesus, \" the angel notes that the child that the \"virgin will conceive,\" is to be called by another name. All of this happened to fulfill the Lord's message through his prophet: \"Look! The virgin will conceive a child!

But they all cried out together, \"Away with this ma n, and release to us Jesus Barabbas\"— a man who had been thrown into prison for an insur- rection started in the city, and for murder.

I have found in him no crime deserving death; I will therefore chastise him and release him.\" Jesus also contributes to the confusion regarding t he identity of the \"Savior Messiah\" by referring to the individual he foresees bring- ing destruction of Judea not as himself but as the \"Son of Man.\" Therefore you also must be ready; for it is at a ti me when you do not expect Him that the Son of Man will come . Matt 24:42-44 The New Testament describes more than one person as \"Jesus,\" and refers to Jesus by a number of different names. I began to won- der if the New Testament was somehow indicating tha t there could be more than one Messiah, or \"Christ\"—in other word s, that the New Testament was calling more than one character \" Jesus.\" The very name \"Jesus\" contributes to this idea. Tha t the \"sav- ior\" of humankind was so named at birth is obviousl y problematic, Eusebius, for example, suggests that the name Jesus might have been allegorical. In other words, as was the case w ith Christ, Jesus may have been so named after it became clear that h e was, indeed, the Savior.

From the perspective of Titus, the tru e \"son of god\" of Judea could not have been any of the Jewish messian ic aspirants who waged war against Rome. It could only have been himself. Josephus records that the struggle over who was the true Savior Messiah of Judea was the real cause of the war betw een the Romans and the Jews: But what more than all else incited them to the war was an ambiguous oracle also found in their sacred writing s, that \"At about that time, one from their country would b ecome ruler of the habitable world.\" This they took to me an one of their own people, and many of the wise men were mis led in their interpretation. This oracle, however, in real ity signified the government of Vespasian, who was proclaimed emperor while in Judea. 92 Josephus could not have stated that the Flavian Cae sars saw themselves as the Messiahs, or \"Christs,\" foreseen by the prophecies of Judaism's world ruler any more clearly. But this proposition sug- gests questions. How could Titus have taken the tit le of the \"Christ\" away from the messianic leaders that he struggled w ith? How could Titus have made the rebellious Jews call him \"Chris t\"? I discovered how Titus achieved this during my effo rts to deter- mine if Jesus, like his Apostles, had a secret iden tity. I uncovered a series of puzzles within the New Testament and War of the Jews that reveal that not only was Titus Flavius the \"Son of Man\" predicted by Jesus, but that he was, in fact, the \"Jesus\" who in teracted with the disciples in the final passage of the Gospels—in Jo hn 21. Put simply, the puzzles reveal that Titus is the \"Jesus\" Christ ianity has unknow- ingly worshiped. These puzzles also reveal that the name of the Jewi sh savior Titus captured on the Mount of Olives and stole the title of \"Christ\" from was Eleazar, and that he was satirized as the \"Lazarus\" within the New Testament. The puzzles were also designed t o change the story line of the New Testament from the one that h as been a com- fort to mankind into perhaps the most vicious tale ever written. To begin to show how these puzzles accomplish all t his, it is first necessary to explain how the New Testament in teracts with War"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Eleazar Lazarus: The Real Christ 97 of the Jews to disclose the name of the Jewish savi or Titus captured on the Mount of Olives and executed. This individual's name was Eleazar, which means \"wh om God aids\" in Hebrew and is translated as \"Lazarus\" in G reek. The fact that the New Testament records that Jesus raised La zarus from the dead makes the notion that Lazarus might have been the name of the \"Christ\" that Titus executed especially hard to accept. To come to this understanding the reader must both recogniz e a number of parallels between Jesus and Eleazar and solve a ser ies of puzzles. Only then can the reader learn the Jewish Messiah's real name. I recognize that the parallels may seem disjointed and difficult to comprehend at first, but I ask the reader to bea r with this. If the comic connections between the New Testament and War oj the Jews were meant to be seen easily they would not have re mained hidden for 2,000 years. In this case the satirical connect ions between Jesus and Eleazar have been hidden by placing the key par allels to Jesus into a number of different characters named Eleazar or Lazarus. The author requires the reader to remember events exper ienced by a number of different \"Eleazars\" to understand his po int. In other words, as he had with the various \"Simons\" and the demoniac of Gadara above, the author is using different charact ers that he links typologically by a shared name or parallel experien ces to create a single satiric theme. The apparent vagueness of the parallels between Jesus and Eleazar will ultimately lead to a connection that is of crystal clarity. Once I had begun the study to determine the identit y of Jesus, I noticed that there are parallels between him and a number of char- acters named Eleazar. As I show below, characters n amed \"Lazarus\" or \"Eleazar\" were said to have had the Jesus-like a ttributes of having been born in Galilee, having the power to expel dem ons, having been scourged, having been plotted against by high priests, having survived a crucifixion, having a tomb that was very like Jesus', and, of course, having risen from the dead. Although I saw the parallels as unusual, their mean ing, if any, was unclear until I uncovered two puzzles whose sol utions disclose the name of an unnamed character as \"Eleazar.\" Know ing that these two unnamed characters were so named revealed that \"Eleazar\" was"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"98 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH captured on the Mount of Olives, survived a crucifi xion, and was a son of Mary whose flesh was eaten as a symbolic Pas cal lamb. Adding these unique attributes of Jesus to those pr eviously men- tioned creates a clear picture. The name of the \"Ch rist\" who was captured on the Mount of Olives and executed by the Romans was Eleazar. The following passage from War of the Jews describe s an Eleazar who was a \"Galilean.\" While being a Galilean is har dly an unusual designation, the reader will note that the Eleazar in the passage has other parallels with Jesus—his self-sacrifice and t he strokes upon his naked body. And here a certain Jew appeared worthy of our relat ion and commendation; he was the son of Sameas, and was cal led Eleazar, and was born at Saab, in Galilee. This man took up a stone of a vast bigness, and threw it down from t he wall upon the ram, and this with so great a force, that it broke off the head of the engine. He also leaped down, an d took up the head of the ram from the midst of them, and without any concern carried it to the top of the wall, and this while he stood as a fit mark to be pelted by all his enem ies. Accordingly, he received the strokes upon his naked body. The following passage reveals that \"Eleazar,\" like Jesus, had the power to dispel demons. It is an obviously fictitio us tale and it is therefore interesting that Josephus claims that the exorcism occurred in his presence, and in the presence of Ve spasian and his sons Titus and Domitian. Knowing that Eleazar was J esus and that the \"demoniacs\" were the Jewish rebels clarifies th e real meaning of this odd tale. It is a spoof on the power of \"Jesus \" to rid the rebels of their demonic wickedness, that is, their rebelli ousness. Notice that it also repeats the idea from the tale of the demoniacs of Gadara, that demons are unable to pass through water. ... for I have seen a certain man of my own country , whose name was Eleazar, releasing people that were demoni acal in the presence of Vespasian, and his sons, and his captains, and the whole multitude of his soldiers. The manner of the"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Eleazar Lazarus: The Real Christ 99 cure was this: He put a ring that had a root of one of those sorts mentioned by Solomon to the nostrils of the d emoniac, after which he drew out the demon through his nostr ils . . . And when Eleazar would persuade and demonstrate to the spectators that he had such a power, he set a littl e way off a cup or basin full of water, and commanded the dem on, as he went out of the man, to overturn it, and thereby to let the spectators know that he had left the man. 93 The passage above is related to the following passa ge from War of the Jews regarding another magical root that cou ld dispel demons. The story takes place in a land called \"Baaras\" whe re a \"sort of rue\" also named \"Baaras\" grew. Baaras appears to be a pl ay on the word for son, bar, reminiscent of the manner in which Si carii was perhaps deliberately misspelled as Iscariot. The New Testam ent and Josephus often engage in humor regarding the identity of the \"Son.\" The pas- sage also states that this magical \"rue\" has been a round \"since the times of Herod, and would probably have lasted much longer had it not been cut down by those Jews.\" This indicates we are dealing with a single plant. However, what sort of plant is there only one of? In any case, why is Josephus going to lengths to de scribe a plant that no longer exits? Further, Josephus also defines in the passage what he meant by the word \"demons.\" They are the \"spirit s of the wicked,\" thus supporting the idea that the \"wicked\" Sicarii were possessed by \"demons\" and were the \"unclean spirits' in the \"dem ons of Gadara,\" as well as the idea that the demons Eleazar is exor cizing in the pas- sage above are Jewish rebels. When the elements of the passage below regarding th e magical \"root\" are viewed as a group, a picture emerges. Th e passage describes a single plant that was called \"son,\" whi ch had been around since the time of Herod and had a magical po wer to drive out demons. This \"son\" would have lasted longer except that \"those Jews\" cut it down. What, other than a satire of Jes us, could this pas- sage be? As the passage contains clear parallels to the one above, describing an \"Eleazar\" who also dispels demons usi ng a magical rue, it was written to connect \"Eleazar\" to the oth er son who exor- cized demons—that is, Jesus."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"100 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH Now within this place there grew a sort of rue that deserves our wonder on account of its largeness, for it was no way inferior to any fig tree whatsoever, either in heig ht or in thickness; and the report is, that it had lasted ev er since the times of Herod, and would probably have lasted much longer, had it not been cut down by those Jews who took possession of the place afterward.

This \"E leazar\" is a transparent parallel to Jesus, as he survives both a scourging of his naked flesh and a crucifixion. ... the Romans when they came upon the others' sall ies against their banks, they foresaw their coming, and were upon their guard when they received them; But the c onclu- sion of this siege did not depend upon these bicker ings; but a certain surprising accident, relating to what was done in this siege, forced the Jews to surrender the citade l.

So the general of the Romans ordered that he should be tak en up naked, set before the city to be seen, and sorely w hipped before their eyes. Upon this sad accident that befe ll the young man, the Jews were terribly confounded, and t he city, with one voice, sorely lamented him, and the mourni ng proved greater than could well be supposed upon the calamity of a single person. 95 The following part of the passage is notable as it is a satirical description of the rationale that led to the creati on of Christianity. The Romans, seeing the love that the Jewish rebels held for their Messiah, decided to use this attachment to their ow n advantage. That is, they decided to create a Roman Messiah. Th is passage is directly linked to the New Testament's story of Jes us' capture on the Mount of Olives. When Bassus perceived that, he began to think of us ing a stratagem against the enemy, and was desirous to ag gra- vate their grief, in order to prevail with them to surrender the city for the preservation of that man. Nor did he fail of his hope; for he commanded them to set up a cross, as if he were just going to hang Eleazar upon it immediately ; the sight of this occasioned a sore grief among those t hat were in the citadel, and they groaned vehemently, and cr ied out that they could not bear to see him thus destroyed. Where- upon Eleazar besought them not to disregard him, no w he was going to suffer a most miserable death, and exh orted them to save themselves, by yielding to the Roman p ower and good fortune, since they now conquered all othe r peo- ple.

Accordingly, they sent out immediately certain messengers, and treated with th e Romans, in order to arrange a surrender of the cita del to them, and desired that they might be permitted to g o away, and take Eleazar along with them. Then did the Roma ns and their general accept of these terms. 96 Another linking of Jesus and Eleazar (Lazarus) occu rs in the New Testament. After describing Lazarus' resurrecti on, the Gospel of John states that the high priests plotted agains t him. This parallel is transparent as it occurs within the same passage where the high priests plot against Jesus. But the High Priests plotted to put Lazarus to deat h also. 97 So War of the Jews and the New Testament describes characters named \"Eleazar\" who have the Jesus-like attributes of having being born in Galilee, having the power to dispel demons, having been plotted against by the High Priests, having been sc ourged, having survived a crucifixion, and having risen from the d ead. These \"Eleazars\" are the only individuals within these wo rks with so many of Jesus' attributes. However, to learn that \"Eleazar\" was the real \"Savi or\" the authors of Josephus and the New Testament required the read er to first solve the following two puzzles. The first puzzle reveals that Eleazar was captured on the Mount of Olives. To solve the puzzl e one must first recognize that the following passage, in which Jose phus gives his version of a capture on the Mount of Olives, is par allel to the pas- sage above that described an Eleazar who was scourg ed and escaped death from crucifixion. The following is the complete text of Josephus' Mou nt of Olives capture: Now after one day had been interposed since the Rom ans ascended the breach, many of the seditious were so pressed by the famine, upon the present failure of their ra vages, that they got together, and made an attack on those Roman guards that were upon the Mount of Olives. The Roma ns"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Eleazar Lazarus: The Real Christ 103 were apprised of their coming to attack them before hand, and, running together from the neighboring camps on the sudden, prevented them from getting over their fort ifica- tion, and one whose name was Pedanius, belonging to a party of horsemen, when the Jews were already beate n and forced down into the valley together, spurred his h orse on their flank with great vehemence, and caught up a c ertain young man belonging to the enemy by his ankle, as h e was running away; the man was, however, of a robust bod y, and in his armor; so low did Pedanius bend himself down ward from his horse, even as he was galloping away, and so great was the strength of his right hand, and of the rest of his body, as also such skill had he in horsemanship. So this man seized upon that his prey, as upon a precious t reasure, and carried him as his captive to Caesar; whereupon Titus admired the man that had seized the other for his g reat strength, and ordered the man that was caught to be pun- ished [with death] for his attempt against the Roma n wall. 98 This incident took place on the Mount of Olives, th e location the New Testament gives for Jesus' capture. As I ha d seen that the New Testament and War of the Jews often shared conc eptually paral- lel events at the same locations, I attempted to an alyze the two pas- sages to determine if they might also be related. I first noticed that there is a parallel between th e two Mount of Olive captures in terms of the relative time when t hey occur. The New Testament's capture takes place immediately bef ore Jesus, the symbolic temple of the New Testament, is destroyed. The Mount of Olives capture in War of the Jews likewise takes pl ace immediately before the destruction of the temple. However, wher eas the identity of the man who was captured on the Mount of Olives in the New Testament is well known, in Josephus' version the c aptured individ- ual is described only as a \"certain young man.\" I wondered if it might be possible, as 1 had with t he demoniacs of Gadara, to learn the name of this \"certain young man.\" It was dur- ing the effort to determine this that the way in wh ich the New Tes- tament and War of the Jews use parallelism to ident ify their unnamed characters finally became clear to me."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"104 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH This use of parallelism came directly from the Hebr ew Bible and, in a sense, its use in the New Testament was t o be expected. As the authors of the New Testament borrowed concepts such as the Exodus, the Passover lamb, and the Messiah, it was logical for them to copy its use of intertextual parallels as well. The Hebrew Bible was structured as an organic whole and can be thought of a \"a series of concentric circles wit h some interlock- ing rings,\" as Freedman puts it.\" For instance, the Torah and the book of Joshua (which together form the Hexateuch) have an over- all mirror-image literary structure in which the ma in themes of books from Genesis up to Exodus 33 are then mirrore d in parallel structures in the books from Exodus 34 to Joshua 24 . The creators of the Hebrew Bible also used structur al parallels at a micro level. For instance, in a technique know n as pedimental composition, 100 two passages that contain many parallels are used to provide a literary \"frame\" by sandwiching a thir d central passage between them—for example, Leviticus 18 and 20 provi de such a \"frame\" for the central passage in Leviticus 19. Th e consequence of these traditional literary techniques is that the J ewish reader does not read a text in what might be thought of as a ra tional, straight- forward, and linear manner. On the contrary, the Je wish reading is intertextual. The use of similar phrasing, formulas , places, clothing, and so on are used to create layers of associative meaning, as con- trasts, and to provide continuity and color. In som e cases the authors create what Robert Alter has called \"type scenes\" — so, for exam- ple, Abraham's servant meeting a young woman by a w ell is then later paralleled by Moses meeting a young woman by a well, and the reader is invited to contemplate the similarities, differences, and continuities. In Hebrew literature, these typological relationshi ps are a source of open-ended speculation and debate. To the Romans this perhaps seemed part of the barbarous mysticism that provoke d the Jewish Zealots to revolt. So they \"improved\" the nature of their parallels in the New Testament from the open-ended types found w ithin the Hebrew canon to ones that were very precise in thei r logical and chronological relationships, and in the identities that they reveal."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Eleazar Lazarus: The Real Christ 105 The authors of the Gospels were very aware of the t ypology in Hebraic literature and were, in effect, showing tha t they were able to produce a more perfect, more complex form of it. Mo reover, there was a profound irony in the authors' requiring the Gospels and War of the Jews to be read in the manner of Judaic lite rature in order to learn that they had created a false Judaism. The insight that Josephus was using typological par allels occurred when I noticed that Josephus' tale regardi ng the capture of the unnamed \"certain young man\" on the Mount of Oli ves is paral- lel to another passage within War of the Jews, the passage above, in which Eleazar is whipped and escapes crucifixion. J osephus identi- fied the two stories as being parallel by having ea ch passage tell the same story, their only differences being in locatio n and that the \"cer- tain young man\" is unnamed in the Mount of Olives v ersion. For clarification, I present the following list of the parallels between the two passages: In each, besieged Jews are encircled by a wall. In each, the Jews attack the siege wall. In each case the Romans foresee the attack. In each, a Jew is literally carried away by a singl e Roman in a manner that is physically impossible. In each, the man who is carried away is in his armo r. Within the works of Josephus there are thousands of passages. These are the only two that share these parallel ch aracteristics. Jose- phus thus notified the \"intelligent reader,\" that i s, the reader with a good memory, that the two stories are parallel. Fur ther, there is a simple point of logic that the authors require the reader to appre- hend, this being that since the passages are parall el, the unnamed \"certain young man\" who is carried away in one must have the same name as the \"certain young man\" named Eleazar who h as the same experience in the other. The passages are also the start of a comic theme th at Josephus and the New Testament develop regarding the Messiah who was cap- tured on the Mount of Olives. This theme, which I r efer to as the \"root and branch,\" begins with the last sentence in the passage"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"106 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH above from War of the Jews. Notice that the transla tor (William Whiston) places brackets around the words that he u ses to describe the punishment of the unnamed \"certain young man\" c aptured on the Mount of Olives \"(with death).\" Whiston used this device to notify the reader that he was delib- erately mistranslating the Greek words Josephus wro te in order to render what seemed a more coherent reading. The Gre ek words he is translating as [with death], kolasai keleusas, a re translated literally as \"commanded to be pruned.\" \"Pruned\" is, of course , a word that describes a gardening activity. Thus, Titus did not order the \"certain young man\" to be put to \"death,\" as Whiston's trans lation reads, but to be \"pruned,\" a word used quite logically on the Mount of Olives. \"Kolasai\" was used by the Greek naturalist Theophra tus in the fourth century B.C.E. to describe the pruning neces sary to cultivate wild plants. His work on plants was often reference d by individuals from Titus' era such as Pliny and Seneca, and speci fically covered the process by which wild olive trees could be transfor med into culti- vated ones. 102 Theophratus was the scientific ancestor of Pedaniu s Dioscorides, the Roman scientist and physician who accompanied Vespasian and Titus to Judea and was a key part of the theme of comedy concerning the \"root and branch.\" This use of the word \"pruned\" to describe the fate of the \"cer- tain young man\" is part of a broad satirical theme within the New Testament. The leaders of the Jewish rebellion were used as the his- torical \"tree\" onto which Christianity was \"grafted .\" Paul's descrip- tion of Christianity being grafted onto Judaism bel ow is part of this \"root and branch\" theme. Notice that Paul states th at it is an olive tree that is to be grafted onto. The olive tree bei ng, of course, the tree that would be \"pruned\" on the Mount of Olives. For if God spared not the natural branches, take he ed lest he also spare not thee. Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodnes s, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Eleazar Lazarus: The Real Christ 107 For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natur al branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?

Rom. 11:21-25 Josephus continued with this vegetive theme by maki ng a joke regarding \"pressing.\" Notice that at the beginning of his description of a capture on the Mount of Olives, Josephus state s that the Jews were \"pressed\" by famine. This use of the word \"pre ss\" by Josephus satirically links his passage describing a Mount of Olive capture with the New Testament's version of a Mount of Olives ca pture. The gar- den Jesus wanders into while on the Mount of Olives is called Geth- semane, an Aramaic word that is usually translated as \"olive press.\" However, as Klausner points out, the word is \"diffi cult\" and may also be related to wine. Beth-Shemanaya is a name u sed in the Tal- mud to describe a \"hall of wine and oil.\" 103 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testa- ment, which is shed for many. Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. And they came to a place that was named Geth- semane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray. Mark 14:32 We have shown that Jesus' calling his flesh \"bread\" is comically related to the cannibalism that the besieged Jewish rebels engaged in. Likewise, the description of Jesus' passion in the garden of Geth- semane is a lampoon of his \"giving of his blood,\" w hich he described as \"wine.\""},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"108 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done. And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falli ng down to the ground. Luke 22:42-44 Naming the garden where Jesus' sweat is compared to drops of blood \"olive press\" is also part of the comic theme . However, the passage in the Gospel of Luke that contains the rel ated comic image, that of the drops of blood that spill from Jesus be ing like the liquid squeezed from grapes or olives in a press, does not refer to the name of the garden. This must be gleaned from reading ve rsions of the Mount of Olives tale in the other Gospels, in which the name of the garden is Gethsemane. The comedy the four Gospels work together, regardin g Jesus' passion at Gethsemane, to show that the Gospels are not four sepa- rate testimonies of Jesus, but rather a unified pie ce of literature with nothing inadvertent in it. All of their seemingly i rrelevant or con- tradictory details have a purpose at the comic leve l. In this instance, the authors have kept the comedy from being too obv ious by plac- ing the word for a wine or olive press, Gethsemane, into one Gospel's version of the story and the image of bloo d dropping from Jesus in another. Josephus then expands the comic t heme in War of the Jews by placing a play on the word \"press\" in t hat Mount of Olives story. Once again, only readers alert enough to combine el ements from different versions of the same story can under stand the joke. Notice that this technique is consistent throughout . To understand the joke in Luke regarding Gethsemane the reader mu st recall another Gospel's version of the same story.

The conse- quence for failing it is belief in a false god. I would also note that this vegetative theme regard ing a Messiah captured in a garden named olive press or wine pres s may have been a parody of a Hebrew metaphor, recorded in the Targ um, of the Mes- siah crushing Israel's enemies in a press. Rome's c omic Messiah did not crush his enemies like \"grapes in the wine pres s,\" but rather was \"pressed\" himself. How lovely is the king Messiah, who is to rise from the house of Judah. He girds his loins and goes out to wage war on thos e who hate him, killing kings and rulers . . . and reddening the mountains with the blood of their slain. With his garments dipped in blood, he is like one who treads grapes in the wine press 104 It is remarkable that the \"root and branch\" theme t hat the New Testament and Josephus create regarding the Messiah has not been noticed before, since it is quite clear. The \"olive tree\" that is \"pruned\" so that Christianity could be \"grafted in\" just hap pens to be on the \"Mount of Olives\" in a garden named \"Gethsemane,\" a word that means \"olive press.\" In this instance, the very nam es and locations give away the fact that the story is comedy and not history. If the Romans did, in fact, capture Eleazar, the me ssianic \"branch\" of the Jewish rebels, on the Mount of Olives, it wo uld have been the specific inspiration for this comic theme. In the f ollowing chapter, my analysis of this vegetative theme concludes as T itus—called a \"gardener\" because he has \"pruned\" Eleazar—\"grafts\" himself onto the Jewish Messiah's identity and history and becom es \"Jesus.\" I will show in \"The New Root and Branch\" chapter th at this \"pruning\" of the certain young man, described so of f-handedly by Josephus, is the fate of the real Messiah, whom Chr istianity is based upon. Further, the New Testament story of Jesus' capture is linked to Titus' campaign in yet another way. The New Testame nt states that"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"110 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH Jesus was captured within a garden named Gethsemane . In the ver- sion of his capture recounted in the Gospel of Mark there is a char- acter described only as a naked \"certain young man\" who, unlike Jesus, was able to escape from the attackers. I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled. And they all forsook him, and fled. and there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the youn g men laid hold on him: And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them nak ed. And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and wit h him were assembled all the chief priests and the el ders and the scribes. Mark 14:49-53 The description of the naked man has puzzled schola rs. Why did the author interrupt his description of somethi ng as important as the capture of Jesus to record an event as irrel evant as the escape of an unnamed character? I believe that I am able t o answer this question and also to identify this unnamed characte r. The answer comes from the fact that there was anoth er \"naked\" individual who had a parallel escape from a band of armed men in the same garden. This individual was Titus Flavius. Once again the New Testament and War of the Jews each describe a c onceptually parallel event at the same location—\"fishing\" for m en at Gen- nesareth, \"demons\" at Gadara, a son of Mary whose f lesh was eaten at Jerusalem, and, in the following passage, a \"nak ed\" young man in a garden outside the northeastern corner of Jerusal em who escaped from a band of armed men.

So he perceived that his preserva tion must be wholly owing to his own courage, and turned his horse about, and cried out aloud to those that were about him to follow him, and ran with violence into the m idst of his enemies, in order to force his way through them to his own men. And hence I may principally learn, that both t he suc- cess of wars, and the dangers that kings are in, ar e under the providence of God; for while such a number of d arts were thrown at Titus, when he had neither his head- piece on, nor his breastplate (for, as I told you, he wen t out not to fight, but to view the city), none of them touched his body, but went aside without hurting him; as if all of them m issed him on purpose, and only made a noise as they passed by him. Thus, the New Testament and War of the Jews each pl aced their king in the same garden for his encounter with a ba nd of armed men. In the New Testament, Jesus starts at the Mount of Olives, which is just outside Jerusalem's eastern edge, and walks no rthward to Geth- semane, from where the New Testament states that he \"went a little farther.\" 105 In other words, to the northeastern corner of the city. Josephus describes Titus as traveling from the towe r of Psephinus, which marked the city's northwestern corner, toward the monument of Queen Helena, along Jerusalem's northern border from west to east. Notice that in his version of a garden assault, Jos ephus makes the reader aware that Titus was, figuratively speak ing, \"naked,\" that is, he was wearing no armor, to create a satirical parallel to the \"naked young man\" who escapes from the garden in the New T estament."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"112 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH As was the case in the puzzle regarding the capture of Eleazar, the unnamed \"naked young man\" in the New Testament must have the same name as the named individual within the pa rallel story in War of the Jews.

Thus, the New Testament and Josephus each describe two assaults that occur in gardens near the Mount of Ol ives.

This parallel is critically important in that it begins the process by which the New Testament's story of Jesus operates as a forerunner of the stories of both \"Sons of God\" des cribed in War of the Jews—Eleazar and Titus. Titus is actually described by Josephus in the pass age as a king when, in fact, at that moment he is only the son of the emperor. And hence we may principally learn, that both the s uccess of wars, and the dangers that kings are in, are und er the providence of God. This reference to Titus as a king has caught the at tention of scholars, who have wondered why Josephus would have made such an obvious error. Josephus, of course, has not forg otten Titus' title. Rather, he is making a comment as to which \"king,\" attacked in a garden outside Jerusalem, enjoys God's favor—Jesus, the king of the Jews or Titus, the king of the Romans. War of the Jews and the New Testament are working t ogether to state that since the king of the Romans escaped fro m his attackers in the garden and the king of the Jews did not, this d emonstrates which king was \"under the providence of God.\" It is stran ge that Josephus' phrase in the passage above, \"the dangers that king s are in,\" has not received more attention from scholars, because he i s clearly referring to an event that occurs in the same garden where Je sus, the king of the Jews, is captured, and his use of the plural pl ainly indicates he is talking about more than one king. It is, at the least, an extraordinary coincidence t hat Josephus chose this moment and location to make an editorial comment regarding which king was under the \"providence of G od.\" Josephus seems to be making a point as to the relat ive value of faith in the divine and faith in one's self, which was perhaps the same thing to the Flavians, since they saw themselv es as gods. This is made clear by the different responses Jesus and Titus have to the same situation. Both are kings who are cut off from their allies and assaulted by armed men in a garden outside Jerusale m's northeast- ern corner. Jesus, that is, Eleazar, meekly accepts God's will.

Josephus may be providing a glimpse into the true \" religious\" belief of the Flavian emperors, which is, rely on one's se lf and not on the \"providence\" of gods. 1 will now analyze the puzzle regarding Eleazar tha t reveals the most significant characteristic he and Jesus share. It i s the puzzle that reveals that Lazarus was a son of \"Mary\" whose fles h was eaten as a Passover lamb. To solve this puzzle the reader must first combine two parallel passages within the New Testament and then combine that \"combined story\" with its parallel counterpart in Josephus. While this may seem complex, the authors create a c lear path to fol- low. As in the puzzle above regarding the \"certain young man\" cap- tured on the Mount of Olives, the puzzle is about d etermining the name of an unnamed character, and again the answer is Eleazar. The puzzle begins with a passage from the Gospel of Luke in which Jesus gives advice to Martha when she is trou bled that her sis- ter Mary is not helping her to serve the food. If J esus' words are interpreted symbolically, he appears to be saying t hat listening to his teaching is more important than serving or eating f ood. Though seemingly innocuous, the following passage is the m ost important in the entire New Testament. Now as they went on their way, he entered a village ; and a woman named Martha received him into her house. And she had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lo rd's feet and listened to his teaching. But Martha was distracted with much serving; and sh e went to him and said, \"Lord, do you not care that m y sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to help m e.\" But the Lord answered her, \"Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things; one thing is needful. Mary has chosen the good port ion, which shall not be taken away from her.\" Luke 10:38-42"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Eleazar Lazarus: The Real Christ 115 Like the New Testament's passage regarding the \"cer tain young man\" who was naked on the Mount of Olives, Luke 10: 38-42 is strangely disconnected from the narrative both befo re and after it. Scholars have recognized that the passage seems rel ated to another story regarding the serving of food found in the Go spel of John, which I call the \"feast of Lazarus.\" During this \"f east of Lazarus\" Martha is described, as she is in the passage above from Luke, as serving food. Martha's sister Mary is also present at this feast, as is their brother, Lazarus, whom Jesus has recently rai sed from the dead. However, if the passage from the Gospel of Lu ke is a piece from the story in John, how did it find its way int o another Gospel? Again, passages within the New Testament and War of the Jews that share parallels are intended to be read as Jew ish literature—that is, intertextually. Read that way, from such a pers pective these par- allel passages create a story with a meaning differ ent from the one that appears on the surface. The passage from the G ospel of Luke shares parallels with the \"feast of Lazarus\" story in the Gospel of John. In both passages, Lazarus' sisters Mary and M artha are present and Martha is described as serving food. Thus, thes e passages can be combined as follows: Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethan y, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the d ead. There they made him a supper; Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at table with him. John 12:2-3 At this point, the piece of the story that occurs i n the Gospel of Luke can be seamlessly woven in. But Martha was distracted with much serving; and sh e went to him and said, \"Lord, do you not care that m y sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to help m e.\" But the Lord answered her, \"Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things; one thing is needful. Mary has chosen the good port ion, which shall not be taken away from her.\" Luke 10:40-42"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"116 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH While the scene created by combining the two passag es may seem trivial, the fact that it joins the Lazarus st ory with Mary's \"good portion\" is critical in solving the puzzle of what, exactly, Mary's \"good portion\" is. Is Jesus speaking metaphorically here or can his words be taken literally, as I have shown they can in the expression \"fishers of men?\" I believe that, once again, those who see spiritual meaning in Jesus' words are being played for a fool . Though a char- acter named Mary who has a \"fine portion\" that is \" not taken away from her\" is quite rare in literature, a character with the same name and attributes is also found in War of the Jews, co ntained in the pas- sage that describes the Mary who ate her son, which I have analyzed previously. They threatened her that they would cut her throat imme- diately if she [Mary] did not show them what food s he had gotten ready. She replied that she had saved a very fine por- tion of it for them, and withal uncovered what was left of her son. After which those men went out... and ... left the rest of that meat to the mother. 106 Josephus' passage has a conceptual parallel in Luke 10:40. But the reader must make more than a linguistic connect ion in order to be able to see the parallels between the two passag es. Note that the two Marys are an example, par excelle nce, of the fact that the conceptual parallels between the New Testament and War of the Jews cannot be seen through the literal method of analy- sis that scholars have always applied to the works. The relationship was created not by linguistic or grammatical parall els but by con- ceptual parallels. The authors uses different words and even differ- ent languages to create their typological relations hips and require that the reader possess the mental capacity to reco gnize the parallel concepts that the different words create. The passage above from War of the Jews shares four overt paral- lels with the New Testament passages regarding Laza rus: a fine por- tion, the fact that the portion was not taken away, a character named Mary, and a relative named Eleazar (Lazarus). However, these four parallels are not the only ways in which the passages are linked. As noted above, Josephus' pass age describing"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Eleazar Lazarus: The Real Christ 117 the Mary whose \"good portion was not taken away fro m her\" also contains a number of elements that parallel the New Testament's symbolic Passover lamb. These are a mother named Ma ry who would be \"pierced through\"; a house of hyssop; a sacrific e; one of Moses' instructions regarding the Passover lamb; the eatin g of a son's flesh who was to become a \"byword to the world\"; and Jeru salem as the location of the incident. Adding the \"good portion that was not taken away\" t o the pre- viously mentioned parallels with the New Testament' s Passover lamb puts to rest the question of whether Josephus' \"son of Mary whose flesh was eaten\" passage and the New Testament's Pa ssover lamb are part of a comic system. Lightning may strike twice in the same place, but it does not strike nine times in a passage of l ess than two pages—a passage written by a member of a family wit h so many con- nections to Christianity. Though I did not understand the reasons for the num erous par- allels between the \"son of Mary whose flesh was eat en\" in War of the Jews and the Passover lamb of the New Testament whe n I first encountered them, their point is now clear. Read in tertextually the passages indicate that the \"good portion\" that was not taken away from Mary in the New Testament was the same \"good p ortion\" that was not taken away from the Mary in the passage fro m Josephus. Therefore, the \"good portion\" that was being served at the feast of Lazarus was human flesh. But whose flesh? What was the name of the \"son of Mary\"? The parallels simply work in reverse to provide the answer. The Lazarus described in the New Testament shares paral lel attributes with Mary's unnamed son in War of the Jews. Both ha ve relatives named \"Mary\" who have a \"good portion\" that was not taken away. The author thus \"informs\" the alert reader that, ag ain, since they share parallel attributes, Mary's unnamed son in Wa r of the Jews had the same name as his counterpart in the parallel ta le in the New Tes- tament—that is, \"Lazarus.\" The comic point is that the \"good por- tion\" Mary and Jesus enjoy is the flesh of Lazarus. Notice the grim wordplay in the passage, \"They made him a supper.\" The economy that the author used in creating the pu zzle deserves note. The passage within War of the Jews identifies the nature of the"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"118 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH \"good portion\" in its parallel passage within the N ew Testament, while the same passage in the New Testament identif ies Mary's unnamed son in War of the Jews. The two passages ar e also an exam- ple of a theme regarding prophecy that runs all the way through the New Testament. It is not just Jesus' overt prophesi es that come to pass in War of the Jews, but everything that the Ne w Testament states \"shall\" occur. Notice that, like the prophecy regarding Mary being \"pierced through\" above, the two passages are temporally log ical. Jesus \"prophesies\" that Mary's fine portion shall not be taken away and, indeed, Josephus records that this \"prophecy\" came to pass. Of course, such \"miraculous fulfillments\" are to be expected. Jesus specifically stated that every letter and gra mmatical \"dot\" of the \"law\" would be fulfilled. Think not that I have come to abolish the law and t he prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fu lfill them. For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law unti l all is ful- filled. Matt. 5:17-18 It is not just his obvious prophecies, such as that the temple would be razed, that came to pass during Titus' cam paign—virtually all of Jesus' ministry is a prophetical forerunner of some event from that campaign. Examples of this technique include a son of Mary whose flesh is eaten; Mary being told she will be \" pierced through\"; Jesus telling his disciples they will become \"fishe rs of men\"; the demoniacs of Gadara asking Jesus, \"Have you come he re to torment us before the time?\"; Simon being called the \"rock\" upon which the new church will be built; Mary's fine portion that shall not be taken away from her; a naked young man who escapes his pu rsuers in the garden of Gethsemane; the list of signs Jesus state s will occur before the temple is razed; as well as a Simon who is cond emned and a John who is spared. The fact that so many seemingly innocuous but unusu al New Testament statements regarding the future \"come to pass\" within War of the Jews is perhaps the simplest proof that the two works were"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Eleazar Lazarus: The Real Christ 119 designed to be read interactively. Josephus' record ing of the fulfill- ment of so many of these \"hidden\" New Testament pro phecies could not have occurred by chance. If I were permitted to ask critics of my thesis one question, it would be this: What is the probability that the sat irical \"fulfillment\" of not one but two unique New Testament prophecies— Mary being \"pierced through the heart\" and her \"fine portion n ot being taken away\"—would exist within a passage that also contai ns an acciden- tal satire of the New Testament's Passover lamb? A skillfully designed, interactive relationship bet ween the two works is also shown by the fact that the prophetic statements in the New Testament occur in the same order as their \"ful fillment\" does in War of the Jews. Clearly, the purpose of this co mic theme is to con- firm that since his \"ministry\" has fulfilled every prophecy predicted by the Gospels, Titus is the Son of Man foreseen by Jesus. Returning to the analysis of the Eleazar puzzles, t he question arises of how the flesh consumed at the feast of La zarus could have been Lazarus' own, since he is described in the New Testament as having been raised from the dead by Jesus and as ha ving been \"with\" him during the meal? To answer this question requir es a careful reading of the passage in which Jesus \"raises\" Laza rus, which occurs immediately before the feast of Lazarus in the Gosp el of John. I pres- ent the passage below. Now a certain man, named Lazarus, of Bethany, was l ying ill—Bethany being the village of Mary and her siste r Martha. (It was the Mary who poured the perfume over the Lo rd and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Laz arus was ill.] So the sisters sent to Him to say, \"Master, he whom you hold dear is ill.\" Jesus received the message and said, \"This illness is not to end in death, but is to promote the glory of God, in order that the Son of God may be glorified by it.\" Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus . When, however, He heard that Lazarus was ill, He st ill remained two days in that same place."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH Then, after that, He said to the disciples, \"Let us return to Judea.\" \"Rabbi,\" exclaimed the disciples, \"the Jews have ju st been trying to stone you, and do you think of going back there again?\" Jesus answered, \"Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any one walks in the day, he does not stumb le, because he sees the light of this world. But if any one walks in the night, he stumbles, bec ause the light is not in him.\" Thus he spoke, and then he said to them, \"Our frien d Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awake him ou t of sleep.\" The disciples said to him, \"Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.\" Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep. Then Jesus told them plainly, \"Lazarus is dead; and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, s o that you may believe. But let us go to him.\" Thomas, called the Twin, said to his fellow discipl es, \"Let us also go, that we may die with him.\" Now when Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days. Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off, and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother. When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, while Mary sat in the house. Martha said to Jesus, \"Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. And even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you.\" Jesus said to her, \"Your brother will rise again.\" Martha said to him, \"I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.\" Jesus said to her, \"I am the resurrection and the l ife; he who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live,"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Eleazar Lazarus: The Real Christ 121 and whoever lives and believes in me shall never di e.

Now Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him. When the Jews who were with her in the house, con- soling her, saw Mary rise quickly and go out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to we ep there. Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was and saw him, fell at his feet, saying to him, \"Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.\" When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spiri t and troubled; and he said, \"Where have you laid him?\" They said t o him, \"Lord, come and see.\" Jesus wept. So the Jews said, \"See how he loved him!\" But some of them said, \"Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying ?\" Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb; i t was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. Jesus said, \"Take away the stone.\" Martha, the sist er of the dead man, said to him, \"Lord, by this time ther e will be an odor, for he has been dead four days.\" Jesus said to her, \"Did I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?\" So they took away the stone.

Jesus said to them, \"Unbind him, and let him go.\" Many of the Jews therefore, who had come with Mary and had seen what he did, believed in him; but some of them went to the Pharisees and told the m what Jesus had done. So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the council, and said, \"What are we to do? For this man per- forms many signs. If we let him go on thus, every one will believe in him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our holy place and our nation.\" John 11:1-48 Notice that in the passage Jesus deliberately waits two days before he starts out to visit Lazarus, thereby allo wing a total of four days to pass before he comes to the tomb, a point t hat Martha specif- ically mentions. This is different, of course, from the timing of Jesus' resurrection, which occurs three days after his dea th. The difference between Jesus' and Lazarus' resurrections is signif icant. During this era, Jews believed that the spirit was irrevocably gone on the fourth day following a person's death. 107 This is why Jesus' resurrection occurs on the third day after his death and makes t he meaning of the parallel \"good portion\" passages clear. Lazarus' re surrection is a joke. Jesus merely raises Lazarus' body from his tomb. So meone who has been dead for four days cannot be restored to life. This also explains why Lazarus never speaks after he is \"raised\" from his tomb. The dead cannot speak. Notice also the mention of the s tench of Lazarus' flesh, which parallels the stench of human flesh in the passage where Josephus describes Mary's \"fine portion.\" Jes us' prophecy concerning the flesh of the \"Son of Man\" has, as al ways, come to pass and his flesh is literally, not symbolically, eaten.

Understanding this joke also enables the reader to understand the comic point in the resurrection o f Jesus, which I will analyze in the next chapter. That being that t he tomb thought to be the Messiah's was empty because the corpse ha d been eaten. Even if this interpretation is correct, it is possi ble that the asser- tion that his followers ate the Messiah was simply a fiction created by the Romans to denigrate the Jewish messianic mov ement. I must note, however, that the Talmud records that canniba lism was preva- lent during Roman sieges and that both Suetonius an d Josephus confirm that it took place during the siege of Jeru salem. The mes- sianic family and their inner circle, which Josephu s describes as the final holdouts, may well have engaged in the practi ce. If this in fact occurred and was discovered by the Romans, the even t provided the grim inspiration for the creation of a Christian Me ssiah who offers his flesh to his followers. In any event, the comic system created by the New Testament and War of the Jews does make it clear that the cannibalism engaged in by the besieged messianic Je ws was the basis of the Christian concept of a Messiah who offers up his flesh. Knowing that the unnamed \"certain young man\" who wa s \"pruned\" on the Mount of Olive passages was named \" Eleazar,\" as was Mary's unnamed child in War of the Jews, comple tes a compos- ite picture of \"Eleazar.\" Josephus and the New Test ament \"state\" that Eleazar could expel demons, was a son of Mary, had his flesh eaten as a Passover sacrifice, was captured on the Mount of Olives, was stripped naked and scourged, was plotted against by the high priests, miraculously escaped death by crucifixion, and \"rose\" from the dead. Further, in the next chapter I will show that Lazarus and Jesus also have parallel tombs. Their tombs occur i n the same loca- tion, at the same time; both have their stones remo ved and have the same burial clothes left behind. Eleazar, like Simon and John, had his identity stol en by the Romans. He was the historical \"Christ\" who had been captured on the Mount of Olives and \"rose\" from the dead. As he was only human, however, Eleazar could not return to life.

I am certain, however, that even if the New Testame nt character of \"Jesus\" were based on a historical individual, v irtually nothing he said and none of the events from his ministry are r ecorded in the New Testament. The authors of the New Testament cre ated their character's dialogue and ministry in order to creat e a \"true\" prophet, one who had \"accurately\" prophesied events from Tit us' triumphant campaign. Jesus did not, for example, envision his disciples becom- ing \"fishers of men\" or \"eating his flesh.\" Nor did he see his con- temporaries as a \"wicked generation\" or advocate th at they \"turn the other cheek.\" Like his \"Apostles\" Simon and John, t he real \"Savior Messiah\" would have been completely in accordance w ith the mes- sianic movement that fought against Rome. He would have been a militaristic Zealot. At the time the New Testament was being created, th e events of 30 C.E. were 50 years past and of little or no impo rtance to its authors. Their focus was solely on Titus' triumph i n the recently completed war against the Jews. The \"Savior\" they c reated was a Roman fantasy, a literary figure they used to \"prop hetically\" chasten the \"wicked generation\" and to set up their satire regarding the Mes- siah that Titus had \"pruned\"—Eleazar.

This combined story is d ivided into two halves. One half consists of the visits to the tomb described in the Gospel of John. The other consists of the visits to the tomb described in the other three Gospels. In the combined story t he individuals described in the Gospel of John meet the individual s described in the other three Gospels and, in their emotional sta te, the different groups mistake one another for angels. This comedy of errors causes the visitors to the empty tomb to mistakenly believ e that their Mes- siah has risen from the dead. To see how the four versions combine into one conti nuous story, it is first necessary to recognize that the New Tes tament places the contradictory versions in one temporal stream of ev ents, and that each version enters this shared stream of events at a different point."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"130 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH The sun's position in the sky places each version o f the story in sequential order. John's version begins earliest an d the events progress through Matthew, Mark, and finally Luke. This can be determined as follows: In John, the first visit occurs while it is \"still dark.\" In Matthew, the first visit occurs while the sun \"i s rising.\" The author specifically uses the present tense. Luke and Mark use the Greek words proi 108 and bathus. 109 Both mean \"early in the morning\"; however, in Mark, the superlative lian, 110 meaning \"extremely\" or \"beyond measure,\" is used i n con- junction with proi. Notice below that in Mark the s un has indeed risen when the visit occurs, thus creating the awkw ard expression \"the very earliest moment in the morning after the sun had risen.\" Thus, Mark's version begins after Matthew's but bef ore Luke's. Below are the related passages in the original Gree k with their English translations. The relative position of the sun indicates that the four visits do not occur simultaneously, but rather within a seque nce on the same day and within moments of one another. The first vi sit is the one given in John because Mary Magdalene visits Jesus' tomb in the dark, while the other three visits occur either dur ing or after sunrise."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"The Puzzle of the Empty Tomb 131 The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene ear ly, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre. John 20:1 The fact that Mary Magdalene is described as being in the dark not only establishes that this is the beginning of the combined story, it is also the start of the comedy. In the dark, Ma ry sees a tomb that has had its stone moved away. Of course, in the dar k it is easy to make a mistake about whose tomb it is, especially i f there is another tomb close by that also has had its stone rolled aw ay. In fact, the Gospel of John describes just such a tomb. The tomb of Lazarus. Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb; i t was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. Jesus said, \"Take away the stone.\" John 11:38-39 It is important to note that in the New Testament L azarus' \"res- urrection\" occurs in the same week as Jesus' burial and in the same general location. Bethany, the village where Lazaru s lived, was located just outside Jerusalem on the Mount of Olives. The New Testament also states that Lazarus left behind burial clothes and a soudarion, a funeral cloth used to cover the face of the corpse, exactly like those found the tomb of Jesus. The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound wit h bandages, and his face wrapped with a cloth [soudar ion]. Jesus said to them, \"Unbind him, and let him go.\" John 11:44 I believe that these facts, though they have no the ological sig- nificance, are included in the New Testament to all ow the alert reader to understand that the tomb of Lazarus has h ad its stone removed, is adjacent to Jesus' tomb, is empty at th e time that Jesus is entombed, and has the same burial clothes inside it as those dis- covered in Jesus' tomb. In other words, the details indicate that Lazarus' tomb is a parallel of Jesus' tomb."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"132 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH Continuing with the version of the visit to the tom b in the Gospel of John, Mary Magdalene then informs \"Simon Peter\" and \"the other disciple, whom Jesus loved,\" meaning the Apostle John, that Jesus' tomb has had its stone removed. However , notice below that it is not \"Simon Peter\" but \"Peter\" and the \"o ther disciple\" who are then described as running to the tomb. The othe r \"disciple\" arrives first but does not enter the tomb. At this point, not \"Peter\" but \"Simon Peter\" arrives and is the first person t o actually enter the tomb and, once inside, sees \"the linen clothes lyin g\" and the soudar- ion. 111 Notice that the reader's attention is drawn to the linen clothes and the soudarion, on three consecutive lin es. Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto th em, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him. Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple , and came to the sepulchre. So they ran both together: and the other disciple d id outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. John 20:2-4 So the author, by including the odd details of the race between Peter and the other disciple, creates a moment when there is one indi- vidual on the outside of the tomb because, for some reason, after beat- ing Peter to the tomb, the other disciple does not enter it but only looks in. However, notice that he does inspect the inside of the tomb, so he is aware while still on the outside of the tomb tha t Jesus has \"risen.\" And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. John 20:5 The author of John now points out that there is a p eriod of time during which one person, \"Simon Peter,\" is alone in the tomb because the other disciple chooses to wait outside. Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went int o the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The Puzzle of the Empty Tomb 133 And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. John 20 6-7 So \"Simon Peter\" enters the tomb first and sees the burial clothes lying there. Next the author provides another stran ge detail, that the other disciple eventually does enter, creating a mo ment when the two men are alone in the tomb. Then went in also that other disciple, which came f irst to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed. John 20:8 At this point Simon Peter and John return home. Then the disciples went away again unto their own h ome John 20:10 Thus, in the Gospel of John, the sequence of events when Simon Peter and John visit the empty tomb is First, one individual on the outside of the tomb. Second, one individual on the inside of the tomb. Third, two individuals inside the tomb. Using the time line established by the relative pos ition of the sun, the sequence of events, the number and locatio n of the \"angels\" who are inside or outside the tomb, and who greet t he visitors in Matthew, Mark, and Luke is as follows: First, one individual on the outside of the tomb. ( Matthew) Second, one individual on the inside of the tomb. ( Mark) Third, two individuals inside the tomb. (Luke) Obviously, the sequence of events in John is the sa me as the sequence of the encounters with \"angels\" in the oth er three Gospels. The time line shown by the relative position of the sun places \"Simon Peter\" and the other disciple at the exact t ime and location, and in the same number, as the first three encounte rs with the \"angels\" described in the other Gospels."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"134 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH However, there is yet another encounter with \"angel s\" described in the New Testament. In the Gospel of John after S imon Peter and John return home, a character named \"Mary\" is descr ibed as stand- ing outside the tomb weeping. She stoops down and s ees two \"angels\" inside the tomb. She then turns and encoun ters Jesus on the outside of the tomb. But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb; and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the f eet. They said to her, \"Woman, why are you weeping?\" She said to them, \"Because they have taken away my Lord , and I do not know where they have laid him.\" Saying this, she turned round and saw Jesus standin g. John 20:11-14 If, as I am suggesting, Simon Peter and John are th e \"angels\" that Jesus' followers encounter in the visits to th e tomb described in Matthew, Mark, and Luke, then who are the angels th at Mary en- counters in the passage above? The Gospel of Luke r ecords that cer- tain men \"went to the tomb\" after having been told by \"some women of our company\" that Jesus' tomb was empty an d that they saw \"angels.\" Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning and did not find his body; and they came back sayin g that they had even seen a vision of angels, who sai d that he was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb, an d found it just as the women had said; but him they d id not see. Luke 24:22-24 The author of Luke, for some reason, includes the d etail that the men who go to the tomb do so only after a visit by women who had seen angels. Notice the use of the plural. Only in the final visit to the tomb, in Luke, does the group encounter more than o ne angel. Therefore, the visit to the tomb described in Luke could occur only"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The Puzzle of the Empty Tomb 135 after Simon Peter and John, the \"angels\" that the f irst three groups encounter, have returned home. This sequence of eve nts ties in per- fectly with the details described in the Gospel of Luke. Notice that the plural \"those\" is also used to desc ribe the num- ber of men who go to the tomb. This fact is also es sential, since the Mary described at the final encounter sees two ange ls. Further, the Gospel of Luke points out that those men \"did not s ee\" Jesus, which correlates with the fact that the angels Mary sees are inside the tomb, while Mary meets Jesus outside the tomb. The author discloses these facts by including the seemingly irrelevant detail that Mary has to look into the tomb to see the angels. Therefore, when the four versions of the visits to Jesus' tomb are combined into one sequence, they create a version t hat is perfectly logical. As I interpret this combined story, Mary M agdalene, in the \"dark\" (the actual word in the Gospel of John can a lso mean \"reli- gious ignorance\"), does not find Jesus' tomb but La zarus'. The \"angels\" who meet the visitors to the tomb are actu ally Simon Peter and John in the first three encounters, and are the men described as visitors to the tomb in the Gospel of Luke. Jesus d oes not rise from the dead; his disciples simply delude themselves in to believing that he does. Notice that this interpretation makes coherent all the strange details of the \"race\" between \"Simon Peter\" and the other disciple as well as their odd behavior while at the tomb. For e xample, it explains not only why the other disciple does not go into th e tomb when he first arrives but also why he looks into the tomb f rom the outside. These details enable him to be alone outside the to mb when the first group arrives and also to be \"aware\" that Jesus has risen so he is then able to then pass this news along to the group who encounters him. It also explains why the Mary in the Gospel of John sees the angels on the inside of the tomb and encounters Jesus on t he outside. All the seemingly irrelevant details included in the fo ur versions of the visits to the tomb are necessary to construct the p erfectly logical sequence of events in the combined story. This fact—that, of the five versions, only the comb ined version is logical—is another example of what I see as the \"truth\" of the New Testament. That is, its authors did not intend the intelligent"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"136 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH reader to take it seriously. Individuals who think logically and have a sense of humor were intended, at least eventually , to understand its comic level. The meaning of the combined story is clear. For exa mple, what if in our day and age four groups claim to have see n \"angels\" near a cave on the same day and in the following sequence? The first group encounters one \"angel\" outside the cave. The next group encounters one \"angel\" inside the ca ve. Then the third group encounters two \"angels\" inside the cave. Finally, an individual encounters two \"angels\" insi de the cave. Though few would believe such stories, if it were t hen discov- ered that other individuals had been either inside or outside the cave at the same time, and in the same number and sequen ce, then such sto- ries of seeing \"angels\" would be universally unders tood to be prod- ucts of overwrought imaginations. To me, the only possible meaning of the combined st ory is that the disciples mistake one another for \"angels\" and thus pass Mary Magdalene's error on to one another until they all believe that Jesus has risen from the dead. Now, the only question is whether the com- bined story was intentionally created. I believe th at the authors of the New Testament left us a way to answer this. If the combined story was intentionally created, it was the prod- uct of a single individual or group. The four Gospe ls, on the other hand, present themselves as the products of four se parate authors. The probability that four authors could accidentall y record the state- ments of fact necessary to create the combined stor y can actually be computed. The resulting probability demonstrates th at the com- bined story was not the accidental product of four separate authors but was deliberately created. At first glance, the perfect fit that exists in the combined story may not seem extraordinary. After all, it is made u p of only four ele- ments—these being the position of the sun; visitors looking or not looking into the tomb; either zero, one, or two cha racters being present; and the encounter occurring either inside or outside the tomb. However, when one determines the probability of any partic- ular sequence, the length of the sequence can be mo re important than the unusualness of the individual events withi n it."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Puzzle of the Empty Tomb 137 I believe that the authors of the New Testament wer e aware of this principle and use it here as a way of communic ating to the edu- cated reader that the combined story is the correct interpretation of the story of Jesus' resurrection. The truth is comm unicated using a mathematical rather than a verbal language, so that it could not be seen by the ignorant. If Titus had designed the New Testament to satirica lly disclose that he was \"Jesus,\" he would have wished there to be some way to confirm that its satirical dimension was correct. W ith their crude system of numbers the Romans could not do any highe r math; how- ever, they were great gamblers and knew odds well. So the authors made sure that the odds that the combined story was accidentally created were both able to be calculated and too sma ll for an intelli- gent person to take seriously. To clarify how the odds on the combined story can b e calcu- lated, I have edited the four Gospels' versions of the first visit to Jesus' tomb into the comic combined version, in whi ch all the ele- ments in the four stories fit together without cont radiction. The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene ear ly, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre. Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unt o them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.

And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. 112 So the author of John has created a moment when the re is a sin- gle man outside the tomb. In Matthew there is also such a moment, which occurs second in the temporal sequence, when the sun is said to be \"dawning.\""},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"138 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn towa rd the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came a nd rolled back the stone from the door, and was sittin g upon it. Matt. 28:2 The Greek word, seismos, translated in the passage above as \"earthquake\" is more commonly used to describe simp ly a shaking or a commotion. 113 Within the comic interpretation it simply describe s the shaking of the ground caused by the running of the disciples. His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and beca me as dead men. And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fea r not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was cr ucified. He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is r isen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you int o Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told yo u. And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with f ear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples w ord. Matt. 28:8 The author then states that Simon Peter, not Peter, arrived at the tomb. Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went int o the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie. John 20:6 Notice that the \"other disciple\" does not go into t he tomb but that Simon Peter does, creating a period when there is a single visi- tor, Simon Peter, in the tomb."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"The Puzzle of the Empty Tomb 139 And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by i tself. John 20:7 Very early in the morning, on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen. Mark 16:2 This group of women encounters a single man (Simon Peter) who tells them that Jesus has arisen. And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young m an sit- ting on the right side, clothed in a long white gar ment; and they were affrighted. And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen ; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him. But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see h im, as he said unto you. Mark 16:5-7 Thus, a single individual in the tomb tells the wom en to \"tell his disciples' and, specifically, to tell \"Peter,\" that Jesus \"goeth before you\" in Galilee. Notice that this is yet another bi nary chance. If the \"angel\" had instructed the women to tell \"Simon Pet er\" and not \"Peter\" then the logical linkage between the versio n in John and the other three would be destroyed. In other words, within the combined version of the story this individual can only be \"Simon Peter\" and it would b e, thus, contra- dictory for him to instruct the disciples to give a message to himself. However, it is not contradictory for Simon Peter to give a message to \"Peter\" if \"Simon Peter\" and \"Peter\" are different individuals. The author provides two methods by which a logical read er can learn that \"Simon Peter\" and \"Peter\" are separate charact ers. One method the author uses to reveal that \"Peter\" a nd \"Simon Peter\" are separate individuals is having the versi on of the visit to the tomb given in Mark, where the single \"young man \" asks the group"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"140 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH of women to tell \"Peter\" that Jesus has \"risen,\" oc cur later in the day than the version of the visit to the tomb given in John, in which the first person to go into the tomb is \"Simon Peter.\" These facts create the following logical progression: In the Gospel of John, which begins earliest, \"Simo n Peter\" is the first person to enter the tomb. The \"young man\" in the tomb tells Mary Magdalene to tell \"Peter\" that Jesus has risen, showing that \"Peter\" has not been in the tomb yet. Therefore, \"Simon Peter\" cannot be \"Peter.\" The logical reader will identify the single individ ual who the group encounters in the tomb as the only person who has been described as being in the tomb alone, that is, \"Sim on Peter.\" Moreover, in the Gospel of Luke, the character name d \"Peter\" does not go into the tomb when he first comes to it but only looks into it, whereas in the Gospel of John, the charact er named \"Simon Peter\" enters the tomb when he first comes to it. T he reader has a choice: either accept a physical impossibility, tha t an individual both went in and not did not go in the tomb, or recogniz e that \"Peter\" and \"Simon Peter\" are separate characters. As I sho w below, this is the same method that the author uses to reveal that \"Mary Magda- lene\" is the name of more than one character. Continuing with the analysis of the combined versio n, the group that came to anoint Jesus having left, the \"o ther disciple\" then enters the tomb. At this point there are two men in side the tomb. Then went in also that other disciple, which came f irst to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed. John 20:8 Another group of women appears and encounters two m en inside the tomb, \"Simon Peter\" and the \"other disci ple.\" Now on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they, and certain other women with them, came to th e tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared.

Luke 24:1-5 Jesus' followers, who visit the empty tomb, are thu s deluded and then spread to the other disciples the misunderstan ding that Jesus has risen from the dead. Notice how the author sets up the idea that the visitors to the tomb are irrational by his desc riptions of their emotions and behaviors. They are shown as running w ildly, \"affrighted,\" \"weeping,\" \"perplexed,\" \"trembling,\" and \"bow[ing] down their faces to the earth.\" Within the Flavian court, these would have been seen as the behaviors and emotions of the messianic Jews, who, from their perspective, were religious madmen who had deluded themselves into believing that the dead cou ld rise. Having finished greeting the three sets of visitors , Simon Peter and John return home. Then the disciples went away again to their homes. John 20:10 At this point in the combined story the pattern rev erses itself. Instead of characters within the other Gospels enco untering \"angels\" from the Gospel of John, a character from the Gospe l of John encounters \"angels\" who are from the Gospel of Luke . But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb; and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the f eet. They said to her, \"Woman, why are you weeping?\" She said to them, \"Because they have taken away my Lord , and I do not know where they have laid him.\" Saying this, she turned round and saw Jesus standin g, John 20:11-14 The \"angels\" (plural) Mary encounters above are \"lo gically'' the men (plural), described in Luke, who go to the tomb after being told"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"142 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH that Jesus has risen by a group of women who had se en \"angels.\" Notice below that the men do not see Jesus, matchin g the fact that the \"angels\" Mary encounters are inside the tomb an d her encounter with Jesus is outside the tomb. Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning and did not find his body; and they came back sayin g that they had even seen a vision of angels, who sai d that he was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb, an d found it just as the women had said; but him they d id not see. Luke 24:22-24 It is thus possible to create a combined story out of the four dif- ferent versions of the first visit to Jesus' tomb t hat has a different meaning than the individual versions and is without contradiction. None of the statements of fact that make up its sto ry line contradict any other within the combined story The combined st ory is logical, whereas the different versions are contradictory. T he authors' inge- niousness deserves note. Their puzzle is constructe d so that readers who are illogical will believe that the passages in dicate that Jesus rose from the dead, while those who are logical wil l see the passages as a comedy of errors. Moreover, the authors have deliberately made it pos sible to compute the probability that the perfect fit betwee n the sequence of events within the Gospel of John and the other thre e Gospels has occurred by chance. This can be done by use of what I refer to as the \"chain of multiplication.\" This method is used, for example, to ensure that slot machines are profitable for their owners. If a slot machine pays a 1,000-to-one payoff for displaying five cher ries in a row, the likelihood of this occurring must be less than 1,00 0 to one for the machine to be profitable. To create the impression that five sequen- tial cherries is \"likely\" such machines will often have the desired symbol occur in individual slots relatively often, say once in every three pulls. However, one slot will display the sym bol rarely, say once in 100 pulls. Thus, the chain of multiplicatio n to determine such a machine's chances of displaying five cherrie s would be 3 x 3"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The Puzzle of the Empty Tomb 143 x 3 x 3 x 100, which would give the gambler one cha nce in 9,100 of hitting the 1,000-to-one jackpot. If four distinct authors have each created differen t versions of the first visit to the tomb, then each author has a ccidentally recorded different facts. For example, in the Gospel of John the author records that the first visit occurs in the dark. Wh ereas in Luke the author records that the sun has risen before Mary M agdalene comes to the tomb. However, for the combined story to hav e its perfect log- ical and temporal sequence the author of the Gospel of John can only select the position of the sun that indicates that his version begins earliest, which he has only one chance in four of d oing. Likewise, each of the authors of the other three Gospels has only one chance in four of accidentally describing his \"first visit\" a s occurring at the next point within the sequence. Thus, the odds of four d istinct authors accidentally describing their versions beginning wi th John's, then Matthew's, followed by Mark's, and finally Luke's a re 4 X 4 X 4 X 4, or one chance in 256. Notice that this sequence is not accounted for beca use the four authors all reflect a shared tradition, since the s equence is created by the differences among the four versions, not their similarities. A shared tradition would, if anything, make it less l ikely that the four authors would each give a different time for the fi rst visit. A shared tradition is likewise implausible as an explanation for the logical relationship between any of the elements within the sequence, since the logical fit is created by the different facts t hat the four Gospels use to describe the first visit. Combining their co ntradictory state- ments of fact creates the perfect logical fit betwe en the events in the Gospel of John and the other three Gospels; therefo re, their rela- tionship cannot be explained away by suggesting tha t the four dif- ferent authors might have shared a common source. Bear in mind that if even one fact in the four vers ions were dif- ferent from what it is, this would destroy the logi cal sequence between the Gospel of John and the other three Gosp els. For exam- ple, if the author of Matthew, the Gospel whose pos ition of the sun indicates that its visitors have come directly afte r John's, had recorded that the first visitors encountered not one but two angels, then the combined story would become contradictory. This is because this"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"144 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH description would then not match the one in John, w hich states that one disciple arrived first. Therefore, the probabil ity that the author of Matthew accidentally records that the first visi tors encounter only one angel and not, as found within the other Gospel s, zero or two, is one chance in three. And that probability become s an element in a \"chain of multiplication\" for the entire sequence of events. The following are the statements of fact that four distinct authors would have to accidentally record to produce the pe rfect sequence of events between the Gospel of John and the other three Gospels. I have included the lowest odds of each event being r ecorded by a par- ticular author—for example, events four and five be low, where the author of John mentions that the disciple looked in to the empty tomb but did not go into it. It can be argued that the odds of this irrelevant detail even being mentioned at this poin t are far higher than one chance in two. Nevertheless, I give only t he binary possi- bility that is, the author could either record that the disciple did or did not look in. 1) The sun must indicate that \"Mary\" comes first to th e tomb in the version given in the Gospel of John. One chance in four. 2) Mary must encounter no angels during her first visi t to the tomb in the Gospel of John. One chance in three. 3) The other disciple must reach the tomb first, not P eter. One chance in two. 4) The other disciple must not go in. One chance in tw o. 5) The disciple must look in. One chance in two. 6) Simon Peter, not Peter or the other disciple, must be the one who arrives second at the tomb. One chance in three . 7) He must go in alone. One chance in two. 8) The other disciple must go into the tomb after Simo n Peter. One chance in two. 9) The sun must indicate that \"Mary\" comes to the tomb second in the version given in the Gospel of Matthew. One chance in four. 10) The group described in Matthew must encounter o ne angel. One chance in three. 11) The angel in Matthew must be outside the tomb. One chance in two."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The Puzzle of the Empty Tomb 145 12) The sun must indicate that \"Mary\" comes to the tomb next in the version given in the Gospel of Mark.

One chance in two. 20) The angels Mary sees must be inside the tomb, becau se those who go to the tomb in Luke are described as n ot seeing Jesus.

Thus, the chain of multiplication to determine the probability that four distinct authors could record these exact facts by chance would be: 4 X 3 X 2 X 2 X 2 X 3 X 2 X 2 X 4 X 3 X 2 X 4 X 3 X 2 X 4 X 2 X3X2 which equals one chance in 254,803,968. This demonstrates that four distinct authors did no t create the combined story by chance and that it was, therefore , intentionally created. This proof is just as conclusive as, for e xample, the DNA probabilities that are used in our day and age to m atch the blood left at a crime scene with that of a suspect. In fact, D NA probabilities are determined using an approach similar to the one abo ve. My theory is also solid in the sense that it is so easily disprovable. In other words, specialists in probability can easi ly demonstrate any errors in my premises or conclusion. In fact, any c urious reader can simply retrace my steps and come to an independent judgment."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"146 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH In any event, the combined version of the four stor ies is so obvi- ous that it is reasonable to ask why no one noticed it before. The answer is that the contradictions within the four p assages are designed to hide the combined version. These contra dictions must be resolved before one can easily see the comic ver sion that the four passages create. The authors were, in effect, deman ding that the reader be logical before being permitted to see the truth. Other than the contradiction involving \"Simon Peter \" and \"Peter\" mentioned above, all the apparent contradic tions between the four different versions of the first visit to J esus' tomb involve a character named Mary Magdalene. Within the four ver sions of the story she is said to arrive at the tomb at four dif ferent times and with different people, to have touched and not touched J esus, and to have told and not told the disciples that the tomb was e mpty—all logical impossibilities. However, if the female characters in the four versi ons of the visit to the tomb were not all named Mary Magdalene, but were each given a different name, say, Mary, Ruth, Ester, and Elizabeth, then these contradictions would not exist and the comic relationship between the version in John, where the two disciple s race to the tomb, and the other versions, where the visitors en counter \"angels,\" would have become visible. In fact, as readers can ascertain for themselves, the comic version would become all too apparent and Christianity might not be a worldwide religion toda y. Thus, Chris- tianity's very viability can be said to depend on t he notion that all the characters named \"Mary Magdalene\" in the New Te stament are the same individual. However, it is not possible that all the \"Mary Magd alenes\" in the four Gospels are the same person. The authors creat e two methods that enable any logical reader to determine this. F irst, as noted above, it is physically impossible for a single \"Mary Magd alene\" to do every thing ascribed to her in the four stories. Mary Mag dalene cannot \"first\" visit the tomb at different times. She cann ot both be telling Simon Peter that the tomb has had its stone rolled away and at the same time be coming with spices to anoint Jesus. Al so, each of the first visits she makes to the tomb is with differen t individuals, another physical impossibility."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"The Puzzle of the Empty Tomb 147 Further, the Mary Magdalene in the Gospel of Mark, who is told to tell \"Peter\" that Jesus has risen, is said to ha ve told no one. How- ever, the Mary Magdalenes in Luke and Mark do tell the disciples that he has risen; therefore, logically, neither ca n be the \"Mary Mag- dalene\" in Mark. Likewise, the Mary Magdalene in Jo hn cannot be the Mary Magdalene in Matthew, because the Mary in John is not permitted to touch Jesus whereas in Matthew she is described as clinging to his feet. Therefore, a rational reader must conclude that each Mary Magdalene is a distinct character. 114 The illogical reader—that is, the one who takes the New Testa- ment \"seriously\" and therefore sees Jesus as divine —must accept the contradictions that the four versions of the first visit to Jesus' tomb create. Such a reader accepts that Mary Magdalene f irst visits the tomb at different times and with different people, that she both touches and does not touch Jesus, and that she both tells and does not tell the disciples that Jesus has arisen. The a uthors of the Gospels may have believed that such a reader deserv es, and perhaps even needs, \"Jesus.\" For the logical reader, who understands that each \" Mary Mag- dalene\" must be a separate character, these contrad ictions are resolved. The contradictions regarding the time of the first visit, the different number of people in the group that visits the tomb \"first,\" as well as how many \"angels\" the different groups find near th e tomb, are all resolved by this single insight. As are the contrad ictions of Mary Magdalene's touching and not touching Jesus, and he r telling and not telling the disciples that Jesus has risen. Thi s single insight allows the truth, that is, the combined version, to be see n. Moreover, \"Mary Magdalene,\" like \"Jesus Christ,\" ca n also be seen as a title, not just a name. Mary Magdalene me ans simply Mary from Magdala, a town in Galilee. From the Roman per spective, any rebellious female—that is, any \"Mary\"—from Magdala would be a Mary Magdalene. The point that the authors wish the logical reader to understand here is simply that the same name can be given to m ore than one person. The authors of the New Testament constructe d the puzzle of the empty tomb in such a way that its solution, the realization that more than one character is being referred to by the same name, is"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"148 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH also the solution to understanding the New Testamen t itself. There can be more than one Mary Magdalene, and, therefore , there can be more than one Jesus. The notion that the New Testament is referring to m ore than one individual as \"Jesus,\" while seemingly far-fetc hed, is actually the only way to resolve the contradictory facts within it. In fact, as with \"Mary Magdalene\" the authors made it logically impo ssible for the \"Jesuses\" described in the four Gospels to have bee n the same per- son. And, as I have shown, logic, memory and derisi ve humor are the prerequisites the authors of the New Testament require of a reader to understand its truth. One way in which th e New Testament reveals that there is more than one \"Jesus\" is the different genealo- gies for the Jesuses in Matthew and Luke, Since the re is nothing inadvertent within the New Testament, two distinct genealogies would indicate, of course, two distinct individuals . Likewise, the Jesus who is crucified in the Gospel of John could not be the Jesus who is crucified in any of the Syn optic Gospels, because he is crucified on the day before Passover, whereas the all the other Jesuses are crucified on Passover itself. Also, each of the Jesuses in the four Gospels has a group of disciple s with slightly dif- ferent names. And, of course, nowhere in the Gospel s is there a physical description of Jesus. One of the reasons that the comic element of the ma ny Jesuses was not noticed previously is that early in Christi an history a redac- tor made an editorial change to the name of the New Testament character known today as Barabbas. Barabbas is a co mposite word made up from the Hebrew bar (son) and abba (father) , which is to say \"son of the Father.\" While the character is kno wn today simply as Barabbas, this was not his name in the version o f the New Testa- ment early church scholars were familiar with. We k now from Ori- gen (c. 250 C.E.) and others 115 that the versions of the New Testa- ment they were familiar with referred to this chara cter as not as Barabbas but as Jesus Barabbas. Origen wrote concerning his dismay over the fact th at the name of the criminal when Jesus was imprisoned with was \"Jesus Barab- bas,\" that is, Jesus, the son of the Father. Althou gh he did not rec- ognize the name as humorous, he sensed intuitively that there was"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"The Puzzle of the Empty Tomb 149 something wrong with Jesus' cellmate having a name so similar to his own. This concern was evidently shared by later church officials because all the earliest extant copies of the New T estament (Sinaiticus, Alexandrinus, Vaticanus) refer to this character on ly as Barabbas. However, based on modern scholarship, both the New English Bible and the Scholar's Version 116 have decided to give Jesus Barabbas as the name of this character in their translations. In such a translation, the purpose of the character named Jesus Barabbas becomes clear. The New Testament is flatly stating that there was more than one \"Jesus.\" Notice the humor i n Pilate's state- ment below, \"I will therefore chastise him and rele ase him.\" The joke being that it is impossible to know which \"Jesus\" P ilate is referring to as \"him.\" Notice also that, just as they were at the empty to mb, the Jews are characterized as being highly emotional. The hu mor derives from the idea that in such a state they cannot tell one \"Jesus\" from the other. But they all cried out together, \"Away with this ma n, and release to us Jesus Barabbas\"— a man who had been thrown into prison for an insur- rection started in the city, and for murder. Pilate addressed them once more, desiring to releas e Jesus; but they shouted out, \"Crucify, crucify him!'\" A third time he said to them, \"Why, what evil has h e done? I have found in him no crime deserving death; I wil l there- fore chastise him and release him.\" But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries tha t he should be crucified. And their voices prevailed. So Pilate gave sentence that their demand should be granted. Luke 23:18-24 In each of the Gospels, following the \"resurrection ,\" the disci- ples are described as encountering a character name d Jesus. How- ever, the dead cannot come back to life. The author s of the Gospels are simply continuing the joke that starts with the disciples mistak-"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"150 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH ing one another for angels in the empty tomb of Laz arus. Each Gos- pel comically reveals that the individual the disci ples believe to be the resurrected Messiah is different from the one w ho was crucified, by repeatedly stating that they could not recognize the \"resurrected\" Jesus. The related passages follow. When they saw Him, they worshiped Him, but some doubted. Matt. 28:17 After this he appeared in another form to two of th em, as they were walking into the country. Mark 16:12 But they were terrified and frightened and supposed they had seen a spirit. Luke 24:37 While they were talking and discussing together, Je sus himself drew near and went with them. But their eye s were kept from recognizing him. Luke 24:16 Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the beach; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. John 21:4 In John 20:15 below, Mary Magdalene is also unable to recog- nize Jesus and confuses him with a \"gardener.\" This passage is a part of the \"root and branch\" element of humor, which ce nters around Titus \"pruning\" the Jewish Messiah Eleazar, who was \"carried away\" on the Mount of Olives. This episode is the prophetic and comic climax of t he New Tes- tament. It is the moment that \"foresees\" Titus swit ching himself for the Jewish Messiah—which actually occurs in John 21 . That is when, following his killing of \"Jesus,\" Titus begin s to be the \"Jesus\" of Christianity. A reader who is able to understand the following \"prophecy\" regarding Titus has essentially solved t he central puzzle of the New Testament and War of the Jews."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"The Puzzle of the Empty Tomb 151 Notice the brilliant irony in Mary's mistaking the Messiah for a \"gardener\" and asking if he has \"carried him away.\" This is exactly what happens to Eleazar, who is \"carried away\" by a \"gardener\" on the Mount of Olives. The authors have Mary mistake the individual for a gardener because this creates a satirical pre diction of what in fact has already occurred. The truth is a mirror im age of the surface narration. While Jesus is mistaken for a gardener w ho has not \"car- ried the Messiah away\" Titus becomes a \"gardener\" w ho is mistaken for Jesus and who carries away the Messiah. Jesus said to her, \"Woman, why are you weeping? Who m do you seek?\" Supposing him to be the gardener, she sa id to him, \"Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me wh ere you have laid him, and I will take him away.\" Jesus said to her, \"Mary.\" She turned and said to h im in Hebrew, \"Rab-boni!\" (which means teacher). John 20:15-16 The following passage from War of the Jews reveals why Titus finds it necessary to create a religion that worshi ps him without its members knowing it. Titus' problem is that the Sica rii refuse to call him Lord, even after being tortured. To circumvent this stubborn- ness, Titus simply switches himself into the Jew's Messiah. The ulti- mate joke of Christianity is that it causes Jews to call Caesar Lord without their knowing it. The passage also contains another element of Christianity evidently stolen from the Sicarii m ovement, that of its members rejoicing while being tortured for refu sing to renounce their faith. ...

So far does the strength of the courage [of the soul] prevail over the weakness of the body. 117 The switching of Titus with Jesus occurs in John 21 . The chap- ter begins with Jesus coming to the Sea of Galilee in the morning, where he \"showed\" himself to his disciples. The dis ciples are described as being unable to recognize Jesus from t he small boat in which they have spent the night. Jesus instructs th em to \"cast the net\" after which they haul in a \"multitude of fish. \" Being informed that it is \"the Lord,\" Simon swims ashore, where he and the disci- ples eat \"bread\" and \"fish\" with Jesus, who then pr ophesies that Simon will be put to death but that John will be sp ared. After these things Jesus showed Himself again to th e dis- ciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and in this way He s howed Himself: Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other s of His disciples were together. Simon Peter said to them, \"I am going fishing.\" The y said to him, \"We are going with you also.\" They wen t out and immediately got into the boat, and that night they caught nothing. But when the morning had now come, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it w as Jesus. Then Jesus said to them, \"Children, have you any food?\" They answered Him, \"No.\" And He said to them, \"Cast the net on the right sid e of the boat, and you will find some.\" So they cast, an d now they were not able to draw it in because of the multitud e of fish. Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Pe ter, \"It is the Lord!\" Now when Simon Peter heard that i t was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he was n aked), and plunged into the sea."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The Puzzle of the Empty Tomb 153 But the other disciples came in the little boat (fo r they were not far from land, but about two hundred cubit s], dragging the net with fish. Then, as soon as they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread. Jesus said to them, \"Bring some of the fish which y ou have just caught.\" Simon Peter went up and dragged the net to land, fu ll of large fish, one hundred and fifty-three; and alt hough there were so many, the net was not broken. Jesus said to them, \"Come and eat breakfast.\" Yet n one of the disciples dared ask Him, \"Who are You?\"—know ing that it was the Lord. Jesus then came and took the bread and gave it to them, and likewise the fish. This is now the third time Jesus showed Himself to His disciples after He was raised from the dead. John 21:1-14 This story of the disciples catching \"fish\" shares a number of parallels with the passage in War of the Jews that describes the Romans catching Jews like fish on the Sea of Galilee, whic h I have discussed previously. In that passage Josephus describes a ba nd of rebels led by a Jesus, the son of Shaphat. This Jesus leads a sally against the Romans. In res ponse, Ves- pasian orders Titus to take a force and counteratta ck Jesus and his band. Before the battle, Titus delivers the speech in which he describes the coming battle as \"my onset.\" He then attacks the Jews with his troops and routs them. Some of the Jews, h owever, escape to their boats on the Sea of Galilee (Josephus desc ribes these boats as \"small,\") where they spend the night. The next morn ing, Titus orders his soldiers to construct boats to attack the Jews. In the ensuing sea battle, the Romans catch Jews like fish. Following the battle Josephus describes the dead bodies of the Jews giving off a terrible stink. 118 The following diagram is presented for clarificatio n of the par- allels between Josephus' \"sea battle\" passage and J ohn 21:"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"154 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH 1. Both passages describe the followers of a \"Jesus\" w ho spend the night in a small boat. 2. Both passages describe a \"catching\" that occurs the following morning. 3. Each passage occurs on the Sea of Galilee (Tiberias ). 4. Jesus and Titus share the previously noted collecti on of par- allels in John 21 involving the condemning of \"Simo n\" and the spar- ing of \"John.\" The parallels work to give a typological and satiri cal meaning to John 21, one that should not be difficult for the r eader to see at this point. Indeed, if Jesus were to say to his disciple s to \"cast a net\" and become \"fishers of men\" in John 21, then the satiri cal relationship between that passage and Josephus' description of t he sea battle becomes too obvious to overlook. The fact that Jesu s makes this prophecy earlier in his ministry does not make its implications any less clear—particularly in light of the fact that t he group that he instructs to \"cast a net\" in John 21 contains Simon , James, and John, the same individuals he has predicted would \"hencef orth\" become \"catchers of men\" earlier in his ministry. Once again, the authors of the New Testament are te sting the memory of the reader. Only the reader with a good m emory will recall that it is Simon and the \"sons of Zeb'edee\" whom Jesus has earlier predicted would \"henceforth\" be \"catching m en.\" And only such a reader will recall that Jesus made this prop hecy regarding \"catching men\" while standing on the very beach whe re Titus stands while his soldiers catch Jews like fish. Notice that the author indicates only that the even ts of John 21 take place \"after these things\"—that is, after Jesu s' crucifixion. In other words, the events of John 21 could have occur red at any time following the crucifixion and can be understood as being contem- poraneous with the events of the parallel \"fishing\" passage from War of the Jews. With this clever device the authors un ify the time frames of the Gospels and War of the Jews. John 21 is inte nded to be under- stood as both an event from the life of a Jewish Me ssiah circa 30 C.E. and a depiction, albeit satirical, of Titus' sea ba ttle with the messianic Galilean fishermen. The passage can be read both as the end of the story of one savior of Israel and the beginning of the story of another."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"The Puzzle of the Empty Tomb 155 As with the different Gospels that form the puzzle of the empty tomb, John 21 and the \"catching passage\" from War o f the Jews are designed to be interactive. And, again, their inter action creates a story different from the benign one that appears on the surface. John 21 interacts with Josephus' \"catching\" passage to c reate a satire indi- cating that the confused followers of Jesus mistake Titus for the Lord. The \"Jesus\" they follow, \"Jesus, the son of Shaphat , the princi- pal head of a band of robbers,\" is not on the beach because Titus has killed him. Josephus records his death in the passa ge, stating that: \"Titus had slain the authors of this revolt,\" clear ly indicating Jesus. Therefore the \"Jesus\" that the disciples follow no longer exists and they mistake Titus for their Lord—\"Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.\" Thus deluded, the dis- ciples then do Titus' bidding, helping the Romans c apture the Jew- ish rebels swimming in the Sea of Tiberias by \"cast ing their net.\" The satire is a perfect synopsis of the real intent of Christianity, which is to \"convert\" the followers of the Jewish Messiah in to followers of Caesar without their knowing it. Having achieved his goal, Titus, the \"Lord,\" then s its down with his new \"disciples\" for a breakfast of \"bread\" and \"fish.\" The words \"bread\" and \"fish\" are, as I have shown, both used as synonyms for human flesh in the New Testament. Notice the authors witticism. The disciples don't a sk his name— which would give away the fact that his name is Tit us—but \"know\" that he is the \"Lord.\" Jesus said to them, \"Come and eat breakfast.\" Yet n one of the disciples dared ask Him, \"Who are You?\" —Knowin g that it was the Lord. Jesus then came and took the bread and gave it to them, and likewise the fish. This is now the third time Jesus showed Himself to His disciples after He was raised from the dead. The interaction between the New Testament and War o f the Jews identifies the \"fish\" that Titus served to his new disciples in John 21 as the \"putrefied\" bodies of the \"fish\" killed by t he Romans during"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"156 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH the battle mentioned above. This putrid smell of th e \"fish\" on the beach parallels the stench recorded in the other pa ssages of canni- balism—the tomb of Lazarus in the New Testament and Mary's son in War of the Jews. And a terrible stink, and a very sad sight there wa s on the following days over that country; for as for the sh ores, they were full of shipwrecks, and of dead bodies all swe lled; and as the dead bodies were inflamed by the sun, and pu trefied, they corrupted the air. And the \"bread\" that the disciples eat is also iden tified in the New Testament. It is the flesh of the Messiah who w as \"raised from the dead.\" Notice how clear an example the followin g passage is of Jesus' seemingly symbolic statements taking on a co mic meaning when read literally. \"I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; an d the bread that I shall give is my flesh, which I shall give f or the life of the world.\" The Jews therefore quarreled among themselves, say- ing, \"How can this Man give us his flesh to eat?\" Then Jesus said to them, \"Most assuredly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drin k his life blood, you shall have no life in you.\" John 6:51-53 To make clear that it is the body of the \"Son of Ma n\" that the disciples are feasting on, John 21 states that this is \"the third time Jesus showed Himself to His disciples after He was raised from the dead.\" The author is including this detail at this point because the \"Jesus\" who actually rose \"from the dead\" was Lazar us, who \"showed himself to the disciples twice previously, first at his \"resurrection\" and then again at the \"feast of Lazarus.\" The disci ples are being sat- irized as unwittingly feeding on the Messiah's body . The joke regard- ing \"bread\" in John 21 is that they are eating from the same \"loaf that was eaten during the \"feast of Lazarus\" above."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"The Puzzle of the Empty Tomb 157 I would note that the analysis above has implicatio ns for the sacrament of Communion. It suggests that the Romans deliberately created the ritual as a cruel joke on Christians. In any event, the humor that the Romans created reg arding the cannibalism of the messianic Jews evidently springs from the irony they saw in a people with such strict dietary laws eating rancid human flesh. The irony of the Jews, a people too fa stidious to eat pork, eating human flesh would have been widely und erstood within the patrician class when War of the Jews was writte n. The satirist Juvenal, for example, referred to it without provid ing any context. Some, whose Lot it has been to have Sabbath fearing fathers, Worship nothing but clouds and the numen of heavens , And see no difference between the flesh of swine an d humans Since their fathers abstained from pork. 119 The two \"Jesuses\" who are on the beach when the Rom ans catch Jews in the Sea of Galilee, Titus and Jesus the Son of Shaphat, are simply the final Jesuses within another comic turn. All the Jesuses encountered after the resurrection are different in dividuals. As they have done with the various \"Mary Magdalenes\" the au thors include seemingly irrelevant details in each Gospel that ma ke it logically impossible for any of the four Jesuses encountered after the \"resur- rection\" to have been the same individual. In Matthew, the Jesus encountered by his disciples does not ascend to Heaven, instead saying to his followers, \"I am with you always.\" In Mark, however, Jesus is described as as cending to heaven, just as he is in the Gospel of Luke. Though these t wo ascension sto- ries appear identical, in fact they take place at d ifferent locations. The authors reveal this in an earlier passage in Mark ( Mark 14:28). This passage indicates that Jesus will meet with his dis ciples in Galilee, obviously some days following his resurrection, whe reas the ascen- sion in Luke occurs just outside Jerusalem on the s ame day as the resurrection.

Whenever two events seem to contrad ict each another, the reader needs to recognize that he or she is rea ding incorrectly. That is to say, that he or she is making an incorre ct assumption. In this case, the incorrect assumption is that all the Jesuses in the Gospels are the same individual. Simply changing th at assumption makes the Gospels become \"true\"—that is, without co ntradiction. However, who do the disciples encounter at the conc lusions of Matthew, Mark, and Luke if not the Jesus who was cr ucified? Just as the authors have identified whose empty tomb Mary M agdalene dis- covers—with its stone \"rolled away\"—before she come s across it in the dark, the authors have already given the reader this information. The Jesuses depicted at the conclusion of the Synop tics are the three Jesuses whom Pilate has previously released, Jesus Barabbas. As the New Testament's final comic stroke, each Gos pel concludes with a different individual as its Jesus. Of course , the final Jesus is the one described in John 21, the very end of the G ospels. That Jesus is Titus, the \"true\" Son of God whom Christianity w orships. I suspect that the herd of Jesuses roaming about at the conclu- sions of the four Gospels are a joke reflecting the fact that there were numerous individuals claiming to be the Messiah dur ing this era, a fact that is recorded in both the New Testament and War of the Jews. The authors of the New Testament are perhaps comica lly making the point that, since there are already so many \"Messia hs,\" or \"Christs,\" there is no reason why Titus could not be one as we ll. Finally, a question I found interesting is whether the authors intended to put forth the \"combined version\" of the visit to the empty tomb and the revelation that Jesus did not ri se from the dead as a philosophical statement advocating reason over religious mysti- cism. The reader must resolve those logical contrad ictions; if he or she fails, the punishment is belief in a false god. It is possible that the authors of the Gospels crea ted them as a sort of educational tool disguised as a narrative a bout Jesus. The authors may have wished their readers to work throu gh the various contradictions in logic in order to develop their r easoning ability and thus be able to think their way out of religiou s superstition. They may have wished the Gospels to be seen by post erity as their contribution to the development of reason."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"C H A P T E R 7 The New Root and Branch Having shown the methods that the Romans used to sa tirically com- municate the real history of their struggle with th e messianic Jews, I can now present the most complex of their works. The reader will recognize that I have already touched on many of th e passages that make up this satire. These separate elements were d esigned to be linked together to create a larger intertextual sto ry. I refer to this satire as the \"new root and branch. \" It is a vast lit- erary device coursing through the Gospels and three of Josephus' books. Because it extends over several different bo oks, it is hard to discover, but this literary device is not unusual i n Hebrew literature. It is, for instance, similar to the way in which th e Abraham saga is continued in the Book of Samuel and the Book of Kin gs. Through a series of distinct passages, one character becomes associated with another character by means of parallel acts or loca tions, and by means of similar language. The purpose of this particular satire is to documen t that the \"root\" and \"branch\" of the Judaic messianic lineage has be en destroyed and that a Roman lineage has been \"grafted on\" in its p lace. This satirical system actually begins in the Book of Malachi, the final book of the Old Testament. Malachi means \"my messenger\" in Hebr ew and was used as an epithet for the prophet Elijah. This is because in Judaic literature it was predicted that the Messiah would be preceded by the appearance of Elijah, who would act as the messenge r of his coming. But I shall send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. Malachi 4:5 159"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"160 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH This final passage in the Book of Malachi predicts a coming dis- aster for the \"wicked,\" one that will leave them de stroyed by fire and with neither \"root\" nor \"branch.\" For behold, the day is coming, burning like an oven , and all the proud, yes all who do wickedly will be stubble. And the day which is coming shall burn them up, says the Lo rd of Hosts, [and] will leave them neither root nor branc h. Malachi 4:1 Josephus clearly records that the first part of thi s prophesy con- cerning the \"wicked\" being \"burned up,\" came to pas s during the war with the Romans. He also records that the secon d part of the prophesy—that they would be left with neither \"root \" nor \"branch\"— was also fulfilled during Titus' campaign, though n ot so overtly. To understand that the \"wicked,\" that is, the messiani c rebels, were to be left with no \"root\" or \"branch,\" the reader need s to comprehend perhaps the most complex literary satire ever writt en. As noted above, \"root\" and \"branch\" were Judaic met aphors used to denote the messianic lineage. For example, the G enesis Flori- legium states: . . . until the Messiah of Righteousness, the Branc h of David comes, because to him and his seed was given the Covenant of the Kingdom of his people . . . 120 This root and branch messianic imagery found in the Dead Sea Scrolls is a continuation of its use by the prophet Isaiah concerning the coming Messiah, as the following translation fr om another frag- ment of the Scrolls shows: . . . Isaiah the Prophet . . . the thickets of the forest will be felled with an axe and Lebanon shall fall by a migh ty one. A staff shall rise from the root of Jesse, {and} a pl anting from his roots will bear fruit. . . the Branch of David. 121 The authors of the New Testament continue the messi anic root and branch metaphor, though with a totally differen t perspective. Within the New Testament, the root and branch image ry is pre- sented in the context of their being transformed in to a different lin-"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"The New Root and Branch 161 eage—the lineage of the new Messiah. The \"branches\" are described as either being \"pruned\" or being \"grafted onto.\" J esus predicts— echoing the Book of Malachi—that those \"branches\" t hat do not \"abide\" in the new Judaism he brings will be \"burne d.\" If anyone does not abide in me, he is cast out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them and throw the m into the fire. John 15:6 Josephus builds on the root and branch imagery in t he New Tes- tament by establishing a series of related parallel s. As we have seen so often, these parallels contain puzzles that reve al the names of unnamed characters. And in every case the name of t he unnamed character is Eleazar. My interpretation of the para llels involving Eleazar is that they indicate that Eleazar was the name of the indi- vidual that the messianic rebels looked to as the \" root\" foreseen by Judaic prophesy. Judging from the satire, this indi vidual may actu- ally have existed and have been the spiritual leade r of the rebellion. As is the case with all the typological passages, t he root and branch satire can be recognized by determining the temporal order in which its events occur, even though they are des cribed in differ- ent books. This is the same technique required to s olve \"the puzzle of the empty tomb\" above, where the reading has to arrange the four empty tomb texts in chronological order to comprehe nd the com- bined story that the texts create. Josephus provide s the reader with a clear path to this temporal understanding. The other keys to recognizing the satire are the sa me ones that are used throughout the New Testament and War of th e Jews. These are parallel locations and conceptual parallels. Fu rther, some of the principles from the Roman sciences of botany and ho meopathic medicine are used in the \"root and branch\" satire. Roman medicine considered that whatever made you sick could someti mes cure you. For instance, one treatment for a scorpion bite was to apply mashed raw scorpion to the wound. Roman botany considered that by intro- ducing tamed specimens into a colony of wild plants , a hybrid and lamer plant would result."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"162 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH Pedanius Dioscorides, the chief physician and botan ist accom- panying Vespasian and Titus in Judea, was familiar with both of these scientific principles. They are key elements in the \"root and branch\" satire. Pedanius was justly famous for pioneering the first documented use of anesthesia and the first medical use of elec tric shock therapy (using electric eels to generate the current). He a lso wrote a text- book on botany that became the basis for modern her balism and identified hundreds of medicinal plant roots—\"many very servicea- ble roots,\" as he put it—that had not previously be en known to medical science. As one of Rome's leading scientist s, Pedanius would certainly have advised Titus on what Josephus calls the \"use- ful science\" 122 of expelling demons from apparently insane people. One of the elements of the root and branch satire i s the strange plant that Josephus calls rue; it has a root by the name of \"baaras.\" This root, baaras, has the power to dispel demons, defined by Jose- phus as the \"spirit of the wicked.\" That Josephus mentions a plant named rue is signifi cant, since rue is one of the plants that Pedanius studied and wrote about. In his textbook On Herbalism, he explains the dangers of the wild, or mountain rue, and the benefits of the domesticated, or garden rue, which grew near fig trees and could be safely eaten . Pedanius' gardening technique is, essentially, the core of the Roman pacification strategy documented in the root and branch satire: the Romans attempted to \"domesticate\" the J ews by pruning the root of their demonic wickedness, the Messiah E leazar, and then grafting in the root that is Jesus, which has the p ower to dispel demons. A quote from Titus recorded by the fourth-century C hristian writer Sulpcius Severus mentions his understanding of the impor- tance of the \"root\" to the Jews and Christians. Titus is said to have first summoned a council and deliber- ated whether or not he should destroy such a mighty tem- ple .. .

To begin the analysis, I would first note the eleme nts from the New Testament that are used in the root and branch satire. These concepts are so well known that I feel it is unnece ssary to include the related texts and only provide the following li st. Root and branch elements in the New Testament: 1. The messianic lineage is described as being \"pruned \" 2. There is a prediction that the messianic lineage wi ll be grafted onto 3. Jesus' capture occurs on the Mount of Olives 4.

War, 4, 9.5 The following passage is also part of the satire. T he reader should recognize it as the passage 1 analyzed above, which led me to under- stand that the name of the Messiah captured on the Mount of Olives was Eleazar. One of the elements that makes the roo t and branch satire so difficult to comprehend is that it uses t he solutions to other puzzles as components. In other words, a reader mus t first solve the puzzle that reveals that the \"certain young man\" ca ptured on the Mount of Olives was named Eleazar to be able to mov e forward and see the even larger story that the captured Eleazar is a part of. For clarification, I present the following list of the elements in the story that are part of the satire. Location: Mount of Olives 1. Eleazar 2. Pedanius (physician) 3. Pedanius hangs Eleazar down from his hand as he \"ca rries him away\" 4. Capture occurs on the Mount of Olives 5. The fact that Eleazar is ordered to be \"pruned\" Many of the seditious were so pressed by the famine . . . that they got together, and made an attack on those Roman guards that were upon the Mount of Olives . . .

It occurs after the sie ge of Jerusalem but before the passage describing Eleazar's capture and release at Macherus. Its temporal orientation relative to the other events in the root and branch satire is crucial, and to make this more difficult to see, the event is recorded in Josephus' autobiograp hy and not in War of the Jews. However, Josephus did provide—for the alert reader—a path to understanding, when his crucifixion scene o ccurred relative to the other events in the satire. He did so with t he statement \"More- over, when the city Jerusalem was taken by force, I was sent by Titus,\" which indicates that the event occurred after the c apture of the \"cer- tain young man\" on the Mount of Olives by Pedanius but before the siege of Macherus, which occurred after Titus had l eft Judea. This relative placement is also crucially important for the over- all parallel sequence between Jesus' ministry and T itus' campaign. In other words, as in the New Testament, the \"three ar e crucified, one survives\" episode occurs after the Mount of Olives capture but before the condemnation of Simon and the sparing of John, which Titus learned of by letter after he had left Jerusa lem. 124 The following list contains the elements that are u sed in the root and branch satire from the passage below, desc ribing three Jews who are crucified and one who survive at Thecoa. Location: Thecoa 1) Three are crucified but one survives 2) Joseph bar Matthias takes survivor down from the cr oss 3) Pitched camp at Thecoe 4) Physician Moreover, when the city Jerusalem was taken by forc e, I was sent by Titus Caesar, to a certain village call ed Thecoa,"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"166 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH in order to know whether it were a place fit for a camp; as I came back, I saw many captives crucified, and remem bered three of them as my former acquaintance.

Josephus Life, 26 Following Titus' return to Rome, Josephus describes a valley next to the fortress Macherus in which a \"magic roo t\" that could dis- pel demons grew. The following list contains the el ements in that passage that are used in the satire. Location: Baaras 1) A root that can dispel demons 2) The fact that this root must be hung down from the hand of its captor as he \"carries it away\" Now within this place there grew a sort of rue that deserves our wonder on account of its largeness, for it was no way inferior to any fig tree whatsoever, either in heig ht or in thickness; and the report is, that it had lasted ev er since the times of Herod, and would probably have lasted much longer, had it not been cut down by those Jews who took possession of the place afterward. But still in tha t valley which encompasses the city on the north side there is a certain place called Baaras, which produces a root of the same name with itself. Its color is like to that of flame, and towards the evenings it sends out a certain ray lik e light- ning. It is not easily taken by such as would do it , but recedes from their hands, nor will yield itself to be taken quietly, until either the urine of a woman, or her menstrual blood, be poured upon it; nay, even then it is cert ain death to those that touch it, unless any one take and han g the root itself down from his hand, and so carry it away. It may also be taken another way, without danger, which is this : they dig a trench quite round about it, till the hidden part of the root be very small, they then tie a dog to it, and when the"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"The New Root and Branch 167 dog tries hard to follow him that tied him, this ro ot is easily plucked up, but the dog dies immediately, as if it were instead of the man that would take the plant away; nor after this need any one be afraid of taking it into their hands. Yet, after all this pains in getting, it is only valuabl e on account of one virtue it hath, that if it be only brought t o sick per- sons, it quickly drives away those called demons, w hich are no other than the spirits of the wicked, that enter into men that are alive and kill them, unless they can obtai n some help against them. 125 Immediately following the description of the magic root Jose- phus describes another incident involving an Eleaza r at one of the Herodian fortresses, Macherus. The following elements from the passage are part of the satire. Location: Macherus 1. Herodian fort 2. Eleazar 3. The fact that Eleazar is carried away in his armor 4. The fact that Eleazar survives his crucifixion Now a certain person belonging to the Roman camp, w hose name was Rufus, by birth an Egyptian, ran upon him sud- denly, when nobody expected such a thing, and carri ed him off, with his armor itself; while, in the mean time , those that saw it from the wall were under such an amazement, that Rufus prevented their assistance, and carried Eleaz ar to the Roman camp. So the general of the Romans ordere d that he should be taken up naked, set before the ci ty to be seen, and sorely whipped before their eyes. Upon th is sad accident that befell the young man, the Jews were t erribly confounded, and the city, with one voice, sorely la mented him, and the mourning proved greater than could wel t be supposed upon the calamity of a single person. 126 When Bassus perceived that, he began to think of us ing a stratagem against the enemy, and was desirous to aggra- vate their grief, in order to prevail with them to surrender the city for the preservation of that man.

These men were greatly moved with what he said , there being also many within the city that interceded for him, because he was of an eminent and very numerous fami ly; so they now yielded to their passion of commiserati on, con- trary to their usual custom. Accordingly, they sent out immediately certain messengers, and treated with th e Romans, in order to surrender the citadel to them, and desired that they might be permitted to go away, an d take Eleazar along with them. Then did the Romans and th eir general accept of these terms . . . Bassus thought he must perform the covenant he had made with those that ha d sur- rendered, he let them go, and restored Eleazar to t hem. The famous depiction of the siege of Masada is also part of this satirical theme. Its elements are Location: Masada 1. Herodian fort 2. Eleazar 3.

Since D omitian did not travel to Judea, this fact establishes that the eve nt took place after Titus had returned to Rome. In the passage, Eleazar is us ing a magic root to remove demons from captives. Its elements within the satire are Location: Rome 1. Eleazar 2. Magic Root 3. Demons cannot pass through water ... for I have seen a certain man of my own country , whose name was Eleazar, releasing people that were demoni acal in the presence of Vespasian, and his sons, and his cap- tains, and the whole multitude of his soldiers. The manner of the cure was this: He put a ring that had a root of one of those sorts mentioned by Solomon to the nostrils of the demoniac, after which he drew out the demon through his nostrils . . . And when Eleazar would persuade and demon- strate to the spectators that he had such a power, he set a little way off a cup or basin full of water, and co mmanded the demon, as he went out of the man, to overturn i t, and thereby to let the spectators know that he had left the man. 127 To begin the interpretation of the root and branch satire, I would note that all the passages above involve a characte r named \"Eleazar.\" In the passages that occur at Herodian, Macherus, M asada, and Rome, Josephus names the character overtly. In the case of the \"young man\" who was \"carried away\" at the Mount of Olives, I have already shown the puzzle that leads to this conclus ion. The crucified man who survived at Thecoa and the \"magical root\" o f Baaras are also part of the satirical system regarding Eleazar . This is an exam- ple of the same motif that I discussed previously r egarding the vari- ous Marys and Simons. In other words, all the Eleaz ars are part of a single satirical element. The passages work together to create a story descri bing the Roman capture of the messianic root of the Jews—Ele azar—and then their \"pruning\" of him and transforming him in to Jesus, the demon-dispelling, pro-Roman Messiah."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"170 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH The parallel that indicates that Eleazar is the \"ro ot\" is quite overt. The reader must recall the method by which J osephus states someone may capture the magic root baaras—that is, the \"Son\"— without killing himself: \". . . it is certain death to those that touch it, unless any one take and hang the root itself do wn from his hand, and so carry it away.\" This is the precise, and implausible, method used b y Pedanius to procure Eleazar on the Mount of Olives: \"... so low did Pedanius bend himself downward from his horse . . . and so g reat was the strength of his right hand ... So this man seized u pon that his prey, as upon a precious treasure, and carried him as his captive to Caesar.\" Notice the parallel language \"down,\" \"hand,\" and \"c arried away.\" As his depiction of the \"magic root\" does, Josephus ' preposter- ous description of Pedanius' capture of the \"certai n young man\" on the Mount of Olives stretches credulity. This liter ary device alerts the reader that the tales are not literal history a nd that, therefore, he or she should look for another type of meaning. In this instance, the parallel methods by which they are captured identif ies, metaphori- cally, that Eleazar is, like baaras, a dangerous \"r oot.\" This identifica- tion is also facilitated by the name of the root—ba aras—which means \"son.\" Further, the satirical capture by Peda nius of the Jew- ish Messiah, who is the \"root\" to the messianic reb els, contributes to the overall satirical theme and the wit. Because Pe danius was the Romans' most renowned root specialist, he would hav e been, of course, the one chosen to handle such a dangerous o ne. The meaning of the tale of the \"magic root\" of baar as within the root and branch satire is also easy to understand. It documents the existence of a metaphorical \"root\" that had the pow er to remove demons—obviously the Jesus of the New Testament, th e only indi- vidual in history with such power. The Romans would graft this demon-dispelling \"root\" onto Eleazar once they had \"pruned\" him, thereby transforming the \"root\" that had infected s o many with a demonic spirit into one that had the power to remov e demons. Parallels also indicate that the individual who sur vived his cru- cifixion at Thecoa was the Messiah. This individual would have been a \"Christ\" because, like his \"type\" in the New Testament, he"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"The New Root and Branch 171 was the sole survivor among three crucified men. Th e two must be among the few individuals in history to have surviv ed a crucifixion. Further, a \"Joseph of Arimathea\" arranged for both survivors to be taken down from the cross. This is to say that t he last names of the two Josephs—\"Josephus Bar Matthias\" and \"Joseph of Ari- mathea\"—are homophonically similar. \"Arimathea\" is an obvious play on Josephus' last name, \"Bar Matthias,\" which is quite similar to the \"Iscariot/Sicarii\" pun noted above. The Gosp el of Barnabas, a noncanonical Gospel from the middle ages, does not even bother with this word play and states that the name of the individual who took Jesus down from the cross was \"Joseph of Barim athea.\" \"Joseph of Arimathea\" is also identified as the \"type\" of J osephus bar Matthias by his job description—counselor. (Luke 23 :50) The individual who survived his crucifixion at Thec oa is also linked to the Eleazar captured on the Mount of Oliv es by the physi- cian Pedanius in that Josephus states that it was a physician who restored him to life. Pedanius was the physician wh o accompanied Titus to Judea and therefore would have been the ph ysician at The- coa. Finally, the Eleazar who committed suicide at the fortress Hero- dian had pitched camp at Thecoa previously and had, thus, answered the question Josephus asked about whether Thecoa was a \"fit place to camp.\" The name of the place where the crucifixion occurre d—The- coa—is also part of the satirical system. Thecoa, o r Theo Coeus, is the name of the Roman god of the questioning intell ect. The point being made here is that the irrational Jewish Messi ah was taken to the place of a discerning or questioning intellect. There he was, as Titus ordered, \"pruned\" and, as Paul described, \"gr afted onto\" with a new \"root\" and was thus transformed into a Messia h deemed rational by the Romans. Knowing that the \"magic root\" was named Eleazar, as was the man who survived his crucifixion at Thecoa, and kno wing the time sequence with which these events took place, enable s the reader to perceive the satire that all the passages work toge ther to create. The Eleazar captured by Pedanius on the Mount of Ol ives is taken to Thecoa, where he is \"hung on a tree\"—that is crucified—"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"172 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH and, as Titus has ordered, \"pruned.\" The botanist a nd physician Pedanius then grafts the magic root of baaras onto him. This process transforms Eleazar from a \"root\" that causes the Je ws to be pos- sessed by a demonic spirit into the \"root\" that dis pells demons. Eleazar has become Jesus. Once this Eleazar has been satirically pruned and g rafted onto at Thecoa, he is \"given back\" to the Jews at Macher us. In this way the Romans introduce a \"tame,\" or domesticated, pla nt into a field of wild ones to decrease the wildness of later gene rations. Of note is the fact that, at this point, the satire takes the story of Jesus beyond the story line of the Gospels and begins to describ e the implemen- tation of Christianity by the Romans. This satirica l introduction of the domesticated \"Jesus\" takes place in the passage that immediately follows the description of the \"magic root.\" In tha t passage the Roman general Bassus seeks to make the Jews inside the Herodian fortress Macherus surrender by threatening to cruci fy Eleazar in front of them. Those Jews who \"accept these terms\" are permitted to survive and Bassus then restores \"Eleazar\"—obviousl y, the Eleazar \"carried away\" at the Mount of Olives and treated b y the physician at Thecoa—to them and they go on their way. In othe r words, those Jews who accept the tamed Messiah and his pro-Roman doctrines are allowed to live. At Masada, however, another Eleazar, a parallel to the Eleazar at Herodian, refuses to surrender and commits suicide. The point is that refusal to surrender and accept the new Judais m is tantamount to suicide. With this Eleazar's death, Josephus is also terminating the \"root\" and \"branch\" of the Maccabean lineage so tha t it will not compete against the \"domesticated\" messianic lineag e newly estab- lished by Rome. Josephus concludes the \"root and branch\" satire wit h the description of yet another Eleazar, one who perform s exorcisms at Rome. This Eleazar uses the \"magic root\" to pull de mons out of cap- tives, clearly indicating captured messianic Jews. This image repre- sents a complete victory for the Roman \"homeopathic \" approach to the problem of the messianic \"root\" that caused Jew s to be possessed by \"demons.\""},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"The New Root and Branch 173 The \"root\" that caused the Jewish rebels to be infe cted has been domesticated by Pedanius and can therefore now be u sed to cure them of the disease it brought about.

These prisoners were the 2,000 rebels who were capt ured at Gadara. Being demonically possessed, they could not pass th rough water and therefore did not drown. As the demon leaves them, it concludes the joke by knocking over the water basin. The passage is also Josephus' last depiction of the \"domesti- cated\" Christ that the Romans created and it provid es us with their vision of his future.

Are not these things come to pass? Are n ot the things announced by thee fulfilled? Is not their co untry, Judea, desolate? Is not the holy place burned with fire? Are not their walls cast down?

The parallels between the two lists of signs do see m too exact to have occurred by chance. I disagree, however, with Hippolytus' belief that they were the result of supernatural causes. I would point out that whenever two documents have similarities too e xact to have been caused by chance, parsimony requires that the first theory to explore is that the two works have emanated from th e same source. This is the simplest theory and should be maintaine d until another explanation is shown to be more plausible.

And besides, many of those that were worn away by the famine, and their mouths almost closed, when they saw the fire of the holy h ouse, they exerted their utmost strength, and brake out i nto groans and outcries again: Pera (17) did also retur n the echo, as well as the mountains round about [the cit y,] and augmented the force of the entire noise.

And now it was that the multitude of the robbers were thrust out [ of the inner court of the temple by the Romans,] and had m uch ado to get into the outward court, and from thence into the city, while the remainder of the populace fled into the clois- ter of that outer court. As for the priests, some o f them plucked up from the holy house the spikes (18) that were upon it, with their bases, which were made of lead, and shot them at the Romans instead of darts.

Besides these, a few days after that feast, o n the one and twentieth day of the month Artemisius [lyar], a certain prodigious and incredible phenomenon appeared: I su p- pose the account of it would seem to be a fable, we re it not related by those that saw it, and were not the even ts that followed it of so considerable a nature as to deser ve such signals; for, before sun-setting, chariots and troo ps of sol- diers in their armor were seen running about among the clouds, and surrounding of cities. Moreover, at tha t feast which we call Pentecost, as the priests were going by night into the inner [court of the] temple, as their cust om was, to perform their sacred ministrations, they said that, in the first place, they felt a quaking, and heard a great noise, and after that they heard a sound as of a great multitu de, say- ing, \"Let us remove hence.\" At this point in the passage Josephus begins his de scription of the character I refer to as the lunatic Jesus.

Hereupon our rule rs, supposing, as the case proved to be, that this was a sort of divine fury in the man, brought him to the Roman pr ocura- tor, where he was whipped till his bones were laid bare; yet he did not make any supplication for himself, nor s hed any"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH tears, but turning his voice to the most lamentable tone possible, at every stroke of the whip his answer wa s, \"Woe, woe to Jerusalem!\" And when Albinus (for he was the n our procurator] asked him, Who he was? and whence he ca me? and why he uttered such words? he made no manner of reply to what he said, but still did not leave off his melan- choly ditty, till Albinus took him to be a madman, and dis- missed him. Now, during all the time that passed be fore the war began, this man did not go near any of the citizens, nor was seen by them while he said so; but he every day uttered these lamentable words, as if it were his p remedi- tated vow, \"Woe, woe to Jerusalem!\" Nor did he give ill words to any of those that beat him every day, nor good words to those that gave him food; but this was his reply to all men, and indeed no other than a melancholy pres age of what was to come.

But these men interpreted some of these signals accordi ng to their own pleasure, and some of them they utterly d espised, until their madness was demonstrated, both by the t aking of their city and their own destruction. 128 In Matthew 23 and 24 Jesus expresses what has been called his eschatological, or doomsday, vision. In fact, the e ntire passage appears to be nothing other than a \"prophecy\" of events and details that have occurred during Titus' destruction of Jerusale m, all of which can be found in Josephus' passage above, which desc ribes that event. The related New Testament passages follow with the discussion points in boldface type. The passage contains, as J esus himself describes them, the signs that will indicate that t he \"Son of Man\" has come to destroy Jerusalem. Jesus had left the Temple and was going on His way, when His disciples came and called His attention to the Temple buildings.\"You see all these?\" He replied; \"in sole mn truth I tell you that there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be pulled down.\" Afterwards He was on the Mount of Olives and was seated there when the disciples came to Him, apart from the others, and said, \"Tell us when this will be; a nd what will be the sign of your Coming and of the Close of the Age?\" \"Take care that no one misleads you,\" answered Jesu s; \"for many will come assuming my name and saying 'I am the Christ;' and they will mislead many. \"And before long you will hear of wars and rumors o f wars.

I shall first focus upon the parallels betwe en Josephus' lunatic Jesus and the New Testament's Jesus. There are nume rous parallels between the eschatological Jesus of Matthew 23 and 24 and the tragicomic Jesus described in the passage from Jose phus, whom I refer to as the lunatic Jesus. I believe that Josephus in tentionally creates a lampoon of the New Testament's Jesus by having the lunatic Jesus share his words, phrases, ideas, and experiences—an d, obviously, by means of their shared name. They are parallel in on e other important way. Each gives a list of \"signs\" that foretell Jer usalem's impending doom. These lists include a number of identical phr ases and concepts. For example, the Jesus of the New Testament states: For just as the lightning flashes in the east and i s seen to the very west, so will be the Coming of the Son of Man. And He will send out His angels and they will gathe r together his elect, from the four winds, and from o ne end of heaven to the other. Then will the Kingdom of the H eavens be found to be like ten bridesmaids who took their torches and went out to meet the bridegroom. The lunatic Jesus also speaks of \"east\" and \"west,\" \"the four winds,\" and \"bridesmaids,\" and \"bridegrooms.\" Notic e that the lan- guage is used in the same sequence in both works: . . . began on a sudden to cry aloud, \"A voice from the east, a voice from the west, a voice from the four winds, a voice against Jerusalem and the holy house, a voice again st the bridegrooms and the brides, and a voice against thi s whole people!\" The lunatic Jesus clearly predicts the destruction of the temple when he says \"a voice against the holy house.\" The New Testament Jesus makes the same prediction."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Until All Is Fulfilled 185 His disciples came and called His attention to the Temple buildings. \"You see all these?\" He replied; \"in solemn truth I tell you that there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be pulled down.\" The New Testament Jesus uses the word \"woe\" seven t imes dur- ing his speech in Matthew 23. The Jesus in Josephus ' passage, above, who seemingly lampoons the New Testament Jesus, als o constantly repeats the word \"woe.\" Woe to you, blind guides . . . Matthew 23:16 And from the passage in Josephus: Woe, woe to the city again, and to the people, and to the holy house! Both Jesuses are using the word \"woe\" to describe t he disasters that will come to the inhabitants of Jerusalem when the \"Son\" returns. The New Testament Jesus foresees this disaster occu rring with the return of a \"Son of God,\" while Josephus' lunatic J esus also foresees this occurring with coming of a \"son of god,\" this one being Titus. It needs it be pointed out that Matthew 23 and 24 s imply divide one speech, so that the parallels between these cha pters and Jose- phus' description of the signs that preceded the de struction of the temple should be taken as unified. The lampoon is made even clearer when Josephus reco rds that the lunatic Jesus has a passion experience very sim ilar to that of the Jesus in the the New Testament. Like the New Testam ent Jesus, the lunatic Jesus is taken by \"eminent Jews\" to the Rom an procurator, where he is whipped until his bones are laid bare. Like the New Tes- tament Jesus he is described as a man with \"divine\" fury. Josephus links his lunatic Jesus to the Jesus in th e New Testa- ment in yet another way, by the date of his death. Josephus enables the reader to calculate this date by stating that t he time when the lunatic Jesus began his wailing was \"four years bef ore the war"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"186 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH began\" and that he continues \"without growing hoars e\" for \"seven years and five months.\" As noted by Eisenman, these dates indicate that the lunatic Jesus died on Passover in 70 C.E. 130 This is a precise 40-year \"gen- eration\" from the beginning of the ministry of the the New Testa- ment's Jesus—who predicted that his prophecies woul d be fulfilled within 40 years. Jesus ben Ananias is another comic fulfillment of the the New Testament Jesus' prophecy. Finally, the completely unbelievable yet very comic end of the woe-saying Jesus in Josephus is related to the comi c New Testament theme regarding \"stones.\" This cry of his was the loudest at the festivals; a nd he con- tinued this ditty for seven years and five months, without growing hoarse, or being tired therewith, until the very time that he saw his presage in earnest fulfilled in our siege, when it ceased; for as he was going round upon the wall, he cried out with his utmost force, \"Woe, woe to the c ity again, and to the people, and to the holy house!\" And just as he added at the last, \"Woe, woe to myself also!\" there came a stone out of one of the engines, and smote him, and killed him immediately; and as he was uttering the very sa me presages he gave up the ghost. In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus states that the tem ple of Jeru- salem will be destroyed. He then is asked what sign s will foretell its destruction. Jesus responds with a list of signs th at will occur before the coming of the \"Son of Man,\" the individual whos e visitation will bring about the destruction. Josephus also gives a list of signs that, as he rel ates it, actually did precede the destruction of the temple. When the se two lists of signs are compared, a number of parallels emerge. The first parallel is almost too obvious to be noti ced—the loca- tion and subject of both passages. They both descri be activity in and around the temple of Jerusalem and both have to do with its destruc- tion. Further, both Jesus and Josephus flatly decla re that they are going to reveal the signs that will precede the com ing destruction of the temple."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Until All Is Fulfilled 187 Thus, the title of the chapter in War of the Jews r eads: THE GREAT DISTRESS THE JEWS WERE IN UPON THE CONFLAGRATION OF THE HOLY HOUSE. CONCERNING A FALSE PROPHET, AND THE SIGNS THAT PRECEDED THIS DESTRUCTION. At the beginning of Matthew 24 Jesus is asked the f ollowing question: Afterwards He was on the Mount of Olives and was se ated there when the disciples came to Him, apart from th e oth- ers, and said, \"Tell us when this will be; and what will be the sign of your Coming and of the Close of the Age?' Jesus' doomsday visions are thus parallel to Joseph us' chapter heading, . . . SIGNS THAT PRECEDED THIS DESTRUCTION. Both sets of signs are, thus, in relation to the co ming destruc- tion of the temple. Jesus states that these signs w ill also herald the coming of the \"Son of Man\" and the beginning of the \"tribulation\" during which the temple will be destroyed. Josephus records that very similar signs, in fact, did occur just before just the destruction of the temple. For clarification, I will go through the list of si gns that Jesus envisioned and then present the parallel signs that Josephus recorded as having come to pass. The New Testament Jesus sees false prophets rising and leading the people astray. \"Take care that no one misleads you,\" answered Jesu s; \"for many will come assuming my name and saying 'I am the Christ;' and they will mislead many. Many false prophets will rise up and lead multitude s astray ...\" This \"comes to pass\" in this passage from Josephus:"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"188 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH A false prophet was the occasion of these people's destruc- tion, who had made a public proclamation in the cit y that very day, that God commanded them to get upon the t em- ple, and that there they should receive miraculous signs of their deliverance. Now there was then a great numbe r of false prophets suborned by the tyrants to impose on the people, who denounced this to them, that they shoul d wait for deliverance from God . . . Jesus described the route the Son of Man would take . For just as the lightning flashes in the east and i s seen to the very west, so will be the Coming of the Son of Man. This was the direction of the march of the Roman ar my as they entered Judea on the east and carried their conques t westward. Like Daniel [Daniel 7,13] the New Testament Jesus s ees a sign of the Son of Man in the sky foreshadowing that the destruction is imminent: \"One like the Son of Man, coming with the clouds of heaven!\" In Josephus, we read of an actual sign in the cloud s foretelling the imminent destruction of Jerusalem. . . . before sun-setting, chariots and troops of so ldiers in their armor were seen running about among the cloud s . . . The parallel between the sign of \"chariots and troo ps . . . among the clouds\" given by Josephus and the \"sign of the Son of Man in the sky\" given by Jesus is problematic for Christianity . If one accepts, as the early Christian scholars did, that the signs Je sus gives in Matthew came to pass with the signs Josephus record s, then it is dif- ficult to gainsay that Jesus was referring to Titus as the \"Son of Man,\" chariots and troops being more synonymous wit h leaders of Roman armies than with religious sages. This parall el is as clear as any of the other parallels between the signs that J esus foresees in Matthew 23 and 24 and the signs that Josephus gives in War of the Jews, and to attempt to exclude it would constitute special pleading. Of interest is the fact that on the Arch of Titus a t Rome there is a relief depicting both Titus' consecratio and his co nquest of Jeru- salem, which shows him being carried into the cloud s on an eagle."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Until All Is Fulfilled 189 Other scholars have noticed the connection between Jesus and Titus that Josephus' sign regarding chariots and tr oops creates. The eighteenth-century theologian Reland wrote concerni ng this partic- ular sign that . . . many will here look for a mystery, as though the mean- ing were, that the Son of God came now to take veng eance on the sins of the Jewish nation . . . Reland was simply stating the obvious. Since Jesus' eschatolog- ical prophecies were solely regarding the destructi on of Judea by the Romans, they appear to envision him coming \"at the head of the Roman army.\" Because Titus was the head of the army that destroyed Jerusalem, the parallel that this sign creates betw een Jesus and him seems clear. Continuing with the lists of signs, in the New Test ament Jesus predicts \"woe\" for women who are suckling a child. And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days. Matt. 24:19 Josephus shows that this came to pass. She then attempted a most unnatural thing; and snat ching up her son, who was a child sucking at her breast, she said, \"O thou miserable infant! for whom shall I preserve thee in this war, this famine, and this sedition?\"... As so on as she had said this, she slew her son, and then roasted h im, and eat the one half of him , . . Jesus foresees \"famines and earthquakes\" as signs o f the coming destruction. In the above passage from Josephus, th e priests \"felt a quaking\" as they attempted to perform their ministr ations. Josephus describes \"many that were worn away by the famine.\" In Matthew 24 Jesus states let him who is on the roof not go down to fetch wha t is in his house; nor let him who is outside the city stay to pick up his outer garment."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"190 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH In the following passage, Josephus records that thi s sign \"came to pass\": And now the Romans, judging that it was in vain to spare what was round about the holy house, that they set that cloister on fire; by which means it came to pass th at some of these were destroyed by throwing themselves down head- long, and some were burnt in the cloisters themselv es. Nor did any one of them escape with his life. A false p rophet was the occasion of these people's destruction, who had made a public proclamation in the city that very day, th at God commanded them to get upon the temple, and that the re they should receive miraculous signs of their deliv erance.

Thus, all of Jesus' prophecies were foreseeing events from the coming w ar. The following quote underscores this idea. . . . Wherever the dead body is, there will the eag les flock together. . . Since the eagle was the symbol of the Roman army, t he idea behind this passage also seems clear. Numerous scho lars have understood the passage to indicate that Jesus is fo reseeing the Roman army gathering about the corpses amidst the d estroyed tem- ple. As Albert Barnes wrote in his Commentary on Ma tthew in 1832: This verse is connected with the preceding by the w ord \"for,\" implying that this is a reason for what is s aid there— that the Son of Man would certainly come to destroy the city, and that he would come suddenly. The meaning is that he would come, by means of the Roman armies, as cer - tainly, as suddenly, and as unexpectedly as whole f locks of vultures and eagles, though unseen before, see thei r prey at a great distance and suddenly gather in multitud es around it... So keen is their vision as aptly to re present the Roman armies, though at an immense distance, spying , as it were, Jerusalem, a putrid carcass, and hastening in mul- titudes to destroy it. The New Testament makes it clear that Jesus has see n into the future and is telling the Jews what they must do to avoid \"tribulation.\" For there will rise up false Christs and false prop hets, dis- playing wonderful signs and prodigies, so as to dec eive, were it possible, even God's own People . . . Remember, I have forewarned you.

As with all of Jesus' prophecies, his list of signs operates on two levels. On their surface they would have demonstrat ed to early une- ducated Christian converts the divinity of Jesus. P otential converts would have been shown the prophecies of Christ in t he New Testa- ment and then the realization of each prophecy in W ar of the Jews— the official prophet corroborated by the official h istory. This would have both \"proven\" the divinity of Christ, because he had been able to see into future, and simultaneously justified th e Romans' destruc- tion of Jerusalem, because it \"proved\" that it had been foreseen by God. On their comic level, however, the two lists o f signs are obvi- ously clues to the real identity of the Son of Man— Titus Flavius. I note another parallel between Jesus' eschatologic al prophecies and War of the Jews that is related to this theme. Jesus in Matthew 24 states ... for then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world and assuredly never will be again. Josephus records that this too came to pass. . . . the misfortunes of all men, from the beginnin g of the world, if they be compared to these of the Jews, ar e not so considerable as they were. 131 There is another parallel between the signs in Matt hew 23 and the signs in Josephus. I will analyze it separately because of its unique comic nature. This parallel has long puzzled scholars. The confusion has been due to its not being understood both as a joke and as another of the parallels between Jesus' mini stry and Titus' campaign, that which were created to give their two stories the same broad outline. In the Gospels, Jesus states You serpents, you brood of vipers, how are you to e scape being sentenced to hell?"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Until All Is Fulfilled 193 Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes, some of whom you will kill and crucify, an d some you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute f rom town to town, that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of innocent Abel to the bl ood of Zechari'ah the son of Barachi'ah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. Truly, I say to you, all this will come upon this g eneration. Matt. 23:33-36 In War of the Jews Josephus writes: And now these zealots and Idumeans were quite weary of barely killing men, so they had the impudence of se tting up fictitious tribunals and judicatures for that purpo se; and as they intended to have Zacharias the son of Baruch, one of the most eminent of the citizens, slain, so what pr ovoked them against him was, that hatred of wickedness and love of liberty which were so eminent in him . . . Now the seventy judges brought in their verdict tha t the person accused was not guilty, as choosing rather t o die themselves with him, than to have his death laid at their doors; hereupon there arose a great clamor of the z ealots upon his acquittal, and they all had indignation at the judges for not understanding that the authority tha t was given them was but in jest.

Jesus leaves the interior of the temple, where the dialogue of Matthew 23 occurs, an d then contin- ues this speech (Matthew 24) outside the temple.

In light of the numerous para llels in Matthew 24 and War of the Jews, we are on solid footing whe n we understand this to be another example of Jesus \"seeing\" someth ing in the future that Josephus documents. There is a problem with accepting that the parallel belongs in the same set as Jesus' famous eschatological prophe cies, however. The character that Jesus refers to appeared not in his future but in his past. The prophet \"Zachari'ah the son of Barach i'ah\" is a charac- ter from the Old Testament, so how can Jesus be for eseeing him in the future? Further, how could Josephus then record that Jesus was right, that Zacharias' death occurred in 70 C.E., a long with the other prophecies envisioned by Jesus in Matthew 23 and 24 ? I include Whiston's fascinating comment regarding t he passage from Josephus. He was aware of the parallel between the Zacharias in Josephus and the Zachari'ah in the New Testament and was trou- bled by its implications. Some commentators are ready to suppose that this \"Zacharias, the son of Baruch,\" here most unjustly slain by the Jews in the temple, was the very same person wi th \"Zacharias, the son of Barachias,\" whom our Savior says the Jews \"slew between the temple and the altar,\" M atthew 23:35. This is a somewhat strange exposition; since Zechariah the prophet was really \"the son of Barach iah,\" and \"grandson of Iddo,\" Zechariah 1:1; and how he d ied, we have no other account than that before us in St. Ma tthew: while this \"Zacharias\" was \"the son of Baruch.\" Sin ce the slaughter was past when our Savior spake these word s, the Jews had then already slain him; whereas this slaug hter of \"Zacharias, the son of Baruch,\" in Josephus, was th en about thirty-four years future. And since the slaug hter was \"between the temple and the altar,\" in the court of the priests, one of the most sacred and remote parts of the whole temple; while this was, in Josephus' own word s, in the middle of the temple, and much the most probabl y in the court of Israel only (for we have had no intima tion that the zealots had at this time profaned the court of the priests.

His second ign ores the many slight changes in spelling between the same words i n Josephus and the New Testament. For example, a type of fish from the Sea of Galilee is spelled \"Coracin\" in Josephus and \"Chora 'zin\" in the New Testament. His third point, regarding the possible differences in the location of the slayings, is contradictory of his a cceptance of the other parallels between the same passages in the Ne w Testament and Josephus as evidence of Christ's divinity. Further, it is obvious that Jesus' prophecy regardi ng, \"Zechar- i'ah the son of Barachi'ah, whom you murdered betwe en the sanctu- ary and the altar,\" 134 would have been understood by an uneducated first-century convert to Christianity as having com e to pass by the passage in Josephus that states, \"so two of the bol dest of them fell upon Zacharias (the son of Baruch) in the middle of the temple, and slew him.\" Josephus and the New Testament consistently avoid v erbatim parallels by one degree. In the chapter ahead on th e Book of Daniel, Jesus speaks of the \"abomination of desolation,\" wh ile Josephus refers to the \"end of the daily sacrifice.\" In fact , both expressions refer the same thing. Someone to whom the two works would be read would then make the connection between the \"di fferent\" terms and thereby come to the conclusion that Jesus had b een able to see into the future.

As I have shown above, Simon becomes Peter, John becomes \"the disciple Jes us loved,\" etc. The two passages above regarding Zacharias use this technique. Jesus uses the expression \"between the sanctuary an d the altar,\" while Josephus uses the expression \"middle of the t emple.\" Jesus speaks of \"Zechari'ah the son of Barachi'ah.\" Josep hus refers to \"Zacharias the son of Baruch.\" Different words agai n express the same concept. Since Jesus' eschatological prophecies all came to pass in the same chapter from War of the Jews, is it not more l ogical to presume that the Zacharias stories are another example of t his set of fulfilled prophecies? However, pursuing this line of thought was impossib le for Whiston. 135 To do so, he would have had to accept that both Je sus and Josephus were in error because they each \"saw\" something that could not have happened in 70 C.E. To Whiston, Jesu s could not err, by definition, because he was God. Likewise, to Whi ston, as to so many Christian scholars, Josephus could not be mist aken because his history records God's handiwork. This is a demonstration of the power of the combina tion of the two works. The belief that they came from two disti nct sources cre- ates the effect that they demonstrate the supernatu ral, which is to say, Jesus' power of prophecy. The New Testament re veals the true \"Son of God\" because Christ's predictions come true . A \"historian\" records them. Josephus' histories must be accurate because they record the works of God. Jesus predicts the events that Josephus sees. Whiston's intellect is powerless to analyze what is right in front of him because of the divinity that the two works \" demonstrate.\" If someone had suggested to Whiston that the Zacharias story in Jose- phus and Christ's prediction regarding Zacharias in the New Testa- ment combine to form a joke, he would not and could not have understood such humor.

Josephus then \"records\" it coming to pass, a second time, in the future. An absurd comic romp comparable with the woe-saying Jesus being struck dead by a stone. Imagine someone today who, claiming to be able to see the future, g ives a list of events that will happen in the coming century. At the end of the list, he pre- dicts that Germany will lose World War II. The come dy is vaudevillian. There are several points. First, the most straightf orward, non- supernatural explanation is that the same source pr oduced both the Zechari'ah, son of Barachi'ah, passage in the New T estament and the Zacharias, son of Baruch, passage in Josephus. This is because it is unlikely that two distinct authors would have made the same mis- take. Further, the passages work together to create a hum orous piece, another example of the New Testament and War of the Jews produc- ing a comic effect when read together. The New Testament passage regarding Zacharias is al so notable in that it gives a point in time when \"these things shall come upon this generation.\" In other words, Jesus is predicti ng exactly when the tribulation of the \"wicked generation\" shall occur— that is, directly following their killing of Zacharias. David Brown w rote in 1858: Does not this tell us plainly as words could do it, that the whole prophecy was meant to apply to the destructio n of Jerusalem? There is but one way of setting this asi de, but how forced it is, must, I think, appear to every un biased mind. It is by translating, not \"this generation,\". . . but \"this nation shall not pass away\": in other words, the Je wish nation shall survive all the things here predicted! Nothing but some fancied necessity, arising out of their vi ew of the prophecy, could have led so many sensible men to pu t this gloss upon our Lord's words. Only try the effect of it upon the perfectly parallel announcement in the previous chap- ter: \"Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers . . . Where- fore, behold, I send you prophets, and wise men, an d scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify ; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, a nd persecute from city to city . . . that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the b lood of"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"198 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.

Beyond all q uestion he does; and if so, what can be plainer than that this is his meaning in the passage before us? 136 Brown is arguing that the context of Jesus' use of the word gen- eration in the Zacharias passage proves that Jesus is referring to the events of 70 C.E. I could not agree more. When Jesu s states that the Jews have been wicked \"from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias\" and that this generation will \" fill up\" on the measure of their fathers, a first-century convert t o Christianity would have understood that he was \"predicting\" the Jews' destruction in 70 C.E. Indeed, what other interpretation of Jesus' wo rds is possible? In addition, by giving \"the blood of Zacharias\" as the end point of the Jews' wickedness Jesus is also clearly stati ng it that will be an event immediately before the \"wicked generation\" wi ll \"fill up\" on their \"tribulation.\" Jesus is clearly predicting th at Zacharias' blood will be spilled immediately before the Jews' destru ction by the Romans. This temporal parallel, that both Jesus and Josephu s \"saw\" Zacharias as being killed by the \"wicked generation \" immediately before the destruction of the temple, is of great i mportance. By each placing the destruction of Zachariah immediately be fore the destruction of the temple, the authors of the New T estament and War of the Jews create another of their \"milestones ,\" conceptually parallel events that occur in the same sequence. The final \"fulfilled prophecy\" I want to analyze fr om Jesus' doomsday speech in Matthew is the one that he makes regarding a \"stone\" that will crush. In the passage, Jesus also predicts that another nation, obviously Rome, will be given the \"Kingdom of God.\" \"Have you never read in the Scriptures,\" said Jesus , \"The Stone which the builders rejected has been made the Cor- nerstone: this Cornerstone came from the Lord, and is wonderful in our eyes?"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Until All Is Fulfilled 199 That, I tell you, is the reason why the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and given to a nation that will exhibit the power of it. He who falls on this stone will be severely hurt; b ut he on whom it falls will be utterly crushed.\" Matt. 21:44.6 In the Whiston translation of War of the Jews, publ ished by J. M. Dent in 1915, I found the following extraordinary p un regarding the \"stone\" that \"crushed.\" First is the passage as I originally read it (in a more recent trans- lation). This is the translation given in most mode rn English ver- sions of Josephus: The engines, that all the legions had ready prepare d for them, were admirably contrived; but still more extr aordinary ones belonged to the tenth legion: those that threw darts and those that threw stones were more forcible and larger than the rest, by which they not only repelled the excursions of the Jews, but drove those away that were upon th e walls also. Now the stones that were cast were of the wei ght of a talent, and were carried two furlongs and further. The blow they gave was no way to be sustained, not only by t hose that stood first in the way, but by those that were beyo nd them for a great space. As for the Jews, they at first w atched the coming of the stone, for it was of a white color, a nd could therefore not only be perceived by the great noise it made, but could be seen also before it came by its bright ness; accordingly the watchmen that sat upon the towers g ave them notice when the engine was let go, and the sto ne came from it, and cried out aloud, in their own cou ntry's language, THE STONE COMETH, so those that were in i ts way stood off, and threw themselves down upon the g round; by which means, and by their thus guarding themselv es, the stone fell down and did them no harm. But the R omans contrived how to prevent that by blacking the stone , who then could aim at them with success, when the stone was not discerned beforehand, as it had been till then; and so"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"200 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH they destroyed many of them at one blow. Yet did no t the Jews, under all this distress, permit the Romans to raise their banks in quiet; but they shrewdly and boldly exerted themselves, and repelled them both by night and by day. 137 In the 1915 Dent translation, this passage reads di fferently. \"THE STONE COMETH\" was translated as \"THE SON COMET H.\" To determine the basis for this discrepancy I looke d at the passage in the oldest Greek versions of War of the Jews. Th ey all show the phrase as \"ho huios erchetai\" \"huios\" being the Gre ek word for \"son.\" Modern translators have arbitrarily substitu ted the word they believed Josephus intended to use here (stone), ref using to translate the actual Greek word that appears in the oldest ex tant manuscripts. This is interesting because the word petros, which scholars have cho- sen to translate \"stone,\" is in no way linguistical ly similar to the word huios \"son,\" which is actually found in the pa ssage. Whiston was aware that the original word in the phr ase is \"huios.\" In his translation of Josephus he left the footnote below, in which he attempts to explain how it came to pass th at all the ancient works he used for his translation had used the Gree k word huios for son. His explanation is fascinating in that it is a n example of the kind of cognitive dissonance that he and other scho lars have used to avoid seeing what is right in front of them. He adm its that the only language in which \"stone\" and \"son\" might have been mistaken for one another, Hebrew, is not the language in which J osephus wrote War of the Jews. He also argues that alternative tr anslations—arrow or dart—are \"groundless conjectural alteration.\" Th erefore, he really has no alternative than to accept the word as it is written—that is, \"SON.\" However, he does not wish to do this either, leaving him with no explanation. What should be the meaning of this signal or watchw ord, when the watchmen saw a stone coming from the engin e, \"The Stone Cometh,\" or what mistake there is in the read- ing, I cannot tell. The MSS., both Greek and Latin, all agree in this reading; and I cannot approve of any ground less con- jectural alteration of the text from \"ro\" to \"lop,\" that not the son or a stone, but that the arrow or dart cometh; as hath"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Until All Is Fulfilled 201 been made by Dr. Hudson, and not corrected by Haver camp. Had Josephus written even his first edition of thes e books of the war in pure Hebrew, or had the Jews then use d the pure Hebrew at Jerusalem, the Hebrew word for a son is so like that for a stone, ben and eben, that such a co rrection might have been more easily admitted. But Josephus wrote his former edition for the use of the Jews beyond E uphrates, and so in the Chaldee language, as he did this seco nd edi- tion in the Greek language; and bar was the Chaldee word for son, instead of the Hebrew ben, and was used no t only in Chaldea, etc. but in Judea also, as the New Test ament informs us. Dio lets us know that the very Romans a t Rome pronounced the name of Simon the son of Giora, Bar Poras for Bar Gioras, as we learn from Xiphiline. Reland takes notice, \"that many will here look for a mystery, as though the meaning were, that the Son of God came now to t ake vengeance on the sins of the Jewish nation;\" which is indeed the truth of the fact, but hardly what the J ews could now mean; unless possibly by way of derision of Chr ist's threatening so often made, that he would come at th e head of the Roman army for their destruction. But even t his interpretation has but a very small degree of proba bility. 138 Whiston mentions the seventeenth century scholar an d theolo- gian Reland's interpretation of the phrase. It is a most straightfor- ward understanding and based, of course, on the wor d \"SON\" being the word Josephus wrote. Reland understood that the phrase relates to the coming of the Son of God described in the Ne w Testament. Further, Whiston's next comment—\"which is indeed th e truth of the fact, but hardly what the Jews could now mean; unle ss possibly by way of derision of Christ's threatening so often ma de, that he would come at the head of the Roman army for their destru ction\"—is so in accord with my thinking as to need almost no clarif ication. Whiston is specifically taking the position that I am argui ng, that Christ's prophecies relate to the coming war between the Rom ans and the Jews, and that the \"Son of God\" would lead the Roma n army. It is a small step then to the position that all of Jesus' warnings regarding the coming of the Son of God, who will bring destru ction with him,"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"202 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH are predicting the Son of God who actually was at t he head of the Roman army, Titus. It is also fascinating to notice how effective and long-lasting the anti-Semitism created by the New Testament has been . Notice that Whiston sees the destruction of the Jews as being a quite appropri- ate vengeance for their destruction of the Savior. It is easy to imag- ine how such a perspective would have affected his everyday deal- ings with Jews. Hence, if Rome did create Christian ity to instill anti-Semitism, their invention certainly stands the test of time. It is still working thousands of years after its creation . To demonstrate the importance of the statement, the editor of Josephus has capitalized all the letters in the phr ase. \"THE SON COMETH.\" The editor of Josephus has identified the importance of the passage in the same way as he identified the ph rase house of hys- sop in the \"Son of Mary\" passage cited earlier, by writing that phrase in italics. The point at which Josephus inserts the pun helps t o make its meaning clear. The passage is at the very beginning of the Roman assault on Jerusalem, the exact moment in time when the son actu- ally did \"cometh\" to destroy Jerusalem. Further, it is implausible that someone would sound the alarm for a hurled projectile with such a lengthy phrase. \"Incoming\" is all a contemporary soldier utters before he hits the de ck. \"THE STONE COMETH\" is too long a phrase to speak when millisec onds matter. This idea becomes even clearer in the original Gree k, \"ho petros erchetai\" is not an expression that would naturally come to mind when a large stone is bearing down on someone. The substitution of \"stone\" for \"son\" actually cont inues another comic concept in the New Testament, \"stone\" being a nother of the important self-designations Jesus uses. Jesus compa res himself to a stone, one that if it strikes will \"utterly crush.\" In other words, he is saying that the \"Son of God\" is a \"stone\" who will crush those who reject him, obviously meaning the Jews. He states t his specifically within the context of Rome's use of power. This is, of course, the same comic concept presented above, where Josephus records that a \"Son,\" who is in fact a \"stone,\" has crushed Jews."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Until All Is Fulfilled 203 Like Jesus' other comic self-designations, (fisher of men, living bread, living water) with \"stone\" the physical loca tion where Jesus uses the expression is part of the joke. He calls himsel f a \"stone\" rejected by the builders (meaning the Jews), which will \"utt erly crush\" those on whom it falls, at the exact spot where Josephus records that stones did actually fall on Jews during the war wit h Rome. In the \"lunatic Jesus\" passage above, Josephus cont inues the comic theme of Jesus calling himself a stone that w ill \"crush.\" The lunatic Jesus is killed just as the Roman siege of Jerusalem begins. Josephus records this slapstick Jesus' last words: \"Woe, woe to the city again, and to the people, and to the holy house!\" And just as he added at the last, \"Woe , woe to myself also!\" there came a stone out of one of the engines, and smote him, and killed him immediately; and as h e was uttering the very same presages he gave up the ghos t. 139 It is clear that a resident of the Flavian court wo uld have found humor in each of Jesus' self-designations because o f the locations where he pronounced them. Imagine a patrician with a copy of the Gospels in 80 C.E., knowing what the Roman war cata pults had done to the Jewish defenders of Jerusalem, reading about a Messiah who, while standing beneath that city's walls, call s himself a stone and threatens to fall on and utterly crush Jews. Fo r such an individ- ual, the humor would have been obvious. Could Jesus , by sheer chance, have given himself so many unique self-desi gnations at the exact locations that would have made them humorous to patricians? When viewed as a group, the parallels between these two pas- sages and the comedy they create seems too exact to have occurred by chance. The choices are either to agree with Eus ebius, who writes It is fitting to add to these accounts the true pre diction of our Savior in which he foretold these very events. His words are as follows: \"Woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!

It struck me as logical for the authors to have concluded their work with a passage that identifies them—quite in keeping with the spirit of malicious playfulness that runs through their entire composition. I present the first of these passages below. This p assage describes a group of Sicarii who escape into Egypt. Once there, they find themselves rebuked by \"Jews of reputation\" who inform the Romans of their presence in Egypt. The Sicarii are captured and then tortured in an attempt to make them \"confess that C aesar was their lord,\" which they refuse to do. Their children also refuse to \"name Caesar for their lord,\" in spite of their also bein g tortured. Thus, the passage clearly presents an unsolved problem for Ti tus: how to make the rebellious Jews call him, \"Lord.\" WHEN Masada was thus taken, the general left a garr ison in the fortress to keep it, and he himself went awa y to Cesarea; for there were now no enemies left in the country, but it was all overthrown by so long a war. Yet did this war afford disturbances and dangerous disorders even in places very far remote from Judea; for still it came to pa ss that many Jews were slain at Alexandria in Egypt; for as many of the Sicarii as were able to fly thither, out of the seditious wars in Judea, were not content to have saved thems elves, but must needs be undertaking to make new disturban ces, and persuaded many of those that entertained them t o 205"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"206 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH assert their liberty, to esteem the Romans to be no better than themselves, and to look upon God as their only Lord and Master.

So they got a ll the Jews together to an assembly, and accused the madne ss of the Sicarii, and demonstrated that they had been th e authors of all the evils that had come upon them. T hey said also that \"these men, now they were run away from J udea, having no sure hope of escaping, because as soon as ever they shall be known, they will be soon destroyed by the Romans, they come hither and fill us full of those calami- ties which belong to them, while we have not been p artakers with them in any of their sins.\" Accordingly, they exhorted the multitude to have a care, lest they should be b rought to destruction by their means, and to make their apolo gy to the Romans for what had been done, by delivering th ese men up to them; who being thus apprised of the grea tness of the danger they were in, complied with what was proposed, and ran with great violence upon the Sicarii, and s eized upon them; and indeed six hundred of them were caught im me- diately: but as to all those that fled into Egypt a nd to the Egyptian Thebes, it was not long ere they were caug ht also, and brought back, whose courage, or whether we ough t to call it madness, or hardiness in their opinions, ev ery body was amazed at.

The passage above explains why Titus in vented Chris- tianity. Even torture could not bring the Sicarii t o call him \"Lord.\" Therefore, they had to be fooled into doing it. Continuing with the passage: Now Lupus did then govern Alexandria, who presently sent Caesar word of this commotion; who having in suspic ion the restless temper of the Jews for innovation, and being afraid lest they should get together again, and per suade some others to join with them, gave orders to Lupus to demolish that Jewish temple which was in the region called Onion, and was in Egypt, which was built and had it s denomination from the occasion following: Onias, th e son of Simon, one of the Jewish high priests, fled from Anti- ochus the king of Syria, when he made war with the Jews, and came to Alexandria; and as Ptolemy received him very kindly, on account of hatred to Antiochus, he assur ed him, that if he would comply with his proposal, he would bring all the Jews to his assistance; and when the king agree d to do it so far as he was able, he desired him to give hi m leave to build a temple some where in Egypt, and to worship God according to the customs of his own country; for th at the Jews would then be so much readier to fight against Anti- ochus, who had laid waste the temple at Jerusalem, and that they would then come to him with greater good- will; and that, by granting them liberty of conscience, v ery many of them would come over to him. 141 The passage continues with a description of the \"Je wish temple, which was in the region called Onion, and was in Eg ypt.\" Josephus, in a digression, nonchalantly points out that the t emple is the one envisioned 600 years previously by the prophet Isai ah.

So Ptolemy complied with his proposals, and gave hi m a place one hundred and eighty furlongs distant from Mem- phis. That Nomos was called the Nomos of Hello poll s, where Onias built a fortress and a temple, not like to that at Jerusalem, but such as resembled a tower. He built it of large stones to the height of sixty cubits; he made the structure of the altar in imitation of that in our own country, and in like manner adorned with gifts, excepting th e make of the candlestick, for he did not make a candlesti ck, but had a [single] lamp hammered out of a piece of gold , which illuminated the place with its rays, and which he h ung by a chain of gold; but the entire temple was encompasse d with a wall of burnt brick, though it had gates of stone .

There had been a lso a certain ancient prediction made by [a prophet] whos e name was Isaiah, about six hundred years before that thi s temple should be built by a man that was a Jew in Egypt. A nd this is the history of the building of that temple. The prophecy that Josephus is referring to is conta ined in Isaiah 19:18-25. Josephus is clearly intending that the \"i ntelligent reader\" understand that the events he described in the pass age demonstrate that Isaiah's prophecy had \"come to pass.\" In the p assage above, Josephus describes a \"city of destruction in the la nd of Egypt,\" this being Alexandria, paralleling Isaiah's prophecy. Jo sephus, again par- alleling Isaiah, describes the temple as being \"pil lar\" shaped. Fur- ther, the political conditions of the region at the time can clearly be seen as those that were envisioned by Isaiah's prop hecy, in that there"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"The Authors of the New Testament 209 was a \"highway out of Egypt to Assyria.\" Which is t o say that Israel was now a \"highway\" between Assyria and Egypt, in t hat it had become a geographical link within the Roman Empire. This idea is especially clear when one considers that the three Roman legions that participated in the destruction of Jerusalem w ere the XV Apol- linaris Legion from Alexandria (Egypt) and the V Ma cedonica and X Fretensis Legions from Syria. So Josephus seems correct in his assertion that Isa iah's prophecy has \"come to pass,\" with the events that he describ es in the passage. The reader will notice, however, that Isaiah's prop hecy is also mes- sianic. It states that the Lord shall send a \"savio r\" who shall \"smite\" and \"heal.\" The passage also states that the \"Lord\" shall \"be known to Egypt,\" and that Israel shall be the \"Lord's inh eritance.\" There cannot be any doubt about who Josephus indica tes is the \"savior\" that Isaiah's prophecy refers to. In fact, at this point in his- tory, the only individual who could have been the s avior foreseen by Isaiah's prophecy is Titus. Only Titus could claim that he had Israel as an \"inheritance\" at this time. Caesar (Titus) gave order that all Judea should be exposed for sale; for he did not found any city there but r eserved the whole country for himself. 142 Therefore, Josephus is disclosing that Titus is the Savior, or the Messiah, by his unspoken contention that Isaiah's p rophecy has come to pass. The prophecy of Isaiah that Josephus uses to identify Titus as the Savior is as follows. In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the Lord of hosts; one shall be called, The city of destruction. In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the bor der thereof to the Lord.

While it is possible that there were earlier versio ns of the New Tes- tament, at some point the four Gospels were unified into their pres- ent comic whole. Someone with editorial control man ipulated the New Testament and War of the Jews into alignment wi th one another. In this sense, all of the four Gospels must have be en written at the same time. Another question this analysis raises is, who maint ained control over the finished product? The authors, having plac ed veiled revela- tions as to the religion's real origin in the four Gospels, had to devise some method to assure that these revelations would not be edited out by later redactors. For example, if one of the statements of fact in the different versions of Jesus' resurrections w ere changed or omitted, then the combined story would lose its log ic. And the same problem would exist for the other half of this sati rical system, the works of Josephus. Josephus concludes War of the Jews with the strange tale of a \"Jonathan,\" one of the Sicarii, and a \"Catullus,\" a Roman governor who makes a false accusation against Josephus, as w ell as a \"Ber- nice\" and an \"Alexander,\" for starting Jonathan's \" innovation.\" \"Innovation,\" is the word Josephus uses to describe the religious sect of the Sicarii because it was a new version, o r \"innovation\" of Judaism. In effect, the three were falsely accused of making someone create a new Judaic sect. Jonathan was clearly a messianic individual who, li ke Jesus, pre- vailed with the poor by showing them \"signs and app aritions.\" Because Jonathan was the name of one the five sons of Matthias Maccabee, this is another example of the connection that Josephus draws between that family and the Sicarii. There is also a comic logic to Josephus' dealing with \"Jonathan\" at this point in War of the Jews. As he has already \"dealt\" with the other four sons of Matthias Mac- cabee—Eleazar, Simon, Judas, and John—he now conclu des his work with the destruction of the last one, Jonathan .

And as fo r the other Jews of Cyrene, he concealed his knavery from them, and put tricks upon them; but those of the greatest dignity among them informed Catullus, the governor of the L ibyan Pentapolis, of his march into the desert, and of th e prepa- rations he had made for it.

And when he was brought to Catullus, he devised a w ay whereby he both escaped punishment himself, and afforded an occasion to Catullus of doing much misc hief; for he falsely accused the richest men among the Je ws, and said that they had put him upon what he did.

One of these, against whom this treacherous accusation was laid, was Jose phus, the writer of these books. However, this plot, thus contrived by Catullus, did not succeed according to his hopes ; for though he came himself to Rome, and brought Jonatha n and his companions along with him in bonds, and tho ught he should have had no further inquisition made as t o those lies that were forged under his government, or by h is means; yet did Vespasian suspect the matter and mad e an inquiry how far it was true. And when he understood that the accusation laid against the Jews was an unjust one, he cleared them of the crimes charged upon them, and t his on account of Titus's concern about the matter, and br ought a deserved punishment upon Jonathan; for he was first tor- mented, and then burnt alive. But as to Catullus, the emperors were so gentle to him, that he underwent no severe condemnation at this ti me; yet was it not long before he fell into a complicated a nd almost incurable distemper, and died miserably. He was not only afflicted in body, but the distemper in his mind wa s more heavy upon him than the other; for he was terribly dis- turbed, and continually cried out that he saw the g hosts of those whom he had slain standing before him.

Thus he be came as great an instance of Divine Providence as ever was, and demonstrated that God punishes wicked men. 1 ' 13 The passage creates a puzzle that uses the name-swi tching tech- nique found in the Decius Mundus puzzle cited earli er to identify the creators of Christianity.

The"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"The Authors of the New Testament 215 inventors of Christianity have signed their work, s o to speak, in the correct place—at the end of their story. I believe that the \"Bernice\" and the \"Alexander\" in the passage are easily identified as Titus' mistress Bernice, a nd either Marcus Alexander, who actually was Bernice's husband but w ho died before the Jewish war, or his brother Tiberius Alexander, Titus' Jewish chief of staff during the siege of Jerusalem. These indiv iduals had both the technical knowledge of Judaism and the ethical pers pective required to create Christianity. The New Testament, continui ng its parallels with War of the Jews, mentions in Acts both an Alex ander, 144 believed by most scholars to actually be Tiberius Alexander, and a Bernice. To recognize that a puzzle exists the reader must, once again, recognize parallels—in this case, that Catullus and Judas, the iden- tifier of Jesus, share a number of attributes. The most obvious parallel between the two is that C atullus dies in the same improbable manner—unknown to medical sc ience—as Judas. That is, \"his very entrails . . . fell out o f his body.\" This is an exact parallel to the death of Judas. And falling h eadlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out . 145 The description of Judas' bowels gushing out does n ot occur in the Gospels but in Acts. The event is in the New Te stament at this point to maintain its parallel with the events in t o War of the Jews. The parallel \"gut spillers\" create another prophecy in Jesus' ministry that is fulfilled in Titus' campaign. Judas and Catullus are also parallels in that both of their accu- sations involve a messianic individual, and neither is true. Josephus, Bernice, and Alexander certainly did not initiate a religion, or \"inno- vation,\" led by a Messiah-like member of the Sicari i. They would have established just the opposite kind of \"innovat ion.\" Jesus is, of course, famous for having been innocent. He was cer tainly not the type of Sicarii military leader that Pontius Pilate would have needed to crucify. In fact, Jesus was the exact opposite o f such an individual. The technique establishing that there is a puzzle n eeding to be solved is the same one used throughout the New Test ament and War of the Jews—that is, parallels.

Thus, had Judas named \"Jonathan\" a s the Messiah who needed to be crucified, and Catullus had accuse d Josephus, Ber- nice, and Alexander as having put \"Jesus\" \"up to wh at he did,\" both passages would be transformed into the truth. Jonat han was a Sicarii messianic leader who, from the perspective of the R omans, deserved to be crucified, and Jesus had \"been put up to what he did\"—that is to say, was created by—Josephus, Bernice, and Alexa nder. The fact that the \"Alexander\" who participated in t he plot is described as Bernice's husband helps us see the sub tle point. Because the Alexander who was Bernice's husband was dead be fore the war broke out, it is not Josephus, Bernice, and her lat e husband who are being identified here. It is the families of these individuals who authored the Gospels—the Flavians, Herods, and Alex anders.

They were experts at what scholars today call the Typological Method. In the Introduct ion, I presented examples showing that Moses is the \"type\" of Jesus. To achieve this effect, the authors of the Gospels used conceptual parallels and par- allel sequences of events. Another example of the way the authors of the New T estament use \"types\" is found in the story of Judas' punishm ent for his betrayal of Jesus. To create the story, the authors weave together a number of texts from the Hebrew Bible, primarily fr om Zechariah and Jeremiah. From Zechariah they take the thirty p ieces of silver, the casting into the treasury, and the potter. 147 From Jeremiah they lake the purchasing of a field. They then claim tha t Judas' fate has \"fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet. \" 148 Having used literary parallels to link the characte rs in the Gospels to the Hebrew Bible, the authors then use t he same motif to link Jesus to Titus in the future. In this way they create a seamless continuum from the Hebrew prophets to Jesus and the n on to Titus, the real Christ. The parallels between Jesus' minis try and Titus' cam- paign simply confirm what Josephus plainly states; that Judaism's world-ruler prophecies envisioned Caesar.

For he is l ike a refiners fire and like launderers soap. 149 I found interesting the thought that the authors of the New Tes- tament and War of the Jews may have created the sam e outline 2,000 years ago, as they began their construction of the two works. See the chart on page 221. The first savior of Israel was used as the \"type\" f or Jesus, the second savior of Israel, who was then used as the \" type\" for Titus, the final savior of Israel. Though cleverly hidden, the relationship between the Gospels and War of the Jews is simply a n extension of the typology used throughout Hebraic literature and the Gospels. For example, Dockery writes: Typological exegesis seeks to discover a correspond ence between people and events of the past and of the pr esent or future . . . Typological exegesis then is based on the convic- tion that certain events in the history of Israel p refigure a future time when God's purposes will be revealed in their fullness. 150 As they had with the parallels between Jesus and Mo ses described in the Introduction, the authors of the G ospels and War of the Jews create a series of typologically related e vents that occur in the same sequence. This is the proof they left us t hat the ministry of Jesus was the \"type\" for the campaign of Titus, a f act they wished posterity to understand. For example, the \"three cr ucified and one survives\" passage recorded by Josephus is clearly n oted as occurring after the captures on the Mount of Olives but befor e the condemning of Simon and sparing of John, so as to mirror the s equence of those events in the New Testament. Likewise, in the New T estament the description of the naked young man's escape on the Mount of Olives is given before its description of Jesus' capture; the events occur in the same sequence in Josephus' twin \"Mount of Olive s assaults.\" Though in the \"cannibal Mary\" passage, which is act ually pre- sented in the chapter following the capture of Elea zar on the Mount of Olives, the specific time when it occurs is not given, Josephus does make it clear that it occurs during the siege of Jerusalem—that is, following the \"demons of Gadara\" incident but b efore the \"three"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"The Typological Method 221 JESUS' MINISTRY (The Forerunner) TITUS' CAMPAIGN (The Messiah) Start of ministry in Galilee: Jesus begins ministry at Gennesareth and says \"Follow me\" and be \"fishers of men\" Start of campaign in Galilee: Titus has his \"onset\" at Gennesareth where his soldiers follow him and \"fish\" for men At Gadara, encounters legion of demons inside one man At Gadara encounters \"Legion\" possessed with wicked spirit coming from one man \"Swine\" run wildly and 2,000 drown At Gadara, 2,000 of the \"demons\" do not drown At Jerusalem, the \"Son of Mary\" of- fers his flesh to be eaten At Jerusalem, the son's flesh is eaten by Mary Jesus envisions \"signs\" occurring before the temple's destruction Josephus records \"signs\" that occurred before the temple's destruction An escape by a naked individual at Jerusalem's northeast corner An escape by a \"naked\" individual at Jerusalem's northeast corner Messiah captured on the Mount of Olives Messiah captured on the Mount of Olives Simon's denials Simon's denials Three are crucified; one survives Three are crucified, one survives Joseph \"Arimathea\" takes survivor down from the cross Joseph bar Matthias takes survivor down from cross Simon is the rock upon which the new Church is to be built Simon is the \"rock\" upon which the new \"Church\" will be built Jesus sends Simon to a martyr's death at Rome but spares John at conclusion of ministry Titus sends Simon to martyr's death at Rome but spares John at conclu- sion of campaign Judas falsely accuses Jesus, and spills his guts (in the Book of Acts) Catullus falsely accuses against Josephus, Bernice and Alexander, and spills his guts"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"222 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH crucified and one survives\" passage, which occurs f ollowing the siege. The same approach is also used with the para llel \"signs before the destruction of the Temple\" given by Jesus and J osephus. The twin sequences are difficult to explain away. A s I have noted above, while it is at least possible to argue that the satirical parallels between Jesus' ministry and Titus' campai gn occur by chance, if that were the case these accidents would occur in a ran- dom pattern. However, the sequences—\"fishing for me n at the Sea of Galilee,\" an individual filled with a \"legion of wickedness,\" the drowning of the those possessed by the legion of wi ckedness, the twin assaults on the Mount of Olives (with first a \"naked\" man escaping and then the capture of a Messiah), Simon' s denials, an episode where three are crucified but one survives, Joseph of \"Ari- mathea\" taking the survivor down from his cross, Si mon con- demned, John spared, and a false accusation against the founder of a messianic religion by a \"gut spiller\"—all are con cretely the same in both works. Further, the parallel \"cannibal Mary \" and \"signs before the destruction of Jerusalem\" passages both occur after the Gadara passages, but before the crucifixion passage s, and thereby do not contradict the parallel sequences within the mi nistry of Jesus and Titus' campaign. Notice that there is no historical, logical, or the ological reason for these satirically related events to have been r ecorded in the same sequence. Jesus was free to have concluded and not begun his min- istry with the phrase \"fishers of men.\" The authors of the New Tes- tament were not forced to put the strange tale of J esus condemning Simon while sparing John at the very end of the Gos pels. Josephus was not required to have included the tale concerni ng the cannibal Mary in his description of the siege of Jerusalem, any more than it was required for Jesus to be at Jerusalem when he offer ed up his flesh. Further, the linking of the two specific events tha t form each parallel, which in turn becomes a link in the seque nce of parallels, is self-evident. In other words, of the eleven even ts from Josephus' works cited above, the only possible episode from t he Gospels that can be linked with his description of the fate of t he rebel leaders is the passage in which Jesus condemns Simon and spare s John. Like- wise, Josephus' episode in which \"three were crucif ied but one sur-"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"The Typological Method 223 vived\" can only relate to Jesus' crucifixion, and n ot to any other ele- ment from his ministry. Therefore, since no outside factor seems to be resp onsible for the sequence of parallels, I can calculate the odds on whether they could have occurred by chance. To do this, I start by simply assign- ing to each of the eleven New Testament events cite d above the number in which it appears chronologically. Thus, 1 would number the \"fishers of men\" episode one, the individual fi lled with a \"legion of wickedness\" two, and so forth. If I then apply t he same number- ing system to the eleven episodes cited above from the works of Josephus, the probability that I would assign the \" fishing for men\" episode the same number—one—that I gave its paralle l episode in the New Testament would be only one in eleven. I then have a choice of which technique to use in c ontinuing the process of calculating the odds on whether the sequ ence could have occurred by chance. The most conservative approach would be to assume that once one of the eleven episodes has bee n used, it can- not be used again. Using this approach, the probabi lity would be cal- culated by a factorial of eleven, or 11x10x9x8x7x6x 5x4x3x2x1— which would equal one chance in 39,916,800. Another approach would be to assign truly random po ssibilities for each of the events. In other words, any episode could occur at any time and would not be excluded from the calcula tion by occur- ring before. The odds of two streams of eleven rand om episodes occurring in the same order would be eleven to the eleventh power, or one chance in 285,311,670,611. This type of calculation is the conventional way th at probability analysis is applied to determine the likelihood tha t two sets of items were arranged in the same sequence by chance. For t he purpose of the calculation, it is hypothetically assumed that an author has been given a set of eleven episodes to arrange. Once the author has arranged them, I discover that the same sequence ca n be found in another document. I then assess the probability tha t this feat was achieved by chance. Note that the calculation holds mathematically true regardless of the method the author uses to create his sequenc e. The author could have discovered the eleven items in an archiv e or could sim-"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"224 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH ply have been given the items and instructed to arr ange them. The probability is the same, regardless. The probabilit y level relates only to the likelihood that the sequence the author crea ted would be identical to another sequence and does not presuppo se anything about how the ordering was done. Notice also that each of these probabilities would be into the billions if I add to the chain of events the chance that the parallel \"cannibal Mary\" and \"signs before the destruction o f Jerusalem\" passages would each occur after Gadara but before t he crucifixions. It is not necessary to do this, however, since even the most conser- vative approach demonstrates that Jesus' ministry a nd Titus' cam- paign were deliberately linked. By using the factorial approach mentioned above, it is 99.999997 percent certain that one account influenced the oth er. In other words, the likelihood that these parallel sequences occurred by chance is virtually zero, less than 0.000003 percen t. The calculation does not, of course, indicate the d irection of causality. However, since there is no plausible rea son why the writ- ings of Josephus should have been created based on events in the Gospels, the presumed direction of the causality is that Titus' war record was created first, and Jesus' ministry was t hen created as a satire of militant Judaism, based on the events of Titus' campaign. Moreover, many of the parallels are too conceptuall y exact, in and of themselves, to be accounted for by random ch ance to be a serious explanation for their existence. For exampl e, the \"son of Mary\" passage in War of the Jews contains the \"comi ng to pass\" of two of the hidden prophecies within the New Testament—M ary's heart being \"pierced through\" and her \"fine portion\" not being taken away. Also supporting the conclusion that the parallels w ere deliberately created is the fact that the locations for the spec ific events in them are the same. The \"fishing for men\" at Gennesareth, the encounter with \"demons\" at Gadara, Mary's son whose flesh was eaten at Jerusalem, the escape of the \"naked\" young men and the capture of the Messiah on the Mount of Olives, and finally Rom e, where Jose- phus' Simon and the Christian Simon \"both\" met thei r fate.

In fact, Jesus is speaking lit erally throughout the New Testament and those who see spiritual meani ng in his words are being played for a fool. I believe that the Romans, with their use of comedy , were con- sistently ridiculing those who see symbolic meaning where there is none. In the Dead Sea Scrolls there are many allego rical interpreta- tions of passages from the Pentateuch. 151 This way of interpreting scripture no doubt helped form the theology of a \"c oming\" Messiah that inspired the first-century Jewish rebels. The point I think the creators of Christianity were making with their use of comedy is that there are unlimited ways to interpret scripture and it is easy for the uneducated to see symbolic meaning where there is n one.

It was for this group, hoi polloi, that they create d the religion. This is why the authors of the New Testament and Jo sephus felt free to put in their creations the puzzles and lamp oons that \"noti- fied\" the educated of the true origin of the religi on.

Once this proposition is understood, it be comes clear that they form a puzzle whose solution is also obvious. Here is the Testimonium and the two odd tales that follow it. Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be Lawful to call him a man; for he was a doer of wond erful works, a teacher of such men as receive the truth w ith pleas- ure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles. He was [the] Christ. And when Pila te, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had con - demned him to the cross, those that loved him did n ot at first forsake him, for he appeared to them alive th e third day, as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thou- sand other wonderful things concerning him. And the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct a t this day. About the same time also another sad calamity put t he Jews into disorder, and certain shameful practices hap- pened about the termpLe of Isis that was at Rome. I will now first take notice of the wicked attempt about the t emple of Isis, and will then give an account of the Jewish a ffairs. There was at Rome a woman whose name was Paulina; o ne who, on account of the dignity of her ancestors, an d by the regular conduct of a virtuous life, had a great rep utation: she was also very rich; and although she was of a b eautiful countenance, and in that flower of her age wherein women are the most gay, yet did she lead a life of great modesty. She was married to Saturninus, one that was every w ay answerable to her in an excellent character. Decius Mundus fell in love with this woman. He was a man very hig h in the equestrian order; and as she was of too great digni ty to be caught by presents, and had already rejected them, though they had been sent in great abundance, he was still more inflamed with love to her, insomuch that he promise d to give her two hundred thousand Attic drachmae for on e night's lodging; and when this would not prevail up on her, and he was not able to bear this misfortune in his amours,"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"228 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH he thought it the best way to famish himself to dea th for want of food, on account of Paulina's sad refusal; and he determined with himself to die after such a manner, and he went on with his purpose accordingly. Now Mundus ha d a freed-woman, who had been made free by his father, whose name was Ide, one skillful in all sorts of mischief . This woman was very much grieved at the young man's reso lu- tion to kill himself, (for he did not conceal his i ntentions to destroy himself from others,) and came to him, and encour- aged him by her discourse, and made him to hope, by some promises she gave him, that he might obtain a night 's lodg- ing with Paulina; and when he joyfully hearkened to her entreaty, she said she wanted no more than fifty th ousand drachmae for the entrapping of the woman. So when s he had encouraged the young man, and gotten as much mo ney as she required, she did not take the same methods as had been taken before, because she perceived that the w oman was by no means to be tempted by money; but as she knew that she was very much given to the worship of the goddess Isis, she devised the following stratagem: She went to some of Isis's priests, and upon the strongest assurance s [of con- cealment], she persuaded them by words, but chiefly by the offer of money, of twenty-five thousand drachmae in hand, and as much more when the thing had taken effect; a nd told them the passion of the young man, and persuad ed them to use all means possible to beguile the woman . So they were drawn in to promise so to do, by that lar ge sum of gold they were to have. Accordingly, the oldest of them went immediately to Paulina; and upon his admittanc e, he desired to speak with her by herself. When that was granted him, he told her that he was sent by the god Anubis , who was fallen in love with her, and enjoined her to co me to him. Upon this she took the message very kindly, and val ued herself greatly upon this condescension of Anubis, and told her husband that she had a message sent her, and wa s to sup and lie with Anubis; so he agreed to her accept ance of the offer, as fully satisfied with the chastity of his wife. Accordingly, she went to the temple, and after she had"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"The Puzzle of Decius Mundus 229 supped there, and it was the hour to go to sleep, t he priest shut the doors of the temple, when, in the holy par t of it, the lights were also put out. Then did Mundus leap out, (for he was hidden therein,) and did not fail of enjoying h er, who was at his service all the night long, as supposing he was the god; and when he was gone away, which was befor e those priests who knew nothing of this stratagem we re stir- ring, Paulina came early to her husband, and told h im how the god Anubis had appeared to her. Among her frien ds, also, she declared how great a value she put upon t his favor, who partly disbelieved the thing, when they reflected on its nature, and partly were amazed at it, as hav ing no pretense for not believing it, when they considered the modesty and the dignity of the person. But now, on the third day after what had been done, Mundus met Paulina, a nd said, \"Nay, Paulina, thou hast saved me two hundred thou- sand drachmae, which sum thou mightest have added t o thy own family; yet hast thou not failed to be at m y service in the manner I invited thee. As for the reproaches thou hast laid upon Mundus, I value not the business of names; but I rejoice in the pleasure I reaped by what I di d, while I took to myself the name of Anubis.\" When he had sai d this, he went his way. But now she began to come to the s ense of the grossness of what she had done, and rent her gar- ments, and told her husband of the horrid nature of the wicked contrivance and prayed him not to neglect to assist her in this case. So he discovered the fact to the emperor; whereupon Tiberius inguired into the matter thoroug hly by examining the priests about it, and ordered them to be cru- cified, as well as Ide, who was the occasion of the ir perdi- tion, and who had contrived the whole matter, which was so injurious to the woman. He also demolished the temp le of Isis, and gave order that her statue should be thro wn into the river Tiber; while he only banished Mundus, but did no more to him, because he supposed that what crime he had committed was done out of the passion of love. And these were the circumstances which concerned the temple o f Isis, and the injuries occasioned by her priests."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"230 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH I now return to the relation of what happened about this time to the Jews at Rome, as I formerly told you I would. There was a man who was a Jew, but he had been driven away from his own country by an accusation l aid against him for transgressing their laws, and by th e fear he was under of punishment for the same; but in all re spects a wicked man. He, then living at Rome, professed to instruct men in the wisdom of the laws of Moses. He procured also three other men, entirely of the same character wit h him- self, to be his partners. These men persuaded Fulvi a, a woman of great dignity, and one that had embraced t he Jewish religion, to send purple and gold to the tem ple at Jerusalem; and when they had gotten them, they empl oyed them for their own uses, and spent the money themse lves, on which account it was that they at first required it of her. Whereupon Tiberius, who had been informed of the th ing by Saturninus, the husband of Fulvia, who desired inqu iry might be made about it, ordered all the Jews to be banished out of Rome; at which time the consuls listed four thousand men out of them, and sent them to the island Sardin ia; but punished a greater number of them, who were unwilli ng to become soldiers, on account of keeping the laws of their forefathers. Thus were these Jews banished out of t he city by the wickedness of four men. 152 First, it should be noted that the two tales that f ollow the Testi- monium are oddly tangential from the narration Jose phus has been engaged in up unto it, which describes Pontius Mate s' military activity in Judea. They stand out both because of t heir location, Rome, as well as their lightweight, ribald substanc e. Josephus is here using an unusual Judaic literary s tructure called \"pedimental composition,\" in which the diffe rent passages form columns of a temple. Josephus uses a particula r pedimental style of composition in which three pillars form a literary temple. 153 The two side columns are small; both concern issues having to do with the Jews, and the left-hand column is the famo us passage about Christ. Unfortunately, scholars have focused on the left-hand pas- sage, while ignoring the overall literary compositi on and the overall"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"The Puzzle of Decius Mundus 231 rhetorical structure, which indicates that the focu s of attention should be on the central column. It was another comic stroke for Josephus to use a t emple-like literary structure to describe an account of a temp le. This pedimen- tal structure with the focus on the central passage similarly is used in the Book of Leviticus in which chapters 18 and 2 0 form the side columns and chapter 19 forms the central column of a literary temple. Moreover, there is a claim within the tales that is verifiably false. The temple of Isis was not destroyed during this er a, a fact that Jose- phus was aware of. He wrote that Vespasian and Titu s had spent the night before the celebration of the completion of t he Judaic war at the temple of Isis. 154 This led me to question why Josephus know- ingly records an obvious spoof as history. To begin this analysis, I want to point out what I understand about the name of the protagonist in the first and longer tale, Decius Mundus. Mundus is the Latin word for \"world,\" or \"e arth.\" The name Decius Mundus, I believe, is a pun on Decius Mus, t he name of a father and son who were among Rome's greatest milit ary heroes. Both father and son had \"devoted\" (devotio) themsel ves; that is to say, in the midst of fierce battles they had sacrif iced themselves. The devotio was a religious ritual of the Roman army th at was made to all gods, known and unknown, Roman and enemy. One of it s purposes was to induce the gods of the enemy to defect to Ro me. As I have mentioned, the Romans felt that they were divinely inspired to con- quer. By the beginning of the first century C.E., R ome had for hun- dreds of years fought and conquered not only their enemies, but also the gods of their enemies. The devotio was a techni que for neutral- izing their enemies' gods. In the ritual, one Roman, together with the legions of the enemy would be \"devoted\" to the gods. In effect, on e Roman would sacrifice himself for the good of the many. Thus, D ecius Mus offered himself as a sacrifice to all the gods, agreeing to give up his life in exchange for their assistance in taking the enemy a long with him to the underworld. At first both armies fought with equal strength and equal determination.

To those who watched him in both armies, he appeared something awful and superhuman, as though sent from heaven to expiate and appease all the ang er of the gods and to avert destruction from his people a nd bring it on their enemies.

This was most evident, for wherever his horse carried hi m they were paralyzed as though struck by some death-deali ng star; but when he fell, overwhelmed with darts, the Latin cohorts, in a state of perfect consternation, fled from the spot and left a large space clear. The Romans, on t he other hand, freed from all religious fears, pressed forwa rd. 155 Decius Mus' famous self-sacrifice was performed to \"free the Romans from all religious fears.\" To accomplish thi s he offered his life to both the gods of the Romans (the Quirites) and the gods of his enemies. This technique was aimed at \"appeasing \" the gods of Rome's enemies and thus freeing the Romans from con cerns about"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"The Puzzle of Decius Mundus 233 whether these gods would give divine assistance to their enemies. Notice that Decius also appealed to \"new gods.\" I s uspect that Decius \"Mundus\" or Decius \"World\" would have been u nderstood by a patrician as a pun calling to mind Decius Mus on a worldwide scale. This wordplay to show a larger scale for Dec ius Mus is made clearer by the fact that \"mus\" means \"mouse\" in Lat in. If a play- wright created a character named Napoleon World, it would be obvious which character in history he was lampoonin g. Decius was perhaps Rome's most famous war hero and all patrici ans were aware of his exploits. For example, the Roman satirist Ju venal, writing during the Flavian era, waxed glowingly about the h eroics of Decius Mus. Juvenal clearly understood that his audience w as familiar with Decius and his devotio, as he refers to both withou t explanation. In the story, the author writes that Decius Mundus had a \"reso- lution to kill himself, (for he did not conceal his intentions to destroy himself from others).\" Decius Mundus is, th us, parallel to both Decius Mus and Jesus in that none of them conc ealed from oth- ers their intention to destroy themselves. Josephus has placed this idea in parenthesis, underscoring the importance of it. This revela- tion makes clearer the connection between Decius Mu s and Decius Mundus. A Roman patrician would have understood a c haracter named Decius Mundus as a lampoon of Decius Mus. It also establishes a parallel between Decius Mundu s and Jesus. This parallel is clear because Jesus went out of hi s way to make oth- ers aware of his coming self-sacrifice. \"You know t hat after two days is the Passover, and the Son of Man will be deliver ed up to be cruci- fied.\" [Matthew 25, 26] The following passage from the Gospel of John liken s Jesus' self- sacrifice to the devotio of Decius Mus. Notice that Caiaphas, the priest who will later oversee Jesus' crucifixion, s tates that one man should die for the people, and that the whole natio n perishes not. This is the very definition of the devotio. Also, Caiaph as makes clear his belief that Jesus must be sacrificed to save all \"t he children of God,\" expressing the idea of a devotio on a worldwide sca le. Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a coun- cil, and said, What do we? forthis man doeth many m iracles."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"234 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH If we Let him thus alone, all men will believe on h im: and the Romans shall come and take away both our pl ace and nation. And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know noth ing at all, Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole natio n perish not. And this spake he not of himself: but being high pr iest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; And not for that nation only, but that also he shou ld gather together in one the children of God that wer e scat- tered abroad. John 11:47-52 From the perspective of the Flavians, Jesus' self-s acrifice is much like a devotio. The religion that Jesus established with his death cer- tainly helped to neutralize the militaristic, messi anic Judaism that the Flavians fought against. In fact, to the Flavia ns, whereas Decius Mus' sacrifice had only helped save a Roman legion, Jesus' sacrifice can be said to have helped to save the whole Roman world (mundus). An interesting historical point to this line of tho ught is that while Jesus is certainly meant to be understood as the Messiah whom Daniel predicted would be \"cut off,\" the real meaning behind Jesus' self-sacrifice may lie not in Judaism, as ha s been universally believed, but in a rite of the Roman religion, as a spoof of the devotio. Whether this conjecture regarding the comic meaning of the name Decius Mus is correct, it is the case that \"De cius,\" the name of Rome's most famous self-sacrifice, is the name of t he hero of the tale that directly follows the Testimonium, Josephus' de scription of his- tory's most famous self-sacrifice. I will show belo w that Decius Mundus and Jesus share a much more profound and uni que parallel. The clearest clue Josephus provides to inform us th at we are dealing with a puzzle is that both the story of Dec ius and Paulina and the story of Fulvia have the same plot. As I ha ve shown, paral- lels within the New Testament and War of the Jews a re significant. In both tales, wicked priests deceive a woman of \"dign ity\" and in both"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"The Puzzle of Decius Mundus 235 tales the woman's weakness for religion is exploite d. Further, not only do both stories have the same plot, but they a lso contain a number of elements that are interchangeable. Both o f these deceived women of dignity, amazingly have husbands named Sat urninus. Both these husbands named \"Saturninus\" just happen to know the Emperor Tiberius, to whom each husband goes to comp lain about what has been done to his wife. In both tales, amon g other punish- ments, Tiberius then \"banishes\" one or more of the perpetrators. Josephus also provided other statements to help the reader rec- ognize that the two stories are to be understood as parallel and therefore interchangeable. First, he reverses the o rder in which he states that he will describe them. About the same time also another sad calamity put t he Jews into disorder, and certain shameful practices hap- pened about the temple of Isis that was at Rome. I will now first take notice of the wicked attempt about the temple of Isis, and will then give an account o f the Jew- ish affairs. Further, at the beginning of the third story Joseph us claims to be returning to an episode about the Jews \"at Rome\" as he had \"for- merly\" stated. I now return to the relation of what happened about this time to the Jews at Rome, as I formerly told you I would. However, it was the \"shameful practices at the temp le of Isis' that Josephus previously claimed to have occurred \" at Rome,\" not the episode regarding the Jews. Josephus does not m ention where the \"sad calamity [that] put the Jews into disorder \" occurred. He last mentioned the Jews in a story regarding their perse cution by Pon- tius Pilate in Judea. Josephus appears to be treati ng the two stories as though they are interchangeable. In doing so he continues the strange \"logic\" that exists between them, since the ir only significant differences are in the names of some of the element s in them. It is also notable that Paulina \"began to come to t he sense of the grossness of what she had done, and rent her garmen ts.\" The rend- ing of garments is a well-known Jewish expression o f grief and is"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"236 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH actually required by Jewish religious law in some i nstances. In the Gospel of Mark, for example, when the High Priest w ho questions Jesus hears him refer to himself as the \"Son of Man ,\" he rends his garments. He does this because in the Sanhedrin it states that a judge who has heard blasphemous words must do so. T he Talmud recounts ten \"sad accidents\" for which Jews are ins tructed to rend their garments. Josephus also records numerous occa sions in his histories where Jews rend their garments as an expr ession of grief. Therefore, why would Paulina, a member of the cult of Isis, be the one to rend her garments and not Fulvia, the Jew, w hen she has the same experience? There is another clue, a parallel that links the Te stimonium to the tale of Decius Mundus. It is one of the most si gnificant parallels that I will present to the reader in this work. The Testimonium describes Jesus' resurrection, stat ing that he \"appeared to them alive again on the third day.\" De cius Mundus also appears to Paulina on the third day. There is, of c ourse, a difference. Whereas Jesus appears on the third day to show that he is a God, Decius appears on the third day to announce that he is not a god. It is implausible that something as unusual as two \"third-day divinity declarations\" would wind up next to one an other by chance. The Testimonium contains the only non-New Testament first-cen- tury description of the life of Jesus. The probabil ity that a mirror opposite of Jesus' resurrection, a singular event i n literature, would occur by chance in the paragraph following its only historical docu- mentation is, I believe, too low for consideration. In fact, in all of lit- erature these are the only two stories I am aware o f that describe any- one coming on a \"third day\" to proclaim that he is or is not a god. The only rational explanation is that this mirror-o pposite parallel has, for some reason, been placed next to the Testi monium deliberately. Another connection between Decius and Jesus is the fact that Anubis, the god Decius pretends to be, is a god wit h many parallels to Christ. Anubis, like Jesus, is a son of god, and is referred to as the \"Royal Child\" within the cult of Isis. More importa ntly, Anubis is a god who comes back from the dead. The cult of Isis actually cele- brated his death at the hands of Set and his subseq uent resurrection."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"The Puzzle of Decius Mundus 237 The myth of Anubis' resurrection also contains, lik e that of Jesus, a strong eschatological message. All three stories are described as occurring \"at ab out same time,\" which links them to one another temporally. While it is hardly unusual for events to be said to occur at ab out the same time, Josephus links the Fulvia story to the Testimonium in another, more unique way. In the passage he writes There was a man who was a Jew, but he had been driv en away from his own country by an accusation laid aga inst him for transgressing their laws, and by the fear h e was under of punishment for the same; but in all respec ts a wicked man. He, then living at Rome, professed to i nstruct men in the wisdom of the laws of Moses. There is a known individual who was a Jew and had b een driven away from his own country and had had accusations l aid against him for transgressing the laws of the Jews. He was also under fear of punishment for these transgressions and was known t o have lived at Rome, and professed to instruct men in his understa nding of the laws of Moses. The character is, of course, the Apo stle Paul. But, when the seven days were nearly over, the Jews from the province of Asia, having seen Paul in the Templ e, set about rousing the fury of all the people against hi m. They laid hands on him, crying out, \"Men of Israel, help! help! This is the man who goes everywhere pre aching to everybody against the Jewish people and the Law and this place . . .\" The excitement spread through the whole city, and t he people rushed in and gates were immediately closed. But while they were trying to kill Paul, word was t aken up to the Tribune in battalion, that all Jerusalem was in a ferment. He instantly sent for a few soldiers and their offi cers, and came down among the people with all speed. At t he sight of the Tribune and the troops they ceased bea ting Paul. When Paul was going up the steps, he had to be carr ied by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob;"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"238 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH I could not discover that he had done anything for which he deserved to die; but as he has himself app ealed to the Emperor, I have decided to send him to Rome. 156 That the wicked man in the Fulvia story can be seen as a lam- poon of Paul seems difficult to dispute. 157 Josephus links the Fulvia story to the Testimonium in yet another way. These men persuaded Fulvia, a woman of great dignit y, and one that had embraced the Jewish religion, to send purple and gold to the temple at Jerusalem . . . Purple was the royal color in the first century. Se nding purple to the temple at Jerusalem suggests that the ruse the wicked priests use to fool Fulvia somehow involves a king, or a person of royal rank, among the Jews. Perhaps one who is religious as wel l as secular. Because Josephus has indicated that this event occu rs at \"about the same time\" that Jesus lived, he would be at least a candidate for the one referred to as royal. Indeed, since the referen ce to purple occurs on the same page as the Testimonium, the only histo rical description of Jesus, what other \"king of the Jews\" can possibl y come to mind? So Jesus came out, wearing the wreath of thorns and the purple cloak. Then they began to march up to Him, saying in a moc k- ing voice, \"Hail, King of the Jews!\" John 19:3 All the \"clues\" above work together to suggest that some rela- tionship exists among all three stories. For exampl e, the Testimo- nium seems related to the Decius story because they share third-day divinity declarations. Likewise, the Fulvia story m ust be related to the Decius story because they share the same plot, the name of both husbands is the same, etc. The parallels and interc hangeable ele- ments within the three stories show that the author has deliberately established some relationship among them that is no t apparent on the surface, some problem the reader must attempt t o \"solve.\" In other words, the three stories are a puzzle."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"The Puzzle of Decius Mundus 239 Once the three stories are seen as a puzzle the sol ution becomes obvious. Josephus actually has Decius Mundus state the solution to the puzzle within the lampoon: . . . value not the business of names . . . Decius did not value \"the business of names\" and to ok the name of Anubis. To solve the puzzle of Decius, the reade r need only do the same. To solve the puzzle, the reader must simply switch the names of the characters and religions that Josephus has iden tified as parallel, so that while the stories will be the same, the nam es of the charac- ters will be different. This technique is used thro ughout the New Testament and War of the Jews. The name of a charac ter in one story is given to a character in another, parallel tale. In the story of Decius Mundus simply switch the nam e of the character Paulina, who is a member of Cult of Isis, with Fulvia from the third story, who is a member of the Jewish reli gion. Notice that Josephus has actually shown us that these two chara cters are inter- changeable. Both women have an experience with wick ed priests; both have husbands with the same name; both husband s appeal to Tiberius; and both women share the quality of digni ty. Josephus has also indicated that the cult of Isis a nd the Jewish religion are interchangeable by deliberately revers ing which story he tells first and which religion was \"at Rome.\" The reader can now replace the name of the characte r \"Decius Mundus\" with \"Christ\" from the first story, the Tes timonium. Again, Josephus has shown that the names are interchangeab le by the par- allel attributes of these two characters. They both claim to be gods, they both make revelations regarding their divinity on the third day; and they both have made public resolutions to sacri fice themselves. The new Decius Mundus story, created by switching t he names of the characters and religions Josephus has identi fied as inter- changeable, can be summarized as follows: Decius Mundus, a Roman, is desirous of Fulvia, a Je w of dignity, whom he cannot seduce with money. Learning that her weakness is her religion, he pays wicked priests to convince he r that he is the"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"240 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH Christ, so that he can \"screw\" her. On the third da y, he reappears to tell her he is not really the Messiah but received pleasure by pre- tending to be a god. The Jews are then banished and their temple destroyed. While this new story is still a satire, it is one w hose meaning can easily be grasped. The translation that I offer is as follows: Rome desires Judea but cannot tempt it with wealth because of the staunch religious convictions of its people. Th erefore, a Roman fools the Jewish Zealots into believing that he is the Christ. He pays wicked priests to help him carry out the plot. The authors of Chris- tianity \"enjoy\" the experience of pretending to be the Messiah. The unnamed Jew in the final tale who \"professed to instruct men in the wisdom of the laws of Moses' is identifi ed as Paul in the parallel description in Acts 25 given above. Joseph us also assists the reader with this identification by beginning the pa rallel stories with descriptions of the genders of \"Paulina\" and the \"J ew at Rome.\" Once the reader knows that the stories are designed to have inter- changeable elements, it is not difficult to see tha t by switching their genders Paulina can become Paul, which completely c larifies the identity of the \"Jew at Rome.\" The story created by solving the puzzle reveals how Caesar fooled the Jews into calling him \"Lord\" without the ir knowing it by simply switching his name to Jesus—the great secret of Christianity. It also reveals the keys to understanding the comic story within the New Testament—a character may take on another name, stories that share parallels can be combined to create another s tory, and an unnamed character in one passage will have the same name as a character in a parallel passage. While the puzzle is simple, the technical idea behi nd it is ingen- ious. The story that emerges when the reader revers es the inter- changeable characters and religions can be read lit erally as the his- torical event Josephus recorded.

The stories that it rep laces do not con- nect to the passages before them, are incoherent, a nd have a sense of fantasy. Josephus has, as he reminded us so often, written the truth—the truth was just contained in a puzzle. The puzzle's main purpose was to show the method by which the true identities of the characters in the New Te stament and War of the Jews can be known, which is simply to combin e the stories that contain parallels. This technique reveals the identities of the \"certain young man\" captured on the Mount of Olives , Mary's unnamed son whose flesh was eaten, the Apostles Sim on and John and, ultimately, Jesus himself. Also notice that De cius' seduction of Paulina occurs \"in the dark,\" like Mary Magdalene's mistaking Lazarus' tomb for that of Jesus, described previous ly. The Testimonium is found in Antiquities of the Jews , Josephus' second work of history, which he purportedly wrote during the reign of Titus' brother Domitian. If Christianity was cre ated by the Fla- vians so that Caesar could secretly become the Mess iah, then Domit- ian could have seen himself as \"Jesus\" once he beca me emperor, fol- lowing Titus' death. Domitian's obsession with his divinity was well known. He demanded, for example, to be addressed by members of the Roman senate as \"Master and god.\" Thus, Domitia n, while over- seeing the production of Antiquities of the Jews, m ay have been the basis for the character Decius Mundus. This conjecture is supported by an interesting para llel between episodes in the life of Domitian and the tale of De cius Mundus. The Flavians overthrew Vitellius, the last of the Julio -Claudian emperors, with a battle that took place in Rome in 69 C.E. Du ring the battle Domitian became trapped behind enemy lines. To esca pe, he donned a mask of Anubis, exactly as Decius Mundus does, an d pretended to be a priest of Isis.

This theory reconciles all the many elements within the three stories that have struck. Further, this interpretation reso lves the longstand- ing debate over how the three stories relate to the passages that are immediately before and after them. The first sentence in the story of Decius Mundus st ates that \"another sad calamity threw the Jews into disorder. \" \"Disorder\" in Greek (thorubeo) also appears in the first two pass ages in the chap- ter, which immediately precede the Testimonium. By starting with a reference to \"another disorder,\" the story of Deciu s Mundus seems to ignore the Testimonium. This fact has led some s cholars to suspect that the Testimonium was therefore inserted into An tiquities by later Christian redactors. G. A. Wells in The Jesus Myth argues this point in the following way: The word (disorder) connects this introduction of 4 (the tale of Decius Mundus), with the \"uproars\" specified in 1 and 2. Thus 3—the passage about Jesus—occurs in a context which deals with uproar bringing danger or misfortu ne to the Jews. That 4 follows immediately after 2 is obv ious from the opening words of 4—\"Another calamity.\" There is no possible reference to 3."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"The Puzzle of Decius Mundus 243 Wells' argument is only one of the various ways in which schol- ars have tried to explain the strange positioning o f the Testimonium. In this case, Wells suggests two reasons for suspec ting that the Tes- timonium was inserted by later Christian redactors between the Decius story and the preceding passage regarding Pilate. H is first argument is that since the word \"disorder\" occurs in passage s one and two and is not found in the third passage of the chapter, t he Testimonium, and but reappears in passage four, this suggests that f our should come after two. Wells also argues that since the express ion \"another cala- mity,\" which begins passage four, cannot be referri ng to the Testimo- nium, it must originally have followed the second p assage, which in fact, describes a calamity. Many scholars have noticed this apparent lack of co ntinuity between the Testimonium and the chapter that contai ns it. H. St. John Thackeray in his 1929 work on Josephus argues, like Wells, that the lack of continuity on the subject of \"disorder\" sug gests to him that redactors, to make history conform to their faith, created and inserted the Testimonium. Thackeray concludes that the argument that the Testimonium may have been inserted by reda ctors \"carries great weight.\" Scholars like Thackeray and Wells have mistakenly s een a lack of continuity between the Testimonium and the two s tories that fol- low it and the rest of Josephus' history simply bec ause they have failed to recognize that the three stories could on ly have been created in direct relationship to one another and are not i ndependent tales. To argue that the Testimonium was inserted into Jew ish Antiqui- ties by later Christian redactors who placed it by chance between the stories about Pilate's \"disorders\" and the tale of Decius Mundus is illogical. This is because such an argument is base d solely upon the perceived gap in continuity on the subject of \"diso rders\" and ignores the continuity created by the parallel \"third-day\" appearances of Jesus and Decius. Since riots were common in the wo rks of Josephus and third-day declarations regarding divinity are u nique in litera- ture, this parallel is clearly more important. It c onnects the Testimo- nium to the story of Decius in a far stronger manne r than the lack of the word \"disorder\" in the Testimonium suggests a d isconnect."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"244 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH Therefore, all three stories must have been created together. This small chain of logic has far-reaching consequences because it also demonstrates a purpose for their joint creation. If one accepts that they are a related set created for some purpose, th is interpretation seems the only one possible. It is useful to list the problematic or seemingly i ncoherent aspects of the three stories that this interpretati on resolves to show how much explanatory power it possesses. The first resolution to a \"problem\" I want to show is the unnat- ural manner in which the Testimonium and its two fo llowing tales fit into the narration of Josephus' history the problem of a gap in con- tinuity that Wells and Thackeray noted above. To cl arify for the reader the nature of this discontinuity, I present the following sequence: 18:35 Pilate arrives in Judea to abolish Jewish laws 18:55-59 Pilate introduces imperial images in the temple, causing a \"tumult\" 18:60-62 Pilate tries to build an aqueduct, ca using another \"tumult\" 18:63-64 The Testimonium appears 18:65-80 The Decius Mundus story appears 18:81-84 The Fulvia story appears 18:85-7 Pilate has a confrontation with the Samaritans 18:88-9 Pilate is removed as procurator When the sequence of events is viewed in this manne r, it is easy to see why scholars like Wells and Thackeray have q uestioned whether later redactors inserted the Testimonium. T he historical nar- ration both before and after the Testimonium is exc lusively about Pilate. Notice, however, that the Decius and Fulvia stories also stand out. None of the stories in this \"set\" discusses Ro man activity in Judea, the theme of the surrounding passages. This interpretation of the \"puzzle\" resolves this lack of continuity in Jo sephus' narration. Further, the satire revealed by this solution fits perfectly into the flow of the narration. This interpretation also resolves the apparently in appropriate opening words of the Decius story, \"Another calamit y.\" As mentioned"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"The Puzzle of Decius Mundus 245 above, many scholars have believed that this phrase could not pos- sibly relate to the Testimonium and Jesus. However, within the con- text of my explanation, the positioning of the phra se makes perfect, though ironic, sense. The Romans invented Christian ity for the express purpose of bringing a calamity on the Jews and throwing them into disorder. Readers will recall how in the \"Son of Mary\" pas- sage Mary uses the word \"calamity\" to describe the effect that her son becoming a \"by-word to the world\" will have upo n the Jews. Come on; be thou my food, and be thou a fury to the se sedi- tious varlets, and a by-word to the world, which is all that is now wanting to complete the calamities of us Jews. The three passages that make up the puzzle are rela ted to the two passages that precede the Testimonium in anothe r way. The first two passages of the short five-passage chapter sati rically state the reasons that the Flavians invented Christianity, as well as the fact that by inventing the religion, the Romans were, in effect, taking over the Sicarii movement. Below are these two pass ages. 1. BUT now Pilate, the procurator of Judea, removed the army from Cesarea to Jerusalem, to take their winte r quar- ters there, in order to abolish the Jewish laws. So he intro- duced Caesar's effigies, which were upon the ensign s, and brought them into the city; whereas our law forbids us the very making of images; on which account the former procu- rators were wont to make their entry into the city with such ensigns as had not those ornaments. Pilate was the first who brought those images to Jerusalem, and set them up there; which was done without the knowledge of the people, because it was done in the night time; but as soon as they knew it, they came in multitudes to Cesarea, and in terceded with Pilate many days that he would remove the imag es; and when he would not grant their requests, because it would tend to the injury of Caesar, while yet they perse- vered in their request, on the sixth day he ordered his sol- diers to have their weapons privately, while he cam e and sat upon his judgment-seat, which seat was so prepa red in the open place of the city, that it concealed the a rmy that lay"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"246 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH ready to oppress them; and when the Jews petitioned him again, he gave a signal to the soldiers to encompas s them routed, and threatened that their punishment should be no less than immediate death, unless they would leave off dis- turbing him, and go theirways home. But they threwt hem- selves upon the ground, and laid their necks bare, and said they would take their death very willingly, rather than the wisdom of their laws should be transgressed; upon w hich Pilate was deeply affected with their firm resoluti on to keep their laws inviolable, and presently commanded the images to be carried back from Jerusalem to Cesarea. 2. But Pilate undertook to bring a current of water to Jerusalem, and did it with the sacred money, and de rived the origin of the stream from the distance of two h undred furlongs. However, the Jews were not pleased with w hat had been done about this water; and many ten thousa nds of the people got together, and made a clamor against him, and insisted that he should leave off that design. Some of them also used reproaches, and abused the man, as crowds of such people usually do. So he habited a g reat number of his soldiers in their habit, who carried daggers under their garments, and sent them to a place wher e they might surround them. So he bid the Jews himself go away; but they boldly began casting reproaches upon him, he gave the soldiers that signal which had been beforehand agreed on; who laid upon them much greater blows than Pila te had commanded them, and equally punished those that wer e tumultuous, and those that were not; nor did they s pare them in the least: and since the people were unarme d, and were caught by men prepared for what they were abou t, there were a great number of them slain by this mea ns, and others of them ran away wounded. And thus an end wa s put to this sedition. 159 The two passages satirically confirm the entire pre mise regard- ing Christianity. The Jews would not worship Roman emperors and were not swayed by violence; therefore, Rome was fo rced to \"become\" the Sicarii movement.

Its effect was to end the rebellion. And thus an end was put to this sedition. When determining the strength of a theory it is use ful to con- sider how much \"explanatory power\" it possesses. Th e following list demonstrates just how many \"puzzles\" this interpret ation resolves. This interpretation • resolves Josephus' perceived confusion over which r eligion was \"at Rome\" • resolves why Paulina, of the cult of Isis, and not Fulvia, the Jew, is the one to rent her garments • resolves why Josephus recorded that the temple of I sis was destroyed, though he was aware that no such destruc tion had occurred • resolves why the women in the different stories bot h have husbands named Saturninus who know the emperor • resolves why the Decius story and the Fulvia story have the same plot • resolves why a character has the unusual name \"Deci us Mundus\" • resolves why a character has the unusual name \"Ide\" • resolves the parallel use in the Testimonium and th e Decius story of the expression \"received with pleasure\" • resolves the unusual parallels between the wicked J ew in the Fulvia story and the Apostle Paul"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"248 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH • explains why Decius Mundus did not conceal his reso lution to kill himself • and most importantly, this interpretation explains how the two \"third-day divinity declarations\" in literature happen to be placed next to one another. There is yet another parallel in the Decius Mundus tale and the Testimonium, a parallel only apparent when one read s the passages in their original Greek. In the Testimonium, Jesus is described as a teacher of people who \"accept the truth with pleasu re.\" The Greek word for pleasure that Josephus uses is hedone, the root for the Eng- lish word \"hedonism.\" Scholars have puzzled over Jo sephus' use of hedone here. Hedone usually denotes sensual or mali cious pleasure, and \"to accept the truth with hedone\" is a strange concept. The sen- tence that Josephus wrote in Greek could just as we ll be translated \"received the truth with malicious pleasure.\" The verb Josephus uses in this phrase is dechomenon , which means to receive, the phrase in Greek reading hedon ei talethe dechomenon. In the Decius Mundus tale, Decius also receives some- thing with \"sensual pleasure.\" Decius receives the plot Ide hatches to enable him to seduce Paulina with sensual pleasu re—hedone, the Greek reading dechomenou ten hiketeian hedonei. The same verb, dechomenou (meaning \"to accept or re ceive\"), is used with hedone in the Testimonium. This creates y et another paral- lel between the Testimonium and the Decius story. B ased on the con- text provided by the Decius story, a logical conjec ture is that this verb/noun combination creates the idiom \"getting sc rewed.\" I have been unable to confirm this conjecture by another e xample from classical Greek, however. Hedone is also used in an interesting manner with a nother word. Josephus concludes his Preface to War of the Jews w ith the following statement; Tauta panta perilabon en hepta bibliois kai medemia n tois epistamenois ta pragmata kai paratuchousi toi polem oi katalipon e mempseos aphormen e kategorias, tois ge ten aletheian agaposin, alla me pros hedonen anegrapsa.

And I will begin my account of these things with what I call m y First Chapter. The reason Whiston places brackets around the phase \"please themselves [with fictitious relations]\" above, was to alert the reader that it is an inaccurate translation. The Greek wor ds that Josephus uses here, hedonen anegrapsa, do not mean \"please t hemselves with fictitious relations\" but rather please themselves with registering. When used in connection with a person, as it is her e, the stem word, anagrapho, means to register or record names.

All of Jesus' ministry was about the coming war with Rome and was designed to establish Jesus as Titus' forerunner. T herefore, the rela- tionship between Jesus and \"the Father\" referred to throughout the Gospels is a forerunner of the relationship between Titus and his father, the emperor and god Vespasian.

They said to him therefore, \"Where is your Father?\" Jesus answered, \"You know neither me nor my Father; if you knew me, you would know my Father also.\" John 8:19 In Matthew, Jesus also speaks of a secret identity known only to him and his father. At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, 0 Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast re vealed them unto babes.

But it was impor tant because Vespasian's deification would break the chain of di vine succession held by the Julio-Claudian line since Julius Caesar and thereby help secure an imperial future for the Flavian family. In order for Vespasian to be made a diuus, the Roma n senate had to decree it upon him. It was a uniquely Roman cust om that only the senate could bestow the title of diuus upon him. Ov er the years, the senate had turned down many applicants for the titl e. Therefore, Titus needed to somehow demonstrate to the senate t hat Vespasian's life had been that of a god. During this time, he w ould also have been involved in creating of an empire-wide bureauc racy to admin- ister the cult of Vespasian, once it was establishe d. In spite of the fact that Vespasian's consecrato wo uld have been of great importance to Titus, it did not occur unti l six months after his death. This interval between the death of an em peror and his consecrato was an unusually long time. It was durin g this time that the New Testament was created. The length of t he interval due to the fact that during this period Titus created n ot one but two reli- gions that worshiped his father as a god, as well a s the New Testa- ment's companion piece, War of the Jews. As Jesus' prophecies came to pass during the Jewish war, they proved that God had sanctioned the events he foresa w. This is exactly what Titus would have been attempting to demonstrat e to the Roman senate—that the events of his father's life, certai nly including his conquest of Judea, proved that he was divine and th at he deserved to be decreed a diuus. Viewed from this perspective , the similarities between Christianity and the cult of Vespasian are obvious. When Titus arranged to have his father declared a g od he \"dei- fied\" the events of Vespasian's life. Thus, all of Jesus' prophecies regarding God's coming wrath upon Judea flow withou t contradic- tion into the cult of Vespasian.

Of course, no R oman senator would have been so gullible as to believe the story . Locating the prophet in Judea does not make such prophecies any more plausi- ble, but Christianity was not created for a sophist icated audience. The histories of Josephus, which prophesied that Ve spasian would be the world ruler foreseen by Judaism's mess ianic prophe- cies, likewise provided support for Vespasian's dei fication. The New Testament and War of the Jews both make the case th at the destruc- tion of Judea was an act of a god—the same absurd p remise as that made by the cult of Vespasian. When we align the New Testament with War of the Jew s a clear picture emerges. Jesus predicted that a \"Son of Man \" would encircle Jerusalem with a wall and destroy its temple and br ing tribulation onto the \"wicked generation\" that rebelled against Rome. In fact, one man actually had these precise characteristics. A m an who was a \"son of god\" and whose followers \"fished for men\" at Gen nesareth. A man who encircled Jerusalem with a wall and destroy ed the temple of Jerusalem. A man who brought the tribulation tha t Jesus had fore- seen unto the \"wicked generation\" and then ended hi s \"ministry\" by condemning Simon and sparing John. The man was Titu s Flavius. Only one man at that point in history had the power to estab- lish a religion. At the same time that the first re al evidence of Chris- tianity emerges, one man is known to have establish ed a religion that, like Christianity, held that the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple was the work of a god. The man was Titus Fla vius. Bear in mind that no one had a stronger motivation than Titus for finding a cost-effective method of containing m ilitant Judaism, which was so expensive for Rome to control. Finally, only one family other than Jesus' is assoc iated with the origin of Christianity. It is the family of Titus F lavius.

Concerning the question of who knew Judaism well en ough to create Christianity, this information was in abunda nt supply, even within the small circle of Titus' known confidants. Titus' mistress Bernice, though a Herodian, had Maccabean ancestors and claimed to have been a Jew. Though the Jews of the messiani c movement would not have seen her religious perspective as Je wish, she would clearly have known much about the Judaism of her da y and would have been able to contribute to the creation of the Gospels. Tiberius Alexander was another individual within Ti tus' inner- most circle who knew of Judaism well enough oversee the produc- tion of the New Testament. Tiberius was the nephew of the famous Jewish philosopher Philo, and Vespasian held him in such regard that he made Tiberius chief of staff to Titus durin g the siege of Jerusalem. Though a Jew, Tiberius Alexander was a Roman knight who was morally able to order the murder of thousands of hi s race to main- tain the Pax Romana, the Roman peace. When the Jews of Alexan- dria \"made a disturbance,\" Tiberius ordered the Rom an troops not only to kill the rioters but to plunder and burn th eir ghetto as well. Josephus records that \"fifty thousand corpses piled up.\" Tiberius, in his role as chief of staff to Titus during the sieg e of Jerusalem and the subsequent slaughter and enslavement of the Jew s there, showed a slavish obedience to Rome. It would have been nec essary for some- one of Jewish descent who created a religion that w as used to oppress his own people. His religious perspective was Roman ized to such an extent that he was not even monotheistic. He often used the word \"gods.\" Josephus, who, it should be remembered, als o claimed to be a Jew, recorded Tiberius' close relationship to the Flavians. ... as also there came Tiberius Alexander, who was a friend of his, most valuable, both for his good-will to hi m, and for"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"256 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH his prudence. He had formerly been governor of Alex andria, but was now thought worthy to be general of the arm y [under Titus].

One of the primary causes for the war between the R omans and the Jews was the Jews' refusal to worship the Roman emperors as gods. Though the rest of the empire did, the Jews w ould not call Caesar \"Lord.\" As I have pointed out, the cruelest joke of Christian- ity is that by replacing the Jewish God and son of God with Roman emperors, it tricked Jews into calling Caesar \"Lord \" without know- ing it. Chrisitanity stole the identities of the Go d of Judaism and his messiah Son, as well as those of John and Simon, th e leaders of the messianic rebellion. Their identities were given to Vespasian and Titus and to the \"Christian Apostles\" John and Simon. The se disguised characters were combined with other symbols of Roma n conquest, the cross of the crucifixion and the \"flesh of the Messiah,\" to create a religion that both absorbed and ridiculed the mes sianic movement. This was the ultimate triumph of the imperial famil y. This darkly comic concept of switched identities is in play to such an extent that the New Testament and the works of Josephus togethe r are a puzzle whose solution produces the true identities of thei r characters. Why was it necessary to create this vast literary puzzl e? Because it was the only method by which Titus could both create a reli gion that solved the problem of the Jews' refusal to accept the Roma n emperor as a god and also make it known to posterity that he was the one who did it.

I suspect that Christianity, as the comic version o f the imperial cult, was first inserted into the areas surrounding Judea to serve as a theological barrier to the spread of militaristic Judaism. Evidently succeeding beyond its creators' original intent, it was eventually decreed the state religion. The religion thus becam e a prophylactic for all the potentially rebellious slave populations th roughout the empire. To make the cult as efficient as possible in promot ing their interests, its inventors had their parodic Messiah advocate both paci- fism and stoicism, whereby Christians would learn t o subdue their rebelliousness and find holiness in subservience. T his combination of Christian theology and Roman imperial might was so effective that it kept European civilization frozen in place for over 1000 years, throughout the Dark Ages. A Roman bureaucracy called the Commune Aside, an or ganiza- tion that administered the imperial cult in Asia, w ould probably have overseen the original implementation of Christ ianity. Notably, all the seven \"churches of Asia\" mentioned in Revel ation 1:11 were known to have agencies of the Commune located withi n them. Five of these seven cities were sites of the imperial cu lt's festival, which was held once every five years. In these cities it would have been possible to oversee two versions of the imperial cu lt, one for Roman citizens and the other for the \"slaves and scum\" se en as susceptible to the lure of the Messiah. The puzzle of Decius Mundus described earlier indic ates that \"wicked priests\" accepted money to build congregati ons for the new Judaism. Following the destruction of the temple, s ome of the 18,000 priests who had previously worked there were, presu mably, still alive and would have needed to seek new employment.

However, the reader can take another route to this understanding , using only the literal meanings of the words in these works. As I have stated, the works of Josephus provided su pport for the religious doctrine of Christianity. Early Christian writers held that the parallels between Jesus' prophecies and Josephu s' histories prove that Jesus could see into the future. Moreover, in addition to simply recording that Jesus' prophecies had come to pass, Josephus falsified the dates of the events that he describes in War of the Jews. He does this so that the sequence of events appear to \"prov e\" that Daniel's prophecies came to pass within the first century C. E. and that Jesus is the son of God that Daniel envisioned. The following passage from St. Augustine exemplifie s the early church fathers' belief that the 70 C.E. destruction of Jerusalem simultaneously fulfilled the prophecies of both Dan iel and Jesus. Luke, to show that the abomination spoken of by Dan iel will take place when Jerusalem is captured, recalls thes e words of the Lord in the same context: When you sha ll see Jerusalem compassed about with an army, then know t hat the desolation thereof is at hand.

In the very same manner Daniel also w rote concerning the Roman government, and that our count ry should be made desolate by them. All these things d id this man leave in writing, as God had showed them to him ... 168 The passage above could not state the proposition a ny more clearly. Josephus is claiming that the events he de scribes in his works are part of the fulfillment of Daniel's proph ecies. He shares this understanding of the events with Jesus, who al so believed that Daniel's prophecies foresaw the 70 C.E. destruction of Jerusalem. Daniel's prophecies foresaw events that spanned fiv e centuries. They predicted that toward the end of this time per iod a Messiah, who would be a son of God, would appear and then be \"cut off.\" This cutting off of the Messiah is then followed by the destruction of Jerusalem. Therefore, to demonstrate that the wa r between the Romans and the Jews is the one that Daniel envision ed, Josephus begins to align his history with Daniel's prophecie s many years before the events of the first century C.E. Josephu s begins War of the Jews with a passage that describes Antiochus Epipha nes' assault on Jerusalem, which occurred approximately 200 years b efore the birth of Christ. Josephus clearly indicates that the assa ult was an event on Daniel's prophetic continuum—specifically, the deso lation Daniel predicts in Daniel 7:13-8:12. He does this by using a phrase found only in the Book of Daniel, the \"ending of the dail y sacrifice,\" and by documenting the amount of time during which the daily sacrifice was halted, \"three years and six months.\" By using these phrases, Josephus is flatly stating that Daniel's prophecies are coming to pass. This position cannot be disputed because Josephus h imself writes the passage above that \"our nation suffered these t hings under Anti- ochus Epiphanes, according to Daniel's vision.\" While the following passage may seem innocuous, it is in fact Josephus' \"proof that Daniel's prophetic continuum was occurring,"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Josephus' Use of the Book of Daniel 261 and that therefore, the first century C.E. would se e both a Messiah who would be \"cut off and the destruction of Jerusa lem.

How ever, Onias, one of the high priests, got the better, and cast the sons of Tobias out of the city; who fled to Antioch us, and besought him to make use of them for his leaders, a nd to make an expedition into Judea. The king being there to dis- posed beforehand, complied with them, and came upon the Jews with a great army, and took their city by forc e, and slew a great multitude of those that favored Ptolem y, and sent out his soldiers to plunder them without mercy . He also spoiled the temple, and put a stop to the constant practice of offering a daily sacrifice of expiation for thre e years and six months. 169 By beginning his work with this description, Joseph us is, in effect, stating that all the events in Daniel's prophetic c ontinuum will come to pass within the era that his histories cover. Th is is because once one links an event to a point on Daniel's continuum the re can be no stop- ping until all the prophecies in his continuum have been fulfilled. The cutting off of the Messiah that Daniel predicte d is one of these events. Therefore, even though Jesus is not m entioned in War of the Jews, Josephus was aware that if the destruc tion of Jerusalem that Daniel prophecies comes to pass in 70 C.E., th e Messiah that Daniel predicted would have lived and been \"cut off earlier in the first century. Josephus is, in effect, providing su pport for the claim that Jesus existed, and was the Messiah that Daniel prophesied with the very first sentence of his work.

He does this by \"documenting,\" once aga in, that the time sequences between the related events during the war match the con- clusion Daniel envisioned, and by using terms found only in the Book of Daniel. The reader will notice that in none of the examples I present does Josephus try to portray certain events as occurring at precise dates. There was no system in the first century to precise ly determine dates to which Daniel's prophecies could be aligned. In a ny case, Daniel's prophecies are so vague as to defy temporal specifi city. The only cer- tainties regarding them is that he uses the word \"w eek\" to refer to a seven-year, not a seven-day period and that his vis ions encompass a 490-year span. Josephus guides his readers to reach his intended c onclusions by using words and phrases such as \"desolation\" and \"ending of the daily sacrifice,\" which he expects the reader to be familiar with from Daniel, and, more concretely, by simply stating tha t Daniel's prophe- cies were coming to pass. Moreover, Josephus also d ates events within his history in precise time spans relative t o one another, creat- ing the impression that they were part of Daniel's prophecies. Josephus recorded that the related events were eith er three and a half years (half a week) or seven years (a week) apart. The length of the war was seven years and the \"ending of the d aily sacrifice\" was three and a half years from its beginning. Bear in mind that Josephus was not merely inventing a religion; he was also inventing a time sequence within which the religion is contained. None of the first-century chronology we orient ourselves by today existed until the author(s) of the works o f Josephus created it. Because he was literally creating both history and time, Josephus was free to place events in relation to one another any way he chose. His recording of the perfect alignment of events in the time sequences Daniel predicted is either his witnessing of supern atural phenomena or a deliberate falsification. Currently there is contention among scholars regard ing virtu- ally of the chronology Josephus gives in War of the Jews. 170 For example, Josephus gives a later date than Suetonius 171 and Dio for when Vespasian began to prepare for the civil war i n Rome that led to his becoming emperor.

While it is not necessary that the reader be comple tely knowl- edgeable about Daniel's arcane prophecies and datin g system to understand this analysis, some information is usefu l. Daniel envisioned a series of tribulations for the Jews during which various disasters would befall them. Inside t his time period, he foresaw that a Messiah, who he referred to as th e son of God, would be \"cut off.\" The period would last 490 years , the \"seven times seventy weeks\" foreseen by Daniel. Several ha lf weeks, three- and-a-half-year periods, would occur within specifi c weeks. Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and up on thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, a nd to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vi sion and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy. 172 When Josephus aligns events of the first century wi th the prophecies of Daniel, he is creating a historical c ontext that includes the son of God, the Messiah. No other interpretatio n is possible. Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusale m unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, a nd threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times. 173 And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the Prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary ; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined. 174 Daniel foresees a war that will last a week (seven years). At the mid-point of this week (three and a half years afte r its beginning) the \"daily sacrifice\" will cease and the \"abominati on of desolation,\" also foreseen by Jesus, will occur."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"264 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week (three and a half year s) he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease , and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it deso- late, even until the consummation, and that determi ned shall be poured upon the desolate. 175 Understanding this much, the reader should apprecia te that the- following passage from War of the Jews is, without question, meant to be understood as demonstrating the alignment bet ween Daniel's prophecies and the history Josephus is describing. The \"failure of the daily sacrifice,\" three and a half years from t he beginning of the war, is too unique and precise a concept to permit any other inter- pretation. Further, this passage must be describing the \"abomination of desolation\" Jesus prophesied in the New Testamen t, a point I shall go into in depth.

The passage begins with Titus bringin g Josephus to the walls of Jerusalem to inform the Jewish rebels in t heir own language of Titus' concern over ending of the \"daily sacrifi ce\" to God. The passage makes it completely clear that Josephus und erstands that Daniel's prophecies are being fulfilled.

Upon this Josephus stood in such a place wher e he might be heard, not by John only, but by many more, and then declared to them what Caesar had given him in charge, and this in the Hebrew language. So he earn estly prayed them to spare their own city, and to prevent that fire which was just ready to seize upon the temple, and to offer their usual sacrifices to God therein. At these wor ds of his a great sadness and silence were observed among the peo- ple. But the tyrant himself cast many re p r o a c h e s u p o n Josephus, with imprecations besides; and at last ad ded this withal, that he did never fear the taking of the ci ty, because it was God's own city. In answer to which Josephus said thus with a loud voice: \"To be sure thou hast kept this city wonderfully pure for God's sake; the temple also co ntinues entirely unpolluted! Nor hast thou been guilty of a ll impiety against him for whose assistance thou hopest! He st ill receives his accustomed sacrifices!

Returning to my analysis of Josephus' use of the Bo ok of Daniel, I have included Whiston's two footnotes to the pass age above. As the footnotes show, Whiston understood the relat ionship between Daniel's prophecies and Josephus' dating of the events of the Jewish war. A devout Christian, he accepted tha t Josephus was faithfully recording supernatural occurrences. In the first footnote below, Whiston recognizes tha t the siege of Jerusalem began exactly \"three years and a half aft er Vespasian began the war. This time span shows that Daniel's prophec y, \"in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the ob lation to cease,\" had come to pass. This was either, as Whiston belie ved, an example of Josephus' witnessing of the supernatural or, as I prefer, an exam- ple of his deliberate falsification of history to c reate the impression that Daniel had envisioned the 70 C.E. destruction of Jerusalem. This was a remarkable day indeed, the seventeenth o f Paneruns [Tammuz], A.D. 70, when, according to Dani el's prediction, six hundred and six years before, the R omans \"in half a week caused the sacrifice and oblation t o cease,\" Daniel 9:27. For from the month of February, A.D. 6 6, about which time Vespasian entered on this war, to this v ery time, was just three years and a half. Whiston's second footnote is even more remarkable. In it Whis- ton comes to show the exact conclusion that Josephu s intended. Since Whiston could not consider the possibility of a nonsupernat- ural explanation for what he read in Josephus, he c oncludes that God was aligned with the Romans, that the Jews were wicked, and that Jesus and Daniel shared the same prophetic vis ion.

If we accept what Josephus has recorded above as tr ue, then the prophet foreseen by Daniel can only have been Jesus . Likewise, Jesus' \"doomsday\" prophecies must have foreseen the 70 C.E . destruction of Jerusalem, because it is the only destruction of Jerusalem that Daniel's prophet could have envisioned had he lived in the first cen- tury. Further cinching this knot of logic is the fa ct that it would it have been impossible for Josephus to record this pe rfect manifesta- tion of Daniel's visions had it not, in fact, come to pass in the war with the Jews. Josephus recorded history to demonstrate that Danie l's prophe- cies came to pass in 70 C.E. Josephus goes overboar d to make cer- tain that his readers come to this conclusion. This was one of the primary reasons the first Christians believed in Je sus' divinity. Some- how this knowledge has been lost and is no longer u nderstood today, even by New Testament scholars. Scholars have debated whether the Testimonium was w ritten by Josephus or added by later Christian redactors. Pre viously, I pre- sented an analysis of the Testimonium that demonstr ates that it is not separate from the two tales that follow it. However , for Josephus to remain consistent in his placing of first-century e vents in the con- text of Daniel's prophecies, he would have to place a \"Messiah\" at the point in history that these prophecies called f or. Because Jose- phus claims that the \"end of the daily sacrifice\" f oreseen by Daniel's prophecies came to pass during the 70 C.E. destruct ion of Jerusalem by the Romans, one needs only to work backward from 70 C.E. to determine if the positioning of the \"Christ\" in Ant iquities is consis- tent with this date. This is exactly what early Chr istian scholars did, using the relevant dates in Josephus and the New Te stament to demonstrate that Jesus had fulfilled the prophecies of Daniel. The following example by the Tertullian, written circa 200 C.E., repre- sents a complete victory for Josephus.

I n the book, describe the prophet predicting events that you kno w have already occurred. Inventing the prophet and his predictions is not the hard part. The hard part is not having the forgery disco vered. In order for the New Testament/Josephus fabrication to be believ able, the two works had to be seen as independent of one another. Therefore, Josephus focused on the events that Daniel had pred icted and not on the \"son of God\" himself. Josephus' successful effort in overlaying Daniel on events in the first century, in a way, provides support for my th eory. It does so by being such an obvious ruse. The \"wickedness\" of the Jews of the first century was their refusal to compromise Judaism and submit to Rome; they did exactly what the religion of Moses a nd Daniel required. Josephus' use of the prophecies of Daniel to substantiate the events of the first century was, clearly, an ef fort to manipulate Judaism into alignment with Roman interests—exactly as was the case with the creation of Christianity. If the Romans were the creators of Christianity and the works of Josephus, why did they portray their fictitious Mes siah as the one foreseen by Daniel? Among the Dead Sea Scrolls are many relating to the Book of Daniel. They show that at least some of the Jews of that era were using the dating system within the Bo ok of Daniel to try to determine when the Messiah would appear to l ead them in their holy war against Rome."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Josephus' Use of the Book of Daniel 273 The Romans understood that the messianic Jewish reb els inter- preted passages from Daniel and other of their prop hets in a way that justified their own militaristic theology.

Roman intellectuals, no doubt, analyzed these works and realized that it was just as possible to interpret the passa ges in order to cre- ate an entirely different, pro-Roman theology. Rome 's solution to these militaristic anti-Roman interpretations of th e Book of Daniel was to create a literature that interpreted Daniel' s prophecies in a way acceptable to Rome—the New Testament and War of the Jews. I will now analyze in depth the link between Jesus' statement concerning the \"abomination of desolation\" and Jose phus' passage describing the end of the \"daily sacrifice.\" Early Christian scholars were aware of the three-wa y link between Jesus' statements in Matthew 24, the Book o f Daniel, and War of the Jews. St. Augustine, for example, unders tood that Jesus had claimed that Daniel's prophecies \"came to pass\" within the first century. In the passage below, notice that Augustin e is clear about what period Jesus' prophecies referred to—the 70 C. E. destruction of Jerusalem.

I have included Josephus' self- serving argument that fulfilled prophecies prove th e existence of God. This argument is interesting historically in t hat it may reveal the reasoning that Christian \"missionaries\" would h ave used with first-century slaves and peasants. In other words, the fulfillment of prophecies, which, of course, the combination of th e New Testament and the works of Josephus represented, not only \"pr oved\" that God existed but that his providence was with the Romans .

Further, when the New Testament has Jesus predict t he \"abom- ination of desolation,\" how could the reader \"under stand\" what he was referring to? Nothing in the New Testament enab les its readers to know that the complex prophecy sequence that Dan iel used to predict the \"Abomination of Desolation,\" would \"com e to pass\" dur- ing the Roman destruction of Jerusalem.

Thus, since Elij ah and Elisha had raised children from the dead, Jesus would do the s ame. Whenever possible, Jesus' miracles would be greater than the ones they were based upon. For example, Elisha satisfied a hundred men with twenty loaves and had bread to spare. 183 So Jesus would feed five thousand men with five loaves and two fishes, and h ave twelve bas- ketsful to spare. Since Jesus was to be the prophet envisioned by Daniel, Jesus' life would also include episodes tha t fulfilled Daniel's prophecies. However, though many of the extraordina ry accomplish- ments of Jesus' ministry were taken from the lives of prior prophets, the character he was primarily based upon was Moses . Moses was chosen as the basic prototype for Jesus because he had been the founder of the religion Christianity would replace. The founder of the new religion was to be seen as the new Moses. T his is already widely recognized in New Testament scholarship. The fact that Jesus was based on Moses is easy to d emonstrate, because the authors of the Gospels went out of thei r way to make sure the converts to Christianity understood this. For example, the story of Jesus' childhood in Matthew is based on th e childhood of Moses. The outline is the same in both cases—the bi rth of a child causes distress to the rulers, followed by a consul tation with wise men, a massacre of children, and a miraculous rescu e, with Egypt as the land of rescue.

The best-known of these are the parallels that the Gospels use to set up Jesus as a \"Passover lamb,\" establishing him as the \"deliverer\" of the religion that was to replace Judaism. All four Gospels show, as does Paul, that Passover, and Judaism itself, are obsolete. Jesus' sacrifice of himself c reates a new Passover and a new religion. It is important to recognize ho w literally early Christianity saw itself as a replacement for Judais m, even to the extent that the early church fathers claimed that t he ancient Hebrews were Christians and not Jews. Eusebius wrote: That the Hebrew nation is not new, but is universal ly hon- ored on account of its antiquity, is known to all. The books and writings of this people contain accounts of anc ient men, rare indeed and few in number, but nevertheles s dis- tinguished for piety and righteousness and every ot her virtue. Of these, some excellent men lived before t he flood, others of the sons and descendants of Noah lived af ter it, among them Abraham, whom the Hebrews celebrate as their own founder and forefather. If any one should assert that all those who have enjoyed the testimony of righteousness, from Abraha m himself back to the first man, were Christians in f act if not in name, he would not go beyond the truth. 184 Jesus introduces the idea that Christianity will re place Judaism by stating that his \"living flesh\" would be a repla cement for the manna the Israelites were given by God during their wandering in the wilderness. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and a re dead. This is the living bread which comes down from heav en. That one may eat of it and not die.

In other words, since God gave the law to Moses fif ty days after the first Passover, Christianity would give the \"new\" l aw 50 days after its Passover, the crucifixion of Jesus. On the day that the law of Moses was given, 3,000 d ied for wor- shipping the golden calf. 185 On the day the \"spirit\" was given to the disciples of Christ, 3,000 were added into Christ a nd received life, 186 signifying that the improved covenant with God brou ght life. These parallels were obviously created to establish Christianity as the new Judaism. The Gospels and the writings of Josephus work together to this end. The New Testament records the birth of the new Judaism while the history of Josephus records t he \"death\" of Second Temple Judaism. All the parallels I have given above, between Chris tianity and Judaism and between Jesus and Moses, are well known . In addition, the authors of the Gospels also established somethi ng else hereto- fore unknown. By mirroring the sequence found in th e story of Exo- dus and by establishing Jesus' crucifiction as a ne w Passover, they established a continuum, one that mirrored the stor y of the Israelites leaving Egypt and \"wandering\" until they were permi tted to enter the promised land forty years after the first Passo ver. As with the time sequence for the fulfillment of the prophecies of Daniel, once the continuum of the \"new Exodus\" had begun, there could be no stopping until all had come to pass. What is the conclusion to the forty years of wander ing in the New Testament? Since the Gospels end shortly after Jesus' death, where is the conclusion to Christianity's forty yea r Exodus recorded? The answer is found within War of the Jews. To conclude Christianity's forty-year cycle, Joseph us links the date of Jesus' crucifixion to the date he establish ed for the destruc- tion of Masada. Josephus \"records\" that the year th e stronghold was destroyed was 73 C.E. Scholars, citing archeologica l evidence, often date the fall of Masada to 74, not 73 C.E. They may well be correct, but Josephus was interested not in recording histor y but in creating"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"Building Jesus 281 mythology. He therefore entitled the chapter that c ontains the pas- sage describing Masada's destruction as follows: Concerning the interval of about three years: from the taking of Jerusalem by Titus to the sedition of the Jews at C yrene. 187 Josephus does not need to be any more precise than he is in the phrase \"about three years.\" If his time span is ina ccurate, and it surely is, who had been there to point out his erro r? Josephus is only interested in using \"history\" to convey his message . In this instance, he wishes the reader to believe that Masada fell th ree and a half years after the destruction of the temple, that is, in 73 C.E. Josephus then gives the day and month of the conclu sion to the siege at Masada. They then chose ten men by lot out of them to slay all the rest; every one of whom laid himself down by his wi fe and children on the ground, and threw his arms about th em, and they offered their necks to the stroke of those who by lot executed that melancholy office; and when these ten had, without fear, slain them all, they made the sa me rule for casting lots for themselves, that he whose lot it was should first kill the other nine, and after all sho uld kill him- self. . . . Those others were nine hundred and sixt y in num- ber, the women and children being withal included i n that computation.

The authors of the New Testament and Josephus thus created a parallel between the first forty years of Judaism, during which the Israelites wandered in the wilderness, and the firs t forty years of Christianity These forty years of wandering for Chr istianity date from Christ's resurrection on the 15th of Nisan, 33 C.E., until the end of the Jewish rebellion, which is marked by the destruction of the Sicarii, the movement that Christianity replace d, on the 15th of Nisan, 73 C.E. The parallel forty years of wandering by the two re ligions is, of course, a continuation of the parallels between Jes us and Moses, which were designed to create the impression that t he origin of Christianity parallels the divine origin of Judaism . The forty years of wandering for Christianity was inspired by the foll owing passage from Joshua, which describes what happened to the I sraelites after the original Passover. The passage makes clear the logic behind the New Te stament authors' decision to establish the precise forty-ye ar interval between Jesus' death and the destruction of Masada. They wi shed to show not only that Christianity's origin paralleled Juda ism's, which proved it had replaced Judaism's special relationship with God, but also that the 70 C.E. destruction of Jerusalem had been divin ely ordained. The \"men of war were consumed because they obeyed n ot the voice of the Lord\"—exactly as had happened after the orig inal Passover.

In the Gos pel of John, Jesus' ministry is described as having encompassed three Passovers. These three Passovers are not mentioned in the Syno ptic Gospels. The author of John consciously establishes the date of Christ's death as occurring in the year 33 C.E. He does this becau se this is the only way possible, arithmetically, to create the correct alignment with the prophecies of Daniel and also to create a forty-yea r cycle between Jesus' resurrection and the end of the Jewish war. The works of Josephus have been deliberately config ured to demonstrate that the prophecies of Daniel culminate in the 70 C.E. destruction of Jerusalem—an understanding he shared with the writers of the Gospels. In order to prove that Rome had God's divine provid ence, the creators of Christianity provided \"evidence\" that t he 70 C.E. sack- ing of Jerusalem was foreseen by Daniel, the eviden ce being the \"his- tories\" of Josephus. In this way, all the important dates of Jesus' life were back-calculated to be in alignment with the de struction of Jerusalem. This is completely clear with regard to the beginning of his ministry and his resurrection. My conjecture is that Jesus' birth was also established at exactly seventy years befor e the siege of Jerusalem. Though scholars have given a number of e xplanations of how the year of Christ's birth was exactly seventy years from the destruction of Jerusalem, my analysis suggests that it was done to mimic the seventy years \"in the desolations of Jeru salem\" described in the Book of Daniel. In the first year of his reign Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the Lord c ame to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seve nty years in the desolations of Jerusalem. 191 "},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"284 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH The dates of Jesus' life were simply more \"pieces\" of Judaism chosen by the creators of Christianity to meet its logical and theo- logical requirements.

All these dates were calculated b ackward from the destruction of Jerusalem. They were chosen to fit i nto a pattern that combined the prophecies of Daniel and the life of M oses. The beginning of Jesus' ministry in 30 C.E. was cal culated to be exactly forty years from the day that the Romans un der Titus pitched camp outside Jerusalem, the \"Second Coming.\" This d ating system is not based upon the birth of a world-historical r eligious leader, but orients itself from the destruction of a city. Thus, the theological chronology created by the inv entors of Christianity ran in a forty-year cycle between Jesu s' resurrection and the fall of Masada. While this forty-year cycle was in motion, the other template for Christianity, the prophecies of Daniel, ran con- currently. In fact, Christianity's version of the prophecies o f Daniel was heading for its conclusion on the same day as its f orty-year cycle of wandering. In the following passage, notice that the day the R omans pitched camp at Jerusalem was the fourteenth of Nisan.

The two streams of theological support for Christianity , Moses and Daniel, have been fused. They are heading for a sim ultaneous con- clusion at Masada on the day Christianity replaces Judaism. Josephus outlines the symbolic landscape of his the ological coup by recording that the leader of the Jewish reb els at Masada was another Eleazar—who, as noted above, was a descenda nt of Judas the Galilean, and, like his ancestor, a leader of t he Sicarii. The New Testament and Josephus work together to cre ate a sub- tle but clear relationship between the families of Judas the Galilean, their Sicarii followers, and Jesus and his family a nd followers. This relationship has three central points. First, the New Testa- ment records that Jesus' family agreed to pay the R oman tax by going to Bethlehem to register in the census of Qui rinus. This places Jesus' family in direct opposition to Judas the Gal ilean because Jose- phus records that a certain Galilean named Judas prevailed with his c ountry- men to revolt; and said they were cowards if they w ould endure to pay a tax to the Romans and submit to mor tal men as their lords. . . 195 Second, the New Testament records that Judas the Is cariot (Sicarii), son of Simon the Iscariot, was responsib le for Jesus' cruci- fixion, thereby showing that the Sicarii are respon sible for Jesus' death.

This per fectly identifies the Sicarii as members of the \"wicked generation\" who J esus warned would be destroyed before the generation passed awa y. Masada brings an end to what Josephus describes as the \"fourth philosophy,\" a synonym for the Sicarii, the messian ic movement founded by Judas the Galilean. The suicide of the S icarii on this date was meant to represent \"atonement\" for their role i n crucifying Jesus forty years ago. By simultaneously concluding Chris tianity's forty years of wandering and the end of the \"fourth philo sophy,\" the mes- sianic movement Christianity replaced, Josephus is making the point that the future belongs to Christianity. And he was correct of course: the future did belong to Chris- tianity. By the midpoint of the second century C.E. , Judaism had been driven from its homeland and would never again be a signifi- cant threat to Rome. Josephus' recording of the fall of Masada contains many telling points: He reiterates that John, the Sicarii leader who was lampooned as the Apostle John, like the man from Gadara with the unclean spirit in the New Testament, filled the countryside with w ickedness.

Only the day Jose phus records for the conclusion of the siege of Masada would sim ultaneously complete the seven-year week that concludes the pro phecies of Daniel and the end of the symbolic forty-year \"wand ering\" of Chris- tianity after the resurrection of Jesus. Such a mir aculous occurrence could not happen by chance and supports the theory that Josephus has falsified history to show that Christianity was God's replacement for Judaism. Notice that the technique the authors of Christianity used is consistent throughout. Simon and John are t ransformed into Christian Apostles. The story of the Passover and E xodus becomes the first forty years of Christianity. Titus become s the Messiah. One must admire the craftsmanship of the intellectu als who produced the works of Josephus and the New Testamen t. Though the method they used, the fusing of Daniel's prophe cies with a new forty-year Exodus, was utterly preposterous from bo th a historical and a theological perspective, with it they were ab le to neatly remove from history a religious movement that oppos ed them mili- tarily and replace it with one aligned to their int erests. In doing so, they were able to conform history to theology to su ch an extent that one movement ended and the other came forth on the same day. It is interesting that the creators of Christianity did not pass along this theological fusion to the early Church f athers. There is no evidence that any of the early church fathers, with the possible exception of Eusebius, understood that the destruct ion of Masada represented the simultaneous conclusion of Christia nity's forty-year wandering and the prophecies of Daniel. The intelle ctuals who pro- duced Christianity were not to have their work appr eciated for 2,000 years.

This may have some bearing on a subject of interest but one that I will not cover in this work—this being, at what point did Ch ristianity lose the memory of its Roman origins?

An example of an early Christian scholar who did not understand the New Te stament's orig- inal intent was Origen, who was troubled by the nam e \"Jesus Barab- bas.\" On the other hand, Cesare Borgia, a fifteenth century Roman Catholic cardinal and a son of Pope Alexander VI (R odrigo Borgia) was quoted as saying, \"It has served us well, this myth of Jesus.\" The reader may find it interesting to see how Chris tianity's forty-year cycle of wandering was achieved. The Gos pel of John was created, among other reasons, to provide the necess ary point of ori- entation to begin the forty-year cycle. The date wa s determined by calculating backward. Josephus records that the destruction of Masada occ urred on the fifteenth of Xanthicus. This calamitous slaughter was made on the fifteenth day of the month Xanthicus . . . 197 Xanthicus is the Syrian word for Nisan. A typical s leight of hand by Josephus, not to be too obvious. Josephus also r ecords that the Jewish Passover was celebrated on the forteenth of Xanthicus/Nisan. When God revealed that with one more plague he woul d compel the Egyptians to let the Hebrews go, he comm anded Moses to tell the people they should have a sacrifi ce ready and should prepare themselves on the tenth day of t he month Xanthicus in readiness for the fourteenth (th is is the month that is called Pharmuthi by the Egyptians, an d Nisan by the Hebrews, but the Macedonians call it Xanthic us), and he should then lead away the Hebrews with all they had. 198 The Gospel of John differs from the Synoptics in it s dating because John describes three Passovers and thus giv es Jesus' min- istry a three-year span. The Synoptics describe onl y one Passover and thus do not reveal the year in which Jesus was crucified. The Gospel of John is also different from the Synop tics in that it describes Jesus' crucifixion as occurring on the day before Pass- over, whereas in the Synoptics Jesus is crucified o n Passover itself.

In the Gospel of John Jesus is \"slaughtered\" on the day before Passover, which is when the paschal lambs were actu ally killed. John's date is more symbolically correct because it makes Jesus the true \"lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of th e world.\" 199 The differences between the dates of Jesus' crucifi xion have always been attributed to the fact that each Gospel has a separate tradition. I, of course, would disagree and reitera te that while the four Gospels may have been produced by different in dividual schol- ars, they were under the control of a single editor who edited them where he saw fit. This is demonstrated by my analys is of the puzzle of the empty tomb (Chapter 6). Therefore, the differences in the dates of Jesus' c rucifixion are by design. That is, they show that there was more t han one \"Jesus,\" because no one can be crucified twice. In any event, the chronology in John has Jesus bein g crucified on the thirteenth of Nisan, the day before Passover . Therefore he would have \"arisen\" on the fifteenth of Nisan—the t hird day. Jose- phus must therefore date the mass suicide at Masada , the \"calami- tous slaughter\" that ended the Jewish rebellion, to the fifteenth of Nisan. Only with this date can he align Christianit y \"correctly.\" Eusebius, who quotes Josephus more often than any o f his con- temporaries, was aware of the forty-year cycle of p enance that Jose- phus recorded between Christ's crucifixion and the destruction at Masada. Concerning those calamities, then, that befell the whole Jewish nation after the Saviour's passion and after the words which the multitude of the Jews uttered, when they begged the release of the robber and murderer, but besought that the Prince of Life should be taken fr om their midst, it is not necessary to add anything to the a ccount of the historian (Josephus).

Divine Providence thus still proved itself long-suffering toward them in order to see w hether by repentance for what they had done they might obtain par- don and salvation; and in addition to such long-suf fering, Providence also furnished wonderful signs of the th ings which were about to happen to them if they did not repent. 200 As I have shown, numerous events in Josephus are da ted in a way that gives the reader the impression that they were foreseen by Daniel. The most important is the end of the \"daily sacrifice\" and the \"abominations of desolation\" described above. One m ight argue that Josephus did this for a reason other than providing a historical con- text for Jesus. Perhaps he simply wished to make th e Jews believe God had been responsible for their destruction. He ther efore overlaid Daniel's prophecies onto the events of 70 C.E. to c reate this effect. He was unaware of the similar claims found in the N ew Testament. It was just chance that the parallel came to exist. While I would regard this argument as improbable, it should at le ast be considered. However, such an argument cannot be made for Joseph us' estab- lishing dates that align with Christianity's mimicr y of the forty-year cycle of Exodus. If the New Testament and War of th e Jews were writ- ten independently, it would have been improbable th at their authors each recorded events demonstrating that the prophec ies of Daniel were coming to pass in the first century. However, for both authors to have accidentally recorded events that link the pre cise time sequences of the prophecies of Daniel with the precise time s equences of Exo- dus borders on the impossible. Either the New Testament and the works of Josephus both recorded a supernatural phenomenon (the unique blen d of Moses and Daniel) or they both deliberately falsified his tory to provide support for Christianity's replacement of Judaism. I have suggested above that the outline of Jesus' c hildhood was fictitious, copied from the life of Moses."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"294 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH There is another example of Jesus' fictitious child hood. In Luke's version of Jesus' childhood, Joseph takes his famil y out of Galilee to Bethlehem to register for the census. And it came to pass in those days that a decree wen t out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be regist ered. This census first took place while Quirinius was go v- erning Syria. So all went to be registered everyone to his own ci ty. Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city o f Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of Bethlehem, bec ause he was of the house and lineage of David. 201 The census of Quirinius was imposed on the area aro und Jerusalem, which was under Roman rule, and not on G alilee, which was part of the tetrarchy of Herod Antipas. At no t ime during the life of Jesus did the Romans raise tribute in Galilee. W hy then would Joseph voluntarily travel to Bethlehem with a pregn ant wife to reg- ister for a tax he was not required to pay? The passage also claims that Joseph went to Bethleh em because this was where the house of David registered. Schol ars have long understood that this claim is untrue, both because the genealogy is unknowable and because Augustus' decree would have been logisti- cally impossible to implement. As E. E Sanders wrot e, According to Luke's own genealogy David had lived 4 2 generations before Joseph. Why should Joseph have h ad to register in the town of one of his ancestors 42 gen erations earlier? What was Augustus—the most rational of the Cae- sars—thinking of? The entirety of the Roman Empire would have been uprooted by such a decree. Besides, how w ould any given man know where to go? No one could trace his genealogy for 42 generations, but if he could, he w ould find that he had millions of ancestors (one million is p assed at the twentieth generation). Further, David doubtless had tens of thousands of descendants who were alive at the time. Could they all identify themselves? If so, ho w would they all register in a little village?"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Building Jesus 295 We can be certain that the pragmatic Augustus would not have given a decree that would both uproot the entire Ro man Empire and be impossible to implement. Why then did the author of this Gospel include these false details? The reason is subtle a nd easy to miss. By traveling to Bethlehem, Joseph is agreeing to pay R oman taxes. I suggest that this detail occurs in the New Testamen t to ensure that the reader understands that the Messiah came from a family of loyal taxpayers. This also establishes Jesus the Galilean as a mirror oppo- site of Judas the Galilean, the inventor of the mys terious \"fourth philosophy of the Jews,\" the sect that rebelled aga inst Rome. Of course, to understand this point the reader must tu rn to Josephus. In response to the question of how many times a man should forgive his brother, Jesus responded by saying, \"un til seventy times seven.\" This is, of course, a reference to the amou nt of time that would pass before the destruction of Jerusalem and the \"abomina- tions of desolation\" that both Jesus and Daniel pre dicted. Jesus' response has often been mistakenly cited as an exam ple of his patience. Jesus would have known that this generati on would be destroyed. Jesus is saying that God's patience with the \"wicked gen- eration\" is over. The end is nigh. This comment by Jesus also shows that he is claimin g to be the Messiah that Daniel had envisioned, the \"son of God .\" It is easy to imagine how such dialogue was created. Once it was determined that the prophecies of Daniel were to be used as th e basis for the Messiah, it was simple enough to have Jesus recite quotes from Scripture that indicated his ability to see the fut ure. In spite of Jesus' reputation for original thought, there is very litt le among his sayings that does not paraphrase earlier prophets and philo sophers. Jesus placed great stress on the negative effects o f wealth and luxury. The theme is firmly embedded in the narrati ve of Jesus' birth, 202 in John the Baptist's advice about how to live, 203 in Jesus' keynote address in Luke's version of the beatitudes (6:20-26), 204 in much of the Lucan material, 205 and in the claim in Acts that the church practiced a \"community of goods.\" 206 Throughout the New Testament, Jesus is portrayed as struggling against a privileged establishment, whose represent atives are both"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"296 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH \"lovers of money\" 207 and highly trained in intellectual matters, like the syllogists and rhetoricians denounced by the St oic philosophers Seneca and Epictetus.

The Stoic philosopher Seneca (though immensely weal thy him- self) summarized his teaching as follows: We talk much about despising money, and we give adv ice on this subject in the lengthiest of speeches, that mankind may believe true riches to exist in the mind and no t in one's bank account, and that the man who adapts himself t o his slender means and makes himself wealthy on a little sum, is the truly rich man . . . Persius' description of the \"benefits\" of Stoic phi losophy make it clear who really benefitted from the underclass' s acceptance of it— the ruling class. Persius wrote: O poor wretches, learn, and come to know the causes of things, what we are, for what life we are born, wha t the assigned order is, where the turning point of the c ourse is to be rounded gently, what limit to set on money, f or what it is right to pray, what is the use of hard cash, how much you ought to spend on your country and on those near an d dear to you, what kind of man God ordered you to be and where as a man you are placed.

This is not a subject that comes to mind as essential for the son of God to touch up on during his brief stay on earth, but is obviously something alw ays in the minds of the imperial family.

For a master of slaves, Stoicism seems the ideal ph ilosophy because it advocates acceptance of \"what kind of man God or dered you to be and where as a man you are placed.\" Jesus' advocacy of principles similar to those of the Stoics led Bruno Bauer in t he nineteenth cen- tury to conclude that Christianity was simply an at tempt by the imperial family to implement Stoicism on a large sc ale. Bauer's suspicion regarding Christianity seems espe cially logical when one considers the degree to which the Roman Em pire relied upon slavery in the first century C.E., where perha ps 40 percent of the population were slaves. Slavery was also prevalent in Judea throughout the first century. No records survive to enable us to know exactly wha t percentage of the Judean population were slaves, but judging from the number of references to slavery within Hebraic literature fro m the period, it was clearly quite common. 208 Klausner wrote that slaves were an important factor in the political and spiritual upheavals in the time of Jesus.

It needs to be noted, how- ever, that if the slave died from his wounds, then the master would be put to death. Klausner wrote: \"Canaanitish slavery was then a hor rible plague affecting the national body of Israel as it was als o the case of other nations in those early days.\" 213 Someone addressing the common people in Judea durin g the first century C.E., as Jesus did, would have been s peaking to groups that contained slaves. Josephus specifically states that the Jewish rebels who were inspired by the hope of a militaris tic Messiah were \"slaves\" and \"scum.\" This was the historical contex t, according to the New Testament, within which Jesus was able to m ake numerous converts by preaching acceptance of one's master. In any event, Jesus' advocacy of accepting one's pl ight, and of pacifism, were certainly principles that the Flavia ns would wish to have taught within rebellious Judea. If one separat es from the words of Jesus the advice that was in the interest of the imperial family, all that remains are truisms, widely known philosophies , and snippets from previous Judaic writing.

The first thing that struck me after beginning this inquiry was that the re were simply too many characters in both works with the names Si mon, John, Judas, Eleazar (Lazarus), Matthias (Matthew), Josep h, Mary, and Jesus. If you consult the Dictionary of Scripture Proper N ames in Web- ster's Unabridged, you will find hundreds of Hebrew first names.

Matt. 13:55 The Maccabees were the creators of the Judea that R ome destroyed. For 376 years, from Zerubbabel to Jonath an Maccabaeus (537-161 B.C.E.), there had been only a negligible Jewish state. Many writers of this era were not even aware of the existence of Judea. The Greek historian Herodotus, painstakingly exact in his documentation of the nations and peoples of the kno wn world, refers only to the Syrians of Palestine (\"Philistia \") when he describes the area. But the embers of a Jewish national ident ity were never completely extinguished and in the second century B .C.E. the Mac- cabean family became the leaders of a movement that brought Eretz Israel (the land of Israel) back into existence. The Maccabees conquered the territories of Samaria, Galilee, Edom, and Moab and the cities of Gadara, Pella, Ger sa, Gamala, and Gaza. The inhabitants of any area the Maccabees con quered were forced to convert to Judaism and the males were cir cumcised. Those who refused were executed. The reign of the Maccabees ended in 37 B.C.E. when Herod, with Roman support, defeated Matthias Antigonus, th e last Mac- cabean king of Israel. The original Herod was not a Jew but an Edomite Arab. His authority was challenged by the r eligiously zeal- ous Jews who believed in the maintenance of a separ ate racial iden- tity. \"Whoso marries an Aramean woman, the Zealots lynch him.\" 217 The people of Israel dubbed Herod \"the Edomite slav e,\" refer- ring both to his slavish relationship with Rome and to his non-Jew- ish background. To many Jews, Herod and his descend ants were thus unacceptable as the kings of Israel. Josephus describes a mes- sianic movement that he calls the \"fourth philosoph y\" which was begun by Judas the Galilean (in the same year that Jesus was pur- portedly born), who led a rebellion against the Her ods and Rome that continued until the fall of Masada in 73 C.E.

John and Simon were the names of the \"Jewish tyrants\" who co ntrolled the rebels during the siege of Jerusalem. The movement ends at Masada when the Sicarii destroy themselves under the leade rship of some- one also named Eleazar, who was also identified as a descendant of Judas the Galilean. Josephus records the names of the leaders of the Je wish rebel- lion at its onset in 66 C.E. Josephus' list continu es the pattern of \"overusing\" Maccabean names and includes a John, a Matthias, an Eleazar (Lazarus), a Simon, and a Joseph (himself). Notably, there is also a Jesus. They also chose other generals for Idumea; Jesus, t he son of Sapphias, one of the high priests; and Eleazar, the son of Ananias, the high priest; they also enjoined Niger, the then governor of Idumea, who was of a family that belong ed to Perea, beyond Jordan, and was thence called the Per aite, that he should be obedient to those fore-named comm and- ers. Nor did they neglect the care of other parts o f the country; but Joseph the son of Simon was sent as ge neral to Jericho, as was Manasseh to Perea, and John, the Ess- cue, to the toparchy of Thamna; Lydda was also adde d to his portion, and Joppa, and Emmaus. But John, the s on of Matthias, was made governor of the toparchies of Go phnit- ica and Acrabattene; as was Josephus, the son of Ma tthias, of both the Galilees. Gamala also, which was the st rongest city in those parts, was put under his command. 218 Because the Maccabees were the royal family Herod d efeated, and were religious zealots, it is logical that they would have been a focus of those zealous Jews who rebelled against He rod's rule. Herod is also recorded as systematically killing members of the Maccabean family. It seemed to me, based on their persistent use of M accabean names, that the family of Judas the Galilean was de scended from the Maccabees, though this is not recorded by Josephus or in any other extant history. I have yet another reason for reach ing this conclu- sion. The discovery of the true identity of the Apo stles John and"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"306 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH Simon, as well as the original Messiah, Eleazar, ha d shown me that Josephus could deliberately have obfuscated their t rue identities to create the historical confusion in which Christiani ty was grafted onto the Sicarii movement. Therefore, if Josephus h ad omitted recording the fact that the family of Judas the Gal ilean was descended from the Maccabees, he would simply have been contin- uing this intentional obfuscation. Josephus and the authors of the New Testament turne d the Mac- cabean family, members of which had led the first-c entury revolt against Rome, into the Apostles and the family of J esus, the Messiah of peace, whom Rome had invented to replace the war rior Messiah of Maccabean Judaism. I suspect that within first-century Judea, the Macc abean family was regarded as messianic, and was similar to what is called a Caliphate throughout the Islamic world today—Caliph meaning \"successor\" in Arabic. Such a family needed to have a way of identi- fying its members, particularly its successors. The purpose of and theoveruse of Maccabean names, ad absurdum, in Jose phus and the New Testament was to interfere with this process an d, in the confu- sion, to graft Christianity onto the movement that centered on that family. The fact that there were messianic families in first-century Judea is borne out by a quote from Eusebius citing an earlier work by Hegesippus. Vespasian, after the capture of Jerusalem, issued a n order to ensure that no one who was of the royal stock sh ould be left among the Jews, that all the descendants of Da vid should be ferreted out and for this reason a furthe r wide- spread persecution was again inflicted upon the Jew s. 219 The previous quote shows that the Romans were indee d trying to eradicate at least one messianic family. Notice that the Messiah who was a problem for the Romans was identified as Jewish. Destroying the family from which this Messiah was s pawned is described as a continuation of the persecutions of the Jews. This shows that Rome oppressed a Jewish, not a Christian , messianic movement in the first century C.E."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"The Apostles and the Maccabees 307 Supporting the contention that Rome saw the family of Judas the Galilean as part of this messianic problem is t hat Josephus records that the \"world ruler,\" or Messianic prophe sies, were what most stirred the masses to revolt, and that the onl y family specifi- cally targeted for destruction by the Romans was th e family of Judas the Galilean. Notice in the following passage that Judas' sons are named James and Simon, just as two of the Apostles. And besides this, the sons of Judas of Galilee were now slain; I mean of that Judas who caused the people t o revolt, when Cyrenius came to take an account of the estate s of the Jews, as we have showed in a foregoing book. Th e names of those sons were James and Simon, whom Alexander commanded to be crucified. 220 Josephus also records that Judas' descendant \"Eleaz ar\" was in charge of the Sicarii at Masada in 70 C.E. when the \"fourth philoso- phy\" was finally destroyed. It seems clear that a f amily that had led messianic revolutionaries generation after generati on would have been the family from whom a Messiah would be expect ed. The passage above suggests that the Zealots saw the family of Judas the Galilean as a messianic family. However, the Maccabees were of the seed of Aaron and not of the family of David. If the fam- ily of Judas the Galilean were descendants of the M accabees, and therefore of Aaron, how could they have been seen a s messianic by the Jewish rebels? Though the son of David has come to be the Messiah' s epithet in both the Talmud and the New Testament, in the fi rst and second centuries C.E. many Jews looked to a Messiah other than the one \"coming\" from the family of David. Rabbi Akiba, for example, believed that Bar Kokhbah, the revolutionary Jewish leader of the second century C.E., was the true Messiah though no where was it claimed that he was of the house of David. More important is the fact that found among the Dea d Sea Scrolls were two works, the Damascus Document and T tt Rule, both of which describe a sect that looked forward to the appearance of a Messiah. In both works, this coming Messiah is desc ribed as a mem- ber of the family of Aaron."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"308 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH This is the exact statement of the statutes in whic h (they shall walk until the coming of the Messiah) of Aaro n and Israel who will pardon their iniquity. 221 They shall depart from none of the counsels of the Law . . . until there shall come the Prophet and the Me ssiahs of Aaron and Israel. . . 222 Each work also refers to the family of Aaron in a w ay that shows it to be in a position of leadership.

If this theory"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"The Apostles and the Maccabees 309 is correct, then the messianic movement of first-ce ntury Judea developed as a reaction against Rome, which had ous ted the Mac- cabees and replaced them with their puppets, the fa mily of Herod. The struggle of first-century Judea was akin to man y in Medieval Europe, in that it involved an ousted royal family seeking to return to power, a foreign government propping up an unpop ular king, and a dispute over religion. Jewish Zealots, hoping to restore the Maccabean fam ily, focused on those parts of their scripture that they believe d prophesied God's sending a Messiah who would restore Israel to a sov ereign Jewish state. The Book of Daniel, which does not specify w hich earthly fam- ily the Messiah was to come from, would have seemed especially apt because it foresees a \"son of God\" who helps to res tore Israel after a series of tribulations. The Zealots applied these p rophecies to the Maccabees. The Roman authors of War of the Jews, in order to t ransform the Maccabees from the messianic family of the Jews int o the founding family of Christianity, created an \"official\" histo ry, the War of the Jews, that contains an undifferentiated clump of individu als with Mac- cabean names. These individuals are described vario usly as robbers and false prophets. One of the purposes of War of t he Jews, therefore, was to obscure the real history of the \"five sons o f Matthias.\" Then, the Gospels graft Jesus and his four brothers , named Judas, /Simon, Joseph and James, his father, named Joseph, and his mother, named Mary, as well as his disciples, named Simon, Judas, John, Eleazar, and Matthew onto the history of the Maccabean fam- ily. By creating so many characters with Maccabean names, the authors of the New Testament and War of the Jews so ught to fool the uneducated into believing that Christianity had ori ginated from within the Maccabean family. This symbolic grafting of Christianity onto the mes sianic tradi- tion of the Maccabees was mirrored by an effort to physically graft the Herodian family onto the Maccabees. 225 Herod married Mariamme, a direct descendant of Mattathias, the founder of t he Maccabean dynasty. After she bore him four children, Herod ex ecuted her and her brother, thereby ensuring that only his Maccabe an children would remain."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"310 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH Throughout his works Josephus is very careful to av oid making any mention of the Messiah. He uses the word only t wice, both times in conjunction with Jesus, and never explains exact ly what the term means. Josephus mentions numerous messianic figures without ever referring to them as a Messiah or a Christ, calling them instead false prophets, robbers, or charlatans. For example, Jose phus uses these pejorative secular terms with a character named Thu edas (c. 45 C.E.), no doubt the same Thuedas mentioned in the New Test ament, who promised to lead his followers over dryshod like Jo shua before Jericho. In other words, he claimed to be able to \"part\" the water like Moses. Clearly he was an individual operating within a rel igious framework and not simply, as Josephus describes him, a robber . Josephus is reworking history again, this time excl uding from it the messianic aspirants who had led revolts against Rome during the first century C.E. He uses the name-switching trick to transform Messiahs into robbers. He is again making it diffic ult to trace the lin- eage of the real messianic family. The only messian ic lineage remain- ing after 70 C.E., according to the New Testament a nd Josephus, is that of Jesus, who, after endorsing Rome, left the planet. Even when Josephus applies a messianic prophecy to Vespasian he does not refer to the prophet directly, but rath er to the vision of some \"ambiguous oracle.\" I would argue that Josephu s' avoidance of the specific prophesies that predict the Messiah, a s well as of the term itself, is an example of how he deliberately b lurs the history of Judaism so that Christianity can, in the confusion, claim the history as its own. In this case he has blurred the identit y and intent of the Maccabean messianic aspirants of this era, leaving only the Messiah of Christianity visible. With his description of the death of Eleazar, a des cendant of Judas the Galilean, at Masada in 73 C.E., Josephus hoped not only to wipe from history the truth of the family that h ad stirred such opposition to Rome but actually to use its individu als and history as the \"rock\" upon which the new religion would be bui lt. The trans- formation of Simon and John above is just part of a deception on a huge scale, encompassing not just the history of a family, but also of an entire religion, for more than a century."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"The Apostles and the Maccabees 311 Christianity is the Sicarii movement of Judas the G alilean delib- erately blurred and transformed. The Romans transfo rmed the his- tory of the cult of the militant Maccabean Messiah into the history of Christianity. Robert Eisenman has pointed out a number of overlap s between the Sicarii movement and Christianity during the se cond half of the first century C.E. Both were messianic movements, b oth were in Judea during the same period, and both have engaged in missionary activities. More important is Eisenman's claim that the word \"Sicar- ios\" itself may be a \"quasi-anagram and a possible pejorative in Greek for the word \"Christian.\" 226 If true, this wordplay creating \"Christian\" from \"Sicarii\" would fit perfectly into the pattern of cre- ating Christianity out of the Sicarii movement. Josephus describes numerous \"Eleazars\" in War of th e Jews. I believe that attributes of these Eleazars, together with those of Lazarus in the New Testament, are intended to revea l the identity of the true Messiah. What is telling is that these Ele azars are so often described as the leaders of a messianic movement. J osephus begins this by stating that an Eleazar was responsible for the \"true begin- ning\" of the war. At the same time Eleazar, the son of Ananias the hi gh priest, a very bold youth, who was at that time gov ernor of the temple, persuaded those that officiated in the Divine service to receive no gift or sacrifice for any for eigner. And this was the true beginning of our war with the Rom ans; for they rejected the sacrifice of Caesar on this accou nt . . . 227 In the passage below notice that another Eleazar is described as the nephew of \"Simon the tyrant,\" who I have identi fied as the Apostle Simon. This supports the contention that a messianic family led the Jewish rebellion and the identities of thos e family members were transformed into the Apostles and Jesus. Of the seditious, those that had fought bravely in the former battles did the like now, as besides them did Eleaz ar, the brother's son of Simon the tyrant. But when Titus p erceived that his endeavors to spare a foreign temple turned to the"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"312 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH damage of his soldiers, and then be killed, he gave order to set the gates on fire. 228 Josephus identifies a Simon and a Judas as the sons of \"Jairus.\" An Eleazar is also identified as a member of this f amily, the Eleazar who is a \"tyrant\" at Masada and a descendant of Jud as the Galilean, and is also identified as a relative of Simon the t yrant (the Apostle Simon) above. A few there were of them who privately escaped to M asada, among whom was Eleazar, the son of Jairus, who was of kin to Manahem, and acted the part of a tyrant at M asada afterward. 229 This establishes the family of Jairus as part of th e family of Judas the Galilean, the true messianic family, and connec ts the Apostles to the family of Judas the Galilean, which connects th e Apostles to the family of Jairus that is found in the New Testament . The hopelessly cross-connected genealogy described above is deliberately difficult to follow. The overly comple x genealogies in the New Testament and Josephus serve both to prevent th e uneducated from understanding them as parodies of the Jews and to expand the general confusion over who the real members of the Maccabean family were—the confusion into which Christianity w as inserted. While Josephus has purposely made the genealogies d ifficult to fol- low, they were constructed to reveal—to the alert r eader—that the characters in the New Testament and War of the Jews are not only the same individuals but are all members of the same fa mily. All the Eleazars in the works of Josephus and all t he Lazaruses in the New Testament are lampoons of the real Eleaz ar, who was anointed as the Messiah by the Jewish rebels who de fended Jeru- salem in 70 C.E. The Eleazar who is \"a son of Jairu s\" and a \"descen- dant of Judas the Galilean,\" and who was the leader of the Sicarii at Masada, is also part of this construct. Supporting this is the fact that in the New Testament the daughter of someone also c alled Jairus, the \"ruler\" of a synagogue, is, like Lazarus, \"rais ed from the dead\" by Jesus.

The reader should appreciate just how small a circle we are dealing with here. It is a small circle because it is a single f amily. Knowing that the Apostles Jesus brings with him to witness the \"resurrection\" of Jairus' daughter are her relative s helps us to under- stand the real meaning of the passage. It is a lamp oon of a belief in the resurrection of the dead, a belief held by the followers of the messianic family. It is possible that this lampoon was based on a real incident, in which the Romans discovered members of the messianic family hidden in the subterranean caverns beneath J erusalem and Titus \"restored\" a young woman to life. Notice that in the passage Jesus instructs that the girl be given \"something t o eat,\" good advice if the cause of the child's illness is starvation. The daughter is another unnamed New Testament chara cter. I suspect that Josephus intends for the \"informed rea der\" to be able to guess her name, however. Since \"Eleazar\" is the son of Jairus and his sisters are named Mary and Martha, this suggests th at the \"resur- rected\" daughter of Jairus would have been yet anot her \"Mary,\" that is to say, a rebellious female. Josephus and the New Testament created a running jo ke about the many \"starving Marys\" during the war. The reade r will recall that Josephus describes how famine \"pierced through Mary 's very bowels\" in the chapter on \"The Son of Mary Whose Flesh Is E aten\" and that the \"Mary\" in the New Testament who is Jesus' mothe r was prophe- sied to one day be \"pierced through.\" Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairu s by name; and seeing him, he fell at his feet, and besought him, saying, \"My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well, and live.\" And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter an d James and John the brother of James. And when he had entered, he said to them, \"Why do y ou make a tumult and weep? The child is not dead but s leeping.\" And they laughed at him.

Mark 5:36-43 The passage from Josephus that describes Eleazar's scourging and miraculous escape from crucifixion, which I ana lyzed previously, is followed immediately in War of the Jews by Josep hus' description of the siege of Masada. In that story yet another E leazar convinces the Sicarii defenders of Masada to commit suicide r ather than risk being captured by the Romans. I regard Josephus' famous passage describing the ma ss suicide of the Jewish defenders as complete fiction. Joseph us was not inter- ested in recording history but in creating effectiv e propaganda. This is why, though there certainly were Sicarii who wer e besieged by the Romans at Masada, I do not believe that they slew t hemselves. I believe Josephus invented Eleazar's speech exhortin g the Jews to kill themselves to instill in the Jews and hoi polloi th e belief that suicide is noble when one is confronted with Roman force ma jure. \"Noble\" suicides of Jewish rebels run throughout the works of Josephus and it was hoped, no doubt, that they would counteract the courageous custom of the Jewish defenders, who fought down to the last man, and thus cost the imperial family more of its troop s. Notice that, as with the crucifixion of Jesus and the destruction o f the temple, it is the Jews, not the Romans, who are again \"responsibl e\" for the slaughter at Masada. It is likewise for symbolic purposes that Josephus places the final Eleazar, the descendant of Judas the Galilean , in the final act of the Roman conquest of the messianic movement. It ma kes the con- clusion of his fictitious history the completion of one era and the beginning of another—that is, the end of Maccabean Judaism and the beginning of Christianity."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"The Apostles and the Maccabees 315 With the death of this final Eleazar, Josephus is b ringing an end to the messianic family of Judas the Galilean and i ts messianic movement, the \"fourth philosophy,\" or the Sicarii. . . . There was but one only strong hold that was s till in rebellion. This fortress was called Masada. It was one Eleazar, a potent man, and the commander of these S icarii, that had seized upon it. He was a descendant from t hat Judas who had persuaded abundance of the Jews, as w e have formerly related, not to submit to the taxatio n when Cyrenius was sent into Judea to make one; 230 Just as Eleazar's death brings an end to his family and their \"phi- losophy,\" it also heralds the beginning of another family and another philosophy. Josephus concludes his description of t he battle of Masada by claiming that, somehow, one group did survive th e mass suicide. So these people died with this intention, that they would not leave so much as one soul among them all alive to b e sub- ject to the Romans. Yet was there an ancient woman, and another who was of kin to Eleazar, and superior to most women in prudence and learning, with five children, who had concealed themselves in caverns under ground, a nd had carried water thither for their drink, and were hidden there when the rest were intent upon the slaughter of one another. 231 As shown in the Building Jesus chapter, the date of the slaugh- ter at Masada, the fifteenth of Nisan 73 C.E., is m eant to be under- stood as the ending of Christianity's forty years o f wandering and thus the beginning of its dominion over the land of Israel and its replacement of Judaism. It is easy to see that with in the symbolic landscape that Josephus has created the \"five child ren\" mentioned in the passage above, who are \"kin to Eleazar,\" are to be understood as the founders of the Christian dynasty. Josephus, who had begun War of the Jews with the de scription of the beginning of a dynasty, the Maccabees—\"Accor dingly Mat- thias armed himself, together with his own family, which had five"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"316 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH sons . . .\" 232 —ends his work with the beginning of another dynast y that starts with a woman who was kin to Eleazar and \"five children.\" Their names are not given.

They are the new dynasty, re ady to enter the Promised Land that has been given to them by \"God.\" Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joseph, and Simo n, and Judas? 233 Though Josephus symbolically converted the Maccabee family to Christianity at Masada, the Messianic rebellions centering on that family apparently continued until the defeat of Sim on Bar Cochba in 135 C.E. Bar Cochba means \"son of the star.\" Simon was so nick- named because of the \"star\" prophecy of Judaism tha t looks to a Messiah, the same prophecy that the New Testament c laims for Jesus. On the coins minted by the Jewish rebels during the ir 132-135 C.E. revolt, only two individuals are celebrated. One co in is dedicated to Bar Cochba and its inscription reads \"Simeon, princ e of Israel.\" The other individual so commemorated is Eleazar. His co in reads \"Elea- zar the priest.\" 234 The coins present the same dichotomy that exists in the New Testament and War of the Jews—that is, b etween a mili- tary leader named Simon and a spiritual one named E leazar. Rome's struggle with \"Simon\" and \"Eleazar\" evidently conti nued even after the family's \"extinction\" at Masada. Since Jesus' ministry lampoons the Jews by drawing darkly comic parallels with Titus' campaign through Judea, it seems logical that there would also be a lampoon of the twelve Ap ostles within War of the Jews. In this way the symmetry between t he two works would be maintained. I assumed that the lampoon wou ld involve a technique similar to the identity-switching used to transform the Jewish rebel leaders Simon and John into Christians .

Upon this speech of Titus, the rest of the multitud e were affrighted at so great a danger.

There followed him eleven others, and no more, that re- solved to imitate his bravery; but still this was t he principal person of them all, and went first, as excited by a divine fury. And now one cannot but complain here of fortune, as still envious at virtue, and always hindering the p erform- ance of glorious achievements: this was the case of the man before us, when he had just obtained his purpos e; for he then stumbled at a certain large stone, and fell down upon it headlong, with a very great noise. 235 A second assault is made and again Josephus refers to the num- ber twelve, though this time he adds to it.

In the following segme nt notice that get- ting into the temple would \"begin\" the Romans' enti re conquest, a phrase reminiscent of \"completing the calamities of the Jews\" in the Son of Mary chapter. Then did the seditious of both the bodies of the Je wish army, as well that belonging to John as that belong ing to Simon, drive them away; and indeed were no way want ing as to the highest degree of force and alacrity; for they esteemed themselves entirely ruined if once the Rom ans got into the temple, as did the Romans look upon th e same thing as the beginning of their entire conquest.

The first point I want to make is that th e two confusing passages in which Josephus describes those who \"sig nalized\" them- selves are a puzzle. The reader who \"solves\" it wil l recognize that the lists describe the twelve individuals who were figh ting to preserve the temple. In other words, when the two lists of Jews who \"sig nalized\" themselves are combined and the duplications are ca ncelled out, there are left four Simons, two Judases, John and J ames, as well as Alexas, Gyphtheus, Malachias, and Sosas. Eight have the names of Apostles and four do not, for a total list of twelv e individuals. Readers may go through this confusing process for themselve s if they wish.

He presents the list of these individuals between t he two lists nam- ing the twelve Jews who \"signalized\" themselves in battle. This new list names those Jews who deserted to the Romans in the midst of the battle. Notice that we have another \"five sons of Matthias.\" ... of whom were the high priests Joseph and Jesus, and of the sons of high priests three, whose father was Ishmael, who was beheaded in Cyrene, and four sons of Matthi as, as also one son of the other Matthias . . . 242 Joseph, Jesus, and Matthias are, of course, all nam es associated with Christianity. \"Matthias\" is not only the name of one of the authors of a Gospel (Matthew) but the name of the d isciple who replaced Judas as one of the twelve Apostles. In ad dition to these three, Josephus' lists include five sons of Matthia s, a Joseph, and a Jesus. The \"five sons of Matthias\" are meant to be understood as the five sons of the founder of the Maccabean dynasty—t hat is, Judas, Simon, John, Eleazar (Lazarus), and Jonathan. Of co urse, as Jose- phus relates it, these \"five sons of Matthias\" are quite different from the original \"five sons of Matthias\" in that they h ave defected to Caesar. However, the point of the joke Josephus is making here is that these five sons of Matthias have the same name s as the original five sons of Matthias. Thus, the \"five sons of Matthias\" who deserted to t he Romans and the twelve \"signalized\" Jewish rebels contain n ames that overlap. The overlapping names are those of both Apostles an d the sons of Matthias Maccabee—Judas, Simon, John, and Eleazar. The list of those who deserted to the Roman side also contain b oth a Jesus and a Joseph, which are both names from Christianity.

The complex confusion about identity is a spoof on how the Romans created the Apostles a nd inserted them into the temple (Judaism) by transforming the history of the Maccabees into the \"history\" of Christianity. ... for the great confused noise that was made on b oth sides hindered them from distinguishing one another 's voices, as did the darkness of the night hinder the m from the like distinction by the sight. . .

The name Malachi is Hebrew for \"my messenger\" and w as a syn- onym for the prophet Elijah. This meaning comes fro m the Book of Elijah, in which God states, \"Behold, I send my mes senger (Malachi) who shall prepare the way before me.\" Elijah (Malac hi) was believed by the messianic Jews rif the first century C.E. to be about to return to earth as a forerunner of the Messiah. 244 The authors of the New Testament created John the B aptist to be Christianity's Elijah, that is, the messenger wh o heralded the Messiah's \"coming.\" \"Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?\" Jesus answered and said to them, \"Indeed, Elijah is coming first\" Matt. 17:11 Like Elijah, John is said to have worn a leather gi rdle and a \"cloak of hair.\" 245 Like Elijah, John also lived by the banks of the Jordan near Jericho. 246 The last of the Books of the Prophets is the"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"324 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH Book of Malachi. As scholars have long recognized, the authors of the Gospels used that book, with its apocalyptic sa yings of a mes- sianic forerunner, as the basis for John the Baptis t's descriptions of a Day of Judgment. In the Book of Malachi it states, Behold the day cometh, burning like a furnace and a ll the proud and they that do wickedly are stubble and the day shall cometh that shall set them aflame, and the Lo rd of Hosts, and shall not leave them root and branch. 247 The author of the Gospel of Matthew makes John the Baptist paraphrase Malachi: The axe is already laid to the root of the tree and every tree that bringeth not forth fruit is hewn and cast into the midst of the fire . . . and his fan is in his hand and he shall winnow his threshing-floor and gather wheat into his garne r and the chaff he shall burn with unquenchable fire. 248 However, John adds his own political perspective to Malachi, warning those who believe they have nothing to fear from the Day of Judgment because they are the \"children of Abrah am, Isaac, and Jacob\"—that is, the Jews—should be aware that their \"Jewishness\" does not make them safe. John states (with a play o n words) \"God is able from these stones (abanim) to raise up chil dren (banim) unto Abraham.\" John the Baptist thus shares with Jesus a \"vision\" of a coming apocalypse for the Jews. From my perspective , however, the more important point is that John is saying that \"G od\" can create \"Jews\" at will, the same idea that Josephus is rela ting with the story of the battle of the temple, during which \"the posi tions of the men were undistinguished on both sides, and they fought at random, the men being intermixed one with another.\" Abanim and banim con- tinues the wordplay regarding \"son\" and \"stone\"—tha t is, ben and eben—that exists in the New Testament and War of th e Jews.

Since a \"Jesus\" is also a charact er in the passage, the identity of the Messiah he is coming before see ms obvious. The logic of the lampoon suggests that the \"Jesus\" on t he Roman list switches himself with his \"forerunner\" at the same time that his \"Apostles\" switch themselves with their Jewish name sakes. My analysis suggests that the Maccabees were insert ed into Christianity in the first century C.E. They were al so somehow extracted from Judaism at the same time. One needs to look into the Book of the Maccabees to read of its origin. Since the Romans inserted the Maccabees in Christia nity, it is at least logical to wonder if they also removed them f rom Judaism, which was being reestablished at about the same tim e. As Eisenman points out in James the Brother of Jesus, Rabbi Yoh anan ben Zacchai is described in the Talmud as having worked to rees tablish a form of Judaism after the 70 C.E. holocaust. He worked at a n academy at Yavneh, established with the authorization of Rome.

This account is a satire of yet another Roman battle rec orded in War of the Jews. Though this battle took place before Titus be gan his campaign at the Sea of Galilee, the authors of the Gospels w ished to make a comment about it. They therefore needed—in order to keep Jesus' ministry and Titus' campaign sequential—to identify it as having occurred before Jesus' ministry began. They achieve d this by having Jesus note that \"my hour has not yet come\" (John 7: 6). In other words, that the event took place before Jesus had o fficially started his ministry in Judea. At Mount Gerizzim the Gospel of John provides an ac count in which Jesus describes himself as \"living water.\" As I have stated, Jesus' self-designations are all darkly comic when juxtaposed with events from the war with Rome that occurred at the same location. Jesus said to her, \"Give me a drink.\" For his disci ples had gone away into the city to buy food. The Samaritan woman said to him, \"How is it that you, a Jew, ask a drin k of me, a woman of Samaria?\" For Jews have no dealings with S amar- itans.

You have spoken the tr uth in saying that.\" \"Sir,\" replied the woman, \"I see that you are a Pro phet.

The following passage from Josephus is t he basis for the irony inherent in Jesus referring to himself as \"li ving water.\" Nor did the Samaritans escape their share of misfor tunes at this time; for they assembled themselves togethe r upon the mountain called Gerizzim, which is with them a holy mountain, and there they remained;...

It is also the only time Jesus refers to himself as \"living water.\" Because in the same pass age Jesus foresees the dual destruction of Jerusalem and Gerizzim, a s ingular event in history, we can be sure of the linkage between this prophecy and the coming war with Rome. In other words, when Jesus sa ys \"the time is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jeru salem will you worship the father . . .\" he is clearly referring t o the \"time\" of their mutual destruction. The only time when both cities were simulta- neously destroyed was during the war with Rome. The refore, we are logically on solid ground to understand that Jesus' vision on Mount Gerizzim is related to the coming war with Rome. If we accept the premise that Jesus' prophecies reg arding Ger- izzim and Jerusalem are related to their coming des truction in the war with Rome, his claim to be \"living water\" for the i nhabitants of Ger- izzim can be understood as foreseeing their lack of water during the Roman siege. Such a self-designation by Jesus, in t his context, may seem innocent enough. However, if we accept that Je sus' description of himself as \"living water\" is related to the Sama ritans dying of thirst on Mount Gerizzim, this verifies my premise regarding Jesus' claim to be \"living bread\"—that is, that it relates to the practice of cannibalism during the siege of Jerusalem. Consider how someone living in the Flavian court in 80 C.E. would have reacted to Jesus choosing Mount Gerizzim as the place to describe himself as \"living water.\" Clearly, suc h an individual, knowing that the Jewish rebels died of thirst on Mo unt Gerizzim, would have found Jesus' self-designation \"living wa ter\" on Gerizzim darkely humorous. In fact, it is self-evident that members of the Fla vian court would have seen all of Christ's self-designations—\"fisher of men,\" \"living bread,\" \"living water,\" \"the stone,\" and \"the templ e\" as ironic because of the locations where he used them. It is unlikely that such a par- ticular brand of humor would occur constantly by ch ance—and the fact that it does occur consistently supports the c ontention that the gospels were created to be understood, on one level , as a mockery of the Jews that specifically relates to Roman militar y victories in Judea."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"The Samaritan Woman and Other Parallels 329 I now want to broaden my analysis here and present a number of other parallels that I am not going to analyze i n any detail.

Since the New Testament and t he works of Josephus cover the same areas and time frames, ther e is nothing unusual in the fact that events and characters appe ar in both works. However, if it can be shown that Josephus had a kee n awareness of Christianity, this has implications. Much of the comedy that the two works create is virtually self-evident. To demo nstrate that Jose- phus was lampooning Christianity in the passage reg arding the son of Mary whose flesh was eaten, for example, it is o nly necessary to prove that Josephus was aware of Christianity as he wrote the story During the time that Josephus was writing War of th e Jews and Jewish Antiquities, the Flavian family was clearly involved with Christianity. This suggests that Josephus, both a h istorian and a the- ologian, would have been familiar with the religion and its symbols.

Matt. 2:2-16 Josephus records a parallel event. Now there was a certain sect of Jews who valued the mselves highly for the skill they had in the ways of their fathers and who believed they best observed the laws favored by God— the sect called the Pharisees—by whom the women of the palace were guided. They were fully able to deal su ccess- fully with the king due to their prescience, but of ten fell into fighting and setting up obstacles to him. For example, when all the Jewish people pledged the ir loyalty to Caesar and to the king's government, the se men, over six thousand of them, refused to swear; and wh en the king therefore imposed a fine on them, the wife of Pheroras [the king's brother] paid it. Now to repay this kin dness of hers, being believed to have, by Divine inspiration , the fore- knowledge of things to come, they foretold that God had decreed that Herod's government would be taken from him and from his descendants, and that the kingdom woul d come to her and Pheroras and to their children. These predictions, which did not escape detection b y Salome [the king's sister], were reported to the ki ng, and also that they had subverted some others of the pal ace. So the king killed those of the Pharisees principally involved, as well as Bagoas the eunuch, and a certain Karos, who exceeded all of his peers in beauty and was his fav orite boy. He also killed everyone of his own house who had al lied themselves to the talk of the Pharisees. Bagoas had been elated by their prediction that he would be hailed as the father and the benefactor of the one who would be t heir appointed king; for to this king would fall power o ver all things, and he would provide Bagoas with a marriage and the ability to sire children of his own line. 253 "},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"332 C AESAR ' S M ESSIAH The passage above from Josephus has clear parallels to the nativity story given in Luke and Matthew.

Herod 's reaction in both is to \"slaughter the innocents.\" Josephus desc ribes the new king as someone who will have \"the power over all t hings.\" It is more important, however, that both stories involve a miraculous birth by someone normally assumed to be incapable o f having chil- dren—in the New Testament it is a virgin, in Joseph us a eunuch. This parallel between the Virgin Mary and the eunuc h Bagoas is the beginning of parallel sequences of events in th e New Testament and War of the Jews.

Though unseen for 2,000 years, the path to understa nding the real meaning of the Gospels is a clear one. The fir st step is simply recognizing that Jesus was created as a typological figure. This is established at the beginning of the Gospels, in Mat thew, where the life of Moses, the first savior of Israel, was used as a type for Jesus, the second savior of Israel.

However, the fact tha t the authors of the Gospels created Jesus as a typological character st rongly supports the thesis that the linkage I show in this work bet ween Jesus and Titus was also created deliberately. Let us suppose that a criminal is known to commit his crimes with a very unusual weap on—say, a bowling ball. A crime scene where the victim is cru shed by a bowl- ing ball would strongly suggest the same perpetrato r. The same kind of evidence weighs against the authors of the Gospe ls. It is implau- sible that one of the few groups that ever knowingl y used typology would have also created the only accidentally typol ogical relation- ships in all of literature. Even if Jesus were not an obvious typological chara cter, the rela- tionship between his ministry and Titus' campaign w ould, in and of itself, prove that one was based on the other. The parallels between the ministry and the campaign of the two \"sons of G od\" do not merely occur in the same locations, but in the same sequence. This is the clearest proof that Titus left for us—proof he left so we would see that he had succeeded in his efforts to make th e Jews call him \"Lord,\" proof he left that he had become the Christ that Christian- ity would worship for thousands of years. To see the relationship between Jesus and Titus, al l that is needed is to view Jesus' ministry as it relates to the war between the Romans and the Jews. Though this perspective has been over looked by his- torians, it is one that should be studied for sever al reasons. First, because Jesus stated that all his prophecies would be fulfilled before the \"wicked generation\" of Jews passed away. To Jew s of this era a generation was forty years in length, and Titus' wa r against the mes- sianic Jews came to an end, \"miraculously,\" forty y ears to the day after Jesus' resurrection. Therefore, the Gospels s hould be read in the context of the war—this was literally the instr uction that Jesus gave us. Further, the victors write history. Since the Flavians were the victors in their war with the messianic movemen t in Judea, all the histories relating to that era, including the G ospels, should be scrutinized to determine if the Flavians produced t hem.

The Parallels The relationship between Jesus and Titus begins on Mount Ger- izzim, where Jesus calls himself \"living water\" on the same spot where Jews would later die of thirst during the war . Because Titus has not received control over the army when that ba ttle occurs, the authors of the Gospels have Jesus announce that \"my time has not yet come\"—in other words, that his ministry had not yet begun—to maintain the parallelism between his ministry and T itus' campaign. Jesus then begins his ministry at the Sea of Galile e, where he gathers in his disciples, who he calls \"fishers of men.\" Titus also has the \"onset\" of his campaign at the same location, w here his \"disci- ples\" become \"fishers of men\" by spearing Jews as t hey attempt to swim for safety after the Romans sink their boats. Jesus next encounters a possessed man at Gadara who unleashes a \"legion\" of demons that possess a herd of swine a nd rush wildly into the Jordan river. Titus has a strangely parall el experience at Gadara, where one \"demonically possessed\" man unlea shed a legion of \"demons\"—that is, the Sicarii—who infect a herd of \"swine\"— that is, Jewish youth. The combined group is then c hased by the Romans and rushes \"like the wildest of beasts\" into the Jordan river. Following the Gadara encounter, the \"son of Mary\" t ravels to Jerusalem where he informs his disciples that they will one day \"eat of his flesh.\" This prophecy comes to pass when a \" son of Mary\" is eaten by his mother during Titus' siege of Jerusale m. The Gospels next describe two assaults on the Mount of Olives, one in which a naked man escapes and another in whi ch the Mes- siah is captured. These episodes parallel events on the Mount of Olives during Titus' siege of Jerusalem, where a \"n aked\" man— Titus—escapes, and a Messiah is captured. The pair of Mount of Olives assaults is followed in both the Gospels and Titus' campaign by a description of thr ee crucified men, one of whom miraculously survives.

The Daniel-Moses Combination This work has shown that, without question, Josephu s manipulated the dates of events to create the impression that t he prophecies of Daniel were coming to pass in the first century C.E . In doing so, Josephus, accidentally or otherwise, provided a fic titious historical context for Jesus, who claimed to be the Messiah th at Daniel had envisioned. The authors of the Gospels also inserted numerous p arallels with the life of Moses into their story of Jesus so as to make it appear that he was, like Moses, the founder of a new, divi nely inspired reli- gion. Josephus linked his history to this theme by recording that the war with the Jews came to an end forty years to the day after Jesus' resurrection. In doing so, he created the impressio n that Christianity had mirrored Judaism's forty years of wandering fol lowing the orig- inal Passover. Only by concluding the war on that d ate, the fifteenth of Nisan, 73 C.E., could Josephus have simultaneous ly \"fulfilled\" both the seven-year cycle of tribulation envisioned by D aniel—the pre- cise length of the war—and completed Christianity's mirroring of the events following the original Passover.

The Puzzle of the Empty Tomb My reading of the combined story of Jesus' resurrec tion is perhaps the clearest proof of the Flavian origin of Christi anity. This is be- cause the story was designed to be a way of proving beyond a doubt that creating the Gospels as satire was the real in tent of its authors. This proof also has the advantage of being, if inco rrect, so easy to disprove. Experts in probability can either confirm or deny the con- clusions in this work and the truth will out. This work was in no way created as a criticism of t he faith of contemporary Christians. I felt required to present my findings because of the light they shed on the origin and pu rpose of both anti-Semitism and the moral structure of Western so cieties. I realize that some will find the conclusions of th is work disori- enting. Symbols long thought to have been based on Christian love may really be images of Roman conquest. Even the be lief that our culture is Judeo-Christian may be incorrect, in tha t it may have been completely shaped by Roman \"religious\" influence. M ost unnerving to me is this question: What would Western civiliza tion be like if, instead of emerging from the Christian tradition, i t had emerged from a culture that worshiped strength and scorned weakness? It is also hard to accept that so many have missed the obvious clues left by the creators of Christianity to infor m us of the true ori- gin of the religion. While many of the puzzles are difficult to see and solve, it is simply amazing that no one has noticed heretofore that Titus' campaign had a conceptual outline parallel t o Jesus' ministry. This is not a difficult thing to see and should hav e been common knowledge centuries earlier. Homo sapiens failed to earn its title in this instance. Though Christianity may have begun as a cruel joke, it has become the basis for much of humankind's moral prog ress. I present this work with great ambivalence, but truth is a wh ole, and no part should be hidden.

He was appointed assistant to Sir Isaac Newton in 1 701 and published an edition of Euclid for student use at that time. In 1703 he suc ceeded Newton as Lucasian pro- fessor. He fell out with Newton over their differen t interpretations of the Bible. Whiston's cosmology conflicted with Newton's in tha t he believed that God directly intervened in the lives of men, an understanding th at he obtained from his readings of Josephus, whose works he translated. His English translation of Josephus is still in print and is the translation used throughout thi s work. 136. R. Brown, Christ's Second Coming, Will it be Pre-mi llennial? 1858, p 435 137.
