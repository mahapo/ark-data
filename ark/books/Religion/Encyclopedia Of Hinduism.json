The volumes have been constructed in an A-to-Z format to provide a handy guide to the major terms, concepts, people, events, and organizations that have, in each case, transformed the religion from its usually modest beginnings to the global force that it has become. Each of these religions began as the faith of a relatively small group of closely related eth- nic peoples. Each has, in the modern world, become a global community, and, with one nota- ble exception, each has transcended its beginning to become an international multiethnic com- munity. Judaism, of course, largely defines itself by its common heritage and ancestry and has an alternative but equally fascinating story. Surviving long after most similar cultures from the ancient past have turned to dust, Judaism has, within the last century, regathered its scattered people into a homeland while simultaneously watching a new diaspora carry Jews into most of the contempo- rary world’s countries. Each of the major traditions has also, in the modern world, become amazingly diverse. Bud- dhism, for example, spread from its original home in India across southern Asia and then through Tibet and China to Korea and Japan. Each time it crossed a language barrier, something was lost, but something seemed equally to be gained, and an array of forms of Buddhism emerged. In Japan alone, Buddhism exists in hundreds of different sect groupings. Protestantism, the newest of the six traditions, began with at least four different and competing forms of the religious life and has since splintered into thousands of denomina- tions. At the beginning of the 19th century, the six religious traditions selected for coverage in this series were largely confined to a relatively small part of the world. Since that time, the world has changed dramatically, with each of the traditions moving from its geographical center to become a global tradition. While the traditional religions of many countries retain the allegiance of a majority of the population, they do so in the presence of the other traditions as growing minorities. Other countries—China being a prominent example— have no religious majority, only a number of minorities that must periodically interface with one another.

In creating these encyclopedias, the attempt has been made to be comprehensive if not exhaus- tive. As space allows, in approximately 800 entries, each author has attempted to define and explain the basic terms used in talking about the religion, make note of definitive events, introduce the most prominent figures, and highlight the major organizations. The coverage is designed to result in both a handy reference tool for the religious scholar/specialist and an understandable work that can be used fruitfully by anyone—a student, an informed lay person, or a reader simply want- ing to look up a particular person or idea. Each volume includes several features. They begin with an essay that introduces the particular tradition and provides a quick overview of its his- torical development, the major events and trends that have pushed it toward its present state, and the mega-problems that have shaped it in the con- temporary world. A chronology lists the major events that have punctuated the religion’s history from its origin to the present. The chronologies differ somewhat in emphasis, given that they treat two very ancient faiths that both originated in prehistoric time, sev- eral more recent faiths that emerged during the last few millennia, and the most recent, Protestantism, that has yet to celebrate its 500-year anniversary. The main body of each encyclopedia is consti- tuted of the approximately 800 entries, arranged alphabetically. These entries include some 200 biographical entries covering religious figures of note in the tradition, with a distinct bias to the 19th and 20th centuries and some emphasis on leaders from different parts of the world. Special attention has been given to highlighting female contributions to the tradition, a factor often overlooked, as religion in all traditions has until recently been largely a male-dominated affair. Geographical entries cover the development of the movement in those countries and parts of the world where the tradition has come to dominate or form an important minority voice, where it has developed a particularly distinct style (often signaled by doctrinal differences), or where it has a unique cultural or social presence. While religious statistics are amazingly difficult to assemble and evaluate, some attempt has been made to estimate the effect of the tradition on the selected countries. In some cases, particular events have had a determining effect on the development of the different religious traditions. Entries on events such as the St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre (for Protestantism) or the conversion of King Asoka (for Buddhism) place the spotlight on the fac- tors precipitating the event and the consequences flowing from it. The various traditions have taken form as communities of believers have organized struc- tures to promote their particular way of belief and practice within the tradition. Each tradition has a different way of organizing and recognizing the distinct groups within it. Buddhism, for example, has organized around national subtraditions. The encyclopedias give coverage to the major group- ings within each tradition. Each tradition has developed a way of encoun- tering and introducing individuals to spiritual reality as well as a vocabulary for it. It has also developed a set of concepts and a language to discuss the spiritual world and humanity’s place within it. In each volume, the largest number of entries explore the concepts, the beliefs that flow from them, and the practices that they have engendered. The authors have attempted to explain these key religious concepts in a nontech- nical language and to communicate their meaning and logic to a person otherwise unfamiliar with the religion as a whole. Finally, each volume is thoroughly cross- indexed using small caps to guide the reader to related entries. A bibliography and comprehen- sive index round out each volume. —J.

Moreover, alter- nate spellings of Hindu terms and names are in com- mon use throughout the English-speaking world. We have chosen in most cases to cite the aca- demically accepted and/or current spellings, even though these spellings may not be the same as com- mon usage and/or historical usage. For example, the name of one wife of Shiva, the goddess Minakshi, is popularly rendered Meenakski, while scholars predominantly favor the former spelling. Also, a number of variations appear over time in the names of cities, so that Banaras is now commonly spelled Benares. Similarly, the honorific Sri is also spelled Shri, Shrii, and Shree. When proper names such as these appear in published volumes in bibliographi- cal citations in this volume, the spelling follows the Library of Congress listing exclusively. Con- sequently, there often appear differences between spellings of names in text entries and spellings in the further reading associated with those entries. Another point of possible confusion is current alternate spellings of Hindu terms such as san- nyasi and sannyasin (meaning renunciant), which are synonymous. A closely related term, sannyas , is the vow that sannyasis or sannyasins take to enter into their lives of austerity. In the last 20 years, the names of several important cities in India have been changed to their historical pre-British names. In this work, names of cities are generally left in the form found in the scholarly literature of the period. In most instances present-day changes are indicated in the text, such as Madras (Chennai), Bombay (Mumbai), Benares (Varanasi), and Calcutta (Kolkata). Due to the dissemination of Hindu ideas in the West, many terms have become part of the English language and are not italicized to indi- cate that they are foreign words. For example, atman, bhakti, karma, maya, mudra, nirvana, and various types of yoga (such as hatha, jnana, ashtanga, and siddha yoga) are treated as En glish words. note on terms and spelling K i-xL-hindu-fm.indd xv 12/14/06 1:02:36 AM"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"i-xL-hindu-fm.indd xvi 12/14/06 1:02:36 AM"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"xvii The Origins of Hinduism Until the 19th century, Hinduism was consid- ered the indigenous religion of the subcontinent of India and was practiced largely in India itself and in the places where Indians migrated in large numbers. In the 21st century, while still centered in India, Hinduism is practiced in most of the world’s countries and can thus rightly be consid- ered a world religion. Its creation, unlike that of some world religions founded by known historical leaders, reaches into prehistory; we do not know the individuals who first practiced the religion (or set of religions that have merged to constitute present-day Hinduism) nor know exactly when its earliest forms emerged. Hindu is a term from the ancient Persians. The Sindhu River in what is now Pakistan was called the “Hindu” by the Persians (the first textual men- tion occurred perhaps in the last centuries before the Common Era [ C . E .]). The people who lived in proximity to the Sindhu therefore came to be called Hindus. In academic terms the Hindu tradition, or Hinduism, is usually referred to as Brahmanism in its earlier phase, before circa 300 B . C . E ., and referred to as Hinduism after that. In common usage, the term Hinduism is used for the entire span of the tradition. For at least two reasons the Hindu tradition contains the greatest diversity of any world tradi- tion. First, Hinduism spans the longest stretch of time of the major world religions, with even the more conservative views setting it as well over 3,000 years old. Throughout this expanse of time, the Hindu tradition has been extremely conserva- tive about abandoning elements that have been historically superseded. Instead, these elements have often been preserved and given new impor- tance, resulting in historical layers of considerable diversity within the tradition. Second, Hinduism has organically absorbed hundreds of separate cultural traditions, expressed in as many as 300 languages. As a result, Hindu tradition is meta- phorically like the Grand Canyon gorge, where the great river of time has sliced through the land- scape, leaving visible successive historical layers. Some practices of Hinduism must have origi- nated in Neolithic times (c. 4000 B . C . E .). The worship of certain plants and animals as sacred, for instance, could very likely have very great antiquity. The worship of goddesses, too, a part of Hinduism today, may be a feature that originated in the Neolithic. introduction hinduism K i-xL-hindu-fm.indd xvii 12/14/06 1:02:36 AM"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The first attested elements that can be argued to be “Hindu” are found in the Indus Valley civilization complex, which lay geographically in present-day Pakistan. This civilization com- plex, which is contemporaneous with Sumeria and matches it in complexity and sophistication, is dated 3600–1900 B . C . E . Many seals found at Indus Valley sites were apparently used to mark commercial goods and had engraved upon them pictures that some have related to later Hindu- ism. One is the “proto-Shiva” seal, which shows a person, seated in a cross-legged position, with a headdress with horns on it and what appears to be an erect phallus. The headdress is said to relate to the later god Shiva’s title of “Lord of the Ani- mals,” and the erect phallus is said to be related to the common icon of Shiva, the lingam, which is phallic in shape. Some see his seated posture as being the yogic lotus position. Shiva is known for his yogic practices. Other Indus Valley seals seem to depict what came to be known as the “Seven Mothers,” still wor- shipped in contemporary Hinduism. Additionally, B. B. Lal, the most prominent Indian archaeologist of the Indus Valley culture, argues that other artifacts and fire sites of the Indus Valley complex appear to be designed for rituals associated with the Vedic ritual tradition, which is usually dated many centu- ries later. The Sacred Texts of Hinduism: The Vedas Considerable debate exists with regard to the rela- tionship of the Indus Valley civilization and the later Vedic tradition that focused on fire worship. The scholarly consensus for many years held that the Aryans, people who migrated from the west through Iran, arrived in India no earlier than 1200 B . C . E ., much too recently to have participated in the Indus Valley world. These people were, the view holds, associated with the transmission of the Vedas, India’s most sacred and revered texts. This consensus has been challenged, primarily from the Indian side, and continues to undergo scrutiny. The alternative view rejects the notion that the people who gave India the Vedas were originally foreign to India and sees a continuity between India’s earliest civilization and the people of the Vedas. The Rig Veda (c. 1500 B . C . E .), which everyone agrees is the most ancient extant Indian text, is the foundational text of Hinduism. It consists of about a thousand hymns. The great majority of the hymns are from five to 20 verses in length. The Rig Veda contains hymns of praise to a pan- theon of divinities as well as a few cosmogonic hymns that tell of the creation of the universe. These stories are extremely important for the development of later Hinduism. By far the greatest number of the thousand plus hymns of the Rig Veda are devoted to Indra, king of the gods, a deity connected with rain and storms who holds a thunderbolt, and Agni, the god of fire. The rest of the hymns are devoted to an array of gods, most prominently Mitra, Varuna, Savitri, Soma, and the Ashvins. Less fre- quently mentioned are the gods who became most important in the later Hindu pantheon, Vishnu and Rudra (one of whose epithets was shiva, the benign). A number of goddesses are mentioned, most frequently Ushas, goddess of the dawn, and Aditi, said to be the mother of the gods. The god- dess of speech, Vach (Vak), however, may be most important, since speech is one of the most power- ful sacred realities in Hindu tradition, although there are not many references to her. The religion of the Rig Veda has for a long time been referred to as henotheistic, meaning that the religion was polytheistic, but it recognized each divinity in turn as, in certain ways, supreme. Cer- tainly, later Hinduism continued and enriched this henotheistic concept, and, through time, Hindu- ism has been able to accept even Christ and Allah as being supreme “in turn.” The Rig Veda, though, was the central text in a very powerful ritual tradi- tion. Rituals public and private, with sacred fire always a central feature, were performed to speak to and beseech the divinities. Sacrifices of animals K xviii Encyclopedia of Hinduism i-xL-hindu-fm.indd xviii 12/14/06 1:02:36 AM"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"were a regular feature of the larger public rites of the Vedic tradition. Two other Vedas, the Yajur and Sama Vedas, were based on the Rig Veda. That is, most of their text is from the Rig Veda, but the words of the prior text are reorganized for the purposes of the rituals. Yajur Veda, the Veda of sacrificial formu- las, which has two branches called the Black and the White Yajur Vedas, contains the chants that accompany most of the important ancient rites. The Sama Veda, the Veda of sung chants, is very much focused on the praise of the god Soma, the personification of a drink taken at most rituals that probably had psychedelic properties. Priests of the three Vedas needed to be present for any larger, public ritual. Later a fourth Veda, the Atharva Veda, became part of the tradition. This text consists primarily of spells and charms used to ward off diseases or to influence events. This text is considered the origin of Indian medicine, the system of Ayurveda. There are also a number of cosmogonic hymns in the Atharva Veda, which show the development of the notion of divine unity in the tradition. A priest of the Atharva Veda was later included in all public rituals and the tradition evolved to include four Vedas rather than three. Two important points must be understood about the Vedic tradition. First, none of the Vedas is considered composed by humans. All are con- sidered to be “received” or “heard” by the rishis, divinely inspired sages, whose names are noted at the end of each hymn. Second, none of the text of the Vedas was written down until the 15th century C . E . The Vedic tradition was passed down from mouth to ear for millennia and is, thus, the oral tradition par excellence. The power of the word in the Vedic tradition is considered an oral and aural power, not a written one. The chant is seen as a power to provide material benefit and spiritual apotheosis. The great emphasis, therefore, was on correct pronunciation and on memorization. Any priest of the tradition was expected to have an entire Veda memorized, including its nonmantric portions (explained later). Any of the four Vedas is properly divided into two parts, the mantra, or verse portion, and the Brahmana, or explicatory portion. Both of these parts of the text are considered revelation, or shruti. The Brahmanas reflect on both the mantra text and the ritual associated with it, giving very detailed, varied, and arcane explication of them. The Brahma- nas abound in equations between ritual aspects, the ritual performers, and cosmic, terrestrial, and divine realities. Early Western scholars tended to discount these texts, as being nothing but priestly mumbo- jumbo. But most recent work recognizes the central importance of the Brahmanas to the development of Indian thought and philosophy. The name Brahmana derives from a central word in the tradition, brahman. Brahman is generi- cally the term for “prayer” but technically refers to the power or magic of the Vedic mantras. (It also was used to designate the one who prays, hence the term Brahmin .) Brahman is from the root brih, “to expand or grow,” and refers to the expansion of the power of the prayer itself as the ritual pro- ceeds; this power is understood as something to be “stirred up” by the prayer. In later philosophy, the term brahman refers to the transcendent, all- encompassing reality. The culmination of Brahmana thought is often considered to be the Shatapatha Brahmana of the White Yajur Veda. It makes explicit the religious nature of the agnichayana fire ceremony, the larg- est public ritual of the tradition. Shatapatha Brah- mana makes clear that this public ritual is, in fact, a reenactment of the primordial ritual described in Rig Veda X. 90, the most important cosmogonic hymn of the Vedas. This myth describes the ritual immolation of a cosmic “Man,” whose parts are apportioned to encompass all of the visible uni- verse and everything beyond it that is not visible. That is, the cosmic “Man” is ritually sacrificed to create the universe. Shatapatha Brahmana delin- eates how, at the largest public ritual in the tradi- tion, the universe is essentially re-created yearly. The Brahmana understands that, at its most per- fect, the Vedic ritual ground is identical to all of the universe, visible and invisible. Introduction xix J i-xL-hindu-fm.indd xix 12/14/06 1:02:36 AM"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Within the Brahmanas two subdivisions are important in the development of later tradition. One of the subdivisions is called the Aranyaka. From its name one can understand that this por- tion of the text pertained to activity in the forest ( aranya ). These specially designated portions of the Brahmanas contain evidence that some Vedic yajna, or ritual, was now performed internally, as an esoteric practice. This appears to be a special practice done by adepts, who would essentially perform the ritual mentally, as though it were being done in their own body and being. This practice was not unprecedented, since the priests of the Atharva Veda did not chant as other priests, but rather were required at public rituals to per- form mentally the rituals that other priests per- formed externally. But the Aranyaka notion was distinctive in that the ritual was performed only internally. From this interpretation originated the notion that the ritualist himself was the yajna, or ritual. Last, the Brahmanas included (commonly within the Aranyaka portion) the Upanishads, the last of the Vedic subdivisions or literary modes (no one really knows when these subdivisions were designated). As do the Brahmanas, many of these texts contained significant material that reflected on the nature of the Vedic sacrifice. Thus the division between Brahmana proper, Aranyaka, and Upanishad is not always clear. The most important feature of the Upanishad was the emer- gence of a clear understanding of the unity of the individual self or atman and the all-encompassing brahman, understood as the totality of universal reality, both manifest and unmanifest. The genesis of the Upanishadic understand- ing, that the self and cosmic reality were one, is clear. First, the Shatapatha Brahmana stated that the most perfect ritual was, in fact, to be equated to the universe itself, visible and invisible. Second, the Aranyakas made clear that the individual ini- tiated practitioner was the ritual itself. So, if the ritual equals all reality and the individual adept equals the ritual, then the notion that the indi- vidual equals all reality is easily arrived at. The Upanishads were arrived at, then, not by philo- sophical speculation, but by ritual practice. Later Upanishads of the orthodox variety (that is, early texts associated with a Vedic collection) omitted most reference to the ritual aspect and merely stated the concepts as they had been derived. Most importantly, the concepts of rebirth (rein- carnation) and the notion that actions in this life would have consequence in a new birth (karma) were first elaborated in the Upanishads. This evidence shows that the concept of karma, or ethically conditioned rebirth, had its roots in earlier Vedic thought. But the full expression of the concept was not found until the later texts, the Upanishads, which are called the Vedanta, or the end or culmination of the Vedas. Therefore, the notion of reaching unity with the ultimate reality was seen as not merely a spiritual apotheosis, but also a way out of the trap of rebirth (or redeath). Epic Hinduism and Classical Hinduism In the sixth century B . C . E ., a large-scale revolt against Vedic practice occurred in India. The Bud- dha, a great reformer, decried the supremacy of Brahmins in Vedic practice and in Indian society and called for a path that was open to all without discrimination. He criticized the animal sacrifices made by the Brahmins and their corruption in monetary pursuits. He was joined in this era by the Jain leader Mahavira. Both of these leaders began movements on the eastern plain of the Ganges valley, near the area of Benares (Varanasi), which represented a shift in the center of the cul- ture from the area of the Punjab, in what is now present-day Pakistan, to eastern India. Buddhism achieved supremacy in early India through the influence of the empire of the great king Ashoka in the third century B . C . E ., but, although it enjoyed periods of state glory over the centuries, it never succeeded in supplanting traditions that looked to the Vedas. Thus, the culture and tradition represented by the great K xx Encyclopedia of Hinduism i-xL-hindu-fm.indd xx 12/14/06 1:02:37 AM"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"epics Ramayana and Mahabharata showed the emergence of the forms of religion called, in cur- rent academic terms, Hinduism. These specifically show a contrast to the forms found in earlier Vedic “Brahminism.” In the Sanskrit epics, still widely known in myriad versions in India today, the gods Shiva and Vishnu begin to emerge as the focal points for cultic worship. Shiva appears to be a god of the Himalayas who was identified by the Brahmins with the god Rudra of the Vedas. In all likelihood the cultic Shiva was fashioned from an amalgam of traditional sources over many centuries. This pattern of taking local traditions and creating direct connection of them with the Vedas was an ongoing feature in the evolution of the Brahmini- cal tradition. Similarly, Vishnu and his numerous avatars emerged from a mélange of cultural sources. Vishnu in the Vedas was not at all a significant divinity. But the cult of Vishnu was organized around a sense of continuity with this Vedic divin- ity and the larger monistic philosophy that devel- oped in the Vedic tradition. The epic Ramayana is understood to be a story of the descent of Vishnu to Earth in order to defeat the demons. Likewise, Krishna, as warrior, another important avatar of Vishnu, was central to the Mahabharata epic. In both epics, stories of Shiva are also found scat- tered throughout. A similar phenomenon occurs in the career of the great Goddess, Shakti, in Hindu tradition. Shakti forms the third large cultic center in Hin- duism, whose worshippers, called shaktas, believe in the supremacy of the goddess. The develop- ment of shakti worship began to take shape at the beginning of the Common Era, some centuries later than the developments in the other cultic contexts. The Bhagavad Gita (c. 100 B . C . E .), which is found in the Mahabharata (MBh), identifies the god Krishna with the brahman of the Upanishads. The likelihood is that Krishna was a divinity of certain western Indian groups, who had reached such popularity that he could not be ignored. It may have been that Krishna was originally a tribal chieftain. In the Mahabharata itself he is spoken of consistently as God only in the Bhagavad Gita, which is clearly a later addition to the MBh. This identification of a local god with the highest divin- ity (and further with Vishnu) shows a pattern that leads to the incredible diversity of Hinduism. All across India in the next thousand years numerous local gods and goddesses are taken up into the larger Hindu tradition. Examples from as far away as South India, the last area of India to accept the Aryan ethos, demonstrate the process of absorption of local divinities into the larger Hindu pantheon. Lord Venkateshvara of Tirupati, in Andhra Pradesh, a hill divinity who may have been worshipped in the same spot for several thousand years, was first identified with Shiva and then later identi- fied as the god Vishnu himself. Tirupati there- upon became part of the Vaishnavite tradition and a pilgrimage site of great importance. Simi- larly, the goddess Minakshi in the temple city of Madurai, most probably a goddess of her home region in Tamil Nadu for many, many centuries, was associated with Shiva by being identified as his wife. In fact, she appears late enough not to be identified with Parvati, his usual spouse, but as a separate wife. Likewise, the Tamil god Murugan became identified as the youngest son of Shiva and Parvati. Over the era from perhaps 600 B . C . E . until as late as the 14th century various local divinities were slowly but systematically absorbed into the Vedic or Brahmanical tradition. The Sanskrit texts, the puranas, composed from the fourth to the 12th centuries C . E ., tell tales of the complicated and varied lives of Vishnu, Shiva, and the Goddess, but many local tales in local languages and San- skrit tell the more hidden tales of how these local godly kings and queens became part of the larger tradition. The earliest additions to the pantheon of Hinduism were clearly those gods and god- desses who formed the basis of the Vishnu and Shiva cults. Parvati was likely a mountain goddess who may have ruled the mountains on her own Introduction xxi J i-xL-hindu-fm.indd xxi 12/14/06 1:02:37 AM"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"at one time but became absorbed in the Shaivite tradition. Likewise, Lakshmi, the wife of Vishnu, has characteristics of a local nature divinity who became identified with Sri of the Vedas. Vedic ritual tradition saw a revival in the king- doms of the Guptas during the fourth through sixth centuries C . E . This period is often described as a golden age of Indian tradition, when Sanskrit literature flourished with such poets as Kalidasa, and the kings patronized Brahmins and rees- tablished Vedic rites that had long languished. Except for this passing phase, however, Vedic ritual tradition lost its supremacy very early. By the turn of the Common Era worship of the major cults had expanded greatly and by the sixth cen- tury C . E . temples to these divinities began to be created in stone. Temple Hinduism represented a real shift in worship from that of the Vedas. Vedic worship had no permanent cultic sites, and no icons or images, nor was it locally bound. Following the traditions of the non-Aryan substratum in India, temple Hinduism focused its worship around icons placed in permanent temples. Most of these temples were built at places that had been sites of worship for hundreds of years. Part of the shift, however, very much connected the new temple sites with the Aryan tradition: the priests in the major temples now were all Brahmins and they all used Sanskrit in the rituals to the gods, where other languages had been used exclusively. Caste In the transition from Vedic religion to Hinduism proper, one important feature is the development of the stratified social system that in India became known as the caste system. Texts dating from the late centuries before the Common Era, such as the Laws of Manu, began to make clear that the four classes found in the Vedas were now seen as strati- fied social entities. Rules and social laws began to be passed down, not universally, but in terms of each class or “birth” ( jati ) division. Brahmins, here, were placed at the apex of the pyramid, because of their priestly positions. (However, they were also not allowed to accumulate large amounts of wealth and could not hold positions of direct political power.) Next were the warriors, or Kshatriyas, who held kingly and administrative power. The large body of the people, the Vish, or Vaishya, were farmers or merchants. The lowest class were the Shudras, born, it was thought, to be servants. As time went on and the tradition expanded its reach into all parts of India, indigenous tribes and other groups entering the society of Aryans were absorbed at an even lower rung of the social ladder. Eventually the concept of the untouchable (contemporary Dalit) was created to refer to peo- ple whom the upper castes would not even allow to be near or to touch them. Hinduism developed into a society where people became ranked rigidly by occupation. The sacerdotal position, or priestly work, was considered purest. Work that involved dealing with the dead, carrion, cleaning of sewers, sweeping, and other such tasks, was considered “unclean” and was performed only by hereditary untouchables. Islam In the 11th and 12th centuries, Islam entered an India that was flourishing. As the devotional movements that embodied the new tendency of the culture to worship the iconic divinity devel- oped, saints emerged to sing poetry at the many shrines. Cultic Hinduism displayed a vast array of poet singers and wanderers who embodied the devotion for which ordinary Hindus strove. The ascetic wanderer had emerged even before Bud- dha, who was one of them. And through time the developing tradition looked to the wandering sadhu, or saint, to exemplify the purest devo- tion to the divine. The often eccentric holy man remains a distinctive feature of Hinduism today. Islam entered India with a vengeance and stayed to rule. As Islamic presence expanded over North India, the Mughal empire was established in the 15th century C . E . For several centuries K xxii Encyclopedia of Hinduism i-xL-hindu-fm.indd xxii 12/14/06 1:02:37 AM"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Islam presided over India. Its reach encompassed nearly the entire country, although the far reaches of the south were spared its iconoclasm and its heaviest hand. The Islamic era (c. 1100 to 1750 C . E .) pro- duced religious interaction that may be unique in the world. Many of the Muslims who entered India were Turks, who often had an appreciation for the Sufi traditions. Sufis were often patron- ized by the Islamic courts. As the Sufi wandering holymen, many of whom were as otherworldly and eccentric as their Indian counterparts, began to meet with the local wanderers and saints, new religious ideas began to develop. The long tradition of Hindu saints who were lower caste, anticaste, or anti-Brahminical were supplemented by Sufi wanderers who held similar views. What emerged were powerful spiritual traditions that condemned all orthodoxy and were socially revo- lutionary in that they decried caste as spiritually bankrupt and laughed at the Brahmins as scoun- drels and worse. The Sant tradition of North India that emerged in this era was well represented by such people as Kabir, who spoke most radically about the stupidity of untouchability and the fool- ishness of the orthodox. The Sant and Sufi sentiments that developed in this era merged in the tradition of Guru Nanak (15th century) and the Sikhs, who eschew all ritual, icons, and ritual leaders. For the Sikhs there is no guru except the Granth Sahib, their holy book, which has many verses from the poet- saints of this era. Other movements, such as the Bauls, remained less institutionalized than the Sikh tradition. They too combined elements from devotional Hinduism, Sufi love poetry and music, and anti-Brahminical sentiments into cultic groups that exist today out- side the orthodox umbrella of Hinduism. British Era By the beginning of the 18th century, the British had arrived in India and had become powerful in Ben- gal. They succeeded in developing political power through the use of intermediaries carefully chosen from corrupt Muslim potentates and Hindu kings in the chaotic aftermath of Mughal rule. It is no accident that Hindu modernism begins in Bengal, as it represented the longest contact point between the Western ruler, Britain, and its new subjects. English education became the norm for well-educated Bengalis by the early 18th century. When other parts of the country were just becoming accustomed to the heavy hand of the British, the Bengalis had already become more than familiar with their views and ways. What emerged were both a reform movement in Hinduism and the roots of the Indian nationalist movement. Groups emerged in the late 18th century who, influenced in part by Christian ideas, sought to reform Hinduism. Groups such as the Brahmo Samaj of Ram Mohan Roy sought to end child marriage, to allow widows to remarry, to eliminate the custom of widows’ burning themselves on the funeral pyres of their husband, to eliminate caste, and to end worship of icons. Many of these people worked from a notion that India had been domi- nated by the British because the Indian culture had become spiritually corrupt. They felt that if they had had a stronger social sense and greater solidarity, the British could not have so easily gained preeminence. This view was held by nearly every major fighter for Indian independence, including Mahatma Gandhi and Sri Aurobindo. The caste system received significant criticism for more than two millennia by various groups who argued from the point of view of a different spiritual vision. The Buddha and Mahavira are the first we know of, starting in 600 B . C . E ., but the Virashaivas of Karnataka, a South Indian state, eliminated caste from their reform tradition in the 11th century C . E ., and many groups of mendicant wanderers such as the Siddhas routinely criticized caste and Brahminical cultural dominance, from the Buddha’s time forward. The medieval poet- saints of North India who followed the views of Kabir were only maintaining a long countertradi- tion. So when the “reformists” of Bengal began to Introduction xxiii J i-xL-hindu-fm.indd xxiii 12/14/06 1:02:37 AM"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"attack the social evils of Hinduism their actions must not be seen as merely a mimicking of Chris- tians and the British. It should be noted, as well, that the antiiconic view of the Brahmo Samaj of Calcutta (Kolkata) were also not new. The Viras- haivas were essentially antiiconic (except for the Shiva lingam, which they kept in their personal homes), and the traditional Vedanta of the Upa- nishads looked to brahman alone without char- acteristics (or icons) as the ultimate divinity. The Brahmo Samaj takes its name, in fact, from this brahman, spelled as Brahmo in Bengali. In the rich matrix of Hindu reform in Bengal in the 19th century emerged the great saint Ramak- rishna and his student Swami Vivekananda. They maintained the reformist notions that caste must be uprooted, but Ramakrishna himself was not opposed to worship of icons. What Ramakrishna does, though, is round out the syncretic move- ments of the Sants, who melded Islamic and Hindu notions while decrying orthodoxy. Ramak- rishna directly experienced Islam and Christianity and saw them as alternate paths to the one goal of the Divine. Ramakrishna then takes Hinduism full circle from its Vedic roots, where God could be seen as having any face and still be God. But now the social evils that had accrued in Hinduism over the centuries were seen by many to be superfluous to any religious need. Post-Independence India (after 1947) The Indian Constitution was written by an untouchable (now referred to as a Dalit), B. R. Ambedkar. Dr. Ambedkar’s selection as the person to head the Constitutional Commis- sion was a sign that the reform values that the Indian independence fighters held were going to be instituted in law in independent India. In the Indian Constitution, “scheduled castes and tribes,” those “out-casted” by traditional Hindu society, were given a specified percent- age of guaranteed seats in the Indian Parliament until such time as the Constitution could be amended. (This guarantee was also instituted in nearly every state of the new Indian Union.) Additionally, separate electorates were estab- lished for Muslims to ensure that they would have adequate representation in the new Indian state. Along with these reforms, inheritance and marriage laws established legal practices to aid women and to counter long-held traditions detrimental to women. Dowry, for instance, a burden for every woman’s family, was out- lawed. (This law, regrettably, has never been rigorously enforced.) Most importantly, the new state of India was declared a secular state with its own unique definition: it was a state that respected all religions and made accommoda- tions for them, but a state that privileged no single religion. This respect for religion went to the extent of institution, by request of Muslim leaders, of certain laws regarding marriage and property that only applied in the Muslim com- munity. (Muslims, for instance, were allowed to maintain the practice of polygamy, in which men may have as many as four wives.) Independent India began in the chaos of par- tition. Many Muslims, Hindus, and Sikhs were killed in the days after independence, when the state of Pakistan was created. Millions crossed the borders on India’s east and west to enter the state that they felt would most protect their interests. Blame has been assigned in many places for the tragic fact of partition. Muslim leaders, Hindu leaders, and the British certainly all bore some share of the blame. Conflict ensued over the state of Kashmir, where a Hindu king ceded his major- ity Muslim state to India at the last minute. This began a long history of wars and disagreement between Pakistan and India that continues in the present day. (Pakistan itself was split in two in 1972, when the state of Bangladesh was created from East Pakistan.) For a long time these disagreements did not greatly affect the relationship between Indian Mus- lims and the Hindu majority. In the 1980s a new political movement emerged in India, based on the K xxiv Encyclopedia of Hinduism i-xL-hindu-fm.indd xxiv 12/14/06 1:02:37 AM"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"assertion of Hindu majority privilege. It is often referred to as Hindu fundamentalism, but this phraseology glosses over the complexities and com- peting values it represents. Nation-states need to justify their existence ideologically. Pakistan shaped its identity from the beginning around Islam, and Hindus and other religions found themselves mar- ginalized there from the beginning. India, however, had preserved the values of a secular state. Muslims regularly held the office of president of India and cabinet posts and were kept visibly in government offices and in positions in the army. It can be argued that the movement for privi- leging Hinduism in India and for a call to “Hin- duize” India was directly related to the need for a national ideology. Formation of national identity for new nations is extremely complex, and flows of power are difficult to track, but the emergence of Hindu fundamentalism seems clearly related to this need for the creation of national identity. Hindu assertion was not new in India. Certain groups, such as the Rashritriya Swayam Sevak Sangh (The National Self-Help Organization), who admired the fascists in Italy and Germany and taught regimented military tactics for their followers (along with hatred of Muslims), had their roots in Hindu nationalist groups of the 19th century. Suffice it to say that hatred of Muslims, conversion of non-Hindu minorities (including Christians), and reassertion of caste privilege were all part of this larger movement. In the 1990s the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) gained power with this platform, and some of its officials presided over a bloody anti-Muslim massacre in the Indian state of Gujarat. In 2004 they were ousted from power in favor of the Congress Party, the same party that had led India to independence and cre- ated the secular state of India. In the interim, great damage was done to relationships between Hin- dus and Muslims in India. Many Muslims began to retreat into their own fundamentalisms, now global in scope. Others simply left India, if they could. This relationship is in deep crisis at this time and will need skillful diplomacy and cultiva- tion to be repaired, if it ever is. Dissemination Through European scholarship and interest, Hindu texts and practices became known in Western Europe and North America as early as the 18th century. In the 19th century, German philosophy, French scholarship, and the American transcendentalist movement served to dissemi- nate Hindu ideas among Western readers, without contributions from Indian emigrants. A diaspora, which involved the resettlement of significant numbers of emigrants from India, began as early as the 17th century and reached significant size in the 18th through 20th centuries. The pattern of the diaspora was first characterized by the arrival of indentured laborers in Indonesia, Africa, and the Caribbean region to work the fields of large landowners. From the 20th century, Hindus from India migrated to the West for education. From the first days of the diaspora, groups of Hindus have cohered to transfer their faith and practices from native India to their new homes, temples, and communities. Thus, the dissemination of Hinduism around the world has followed two main routes: the route of scholarship and study, as the religion has been studied by non-Indians and introduced to non-Indian populations, and the route of immigration, as devoted Hindus have cre- ated Hindu homes and institutions in their places of resettlement. The acceptance of Hindu ideals and practices in the West has depended upon a succession of Hindu practitioners who visited the West. Begin- ning with P. C. Moozumdar and Swami Vive- kananda at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893 and continuing through the resi- dence of Paramahansa Yogananda in the United States from the 1920s, the West has received ever- larger numbers of Hindu teachers, especially since new immigration laws that allowed South Asian migration to the West. Philosophical and theological ideas from Hinduism have been incorporated into Western thought on a large scale, primarily through the publications and activities of the Theosophical Introduction xxv J i-xL-hindu-fm.indd xxv 12/14/06 1:02:38 AM"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"K xxvi Encyclopedia of Hinduism Society and the teachings of many Hindu adepts in the West. Today, every major form of Hindu practice and belief has its Western form, which, although modified from traditional Hinduism, nevertheless contains the character of Hinduism. An Encyclopedic Approach In some 800 entries, Encyclopedia of Hinduism explores the vast world of Hinduism that emerges from prehistory and lives today in astonishing variety. This volume focuses on the most signifi- cant groups within Hinduism, the religious and cultural movements that enriched its history, sig- nificant teachers and their contributions, and the diaspora of Hindu thought and practice around the world. Two major religious traditions that sprang from a Hindu milieu, Jainism and Sikhism, have many entries; Buddhism, also a tradition that evolved from within Hinduism, is the subject of another encyclopedia in this series. Inevitably, one volume cannot fully describe a history of at least 3,000 years and a stagger- ing diversity in the present. The authors had to choose one topic over another and one person over another. Yet, the Encyclopedia of Hinduism represents major events, specific groups, central concepts, and major teachers who have given Hinduism its unique place as a world religion. Importantly, the many women leaders and teach- ers who have been valued in the evolution of Hin- duism retain a focus in these entries. This volume, though selective, gives the interested reader a reli- able window into the vast and enduring tradition of Hinduism, and some of its sister traditions in the land of India. —Constance A.

In it, the right hand is raised and opened, straight up and facing forward (divinities with more than two hands raise one of their right hands). Abhaya literally means “no fear,” and the gesture indi- cates blessing, protection, and reassurance. The gesture is ancient and widespread and is found in the iconography of Buddhists, Jains, and Hindus. The Buddha(s) and the T IRTHANKARA s are fre- quently seen using this hand gesture. The Lord S HIVA in his N ATARAJA , or divine dancer, pose has his upper right hand in the abhaya mudra. In fact, this mudra may be used when any divinity is represented in Indian dance/dramas.

Abhedananda, Swami (1866–1939) pioneer Hindu leader in the United States The Indian monk Swami Abhedananda founded the New York City Vedanta Society at the end of the 19th century, pioneering the spread of Hindu thought in America. Abhedananda was born Kaliprasad Chandra in Calcutta (Kolkata). As a teenager, he was interested in yoga, philosophy, and the religious life and, though quite intelligent, did not attend college. Rather, at the age of 18 he had his first meeting with Sri R AMAKRISHNA , who immediately recruited the youthful Kaliprasad to his inner circle. Kaliprasad moved into the Ramakrishna residence at Dakshineswar, where he lived until Ramakrishna died two years later. Shortly after Ramakrishna’s passing, Kaliprasad joined the other men who had gathered around the master in taking the vows of the renounced life (see SANNYASI ), at which time he took the name Abhedananda. He spent the next several years in concentrated study of the Hindu holy books and in meditation. For a brief period he left his brother monks to wander around India. In 1893, one of his fellow monks, Swami V IVE - KANANDA , traveled to America to address the W ORLD 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 1 12/14/06 9:28:08 AM"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"P ARLIAMENT OF R ELIGIONS . Abhedananda organized the celebration in Calcutta of the swami’s American success, and three years later Vivekananda called him to assist his work in the West. Abhedananda remained in London for a year speaking and build- ing a following for the Vedanta Society. In 1897, Abhedananda began a 25-year stay in New York City. He succeeded in organizing a Vedanta Society (Vivekananda had failed to do so), and built it into a relatively strong organi- zation. He moved in the intellectual circles of his day and was invited to speak at a number of colleges and universities. He also made some 17 lecture tours in Europe. All his teachings and lec- turing consistently reflected the ADVAITA V EDANTA perspective of Ramakrishna; together with his learned colleagues he argued for the unity of Truth and the confluence of science and religion. In 1921, Abhedananda returned to India, where he was received as a celebrity. He went on to establish two Ramakrishna centers, in Darjeel- ing (1923) and Calcutta (1929). Among his last duties was presiding at the 1937 Parliament of Religions in Calcutta, organized to celebrate the Ramakrishna Centennial. Abhedananda died two years later in 1939.

Abhidhyan Yoga Institute (est. 1991) The Abhidhyan Yoga Institute, also called Mod- ern Seers, headquartered at Swarthmore, Penn- sylvania, is a training center for All Embracing ( Abhidhyan ) Yoga, a somewhat rare form of TANTRA that has survived within several lesser- known Hindu and Buddhist sects. All Embracing Yoga incorporates the four major yoga paths: JNANA YOGA , the path of study; BHAKTI YOGA , the path of devotion to the Divine; KARMA YOGA , the path of action; and RAJA YOGA , the path that unites mind, heart, and body in pursuit of the Divine. The revival of All Embracing Yoga, and its spread from India to the United States and several other countries is attributed to Sri Acharya Abhid- hyanananda Avadhuta (Anatole Ruslanov) (b. May 5, 1965), a Russian computer scientist who apprenticed in B ENARES (Varanasi) India, with Sri A NANDAMURTI (1921–90), founder of the A NANDA M ARGA Y OGA S OCIETY . As a monastic student of the guru, Anatole became a vital transmitter and spiritual master of this largely overlooked form of tantric practice. A year after the death of Sri Anandamurti (1990), Anatole established the Abhidhyanan- anda Yoga Institute with its headquarters in the United States. He added his own teaching methods to those of his teacher, synthesized what he had learned during his monastic life in India, and refined his tantric abilities. In 1998, Anatole revealed to his students that he had had a transformational experience that had lifted his religious and practical focus to a higher level, thus requiring a revision of the discipline required of practitioners. Students of All Embracing Yoga engage in regular meditation, follow strict moral codes, and practice postures ( ASANAS ) and breathing tech- niques ( PRANAYAMA ). Abhidhyanananda recom- mends solitary spiritual work for a year prior to entering this specific yoga path. The institute publishes a periodical, The Tan- trik Path, at its headquarters in Nevada City, California. No publications in book form are used at the institute. Rather, all teachings are found online on the Internet.

His work represents the pinnacle of the tantric ( see TANTRISM ) school of K ASHMIRI S HAIVISM , which sees the world as both real and divine. He is also recognized as one of India’s foremost theorists in the field of aesthetics, or the appreciation of art. Abhinavagupta interwove the diverse threads of the earlier schools of Kashmiri Shaivism into a coherent and cogent philosophy and practice. He wrote numerous books and commentaries, all in Sanskrit. Most well known is the magnum opus, the massive Tantraloka; it deals with the philoso- phy, religion, and yogic practice of the Kashmir Shaiva tradition. Abhinavagupta’s exceptional work on the the- ory of art derives its interest from his belief in the divinity of the senses and sense experience. His most well known book in this area is his commentary on the Dhvanyaloka, an important text on aesthetics, which has become a source book for much of later Indian aesthetic theory. Abhinavagupta’s influence is most evident in the traditions of Swami M UKTANANDA and his disciple Swami C HIDVILASANANDA , two of the most promi- nent modern teachers in the Kashmiri Shaivite tradition.

Abhishiktananda, Swami (1910–1973) pioneer in Hindu-Christian monasticism Born Henri Le Saux, Abhishiktananda was a pio- neer in the field of spiritual and theological dia- logue between Christianity and Hinduism. He was born on August 30, 1910, at Saint Briac in Brittany, France. At an early age he felt a call to the vocation of a Roman Catholic priest, and in 1929 he entered the Benedictine Monastery of Saint Anne de Kergonan in Plouharnel. Dur- ing his 19 years there he worked as librarian and master of ceremonies. He served in the French army during World War II and experienced a miraculous escape after being captured by Ger- man troops in 1940. Seeking a more radical path for living a spiri- tual life, Le Saux was attracted to India as early as 1934. In Tamil Nadu state he met Father Jules Monchanin, a Roman Catholic priest serving in a Tamil village in southern India, who was formu- lating a path for living a contemplative life that combined Indian asceticism (see SANNYASI ) and Christian practice. Le Saux joined Fr. Monchanin in 1948 at Kulitalai; the two began a small ashram near the C AUVERY R IVER at the village of Tan- nirpalli in Tiruchirappalli District, South India. In 1950, they settled in Shantivanam (Forest of Peace) and named their new foundation Saccidan- anda Ashram after the Hindu trinity. In 1950 Le Saux adopted the dress of a Hindu ascetic and changed his name to Swami Abhishik- tananda (the Bliss of the Anointed One). He began studying Tamil and Sanskrit and immersed him- self in Indian traditions and practices. A meeting in 1949 with R AMANA M AHARSHI (1879–1950) at Ramana’s ashram in Tiruvannamalai had a strong influence on his developing spirituality, and between 1950 and 1955 he spent many months in deep meditation in the caves near Ramana’s ashram at the holy mountain Arunachala. After Ramana’s death in 1950, he became a disciple of Gnanananda Giri of Tirukoylur. When the ailing Fr. Monchanin returned to France and died in 1957, Abhishiktananda felt a growing attraction to the north of India and Abhishiktananda, Swami 3 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 3 12/14/06 9:28:09 AM"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"the Himalayas. He undertook several pilgrim- ages and often visited the holy city of B ENARES , (Varanasi), where he found others, such as Dr. Raimon Panikkar, engaged in Hindu-Christian dialogue. In 1968, he left Shantivanam under the leadership of Father Bede Griffiths (1968–93) and went to live in a hermitage in Uttarkashi in the Himalayas. In 1980, Shantivanam, under the leadership of Father Bede, was received in the Camaldolese Congregation of the Benedictine Confederation. In 1969 Abhishiktananda participated in the All-India Seminar on the Church in India Today in Bangalore, the aim of which was to adapt the principles of Vatican II to the Indian context. There he was recognized as a pioneer in the field of Hindu-Christian dialogue, whose life and work inspired several religious communities, such as Jyotiniketan Ashram formed in 1969 at Bareilly. Abhishiktananda’s books and teaching are largely addressed to Christians, with the aim of helping them discover the spirit and principles of ADVAITA (non-dual) Hinduism. While always remaining a Christian, he discerned elements of Christianity in the spiritual wisdom of India that helped him toward resolving for himself the ten- sions between the two religions and finding an inner integration. His goal was to move beyond the limits of institutional religions and churches to encourage spiritual renewal, which he consid- ered essential for human survival in the modern world. On July 14, 1973, Abhishiktananda suffered a heart attack on the road in Rishikesh, where he was on retreat with another French religious. He died December 7, 1973, at Indore, Madhya Pradesh.

It is especially holy to Jains (see J AINISM ), who built beautifully adorned temples there. It was once a British hill station for retreat from the summer heat. According to one legend, the sage Vasishtha’s cow Nandini was once trapped in a deep gorge and could not free herself. The sage appealed to Lord S HIVA for assistance. The Lord sent S ARASVATI , the divine stream, to help flood the gorge so that the cow could float up. Vasishtha then decided to ensure that such mishaps would not occur in future. He asked the youngest son of H IMALAYA , the king of mountains, to fill the chasm perma- nently. This he did with the assistance of Arbud, the mighty snake. This spot came to be known as Mount Arbud, and the name was later changed to its present form—Mount Abu. It is said that this mountain was visited and blessed in the sixth century B . C . E . by M AHAVIRA , the 24th and last Jain T IRTHANKARA of this half of the cosmic era. It is known for its marble Jain temples, two of which are famous. The first, built in the 11th century, is devoted to RISHABHA , the first Tirthankara of the line leading to Mahavira, The other, from the 13th century, is dedicated to Neminatha, the 22nd Tirthankara in the line.

Acharanga Sutra (c. 300 B . C . E .–400 C . E .) The Acharanga Sutra is the first of the 12 texts accepted as canonical by S HVETAMBARA Jains. The D IGAMBARA Jains believe that the original version of this sutra was lost and reject the text held sacred by the Shvetambaras. The sutra outlines, with some details, the rigorous limitations that Jain monks must observe and answers difficulties that might occur in their struggle to prevent injury to any creatures, including microscopic ones. To cite some examples, the Acharanga Sutra prohibits monks from digging in the earth (to prevent injury to any earth being); bathing, swim- ming, wading, or walking in the rain (to prevent injury to any water being); kindling or extin- guishing any flame (to prevent injury to beings that live in fire); waving the arms or making any other sudden movement (to prevent injury to air beings); and walking in any greenery or stepping on any plant (to prevent injury to beings living in plants). The sutra also demands the strictest vegetarianism. Further reading: Hermann Jacobi, trans., Jain Sutras, Part 1, Sacred Books of the East, XVL (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1964); P. S.

In ancient times the term referred specifically to the one who initiated a student and taught him the complete V EDA or sacred literature. In later times it became a general honorific indicating great learning and/or spiritual accomplishment. The term was, for example, appended to the names of all the great V EDANTA teachers: S HANKARA , R AMANUJA , M ADHVA , and N IMBARKA , become Shan- karacharya, Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya, and Nimbarkacharya. This practice is followed in the J AIN tradition as well; for example, G UNABHADRA will be called Gunabhadracharya. Furthermore, Jains honor acha- ryas in the panchanamaskara MANTRA , the central mantra of the Jain faith, immediately after the ARHATS and SIDDHAS ; this indicates their exalted status.

He oversees all the ritual activity, carrying out most of the actions himself. He prepares and uses the implements, pours clarified butter, kills the ritual animal, and recites the appropriate verses (of either the Black or the White Yajur Veda) as the ritual actions are performed. The priests of the R IG , S AMA , and A THARVA V EDAS are usually much less active on the ritual ground.

A pedestrian example would be a person look- ing at a rope in a dark place and briefly seeing a snake. This sort of superimposition involves two physical objects, but the central superimposition or adhyasa in Shankara’s system is the ignorant superimposition of the empirical world upon the attribute-free BRAHMAN or ultimate reality. Humans imagine that the empirical world is real, but, just as the rope is not the snake, so is the empirical world not the brahman. Shankara holds that the phenomenal world is false ( mithya ) and illusory ( M AYA ). Ignorance ( AV I D YA ), leads us to see the world as real, but when knowledge ( VIDYA or JNANA ) dawns, we see the truth: that the only existence is brahman, the actionless, attribute-free ground of being that can be described as SAT - CHIT - ANANDA , being-consciousness-bliss.

Adi Da Samraj (1939– ) teacher of “Crazy Wisdom” Adi Da Samraj, a U.S.-born guru, teaches his idiosyncratic philosophy and discipline to a small but devoted international following, mostly in English-speaking countries. According to Adi Da Samraj’s autobiography, he experienced a state of perfect awareness of ulti- mate reality from the day of his birth as Franklin Jones on November 3, 1939, on Long Island, New York. At age two he relinquished that state in order to experience human limitations completely. From 1957 he studied philosophy at Columbia Univer- sity in New York. Beginning in his college years Jones engaged in a spiritual quest that led him to Swami R UDRANANDA in New York City and eventu- ally to Swami M UKTANANDA , the famous practitio- ner of Shaivism and siddha yoga. From childhood, Jones reported many experiences of KUNDALINI (awakening divine energy), mystical revelation, astral travel, and superconscious identification with higher beings, but he found that these powers were not valuable because they were not expres- sions of his real nature. In 1970 at the Vedanta temple in Hollywood, he experienced a reawaken- ing and realization of his ultimate nature; he knew his oneness with S HAKTI , divine energy. He left Muktananda and became a devotee of Shakti. In 1972, Jones began to teach his “radical” understanding of a spiritual path that includes devotion to a guru and self-observation. He opened a small ashram in Los Angeles and began to attract devotees. During a trip to India he adopted the first of what would become many new names for himself, Bubba Free John. At first he worked with students in a traditional way, but in the late 1970s he adopted the “Crazy Wisdom” approach to spirituality. In 1979, he changed his name to Da Free John. In 1986, his name became Da Love-Ananda. In the late 1980s he became Da Avabhasa (the Bright), in 1990 Da Kalki, and finally, in 1995, Adi Da Samraj. The completion of his work of revelation, he says, is signified in this last change of name and his title of AVATA R . In 1983, he acquired an island in Fiji for his community, then called the Johannine Daist Communion. Today Adi Da’s spiritual movement is named Adidam, or the Way of the Heart. A K 6 adhyasa 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 6 12/18/06 12:52:17 PM"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"central teaching of this path is that all seeking requires constant activity, a factor that, in itself, prevents conscious realization and perfect hap- piness. Because the means used on any path are always changing, no method of seeking is ever permanently successful. Adi Da asserts that he has attained the Most Perfect Happiness and can transmit this divine Self-realization to others. Thus, a devotional relationship with Adi Da is the source of divine Self-realization. The Way of the Heart employs meditation, study, worship, com- munal living, and dietary and sexual disciplines as means for “radical” understanding and com- munion with Adi Da. The educational organization of Adidam is the Laughing Man Institute, which propagates the teaching of Adi Da around the world. Adidam also has a publishing vehicle, the Dawn Horse Press, which publishes The Adidam Revelation Magazine and books about and by Adi Da. At the turn of the 21st century Adidam reported over 1,000 members worldwide, the majority of whom live in the United States. Centers have been opened in New Zealand, Australia, Great Britain, and Fiji. Ashrams currently are located in Fiji, Hawaii, and northern California. See also B ONDER , S ANIEL .

It records the lives of the 63 great men of Jain history and myth (which are also recorded later in the larger compendium of H EMACHANDRA , The History of the 63 Famous Men ). It was begun in Karnataka state by J INASENA around the ninth century C . E . and completed by one of his students, G UNABHADRA , whose addition bears the separate name of Uttarapuranam. The Adipurana was the first major Jain text that openly integrated elements of Hinduism into the Jain philosophical framework. Jinasena pro- vides for Jain B RAHMINS (who are not, however, allowed the haughtiness and privilege of Hindu Brahmins), the caste system (which in the Jain view is a political institution, not a birthright), various Hindu life transition rituals, and elements of Hindu temple ritual, which are given differ- ent philosophical interpretations. For example, Jinasena provided the first Jain fire rituals, which are clearly Vedic, Brahmanical rituals revalorized for the Jain context. Jinasena also establishes a set of “traditional” Jain M ANTRA s to mirror the Hindu tradition. See also J AINISM . Further reading: P. S.

It is also said that, when time begins again in a new era, the world sits on the head of Adishesha; whenever he stirs, earthquakes result. At the end of each cosmic era he vomits out the fire of destruction, which incinerates the universe. In the story of P RAHLADA and H IRANYAKASHIPU , Prahlada prays to Adishesha when forced by his father to eat poison and is saved. Other stories associate Adishesha with cosmic poison in differ- ent ways. Many different personages in Indian tradition have been said to be incarnations of Adishesha, most notably B ALARAMA , the brother of Lord K RISHNA . Adishesa is usually described as the son of a rishi, a seer. However, as is common in Indian mythology many contradictory stories exist, and some say that he was born of S HIVA . He has even been identified with the eternal, all-encompassing BRAHMAN itself. Further reading: Cornelia Dimmitt and J. A.

Aditi Aditi (she who has no limit) is one of the few goddesses mentioned by name in the R IG V EDA , the earliest extant Indian text. There she is said to be the mother of the A DITYAS , a group of seven (sometimes eight or 12) important divinities, including V ARUNA and M ITRA . However, the list of her children varies in other texts; S URYA , the Sun God; A GNI , the god of fire; or even I NDRA , the king of the gods, is referred to as aditya, that is, “hav- ing Aditi as mother.” Aditi is said to have sprung from the RISHI D AKSHA (although in Rig Veda, Daksha is also simultaneously her son). There is no iconography of Aditi ( see ICONS ). Further reading: Joel Peter Brereton, The Rgvedic Adityas (New Haven, Conn.: American Oriental Soci- ety, 1981); Cornelia Dimmitt and J. A.

Adityas Aditya means “whose mother is A DITI ,” the Vedic goddess. The father of the Adityas is usually said to be the RISHI Kashyapa, a famous Vedic rishi. The Adityas are sometimes referred to as seven, sometimes eight, and sometimes 12 in number. The Vedic list is seven or eight. The list of seven includes V ARUNA , M ITRA , A RYAMAN , B HAGA , D AK - SHA , A NSHA , and S URYA or S AVITRI . The list of eight sometimes includes Martanda, who is said to have been excluded by his mother. When 12 Adityas are listed, in later times, they represent the 12 months of the year; they are Dhatri, M ITRA , A RYAMAN , R UDRA , S URYA , Bhaga, V IVASVAT , P USHAN , S AVITRI , T VASHTRI , and V ISHNU . In some lists A GNI , the god of fire, or even I NDRA , the king of the gods, is referred to as an “Aditya.” Further reading: Joel P.

In Mimamsa the term refers to any invisible result of a ritual act that accrues to a person; it K 8 Aditi 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 8 12/14/06 9:28:10 AM"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"bears fruit upon that person’s death. Adrishta has lent itself to extensive commentary in the Mimamsa literature. It is intangible and ineffable, but also the instrument through which Vedic rites come to fruition. In Vaisheshika, the term is sometimes synony- mous with adharma, the equally invisible negative karmic accrual. In a larger sense in Vaisheshika, adrishta is the unknown quality of things and of the soul; it brings about the cosmic order and arranges for souls according to their merits and demerits.

Potter, Indian Metaphysics and Epistemology: The Tradi- tion of Nyaya-Vaisesika Up to Gangesa (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1977). advaita Advaita (non-dual, from the root dvi, or two) is a term used to describe the unitary philosophies and religious movements in India. Rather than a definition of these schools of thought as unitary or monist, the negative description is generally used. Advaita is usually translated as “non-dual.” Duality would imply that there is more than one reality; non-duality implies that there is nowhere a second to the one reality. A number of philosophies in Indian tradition are conventionally called advaita. Their character- istics vary considerably. Best known is “absolute advaita, ” formulated by the Vedanta founder S HANKARA , in which the individual self, and all apparently separate selves, are understood to be nothing but the ultimate Self, that is, non-dual with it; there are no distinctions between selves. A further aspect of Shankara’s advaita system is that the world is false or MAYA , illusion. Only the one BRAHMAN is true. The views of R AMANUJA and V ALLABHA are also technically referred to as advaita or non-dualistic, as both their systems maintain that individual selves are nothing but the ultimate Self. However, they both also include qualifying language to show that they do not hold Shankara’s absolute view. In their understanding, the highest Self or brahman is God and therefore has certain inherent characteristics that distinguish it from any other self. No individual self can possess the power and supremacy of the divinity; in fact, both Ramanuja and Vallabha see the individual selves as being distinct from each other. Similarly, Ramanuja and Vallabha qualify their advaita belief that the world or universe is in fact nothing but the divinity: from another perspective the world is different from the divinity. Many other Vedantins similarly could be called advaita with these sorts of reservations. They sometimes use terms like Dvaitadvaita (non- dualist and dualist) or B HEDABHEDA (both different and non-different). Philosophically they are quite similar to Ramanuja and Vallabha. Finally, most TANTRIC philosophical systems are also termed advaita or non-dual. In these cases, the individual self is understood as being precisely brahman, God or Goddess, with no reservations. The power inherent in the divinity is understood to belong to any individual, at the highest level of realization. The world too is understood to be non-dual with the divinity. Further reading: M. M.

Africa, Hinduism in Hinduism is practiced throughout the African continent but is primarily focused in South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, and Ghana. According to 2000 census data, nearly 1 million Hindus live in South Africa, the largest concentration of followers on the continent. India has had a long history of interaction with East Africa, first recorded as trade during the time of the Roman Empire, which exported products and slaves from East Africa and imported Indian cloth and spices. An Indian presence in Africa has been discovered at archaeological sites in Zim- babwe and the Swahili coast. Remains of small Indo-African colonies have also been identified on Madagascar and Zanzibar. Zanzibar appears to have been the center of South Asian mercantilism, which predated the entry of the Europeans. Even today words from Indian languages can be found in the Swahili language. The trade initiated by the Roman Empire ebbed for centuries, but the onset of European colonization of Africa and India, and particu- larly the British Empire, renewed communication between East Africa and India, as Kenya, Uganda, and South Africa became part of the British Empire and began to be settled by South Asian colonists. Europeans presided over a flourishing of trade across the Indian Ocean that included the German colony of Tanzania (German East Africa), although they also suppressed the slave trade. The Indian community in Zanzibar grew to include Hindus, Muslims, Roman Catholics from Goa, Buddhists from Sri Lanka, Sikhs, and Parsees (Zoroastrians from India). Construction by the British of the Kenya- Uganda railway generated another emigration of South Asian workers to East Africa. First Muslims, and later Hindus, arrived as construction laborers. After completion of the railway, many remained to create Indian bazaars and shops along the new line. The British practice of separating different ethnic groups into homogeneous colonies kept Indian immigrants in segregated communities. Racist attitudes and policies among the European colonists prompted various South Asian groups to organize politically. Schools were founded in order to educate South Asians. After World War II, nationalist movements among the indigenous African population channeled resentment of the financial success of the Asians and threatened the South Asian communities. Even under duress, South Asians continued to immigrate to East Africa and to assist in the development of Hindu communities there. The majority of the Hindu population in East Africa is from the Gujarat (70 percent) and Punjab regions; all but the lowest castes are represented. As a result of constant communication with India, Hindus in East Africa practice the religion of the subcontinent, although members of the different castes interact more freely in East Africa than in India. Various temples allow the Hindu popula- tion to worship their respective deities. In 1972 Idi Amin expelled all Hindus from Uganda. Twenty years later Uganda allowed the Hindu population to return. Today there are two Hindu temples in Uganda, and 65 percent of the South Asian population in Uganda is Hindu. The Hindu population continues to be sepa- rate from other ethnic and religious groups in Africa, as the indigenous and European popula- tions of Africa tend to be primarily Christian or Muslim. Modern movements, such as the V EDANTA S OCIETIES and R AMAKRISHNA M AT H AND M ISSION and the S AT YA S AI B ABA movement can be found, although traditional Hinduism and Hindu move- ments remain of interest to the immigrants and their descendants.

It was the same inden- tured servant scheme that took other Indian populations to Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago. Hindus arrived at the South African port of Natal in 1860 to work on plantations. The laborer population increased over the following decades with the construction of continental railroads. Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu are among the Indian states from which the first Hindus emigrated. During the early decades, Hindus preserved a broad array of rituals and customs even through they shared temple space across various sects. The temples became eclec- tic places of worship and helped to solidify a cultural identity for Hindus living far away from their Indian homes. Most laborers remained in Africa after their contracts of servitude ended and established per- manent settlements. An Indian merchant class soon formed around the developing communi- ties. Revenues accumulated for the construction and maintenance of the first temples, built on plantations or at the outskirts of towns. Large temples built as early as the 1880s still stand in Durban at the Umgeni Road Temple Complex. The Umbilo Shree Ambalavanaar Alayam Temple of Durban, built in 1875, is recorded as the first proper Hindu temple built on the continent. After it was destroyed in 1905 by the flooding of the Umbilo River, the temple was revitalized in 1946 and was dedicated as a national monu- ment in 1980. The Umbilo Temple continues to operate as a favored place of Hindu worship, celebrating the annual fire walking ceremony each spring. In 1913 laws were passed in South Africa to curb immigration. Nevertheless, before strict apartheid appeared, South Asians were relatively free to travel and to own land. In response to the policies of apartheid, M OHANDAS K ARAMCHAND G ANDHI , during his 21-year residency in South Africa, first developed his method of social action and nonviolent protest. In 1947 the South African government passed the Group Areas Act, which enforced strict segregation of all people of color. Previously, South Asians and indigenous Africans had worked together and shared tra- ditions through free intercommunication. The Group Areas Act precluded the possibilities of free communication and forced South Asians and Africans to leave desirable locations and settle in segregated townships in more undesirable areas. Hindu congregations were scattered across the country, isolated from each other and cut off from India. Temples and community centers were created in these highly segregated commu- nities. Between 1968 and 1973 the government of South Africa established a policy of conver- sion to Christianity for the Hindu population, which left Hindu communities cut off from their traditions and unable to socialize youth into the Hindu heritage. The A RYA S AMAJ movement fought the South African policies of apartheid. The movement, begun in India in 1875, entered South Africa in 1906 and Kenya and Tanzania later on. As a social service and educational organization, the Arya Samaj served poor Hindus, but it also affirmed the Vedic tradition and established schools. The movement effectively dissuaded Hindus from converting to Christianity, despite the presence of influential Christian missions. In Tanzania the Hindu Mandal, established in 1910, offered welfare programs, youth activities, and medical services. Other Hindus from diverse backgrounds joined to retain their tradition in the face of sig- nificant challenges to its existence. With the end of apartheid in the early 1990s, Hindus were again able to travel and have contact with India. A number of active Hindu missions coun- tered the growing influence of Christian mis- sionaries. One exemplary mission was begun by Swami Shankarananda. The swami arrived in South Africa in 1907 and helped organize Africa, Hinduism in 11 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 11 12/14/06 9:28:10 AM"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Hindu practice, spread Hindu teaching, and revive festivals. Schools were established under his direction, focused on the study of traditional Hindu scripture. In 1912 Shankarananda orga- nized the first South African Hindu Conference, which established the South African Maha Sabha, which maintained ties among 44 institutes. Shan- karananda’s work opened the way for other missionaries, including Swami Adhyananda and Pandit Rishi Ram, to establish their own work in the country. The work of these early missionaries inspired movements in the later decades of the 20th century. Hindus entered Mauritius in the early 19th century as indentured workers for French sugar plantations. After Great Britain suppressed the slave trade, the colonial French farmers needed a new source of cheap labor. In time the population of Indians in Mauritius grew considerably. Today Hindus make up 68 percent of the total popula- tion. Most Hindus live in the rural areas and still work on plantations. Arya Samaj is also active in Mauritius. Recently neo-Hindu movements have grown in popularity on the continent. In both Kenya and South Africa the I NTERNATIONAL S OCIETY FOR K RISHNA C ONSCIOUSNESS became influential in the latter part of the 20th century. The R AMAKRISHNA M AT H AND M ISSION , and the Divine Life Soci- ety of Swami S HIVANANDA Saraswai have also become popular. In Ghana, where Indian mer- chants arrived during the 20th century, a mission- ary known as the Black Monk of Africa founded a monastery in Accra in 1977. With a small but devoted following, the monastery provides ser- vices to Hindu communities. The A NANDA M ARGA Y OGA S OCIETY has also established a popular fol- lowing in Ghana. Only five Hindu families live in Senegal at present. The observance of Hindu festivals continues in Africa largely unchanged from Indian sources. Each year in October D IVALI , or the festival of lights, is celebrated across Africa. In South Africa, the popular festival lasts into Novem- ber and includes both Hindu and non-Hindu participants. In Kenya, Divali is recognized as a national holiday. Communities in Tanzania and Ghana also celebrate Divali. Other festivals observed across Africa include the popular sum- mer celebration H OLI , the festival of colors. Sev- eral local festivals are also observed according to regional customs. Although Hindus have maintained a cultural identity and are generally respected throughout Africa, some Hindus have become increasingly alarmed over the tactics of Christian missionar- ies. Some of the growing numbers of American and European Christian missionaries have insti- gated divisions among African communities. For example, some Christian evangelicals have dis- seminated portrayals of Hindus as followers of demonic gods and goddesses, fueling religious tensions. In South Africa in recent years, several Hindu organizations have petitioned Christian evangelicals to condemn attempts to convert Hindus and have protested against the use of propaganda that depicts Hindus as devil worship- pers. The tactics have ignited a new call for Hindu unity and for peaceful efforts to counter Christian evangelicalism. See also C ARIBBEAN REGION ; D IASPORA .

In South India, for instance, there is a tradition called Agamanta S HAIVISM that relies upon 28 agamas. In this tradi- tion, the V EDAS are referred to as N IGAMA . Agamas tend to be fairly late texts (compared to the Vedas); the earliest agama could hardly have been written before the sixth century C . E . Though many of the agamas of the diverse tantric tradi- tions are philosophical, others focus on Shaivite temple ritual, including the layout of temples, the installation of icons, and the ritual forms to be used. In this sense, they are foundational texts for temple Hinduism. In a more limited sense, an agama is a tantric text that takes the form of a teaching by S HIVA to P ARVATI or another goddess. (In this context, a Nigama is a text taught by the goddess to Shiva.) Finally, agama is a linguistic term used in P ANINI , The great Sanskrit grammarian, for an augment added to a base to form a complete word. Further reading: J. A.

Agastya (also Agasti) Agastya was one of the Vedic RISHI s (inspired poets); his name is given as the author of several hymns in the first of the 10 chapters of the R IG V EDA . He is said to be the son of both M ITRA and V ARUNA , both of whose seed was emitted upon sight of the celestial APSARAS URVASHI . Agastya then was born in a water jar. (A similar story exists about the conception of D RONA in a bucket.) In the M AHABHARATA and later literature Agas- tya became an important rishi. In the Mahabharata itself there are a number of stories about him. One tale frequently mentioned in Indian litera- ture relates how Agastya helped the gods destroy demons who had hidden in the ocean by drink- ing up the entire ocean. In another tale Agastya restores the world to order: the V INDHYA mountain grew jealous of mount M ERU , the central mountain of our universe around which the Sun and Moon always go, so he began to raise his head in order to block the path of the celestial orbs. Agastya, GURU of the Vindhya mountain, went to Vindhya and forced him to lower his head in obeisance, and to keep his head lowered while Agastya headed in the southern direction. Agastya, however, never returned. This notion of the Vindhya’s bowing to Agastya is associated with the migration of the A RYANS and particularly the B RAHMINS to South India. Agastya is venerated in the south of India, where he is said to have been the first to organize the Tamil grammar. Tolkappiyar, the author of the oldest known Tamil grammar, is considered one of Agastya’s 12 students. Agastya was also said to have been a member of the first two Tamil Sangams or literary academies, which were inundated by the sea. (The literature of the third and last Sangam is understood to be still extant, but, of course, the Sangams are not historically verifiable.) In Tamil Nadu Agastya is mythologically asso- ciated with SHIVA , who it is said to have sent Agastya to the south. In the tantric tradition of the S RI V IDYA , Agastya is said to be the husband of L OPAMUDRA , the female founder of one of the sri vidya lineages. In the Ramayana Agastya was visited at his ASHRAM by R AMA and became an adviser to him.

Agehananda Bharati, Swami (1923–1991) Western Hindu monastic Swami Agehananda Bharati was an Austrian-born Hindu monk and an important scholar of Indian culture and languages. Leopold Fischer was born in Vienna, Austria, on April 20, 1923, to a retired cavalry captain, Hans Fischer, and his wife, Margarete. In a youth of considerable privilege, Leopold and his brother Hans were closer emotionally to their governess, Frau Blumel, than to their parents, who, according to Leopold, were not interested in understanding and communicating with their sons. At age 13 Leopold joined the Indian Club, as he was already keen on India and all things Indian, and began to study H INDI and classical S ANSKRIT ; the next year he decided to become a professional Indologist. On his 16th birthday, after Hitler took over Austria, Fischer took an oath to fight for India’s freedom and became a member of Hitler’s “Free India” Legion, an organization based on anti-British politics and Aryan racist thought. Also on his birthday, he took vows to become a Hindu by honoring the five things of the cow (milk, buttermilk, butter, urine, and dung) while renouncing the sixth thing of the cow, namely, its flesh. He was given the Hindu name Ramachandra by a traveling Hindu preacher, Bhai Sachidanand. During the war, he served with the Indian Legion of the Ger- man army in the European theater, expanding his language skills to include several contempo- rary Indian languages. In January 1949, Fischer landed in Bombay (Mumbai), having written to many Indian con- tacts he had made in Europe. He lived in R AMA - KRISHNA ashrams, first in Calcutta (Kolkata), then in Almora. After two years, he decided that the Ramakrishna Math was not his ordained path; nor was its founder, Swami V IVEKANANDA (1863– 1902), his ordained teacher, and he became a novice in a Hindu monastery. He was initiated into the Dasanami SANNYASI order of Hinduism by Swami Vishvananda Bharati on the banks of the Ganges at B ENARES (Varanasi), where he became Agehananda Bharati (bliss through homeless- ness). In this initiation into monasticism ( DIKSHA ), he became the first Westerner to embrace monas- tic Hinduism fully. He then began a 1,500-mile trek of India on foot as a mendicant monk with a begging bowl. Agehananda Bharati continued his scholarly activities in such diverse subjects as cultural anthropology, South Asian studies, linguistics, and comparative philosophy. He taught at Delhi University, Banaras Hindu University, and Nalanda Institute in India; at a Buddhist academy in Bang- kok, Thailand; and at the University of Tokyo. In 1956, Bharati immigrated to the United States as a research associate for Washington University. In 1957 he joined the anthropology faculty at Syracuse University and became the Ford-Maxwell Professor of South Asian studies. He became a U.S. citizen in 1968. His publica- tions include 500 articles, essays, and books that report on Hindu monasticism and worldview and have been widely read by scholars and general readers alike. His interpretation of Hinduism through anthro- pological and personal lenses have been influential among Western Hindus as well as scholars. Agehananda Bharati died of cancer at a friend’s house in Pittsford, New York, on May 14, 1991, at the age of 68.

Aghori sadhus Paradoxically named, the Aghori (“non-terrible”) SADHUS are among the most strange and frighten- ing of all the mendicants of India. Their practice is similarly called aghora —“non-terrible.” They inhabit cremation grounds, where they perform their esoteric rituals. They eat the flesh of human corpses and smear their bodies with ashes from human cremations. They carry begging bowls made from human skulls (they do not beg but will not refuse anything) and eat their food from them. They are popularly known as evil sorcerers who command fearsome magic powers. The practices of the Aghoris are calculated to outrage; they are known copraphages (eaters of human excrement), and folklore reports their kidnapping and sacrificing children for their out- rageously transgressive rites. They trace their sect to the great guru of the N ATHS , G ORAKHNATH ; they embody the extreme left-handed tantra (see TA N - TRISM ), which finds the divinity everywhere, and they believe that complete release is to be found in discovering the essence of the divinity in that which is most horrific. They are often devotees of the fierce aspect of the GODDESS , but also, of SHIVA . Their origins are probably to be found in the ancient S HAIVA cult of the Kapalikas. These sad- hus are given a wide berth by most contemporary Indians and are looked down upon as evil. Further reading: R. G.

Agni Agni, the god of fire, is one of the most central divinities in the early Vedic tradition. There are more hymns to Agni in the R IG V EDA , the earli- est S ANSKRIT text, than to any other divinity. Agni is sometimes said to be the son of earth and sky. He is also sometimes said to be the offspring of B RAHMA . He is sometimes called the son of A DITI and the R ISHI Kashyapa. Finally, he is also some- times called the son of the rishi Angiras. Agni’s most important role is in the Vedic ritual, where he is the messenger between human- ity and the gods. He is called upon always to take the gods to the ritual place so that they can hear the pleas and praises of the chanters. In Vedic poetry he is called a domestic priest, a poet, and a sage, as though to identify him directly with the R ISHIS . There is a sense of his presence in every home as the hearth fire, and there are a close- ness and intimacy expressed in the Vedic poetry with him that are lacking with many of the other Vedic divinities. He is seen to extend protection to humans in many ways and to grant wealth and length of life. Iconographically, in later times Agni is seen as red or black in color, riding a ram. He is guard- ian of the southeastern direction among the eight guardians of the directions. Fire is considered one of the five elements ( PANCHA BHUTA s ). Further reading: Cornelia Dimmitt and J. A.

(Calcutta: Rupa, 1973). agnichayana The agnichayana, or “ritual of building the fire altar,” was one of the grandest rituals in the Vedic sacrificial tradition; it played an extremely important role in the development of Hinduism. It is most completely described in the sixth book of the S HATAPATHA B RAHMANA , which is attached to the Y AJUR V EDA . The ritual involves building a temporary shelter of posts and roof thatching to serve as the site for the ritual and all of its adjuncts, which last for more than two weeks. Once the shelter has been created, a huge falcon is built from consecrated bricks. This bird is homologized or understood to be P RAJAPATI or the P URUSHA , the Universal Being. Seventeen special- ized priests are required for this most elaborate of Vedic rituals. A sacrifice of 14 goats formed a central part of the early ritual. The agnichayana is understood as a renewal or re-creation of the universe through ritual. A late verse in the R IG V EDA recounts how the Primordial Man offered himself in sacrifice to create all of the universe; the agnichayana reenacts this process. S OMA , the special drug taken by the Vedic B RAH - MINS , was used during this ritual. The agnichayana ritual, and the theory that developed around it, helped define Indian notions of ADVAITA or non-duality—the equation of the individual self with the Universal Self or Real- ity. The Shatapatha Brahamana, where this ritual is described, says that it must be understood as the universe itself. As the later Vedic texts, the Aranyakas, show, this Vedic ritual can be done esoterically within the body and being of one person. If the agnichayana is the Universal Reality and a person’s being is the ritual, then one can conclude that a person’s being is the Universal Reality, or all that is. This insight leads to the philosophical identification of the individual self and the Ultimate Reality, later found explicitly in the Upanishads.

Agni Yoga Society (est. 1920) The Agni Yoga Society was founded in New York in 1920 by the Russian artist Nicholas Roerich (October 9, 1874–December 13, 1947) and his wife, Helena (February 12, 1879–October 5, 1955), and was incorporated in New York City as a nonprofit educational organization. The society’s philosophy emphasizes the evolution of planetary consciousness as a necessary and attainable goal for humankind. Agni Yoga, sometimes referred to as the teach- ing of “Living Ethics,” does not rely on a physical or meditative discipline. It is rather a way of life offering a practice and commitment to directing thought and prioritizing actions for the common good. It is reportedly practiced by thousands in Russia and by several thousand others around the world. Although the teaching reveres Hinduism, Agni Yoga is not considered exclusively Hindu in nature; rather, it involves a synthesis of religious teachings of all ages from around the world. Agni Yoga evolved from Nicholas Roerich’s encounters in London with Mahatma Morya and Mahatma Koot Hoomi (ascended masters in the tradition of T HEOSOPHY ). In March 1920, Nicholas produced the first of the group’s writings; they were followed by several books by Helena. At the request of the Mahatmas the Roerichs moved to New York to share the teachings and to open K 16 agnichayana 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 16 12/14/06 9:28:11 AM"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"cultural centers in America. Several institutes and museums were established, including the Agni Yoga Society. The society has published a set of books called the Agni Yoga Series, which encapsulates their philosophy, a teaching that integrates East- ern beliefs with Western spiritual and scientific thought. Although the society does not offer courses, it provides information on Agni Yoga and welcomes correspondence.

Ahalya The wife of the RISHI Gautama, Ahalya was seduced by I NDRA while her husband was taking his morn- ing bath. Indra took the form of her husband, and though Ahalya knew that Indra was not her husband, she consented to his advances. When the rishi was returning to the hut Indra took the form of a cat and escaped. The rishi, however, knew through his supranormal powers what had occurred. He cursed his wife, turning her to stone, and put a curse on Indra as well. In some versions of the Ahalya story Indra is cursed with the testicles of a ram; in other ver- sions he is cursed with 1,000 vaginas. In the later tale, Indra beseeched the gods to relieve the curse and the vaginas were transformed into 1,000 eyes. This colorful story explains how Indra acquired the epithet “thousand-eyed one.” In the R AMAYANA , R AMA comes upon the stone form of a woman, who, with the touch of his foot, becomes alive again. She is Ahalya. This well-known myth has generated many books and novels in contemporary Indian languages.

In nearly every tradition of Hinduism ahamkara is consid- ered the great spiritual enemy. In YOGA one tran- scends the ego through the calming of the mind and eventually learns to ignore the pernicious pull of ahamkara. In non-dual Vedantic practice, ego is seen as false self, which must be rejected in favor of the transcendent Self that is Ultimate Reality. In the practice of BHAKTI , or devotional YOGA , through chants and MANTRAS one connects to the inner godhead and uproots the ego with service to the Divine. Only in the tantric ( see TANTRISM ) tra- ditions is Ahamkara seen as a positive word, but there, also, it is understood that one’s ego must be transformed into divine “I-ness,” where the mun- dane ego is totally supplanted in identification with God. In Jain and S IKH traditions ahamkara is seen also as a supreme negative; ego must be controlled and finally eliminated.

C . E .) and is primarily associated with the Jain (see J AINISM ) and Buddhist traditions at that time. It gradually is taken into the Brahminical tradition and becomes central to it up to the present day. The notion of ahimsa is applied toward animal life primarily but in Jain tradition is recognized in the case of plants also. Ahimsa understands that all animals (and for the Jains certain plants) have souls and that the killing of any animal (or certain plants) whether for eating or not accumulates karmic (see KARMA ) demerit to the one who does it. The Jains were the most radical in this regard, and their monks were enjoined to sweep their path clear with whisks to prevent stepping on insects and sometimes wore (and wear) masks over their mouths to prevent the breathing in and killing of small invisible beings and insects. Jains would never eat meat and would not countenance the eating of meat or the killing of any animal for any reason in their tradition. Because Jains believe that there were small invisible beings everywhere, monks were required to walk and move extremely circumspectly and slowly. Agriculture was traditionally forbidden to all Jains because it involved violence to beings, invisible and visible, who live in the ground. Buddhists in India adhered to a strict notion of ahimsa, but Buddhist monks would accept meat if given it, while Jain monks would never do so. The notion of ahimsa is the primary motive for Indian vegetarianism and orthodox B RAHMINS too avoid all meat, animal products, and eggs (which are seen to be living embryos). Because of ahimsa there are certain orthodox Hindu ascetics who will not wear leather shoes or sandals, but will wear only wooden shoes. Mohandas Karamchand G ANDHI expanded the notion of ahimsa to the interpersonal realm and developed it into a philosophy of personal action. Gandhi took the word to mean “nonviolence” in all its aspects, and, while he was very strictly veg- etarian as part of his vow of ahimsa, he believed that it should become a general principle of human conduct, in all relations between people. Particularly he trained people in the notion of “nonviolent” response to all violence and provo- cation as a moral as well as a political matter. His political use of ahimsa was adopted by many great political leaders of the 20th century, including Martin Luther King Jr. Further reading: Christopher Key Chapple, Nonviolence to Animals, Earth and Self in Asian Traditions (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1993); Erik H.

Airavata (Airavana) Airavata is the huge, four-tusked white elephant who is the vehicle of the king of the gods, I NDRA . When the elephants of the eight directions are listed, Airavata is the elephant of the western direction. Airavata appears in the M AHABHARATA as the mount of Indra, but is particularly referenced in the R AMAYANA in the battle with the raksasas. In this battle, he is attacked by the raksasas and loses his tusks, whereupon he turns and gouges R AV - ANA , the demon king. In the myth of the churning of the M ILK O CEAN , Airavata emerges along with many other auspicious beings and things.

Aitareya Upanishad Aitareya is a matronymic or patronymic deriving from the S ANSKRIT root itara. It means “son of itara ” (either masculine or feminine), who would be his mother or father. This is an ancient R IG V EDIC sage who also goes by the name of Mahi- dasa. Credited to him are the Aitareya Brahmana, the Aitareya Aranyaka, and the Aitareya Upani- shad, all texts attached to the R IG V EDA . The Aita- reya Upanishad is found in the Aitareya Aranyaka, constituting chapters 4 to 6 of that work. The Aitareya Upanishad begins with cosmo- logical verses showing how the ultimate being, the ATMAN or Self, created the worlds, the ele- ments, and human beings. Important here is the connection between each of the elements of the divine PURUSHA , which is the template Person, and the elements of nature aspects of the cosmos and the human being. From the original Person fire, air, Sun, the quarters of space, the Moon, death, and water emerge. All of these elements again go into making up the human being. Once this takes place the Self enters into the human being that has emerged as the result of his creation. This then makes clear that the self of a human being is the Ultimate Self, which is the source of everything. Further reading: S. N.

The caves date from the second century B . C . E . to seventh century C . E . There are 29 caves at Ajanta, which are carved into solid stone halfway up a large hill that curves gently away, to the left of the visitor. In the middle of the steep incline is a walk- way, which appears made on a natural cliff. All of the caves at Ajanta were done by the Buddhists. Some were clearly used as monastic dwellings, and others were chaityas or shrine rooms. Some of the caves have beautiful frescoes depicting scenes from the Buddhist Jatakas (tales of the life of the B UDDHA ). The frescoes of Ajanta show a development of nearly 1,000 years of fresco art. Other caves have impressive figures of the Buddha in high relief. Further reading: Benoy K.

Ajapa Yoga Foundation (est. 1974) The Ajapa Yoga Foundation was established in 1974 by followers of Guru Janardan Paramahansa (1888– 1980). It promotes ajapa, a breathing and medita- tion technique not widely known but practiced for centuries by RISHI s (spiritual adepts) in India. Prac- titioners believe that it is the pure and original YOGA and not a derivative of any prior teaching. The primary teaching of the foundation is that humans see themselves as living in a world of suffering and desire because they have lost their true sense of self. Through the practice of ajapa yoga, they can realize their true identity. Today, five ashrams are maintained in India, Bangladesh, and California. The modern teaching traces back to the 1860s, when Swami Purnananda Paramahansa (1834– 1928) learned the ancient technique from Matang Rishi at Siddhashrama, a remote Tibetan mon- astery. After five years of training, Purnananda returned to Bengal and established ashrams with the purpose of reintroducing ajapa. Upon Purananda’s death, leadership passed to Swami Bhumananda Paramahansa (1873–1958), who was in turn succeeded by his disciple, Guru Janardan. In the 1960s Janardan organized the World Conference on Scientific Yoga in New Delhi, where he made the acquaintance of many Westerners. He then toured Europe and North America and established ashrams and centers in Hamburg, Montreal, New York, and California. In 1966, Janardan found a baby on the bank of the Ganges River in India, named him Guru Prasad (b. 1966), and raised him to be his successor as a living master of ajapa yoga. Guru Prasad assumed leadership of the ashrams and foundation at age 14 and continues to teach practitioners and to maintain the ashrams and centers.

Ajivikas The Ajivikas were an ancient cult known mostly through references in contemporaneous Buddhist and Jain literature. The founder of the cult was Maskariputra (d. 484 B . C . E .), who had learned from earlier teachers in the tradition. The last ele- ment of Ajivika tradition died in India around the 15th century. As did the followers of S AMKHYA , the Ajivikas did not believe in a god or gods. They believed only in KARMA and the round of births and rebirth, and were strictly deterministic. Each of us, they thought, must live through these cycles for a fabulously long period of time—8,400,000 great eons; no amount of good or bad deeds would make any difference. The Ajivikas were criticized in some texts for licentious- ness, but the evidence indicates that, compelled as they believed by fate, they were devoted ascetics. Further reading: B. M.

Akka Mahadevi Virashaiva saint Akka Mahadevi, a talented mystical poet who died while still a young woman, is regarded as one of the early saints of the V IRASHAIVA sect founded by B ASAVANNA . Akka Mahadevi was born in the 12th century in Karnataka. As a young and beautiful maiden, she was seen by the then king Kaushika, who fell hopelessly in love with her. Despite the attempts of his ministers to distract him from marrying a commoner, he persisted in asking them to arrange for her to be his wife. Because the king was not a S HAIVITE and she was a devotee of S HIVA Akka Mahadevi persisted in refusing to marry the king. Finally the king threatened her parents with death if she did not marry him. Mahadevi could no longer refuse, but she exacted a high price: she was to be allowed to worship Shiva as she liked, spend time with Shiva devotees as she liked, and be with the king only as she liked. These condi- tions would be permanent; the king would have the right to overrule them only three times. Mahadevi sadly proceeded through the mar- riage rites. Once married, by day she would focus on the Shiva LINGAM in prayer and spend time with Shaivite teachers and devotees; at night she would suffer the attentions of the king. Before she would go to meet him she would remove all her jewelry and makeup in order to appear bedraggled and disheveled.

Mahadevi then abandoned the king and set out to be near the form of Shiva on a mountain outpost some distance away. There she worshipped contin- uously, abandoning all care for her body or for the world. She had already begun to go naked in the palace, uninterested in worldly things; her trip to the mountain was also without clothes. Mahadevi is depicted in all iconography as naked, her pri- vacy protected by her long full hair. Her parents begged her to return to the king, but she refused. The king tried to lure her back by converting to Shaivism, but this too failed. Though the stories vary, it seems certain that Mahadevi met Allamaprabhu of the Virashaivas and joined the sect. She is said to have died after her visit to the mountain, but there must have been a long enough interlude for her to produce her beautiful mystical poetry, in which she finally found Shiva in a formless reality beyond even the notion of God.

S HAIVITE akshamalas are typically made of the rudraksha ( Eleocarpus ganitrus ) seed—spherical, brownish red, with a texture similar to that of a peach pit. V AISHNAVA akshamalas are typically made of seeds of tulasi, the Indian basil plant, sacred to Vaishnavites. Akshamalas can also be made of coral, crystal, or other gems; some TANTRICS use small skulls carved of ivory. Many akshamalas have 50 beads to corre- spond with the number of letters of the alphabet. Others have 108 or other numbers of beads.

Prayaga in S ANSKRIT means “confluence,” and it is the place where the holy Y AMUNA and the most sacred G ANGES meet. It is also understood that an ancient sacred river mentioned in the V EDAS , the Sarasvati, invisibly joins these two. Thus, this city is considered most holy because these three rivers join there. Prayag is one of the seven holy pilgrimage cities of India. It is said that B RAHMA did the first ashva medha or HORSE SACRIFICE there. Every 12 years during the month of Magha (January–Feb- ruary), the great K UMBHA M ELA festival is held in Prayag, attracting millions of pilgrims and devo- tees. Further reading: S. K.

Their devotional songs, written in the Tamil language, were collected in the Nalayira Divya Prabandham (The sacred collection of the four thousand songs) by Nathamuni, the first of the great Vaishnavite teachers of Tamil Nadu. The songs of the Alvars are used today in Tamil Vaishnava temples and in ritual contexts alongside the sacred S ANSKRIT recitations. They praise Lord V ISHNU in an intimate, highly passion- ate style, frequently referring to his incarnations as R AMA , K RISHNA , and other deities. The acts and adventures of all these incarnations are lovingly recalled and praised. The poems frequently refer to the well-known shrines of the Tamil country, which were visited by the Alvars in their pilgrim- ages and travels. The Tamil Alvars are Periyalvar, A NDAL , Kulasekalvar, Tirumalisai, Tondaradipodi Alvar, Tirupanalvar, Maturakavi, Tirumankai, N AMMAL - VA R , Poykai, Putam, and Pey. The latter three are the earliest, dating from 650 to 700 C . E . Two Alvars stand out for their brilliance: Periyalvar (c. ninth century), who composed beautiful verses in praise of Lord Krishna as a child, and Nammalvar (c. 880–930 C . E .), who is the most prolific poet in the Nalayira Divya Prabandham. Nammalvar’s main work, the 1,102-stanza Tiruvaymoli (The divine words from the mouth) was intended to encapsulate the Vedas. The only female Alvar was Andal; her poems expressing her love for Ran- ganatha, the form of Vishnu found at the most sacred Tamil Vaishnavite shrine at Srirangam, are used in Vaishnava wedding ceremonies in Tamil Nadu.

Amarnath Amarnath is a famous shrine to S HIVA in Kashmir, located some 80 miles from Shrinagar, in a moun- tain cave roughly 7,500 feet high. A Shiva LINGAM shape of ice covered with snow is visible at the far end of the cave. This is considered a “natural” or “self-generated” Shiva lingam, created by nature. It is said that Shiva revealed the secret of immortality to P ARVATI at this cave. Beneath the tiger skin on which Shiva sat, pigeon eggs later hatched. Those who do pilgrimage to this place often see the immortal pigeons incubated by the Lord Shiva himself. Some say that the first to make the pilgrimage to this shrine was Bhrigu Rishi. In modern times it is said that a Muslim shep- herd, Buta Malik, was given a sack of coal by a holy man at this site.

During four days in the Hindu month of Ashadha (June–July), just before the rainy season is to begin, the earth goddess is said to menstruate in order to prepare herself for fertility. During this period all plowing, sowing, and other farm- work are suspended. Widows may be required to observe special taboos during Ambuvachi, as they are not involved in procreation.

American Meditation Society The American Meditation Society was founded in 1976 by Purushottam Narshinhran Valodia (March 3, 1932–May 17, 1988), also known as Gururaj Ananda Yogi. Its teaching is focused on MEDITATION . Drawn as a child to spiritual concerns, the guru ran away from his home in Gujarat at age five to visit temples. He wandered from village to village for six months, until found by his parents. As he wandered, he discovered that the temple gods were lifeless and did not speak to him. Con- tinuing his search into adulthood, he eventually discovered that what he sought lay within himself. After SELF - REALIZATION , he set about to become a spiritual teacher in the West. He moved from his native Gujarat to South Africa and became a successful businessman. In 1975, he retired from business to become a full- time spiritual teacher, founding the International Foundation for Spiritual Unfoldment in 1975. By 1976, the organization had spread to nine coun- tries in the British Commonwealth, Europe, and America, where the American Meditation Society was founded that year in California. Gururaj Ananda Yogi taught that his path is not a religion, but the basis that underlies all religions. His teaching is to awaken each individual to the same reality that he discovered, primarily through the practice of meditation. The society offers courses in meditation and the intonation of sound during meditation. During his lifetime, students would send pictures of themselves to Gururaj, who would meditate upon the pictures and hear each person’s unique sound in the universe, which became the student’s personal mantra for meditation.

American Yoga Association (est. 1968) The American Yoga Association, the first nonprofit organization in the United States dedicated to yoga education, was founded by Alice Christensen (no date of birth) in 1968. Located in Sarasota, Florida, it serves as a resource center for both stu- dents and teachers, focusing on V EDANTA philoso- phy, HATHA YOGA , and MEDITATION techniques. In 1953 Christensen began to have visionary experiences of a white light followed by transcen- dental communications from Swami S HIVANANDA S ARASWATI (1887–1963) of Rishikesh. Subsequent dreams encouraged her to pursue the path of yoga.

She then began to study with S WAMI R AMA (1900–72) and to travel in India. Christensen began to teach yoga in 1965. As a student of Swami Rama she represented his teach- ings in the West. In 1968 she founded the Light Society (known later as the American Yoga Asso- ciation) in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. By 1972 11 yoga centers were established in India, Australia, and the United States. During this time the first book published by the association was released, The American Yoga Association Beginner’s Manual. After Swami Rama’s death in 1972, Christensen continued to study yoga as a student of Sri L AKSH - MANJOO (1907–92), a teacher of K ASHMIRI S HAIVISM . Christensen would remain his student, frequently traveling to Kashmir, until his death in 1992. The American Yoga Association provides edu- cational services to program developers in health- related fields as well as writers seeking information on yoga. During the late 1960s Christensen inau- gurated a program called Easy Does It Yoga, which the association continues to offer to seniors and those with physical limitations. The program has gained wide respect for its effectiveness in help- ing older adults regain independence. Following the Kashmiri Shaivism system, the association emphasizes a self-directed approach to yoga that encourages its participants to engage in inner awareness for the purpose of releasing potential for self-knowledge. The association offers books and videotapes by Christensen.

It is considered a nectar of immortality of sorts and is taken during certain rites to achieve transcendent insight. Perhaps because the Moon is sometimes called Soma, amrita in the Vedic context is said to be found on the Moon; it feeds the Fathers in the dark half of the Moon’s phases and the gods in the bright half. The story goes that the gods and antigods ( asuras ) once joined together to churn the M ILK O CEAN to make amrita. A huge mountain was used as a churning stick and the divine snake A DISHESHA (or Vasuki) was used as the rope around the stick. Many things emerged from the Milk Ocean at that time including the special divine wish-giving cow who appears in later mythology. Finally, the amrita emerged held in a cup by the divine physician Dhanvantari. The gods then plotted with V ISHNU so that the antigods ( asuras ) would not be able to drink the nectar. Vishnu took on his form of the dazzling maiden, M OHINI , and as he distracted the asuras, the gods drank all the amrita themselves. One story says that when the gods drank the amrita it spilled at four sites: H ARDVAR , Nasik, Ujjain, and A LLAHABAD (Prayag). In esoteric HATHA YOGA it is thought that amrita can be accumulated in the skull above the posterior of the nasal pas- sage. This amrita is understood to be transformed semen that can create bodily immortality. By sev- ering the frenulum, or skin attachment under the bottom of the tongue, a yogi can force his tongue backward into what is called the Khechara MUDRA , in order to drink the amrita.

Since the 1920s, SRF had taken prime responsibility for publishing and circulating Yogananda’s writings, but after his death some followers thought that the SRF’s editing distorted the texts. As SRF owned the copyrights to most of Yogananda’s writings, the Amrita Foundation set about reprinting materials that had passed into the public domain, including the original editions of Yogananda’s writings. Among the reprints were the initial writings and essential teachings of the infrastructure of Yogananda’s work—the lessons on KRIYA YOGA distributed to students. The home study course is a hallmark fea- ture of the foundation’s services, making the kriya lessons available to everyone. Issues are sent out each month to subscribers. The focal points of these lessons include the principles of MEDITATION and concentration, as well as physical practices designed to facilitate the spiritual development that kriya yoga can help achieve. Advice on diet and nutrition is also promoted; an important aspect of kriya yoga is promotion of a healthy body in order to awaken KUNDALINI energy as the vehicle to spiritual bliss ( ANANDA ).

Amritanandamayi Ma (1953– ) teacher who embodies the Divine Mother Ammachi (beloved Mother), as Amritanandamayi Ma is affectionately known, is a world-renowned Hindu guru recognized as an incarnation of the Holy Mother of Hinduism. Sudhamani (her birth name) was born on September 27, 1953, to a poor fisherman in the small village of Parayakadavu in the state of Ker- ala, showing signs of divinity from the start. The birth itself, which was foreseen by a wandering religious mendicant, was said to be painless for her mother, and the infant did not cry, beaming a happy smile instead. At six months she began speaking prayers and singing songs in praise of Krishna. Her fervor increased, and by age six she was found daily immersed in JAPA ( MANTRA recitation), devotional singing, and quiet MEDITA - TION . This practice estranged her from family and friends who did not understand. She took refuge in a deep spirituality. In the mid-1970s she had a series of pro- found visions and meditative experiences, which firmly established her intimate relationship with the Divine Mother and set her on her present mission to Amritanandamayi Ma (b. 1953), a famous devotional teacher from South India known for physically embrac- ing all who go to her (Ma Amritananda Center, San Ramon, California) K 26 Amritanandamayi Ma 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 26 12/14/06 9:28:13 AM"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"“Give solace to suffering humanity.” Her mission has matured into a dynamic global congregation. She runs an orphanage near her ASHRAM , housing about 400 poor villagers. She has built hospitals in Bombay and Ernakulam and industrial and com- puter training centers to help poor students learn vocational skills. She advocates the establishment of schools at every ashram to impart religious education. The house where Ammachi was born has become an ashram and the headquarters of Mata Amritananda Mayi Trust. The ashram, Amritapuri, offers food and accommodations for travelers, funds social services for indigents, and sponsors humanitarian activities around the world. Hundreds of devotees work there on social service projects all day and attend daily sessions with Ammachi. At each of her daily appearances, Ammachi sits on a simple chair on stage with 30 male students, brahmacharis, seated on mats on her right and 30 female students, brahmachari- nis, seated on her left, all dressed in white. Each DARSHAN , which can last for six to eight hours, includes the singing of BHAJANS while each of the attendees walks forward for a blessing and an embrace from Ammachi, who remains on stage until all have experienced her embrace. Ammachi tours the globe with a constant schedule of appearances held at major cities in many countries. She does not deliver teachings or speeches. Instead, she blesses all those who go forward. Often thousands of admirers stand in line for hours to be hugged by Ammachi. She says that her life itself is her message and teaching. “An unbroken stream of love flows from me towards all beings in the universe,” she has said. “That is my inborn nature.” At gatherings she disappears behind a screen, where she puts on the clothes of K RISHNA or D EVI , the goddess. She returns to serve as a channel for God, blessing the audience. She says, “The ATMAN , or Self, that is in me is also within you. If you can realize that Indivisible Principle ever shining in you, you will become That.” Ammachi has initiated 11 senior disciples into the order of sannyas (renunciants), two of whom are women. She has followed Hindu tradition by having Swami Dhruvananda of the R AMAKRISHNA M AT H AND M ISSION give the rites of sannyas to Swami Amritaswarupananda, her first disciple to renounce worldly life. Since then, Amritaswaru- pananda has performed the rites with Ammachi in attendance. In 1993 Ammachi was named one of three presidents of Hinduism by the Parliament of the World’s Religions in Chicago. That same year Hin- duism Today bestowed a “Hindu of the Year” award upon her. In 1995 she spoke at the interreligion meeting of the United Nations. A movie, Darshan, released in 2006, portrays her life and the services organized by the headquarters of her trust.

Many teachers also have “ananda” appended to their names, such as Nikhilananda, “He who has realized total divine bliss,” or Satyananda, “He who has realized the divine bliss of the One Truth,” or Muktananda, “He who has realized the divine bliss in liberation from birth and rebirth.” Further reading: John Dudley Ball, Ananda—Where Yoga Lives (Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green Uni- versity Popular Press, 1982); J.

Ananda Ashram, Monroe, New York (est. 1964) Ananda Ashram was founded in 1964 in Monroe, New York, as the headquarters of the Yoga Society of New York, Inc., which was founded by Rama- murti S. Mishra, M.D. (1923–93), also known as Swami Brahmananda Saraswati, a teacher of Raja YOGA . The ashram serves as a spiritual retreat and educational center that integrates principles of yoga and V EDANTA with a commitment to an East-West “cultural exchange.” The center offers instruction in MEDITATION , Vedanta philosophy, HATHA YOGA , S ANSKRIT , dance, and music, as well as regular workshops and retreats. Guest teachers and artists from diverse traditions offer courses. By the 1950s Mishra had gained renown in the East and West for his expertise in Eastern and Western medicine, including the system of A YURVEDA . In 1966 he quit the practice of Western medicine and left the United States. He later returned as a doctor of acupuncture and led a number of his ashrams into holistic health, including Ayurveda. In 1984 he took the vow of sannyas (renunciation) from Swami Gangeshva- rananda and was given the name Brahmananda Saraswati. Sri Brahmananda Saraswati also established the Brahmananda Ashram (the Yoga Society of San Francisco, Inc.), in 1972, as well as several medi- tation centers in the United States and around the world. He was a prolific writer who published texts on yoga, a commentary on the writing of the great ADVAITA philosopher Shankaracharya, and translations of Sanskrit texts, in addition to many essays and stories. Much of his teaching is recorded in audio and video formats. Brahman- anda died in 1993. Ananda Ashram is open year round and offers teachings to people of all faiths. Programs offered are nonsectarian and place an emphasis on self- awareness and meditation. The Baba Bhagavandas Publication Trust was established by Brahman- anda in 1993 to publish important works in phi- losophy, medicine, and yoga. Further reading: Ramamurti S.

Ananda Ashrama and Vedanta Centre (est. 1923) Ananda Ashrama of La Crescenta, California, was founded in 1923 by Swami P ARAMANANDA (1884–1940) to facilitate a better understanding between Eastern and Western spiritualities and to disseminate V EDANTA philosophy. The 120-acre retreat features Viswamandir, a temple established in 1928 and dedicated to the world’s great reli- gions. The ashram upholds a model of tolerance and nonsectarianism. By upholding the teachings of Sri R AMAKRISHNA and Swami Paramananda, the ashram assists individuals in discovering prin- ciples for spiritual practice. It teaches the basic tenets of the Vedanta tradition: God is one, human nature is divine, all paths lead to the same goal, and the purpose of life is the realization of God in one’s soul. In line with Paramananda’s belief in equality of the sexes, he ordained women to teach Vedanta, entrusting them to undertake major responsibili- ties in his work in India and the United States. In both countries, he founded schools and orphan- ages to assist women and children in need. In fact, he designated a woman, Sri Mata Gayatri Devi (1906–95), to succeed him as director of the ashram. As a result, the parent order in India, the R AMAKRISHNA M AT H AND M ISSION , excommunicated his centers. Nevertheless, for 55 years Gayatri Devi continued teaching Vedanta in the tradition Ananda Ashrama and Vedanta Centre 29 J"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"of Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Paramananda.

M EDITATION classes, weekly worship services, a lending library, and retreats are offered to the public. Membership is offered to anyone who attends regular services. Through its company, Vedanta Centre Publishers, the ashram publishes and sells books, compact disks, and cas- sette tapes by and about Swami Paramananda.

Ananda Marga Yoga Society (est. 1955) The Ananda Marga Yoga Society describes itself as “an international socio-spiritual movement involved in the twin pursuit of SELF - REALIZATION and service to all of creation.” Ananda Marga, through its educational and charitable affiliates in over 160 countries, claims more than a million followers worldwide. The movement was founded in 1955 in the state of Bihar, India, by Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar (1921–90), better known as Marga Guru Sri S RI A NANDAMURTI , which means “He who attracts others as the embodiment of bliss.” He received enlightenment quite early in his life—he is reported to have been an accomplished yogi by the age of four—and he attracted his first devotees when he was only six. After marrying and getting a job with the railway system, he founded Ananda Marga. From then until his death he authored more than 250 books as Sri Sri Anandamurti. After founding Ananda Marga, Sarkar began to train missionaries to carry his teachings beyond India; today the society has a complex interna- tional organization. Three levels of membership are offered: (1) acharyas —teachers and devotees who devote their lives to the movement and may be employed in many locales around the world; (2) local full-time workers; and (3) margis —mem- bers who are initiated but hold jobs outside the movement. The number of active members is not known, but estimates run as high as several hun- dred thousand. The teaching of the movement involves three dimensions: the practice of tantra yoga, MEDITA - TION , and engagement in social service with the goal of bringing about a more just and humane world. Part of the movement’s discipline is Sarkar’s Sixteen Points, a system of spiritual practices that helps initiates balance the physi- cal, mental, and spiritual aspects of life. Rituals include KIRTAN (singing) and recitation of the mantra Baba Nam Kevalam (the universal Father is everywhere). Ananda Marga stresses public service, includ- ing care of the sick and elderly. Service to others is a means of transformation from the needs of oneself to the needs of others, which is also the path to enlightenment. Because of the movement’s dedication to human service, many organizations have been formed within its ambit. The Ananda Marga Universal Relief Team (AMURT), founded in 1965, and the Ananda Marga Universal Relief Team Ladies (AMURTEL), founded in 1977, address disaster relief around the world. Renais- sance Universal, founded in 1958, encourages intellectuals to design and create programs for improving the human condition. The Education, Relief, and Welfare Section (ERWS) is another organization created to propagate Ananda Marga’s agenda of social service.

He advocated a form of education that encourages simultaneous devel- opment of the physical, mental, and spiritual aspects of humanity. His philosophy extends his emphasis on human development to include animals and plants. He established a global plant exchange program and animal sanctuaries around the world. Sarkar proposed a political program in 1959, called Progressive Utilization Theory (PROUT), which calls for economic democracy and human rights. He also advocated a global bill of rights, constitution, and system of justice. In India, Sarkar’s political activism generated much controversy regarding the movement dur- ing the 1960s and 1970s. He ran unsuccessfully for political office in 1967 and 1968, representing the Proutist Bloc. Many in India saw the Proutists as a terrorist organization, and both PROUT and Ananda Marga were banned in India during the period of national emergency declared by Indira Gandhi. Sarkar was accused, convicted, and sen- tenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to murder former members. In 1978 he won a new trial and was acquitted of the charges. Since the acquittal of its leader, Ananda Marga has recovered slowly in India but has spread widely outside India, including Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States. Led by Acharya Vimala-ananda, the movement entered the United States in 1969 and gained many followers. Ananda Marga has adherents and social bet- terment activities in more than 160 countries and claims more than a million followers worldwide. It supports a variety of schools, clinics, and chil- dren’s homes. It is attempting to put its larger eco- nomic program into effect through the formation of cooperative communities, the largest of them Ananda Nagar (the City of Bliss) in West Bengal, and promoting rural development. International headquarters of the movement is in West Bengal. The society produces several periodicals, including a monthly newsletter and a magazine. Sadvipra, begun in 1973. A branch of Ananda Marga, Renaissance Universal, is dedicated to working toward a renaissance of social institutions based on neohumanistic values. This renaissance will involve a redesign of the major institutions of society and will foster individual growth and self- realization. Twice a year Renaissance Universal organizes a worldwide forum on contemporary issues. Its quarterly journal, New Renaissance, fea- tures articles on neohumanism, art, and science in service of self-realization, and social justice.

Anandamayi Ma (1896–1982) mystic and avatar of Shakti Born Nirmala Sundari Bhattacharya in Vadyakuta, East Bengal (now Bangladesh), on April 30, 1896, Anandamayi Ma was a mystic considered by her disciples as an AVATA R of S HAKTI , the manifest energy of the divine, and as God in the form of the goddess K ALI . Her father, Bipin Behari Bhattacharya, was head of a poor Brahmin family and was often in religious ecstasy as he sang songs from the Vaish- navite tradition. Her mother, Moksada Sundari Devi, also experienced states of religious emotion and reported visits by avatars and deities who appeared surrounded by light. Moksada eventu- ally took vows of renunciation. As a child, Nirmala also behaved as an ecstatic. She fell into trances, saw visions of religious fig- ures, and gazed into space with eyes not focused on physical objects. Her education was limited and her writing skills minimal. Married at age 13 to Ramani Mohan Chakra- varti, she spent a few years living in her brother- in-law’s house, often in a trance. At age 18, when Anandamayi Ma 31 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 31 12/14/06 9:28:14 AM"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"her brother-in-law died, she went to live with her husband; there she met a young man who was impressed by her quiet way of being. He called her Ma ( mother in Bengali) and said that one day the entire world would address her with that name. Her marriage remained celibate because Nir- mala’s body would grow stiff and faint when her husband approached the topic of sexuality. She would regain normal consciousness only after he repeated MANTRAS . He eventually accepted her as his GURU and took initiation from her. Throughout her life, Nirmala exhibited bodily states of trance, physical stiffness, and fainting. She could hold difficult yogic positions ( ASANAS ) for long periods and form complex hand positions ( MUDRAS ) and gestures. After examination by exor- cists and physicians, she was diagnosed as having a kind of god intoxication, a divine madness. Her status as a holy woman was based entirely on her spontaneous ecstatic states, as she did not receive formal religious training or initiation from a guru. Instead, she heard voices that told her which spiritual practices to perform and which images to visualize. She would variously shed profuse tears, laugh for hours, talk at great speed, roll in the dust, dance for long periods, and fast for days. At age 26 Nirmala began a stage of spiritual discipline ( SADHANA ) without a guru. She per- formed her own initiation ( DIKSHA ), spontaneously visualizing the ritual and initiatory sacred words, after which she entered three years of complete silence. In 1925, Sri Jyotish Chandra Roy named her Anandamayi Ma. Although her parents worshipped K RISHNA , Anandamayi is not properly placed in a specific Hindu sect; rather, her influence was felt in many religious traditions of India. She traveled widely, staying at abandoned temples and other inhospi- table sites, with little care for her physical body. She taught detachment from the world, religious devotion, and service to others. She was known for her SIDDHIS , or yogic powers, particularly telepathy, healing, and a variety of psychic states. Her chaotic states of consciousness, she believed, derived from spontaneous eruptions of the divine will that arise out of the state of nothingness or the void ( mahasunya ). She explained that her emotional states were the play of the Lord acting through her body, and that she as an individual person did not exist. She died on August 27, 1982. The Sri Sri Anandamayi Sangha of Varanasi coordinates many ASHRAMS built for her by her disciples throughout India.

Ananda movement (est. 1968) Ananda is a worldwide movement based on the teachings of Paramahansa Y OGANANDA (1893–1952) and founded by Swami Kriyananda (b. 1926). The Ananda World Brotherhood includes the Ananda Church of Self-Realization, several Ananda com- munities around the world, educational institu- tions, and several publishing ventures. When he was 22 years of age, Kriyananda became a disciple of Yogananda, and he lived with him until his death, receiving the vow of SANNYAS (renunciation) from him in 1948. Until 1961 Kriyananda served in a variety of capacities—as minister, director, lecturer, and vice president—at the S ELF -R EALIZATION F ELLOWSHIP (SRF) at Mount Washington, California, the primary organization founded by Yogananda. As a monk in Yogananda’s order, he initiated students into KRIYA YOGA , trav- eled, and taught. Along the way, Kriyananda received what he perceived as a summons from God, calling him to serve in another way. His intentions were per- ceived as divisive by officials of SRF and he was asked to resign from the organization in 1962. He left SRF to expand upon the meaning of Yogananda’s teachings of kriya yoga. He initially offered himself as teacher and leader to lay people and students who wished to know his viewpoints. In 1968, observing Yogananda’s vision of a world brotherhood community, he constructed a retreat center and house in Nevada City, California, on 750 acres of woodland and natural forest in the Sierra foothills. At present Ananda Village has almost 300 members, making it one of the larg- est religious communities in the United States. The village and adjoining areas support about 600 people drawn from some 25 nationalities. All residents of the village are also members of the local congregation of the Ananda Church of Self- Realization. Kriyananda saw himself as responding to Yogananda’s plea to “cover the Earth with world- brotherhood colonies, demonstrating that sim- plicity of living plus high thinking lead to the greatest happiness.” Kriyananda took this mission seriously and laid out the rationale for Ananda in his booklet Cooperative Communities: How to Start Them and Why (1968). Members of Ananda Village work in a number of capacities. Some own their own businesses; oth- ers work for Ananda. Residents operate the Ananda Education-For-Life, a school for children through the junior high school level. Youth then attend Nevada City High School to complete their educa- tion. A governing village council is elected every year. The Expanding Light, a guest facility, offers retreats, a variety of special events, workshops, and seminars. Residents engage in kriya yoga as taught by Yogananda. They also sponsor a worldwide outreach program for those interested in becoming practitioners. The village includes a farm, a natural food store, and a vegetarian restaurant. Founded in 1990, Ananda Church of Self- Realization, similar in many ways to SRF, has 2,000 members who worship in the congrega- tional way, quite different from temple worship, where individuals go alone to commune with God. The goal of the Ananda Church is to provide fellowship and teaching to inspire others to find spiritual nourishment in serving humanity. The purpose is to engage in the practice introduced to the West by Yogananda. The church has over 150 trained and ordained ministers who serve at home or in missions abroad. There are five branches: in Sacramento and Palo Alto, California; Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; and Assisi, Italy. Ananda’s Crystal Clarity Publishers issues books on yoga, including Kriyananda’s own writings, and the periodical Clarity Newsletter. East-West Bookstore in Palo Alto is a thriving business begun by members of the Ananda Community.

The church prevailed in most of the issues and is now free to use pictures of Yogananda and reproduce his early writings. On the other hand, the movement suf- fered from a lawsuit brought by a former member claiming sexual abuse at the hands of an Ananda minister. A court judgment in 2001 against the minister and the church sent the Nevada City community into bankruptcy, from which it is only slowly recovering.

Anandamurti, Sri (1921–1990) founder Ananda Marga Yoga Society Sri Sri Anandamurti, the founder of the Ananda M ARGA Y OGA S OCIETY , was born Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar. His father died while Prabhat was still a youth, putting an end to his formal educa- tion. As his father had, he took a job with the railroad. However, he gradually developed a discipline of YOGA and MEDITATION , and in 1955 he announced to his acquaintances that he had achieved enlightenment. He resigned from his job and founded the A NANDA M ARGA (Path of Bliss) Y OGA S OCIETY . It was at this time that he assumed his religious name, Anandamurti. In 1962, he initiated the first monks and four years later the first nuns. The new organization taught a form of tan- tric yoga but also became socially active. As it expanded, it founded and supported several hun- dred elementary schools and homes for children. The social activism was underlain by Anandamur- ti’s developing theories about the reorganization of society. He had begun to feel that both capital- ism and communism, the two main economic and political options being debated in India, were lacking the elements necessary to build the good society. In 1958 he formally introduced his new plan, which he termed Progressive Universal The- ory (PROUT), and founded Renaissance Universal as an organization to propagate his perspective. PROUT was introduced in the context of wide- spread criticism of government corruption. As Ananda Marga grew, it became involved in a num- ber of violent clashes and was charged with illegal political activities and terrorism. In 1967, five members of the group were murdered. The new government of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi (r. 1966–77) restricted the organization by issuing a ban on government employees joining it. In 1971, Anandamurti was arrested on what some say were fabricated charges that he had ordered the murder of some former adherents. In 1975, under severe political pressure Gandhi declared emergency rule. Ananda Marga was one of a number of orga- nizations that were banned. The organization was suppressed, its assets seized, and a number of its leaders arrested. Gandhi was voted out of office in 1977 and Anandamurti and his followers were released when emergency rule ended. After the drama of the Gandhi era, Ananda Marga was reorganized in India and resumed its program of propagating the spiritual and social teachings of its founder. Controversy has sur- rounded Anandamurti and his movement since its inception. In this period Anandamurti developed his concept of Neo-Humanism, in reaction to the neglect of the spiritual dimension of human life that he saw in communism and capitalism. He K 34 Anandamurti, Sri 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 34 12/14/06 9:28:15 AM"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"suggested that human beings were an expression of the Supreme Consciousness. If this concept were accepted, he believed, humanity would enter a state of love toward all sentient beings. He died in 1990.

Ananda Yogi, Gururaj See A MERICAN M EDITATION S OCIETY . Ananta See A DISHESHA . Anasuya Foundation (est. 1975) The Anasuya Foundation (also known as the Tripura Yoga Foundation) was created in 1975. It was a response to a revelation of Lord Dattatreya that Swami Punitachariji received while meditat- ing on Mount Girnar in Gujarat state. Lord Dat- tatreya appeared as the Vedic trinity—the union of B RAHMA , V ISHNU , and S HIVA . His classic form of three heads and six arms appeared as the supreme being who is omnipresent, omnipotent, and omni- scient. Lord Dattatreya represents the divine spark contained in true wisdom. He is a transmitter of the secrets that when known empower others to understand the universal energies and know the meaning of life. In the vision, Swami Punitachariji (also known as Bapu, a fond name for a grandfa- ther figure) saw Lord Dattatreya seated on a large rock. Legendary saints and holy people were wor- shipping him with flowers. Bapu recognized Lord Dattatreya from traditional statuary and paintings and knew that the Lord’s all-knowingness and spiritual prowess could transform ordinary exis- tence into divine life. Lord Dattatreya gave Bapu a mantric chant: “ Hari Om Tatsat Jai Guru Datta, a mantra recited for the effects of its sound, rather than its mean- ing.” From his own training in the Hindu tradi- tion, Bapu believed that the world and everything in it were created through sound. He believed that repeated mantras of power make the invisible creative planes of existence reverberate to enrich and enhance the physical plane of the Earth. Bapu believed that repetition of the mantra of Lord Dat- tatreya sends forth the Lord’s spiritual essence to those who seek his divine wisdom. Through the union of sound, between the visible and invisible worlds, one’s spiritual teacher need not be on the physical plane sharing an earthly life. Chanting in this way allows spiritual interaction between GURU and chela (student) without time constraints. Bapu believed that Lord Dattatreya had specifically given him this insight to promote the elevated consciousness of humankind and to enhance the spirituality of the people on the planet. The religious beliefs of Bapu were exported to North America in the late 1970s, when Shan- tibaba, an early devotee of Bapu, who wished to share with students in other countries the mysti- cal teachings about sacred sound, immigrated to the United States. Not long afterward, teaching centers were also founded in the United Kingdom and Germany. Today there are centers located in California, New York, Colorado, and New Jersey. International headquarters are at Girnar Sadhana Ashram in Gujarat state, India. The American headquarters is the Tripura Yoga Foundation in Snowmass, Colorado. Further reading: Datta Mission.

C . E .) Tradi- tionally, a man is expected to offer libations of oil and water to his deceased father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. The anniversary of the deaths of one’s mother and father must also be celebrated with formalities, including the offering of balls of rice to the ancestors. (Ancestors are presumed to be in heaven but must be fed by their progeny.) Funeral rituals always include a worship of ances- tors with offerings of rice balls. Among five sac- rificial rites that are enjoined daily for B RAHMINS , worshippers must “sacrifice to the ancestors” by ritually pouring out a glass of water to them. There is an inherent paradox in this practice. The very ancient Vedic rites assume that the departed have gone to a heavenly realm. How- ever, such notions have long been superseded by the orthodox Hindu understanding that most departed souls will be reincarnated in a new form in this realm. Further reading: Abbe J. A.

Andal (c. ninth century C . E .) Andal was the only woman among the A LVARS , the 12 Tamil Vaishnavite saints. There are no reliable historical data on Andal, only two hagiographies. Tradition says she was born in Srivilliputtur in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Her father, Vishnucitta, who was also a saint under the name Periyalvar, is said to have found her as an infant girl while he was hoeing his sacred basil (basil or TULSI is sacred to V ISHNU ). The infant was recognized as an incarna- tion of Bhudevi, the goddess of the Earth, who is consort and wife of V ISHNU and a form of sri. Andal’s father raised her as though she were Sri herself. As a young girl, when her father was absent, she would dress up as a bride and put on the garland her father had set aside to be offered to the Lord Vishnu. Any handling of PUJA flow- ers ordinarily makes them unfit for offering, and when her father discovered her doing this, he was very upset. He put the flowers aside and did his puja without the garland. That night Vishnu appeared to Periyalvar in a dream, saying that Andal’s wearing of the garland had increased its desirability to him. After this time Andal became even more focused on worship of Vishnu. She refused ordinary marriage, wishing only to be a bride of Vishnu. She composed Tiruppavai and Nacciyar Tirmoli, two poetic works in devotion to Vishnu. Not knowing which form of Vishnu his daughter was obsessed with, Periyalvar sang songs to each of the 108 manifestations of the Lord in various places. Andal responded to the song to the Lord of S RIRANGAM , the most prominent South Indian Vaishnavite (see V AISHNAVISM ) shrine. Once again, in a dream, Vishnu appeared to Peri- yalvar and said that he would accept Andal as his bride. It is said that Vishnu himself arranged for Andal to be taken from Srivilliputtur to Srirangam with a fabulous marriage party. When she arrived at the shrine she approached the reclining image of Vishnu there and disappeared into his image, never to be seen again.

Andhaka Andhaka (Blind One) is the blind demon born to S HIVA and P ARVATI in the following way: Parvati was joking with Shiva and covered up his three eyes with her hands. As she did this, the entire cosmos fell into darkness. Parvati’s hands began to sweat as they covered Shiva’s potent third eye. From the sweat of her hands, heated up by the third eye of Shiva, arose Andhaka, an angry black blind demon. Andhaka is thus considered the son of Parvati, but when the childless demon king H IRANYAKSHA , after performing strict austerities, requested a son as a boon from Shiva, he gave him Andhaka. After a short time, Hiranyaksha died and Andhaka became the king of the demons. After horrific austerities, in which he offered every ounce of his own flesh to a sacrificial fire, Andhaka was given a boon. His request was very strange: If he were ever to desire the most desirable woman of all, he asked to be destroyed. The “most desirable woman of all,” however, could only have been his own mother, Parvati. Eventually, he did in fact manifest this desire, and he was impaled by Shiva on his trident. Existing half-dead there, Andhaka became purified and a complete devotee of Shiva and Parvati and ceased being a demon. Further reading: Cornelia Dimmitt and J. A.

Anekantavada One of the underlying philosophical ideas in J AIN - ISM is Anekantavada, “the assertation that every- thing is many-sided.” This historical Jain concept, which for centuries remained largely at the level of theory rather than practice, has received more focused attention from many modern Jains, espe- cially those in the diaspora. One must take a position of Anekantavada when one realizes that no ordinary human can have a full view of any- thing—as only the Omniscient SIDDHA or T IRTHAN - KARA can. It logically follows that all views are partial and subject to many-sided analysis. Further reading: Paul Dundas, The Jains (London: Routledge, 1992); P. S.

Anirvan, Sri (1896–1978) Baul and Samkhya author and guru Sri Anirvan was an important scholar and writer of commentaries on traditional Hindu sacred texts, a practicing BAUL , and a spiritual seeker who espoused the S AMKHYA philosophy of Hinduism. The future guru was born Narendra Chandra Dhar on July 8, 1896, in Mymensingh, East Ben- gal (now Bangladesh). His parents, Raj Chandra Dhar and Sushila Devi, were cultured, pious middle-class Hindus of the Kayastha caste. Poor but deeply committed to spiritual values, they provided Narendra with an environment of love and harmony. He learned P ANINI ’s S ANSKRIT gram- mar at an early age and daily recited chapters from the B HAGAVAD G ITA . At the age of seven, he had a vision of an exquisitely beautiful young girl, whose image became for him a symbol of a mystery to be addressed. This image was a benign influence that deeply influenced his SADHANA (spiritual path) and became a presiding deity of his life. Later he recognized in this vision the Divine Mother, born of perfect wisdom, the Uma Haimavati of the Kenopanishad. At age nine, in a state of SAMADHI (blissful con- sciousness), he experienced the boundless Void and saw the sky ( AKASHA ) with its myriad stars enter into him. The akasha became his symbol of free- dom and detachment; his meditation on it became part of his teaching. At age 16, upon completion of his secondary education, he left Mymensingh to live in Assam with his family’s guru, Swami Nigamananda, who was building a new ashram near Jorhat. Narendra worked on the building site until he was awarded a state scholarship to study Sanskrit and Indian philosophy. He specialized in study of the V EDAS and stood first in the University of Calcutta (Kolkata) Sanskrit examinations at both the bachelor’s and the master’s levels. At age 22, having completed his studies, Nar- endra returned to the ashram, where his guru initiated him into sannyas (renunciation) and gave him the name Nirvanananda. In 1920, at age 34, he left the ashram after serving as teacher and administrator. He changed his name to Anirvan to signify that he was no longer bound by the vows of sannyas. He spent the next 12 years travel- ing widely in the Himalayas in quiet retreat and MEDITATION . In 1944 he began living in a house near Almora, Uttar Pradesh, where he began to trans- late Sri A UROBINDO ’ S The Life Divine from English to Bengali and began to write his own commen- taries on the Vedas. Here he met a Swiss woman, Lizelle Reymond, who became his pupil and biographer. Her work became his line of transmis- sion to the West, and they remained in intimate contact for the rest of his life. Living in Almora, Shillong, and finally Cal- cutta, Anirvan continued to write and to give lectures on the U PANISHADS to small groups of dis- ciples. Bedridden after a fall in 1971, he remained in the care of two disciples in Calcutta. He con- tinued to be a quiet seeker with a spiritual jour- ney based on the teachings of P ATANJALI and the S AMKHYA philosophy of Hinduism. He identified himself as a B AUL , although he did not belong to a formal organization of Bauls. He especially liked the freedom of spiritual expression taught by the Bauls and some of his writing is collected as “Let- ters from a Baul.” His statement of his mission was clear: “My ambition is not very great. It is to live a life rich in impressions, luminous to the end; to leave behind a few books embodying my life-long search for Truth, and a few souls who have caught fire. My K 38 Anirvan, Sri 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 38 12/14/06 9:28:16 AM"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"aim? Simply to inspire people and give them the most complete freedom to live their own life. No glamour, no fame, no institution—nothing. To live simply and die luminously.” Anirvan wrote some 20 books, most of them commentaries on the scriptures and philosophical systems of India. All but two English volumes were published in Bengali. Anirvan died on Fern Road in Calcutta on May 31, 1978.

Annapurna Literally “She who is abundant [ purna ] with food [ anna ],” the goddess Annapurna is considered a form of D URGA or sometimes of P ARVATI , both being wives of S HIVA . In her iconography she is light colored and stands on a lotus or sits on a throne. She has only two hands; in one she holds a bowl of rice and in the other a spoon that is used to stir rice while cooking it. Sometimes Shiva, as a mendicant, is receiving alms from her. For many Hindus she is a protecting deity; those who wor- ship her are said never to want for food. The most elaborate festival to Annapurna takes place in B ENARES (Varanasi) in the fall, when she is celebrated as the sustainer of life. She is also celebrated there in the springtime during the annakuta or “food-pile” festival, in which a pile of food fills her temple in worship to her. In the spring, she is worshipped in association with the new sprouts of rice in the fields; at that time her temple is decorated with rice sprouts. In the Linga Purana there is a story about Annapurna that purports to tell how Shiva took the form of A RDHANARISHVARA , or “half-man, half- woman.” Once when Shiva was unable to do his usual begging to support his family as a result of marijuana intoxication, there was nothing in the house to eat. Shiva thereupon went out to beg, while Durga, his wife, in anger, started out for her father’s house. On the way she and her chil- dren ran into the famous sage N ARADA . Narada told her that in her aspect as Annapurna she should make it impossible for Shiva to get food by begging. She did this and went home, still in her aspect as Annapurna. When Shiva returned home she offered him food. He was so pleased that he merged his being with her, creating Ard- hanarishvara. The name of this goddess is given to one of the highest peaks in the H IMALAYAS .

J. Wilkins, Hindu Mythology, Vedic and Puranic (Calcutta: Rupa, 1973). Anoopam Mission (est. 1965) The Anoopam Mission was founded in 1965 as an independent branch of the S WAMINARAYAN M OVE - MENT . It is dedicated to the worldwide spread of the theistic devotional Hinduism ( BHAKTI YOGA ) and strict moral code of Sri Sahajanand Swami, better known to his followers as Swaminarayan (1781–1830). Swaminarayan believed that God was not the impersonal deity portrayed in the writings and oral tradition of V EDANTA . Saints and RISHIS (wise souls) were teachers who had traveled to Earth to help a suffering humanity find the way to God; the swami considered himself to be an incarnation of an earlier guru, Lord Swami Narayan, who was believed by his followers to be God. In the mid-20th century, His Supreme Holiness Brahmaswarup Param Pujya Yogiji Maharaj (d. Anoopam Mission 39 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 39 12/14/06 9:28:16 AM"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"1971) sent what he called the Anoopam Mission to the United States. Its success was due to the dedi- cation of a young man named Jashbhai, born on March 23, 1940 in Sokhada, Gujarat, who had as a young college student crossed paths with Yogiji Maharaj. Yogiji was so impressed with the young man that he called him Saheb, a term of great respect. Saheb organized meetings and recruited his peers onto the path of bhakti, especially as expressed through the lineage of Yogiji Maharaj. He encouraged the young men to live a life based on spirituality, service to others, and positive assis- tance in their community. Those attracted to his teachings developed a new way to live as SADHUS . They did not renounce the world but accepted it. They did not take vows of chastity, obedience, and poverty; instead they had families and participated in life on an every- day level but focused on a mission of service to others. Their aim was to integrate the life of holy people with that of lay people. Saheb was expelled from the larger movement in 1965, after a dispute with conservatives who did not want women to become sadhus. He and his fol- lowers established the Brahmajyoti (light of God), in Mogri, Gujarat, which became the new movement’s international headquarters. Groups developed in the surrounding countryside and areas adjacent to the mother organization, with similar institutions set up for community service. Followers began to migrate to the United States in the 1960s, and Saheb traveled to visit them in 1973. The Anoopam Mission in the United States encourages members to live frugally in a commu- nity atmosphere. The excess income they make in their careers is saved to enhance and carry forth the obligations of the mission. Over 100 American members (called sadhaks ) engage as a group to work with devotees toward spiritual goals. Sadhaks are distinguished by attire that reveals their commitment. Blue shirts and cream colored slacks are worn by the men. Cream is the symbol of the Earth; blue is symbolic of the sky and the greatest of spiritual attainments, which is to unite with God into the bliss of Oneness. These colors reflect the transformation of each person’s mission from Earth-bound to spiritual-bound. Members also wear a saffron and white badge showing an eight-spoked wheel. The hub of the wheel represents Saheb, while the spokes are the internal purification rituals required in the move- ment. The spokes also represent eight brothers who were blessed by Yogiji Maharaj as the leaders of the mission. Saheb has continued to extend the mission to 25 countries throughout the world. After begin- ning in India, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia, the mission now has centers in several countries in Europe, Africa, and the Far East. The mission now sponsors educational institutions, health-care organizations, social wel- fare programs, and relief programs for assistance in floods, earthquakes, and water conservation. The international headquarters remains in Mogri, Gujarat, India.

Buddhism and V AISHESHIKA accepted only two valid means— anu- mana and direct perception ( PRATYAKSHA ). The S AMKHYA school recognized direct perception, inference, and verbal testimony ( shabda ). N YAYA added a fourth: analogy ( upamana ). In J AINISM , anumana is admitted as valid under the wider category of “non perceptual” knowledge, which includes other elements such as memory. Only the C HARVAKA s or materialist philosophers denied the validity of anumana, thinking truth could be gained only by direct perception. Further reading: S. N.

Apabhramsha Sanskrit linguists use the term Apabramsha, “that which is badly fallen,” to refer to the languages spoken in North India between approximately 600 and 1200 C . E . These languages developed from certain of the earlier Prakrits (themselves evolutes of S ANSKRIT ), and evolved to become the various modern languages of North India. There are important extant Apabramsha texts, particularly among the Jains. Examples of Jain text are the Paumacariu of Svayambhu and the Mahapurana of Pushpadanta. Some later Buddhist sages also composed in this language; some of their texts are still extant. Further reading: H. C. Bhayani, Apabhramsa Language and Literature: A Short Introduction (Delhi: B. L.

Appar (Tirunavakkarasu) (c. 570–670 C . E .) Tamil Shaivite poet and saint A PPAR was one of the three most prominent Tamil Shaivite saints ( see S HAIVISM , NAYANARS ), whose hymns appear in the central liturgical and literary text of the the Tamil Shaivites, the T EVARAM . Appar was born under the name Marunaikkiyar to a Vellala (agricultural class) family in Tiruvamur. His family were Shaivite but he converted to J AIN - ISM as a youth, taking on the name Dharmasena. Afflicted by a painful abdominal disease, the young Jain monk turned to his sister, a Shaivite, for help. At her request he put his faith in Shiva, and was miraculously cured. He immediately converted back to the faith of his birth. He began to sing passionate hymns to Lord Shiva, which angered his former Jain associates. It was said that he was persecuted and even tortured by the angry Jains but by the grace of Shiva was unharmed. Appar is said to have led the Pallava king, who had also converted to Jainism, back to Shiva. He was recognized as a saint and spent his time travel- ing from one shrine to the next singing hymns at each sacred location. Iconographically, Appar is often showing holding a hoe, for he was known for clearing the temple grounds of weeds and grass in service to Lord Shiva. His beautiful lyrics and speech earned him the name Tirunavakkarasu, “He who is the king of eloquence.” It is said that he was first called Appar (my father) by his younger con- temporary S AMBANTHAR , who addressed him thus.

Late tradition says that apsaras either were born from B RAHMA ’s fancy or are the daughters of the RISHI DAKSHA or of Kashyapa. The Vedic apsaras born from the daughters of Daksha are Menaka, Sahajanya, Parnini, Punjakasthala, Gritasthala, Ghritachi, Vishvachi, Urvashi, Anulocha, Pramlocha, and Manovati. Other well known apsaras of later times are Tilottama, Rambha, and Mishrakeshi. The most famous apsaras is perhaps Urvashi, whom King Pururavas fell in love with and begged to stay with him. She agreed upon several condi- tions, one of which was that she never see him undressed. As fate would have it, one night she saw him without his clothes and was forced to return to her celestial home. Pururavas was heart- broken and searched everywhere for her. One day he was able to reach her abode and persuaded her to promise that she would meet him yearly and have his son. After he had gone to see her several times she told him how he might obtain her as his bride permanently. Through a ritual sacrifice he was able to become a celestial ( GANDHARVA singer) and gain her as his bride forever. Tilottama is also well known, as the apsaras who tempted Lord B RAHMA when he was doing austerities. She appeared before him in turn on all sides and caused him to form heads in all direc- tions. Eventually he was humiliated, because he had been doing austerities to gain the throne of I NDRA . Apsarases are often depicted in temple architecture.

Aranyaka The Aranyakas or “forest books,” originally part of the B RAHMANA sections within the V EDAS , contain esoteric interpretations of the Vedic rituals. They show the ritual actors performing aspects of the ritual internally and esoterically while meditating in the forest. In the development of Indian tradi- tion, the Aranyakas are in one sense transitional between the typical Brahmana philosophy, which explains the Vedic acts in practical terms, and the U PANISHADS , which delve into the higher philo- sophical vision of the Vedas. Only four Aranyakas have been preserved: the Brhad Aranyaka in the S HATAPATHA B RAHMANA of the White Y AJUR V EDA , the Taittariya Aranyaka of the Taittariya Brahmana of the Black Yajur Veda, the Aitareya Aranyaka in the Aitareya Brahmana of the R IG V EDA , and the Kaushitiki Aranyaka in the Kaushitiki Brahmana, also in the Rig Veda.

The iconic image is a popular one at temples and shrines to Shiva everywhere in India. Images were present very early in the development of stone architecture and are found at various rock cut temples such as at M AHABALIPURAM . It is said that B RAHMA , the creator god, tried many times to create beings who would pro- create properly. Usually the beings he created, god or human, would take up asceticism and not reproduce. Finally, he asked Lord Shiva to separate out his female goddess aspect, so that procreation could take place. Shiva did so; this feminine aspect stood before Brahma and at his request gave him the feminine energy that allowed him to become the creator of the human line. Through this story all human beings are seen to be descended from Brahma via his feminine, procreative energy. The Ardhanarishvara depic- tion of Shiva as half goddess is a reminder of this story. A different explanation for the Ardhanarish- vara is found in another story, in which the sage Bhringi respectfully circumambulated Shiva every day but ignored Parvati, unlike all the other rishis, who customarily circumambulated them both. To induce him to honor Parvati, Shiva and Parvati joined together as one, but the stubborn sage became a bee and bored between them so as only to go around Shiva (explaining the name bhringa, which means bee). Still other explanations exist ( see A NNAPURNA ).

As Jains do not believe in living liberated beings ( jivanmukta ), the arhat while living is not released from the cycle of birth and rebirth, but will be upon his/her death. A person becomes an arhat when he or she has destroyed nearly all KARMA s except those that hold him or her in bodily existence. Technically, one becomes an arhat at the 12th gunasthana (progression level) out of the 14 that take one to posthumous NIRVANA . All the T IRTHANKARA s in the Jain pantheon are referred to in their texts as arhat s. The term arhat is also used in the Buddhist context, where it refers to someone who has attained nirvana—who has attained enlighten- ment and will be released from the cycle of birth and rebirth upon death. In the Buddhist tradition also one can be referred to as an arhat before one is dead. Further reading: M. A. Dhaky, ed., Arhat Parsva and Dharanendra Nexus (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1997); P. S.

Arjuna Arjuna was one of the five P ANDAVAS in the M AHAB - HARATA epic, all of them sons of Kunti by different gods. Arjuna’s father was the king of the gods, Indra, hence his prominent role in the epic. It is Arjuna who won the Pandavas’ wife Draupadi at her “self-choice” ceremony, where the contestants competed in various challenges of strength and skill. The rule was that each of the five brothers would stay at night with Draupadi alone. No other brother was to enter their chamber Arjuna 43 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 43 12/14/06 9:28:17 AM"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"on penalty of exile. Arjuna broke this agreement and was sent away from the other brothers for 12 years. During his exile Arjuna had relationships with many women. He married Krishna’s sister Sub- hadra, to whom was born their son Abhimanyu, who played an important role in the Mahabharata war. Arjuna at this time also met up with Para- shurama, the B RAHMIN warrior and incarnation of V ISHNU ; he taught Arjuna the use of magical weapons. For helping the god A GNI and K RISHNA burn down the Khandava forest, Arjuna received his bow Gandiva, his most cherished weapon. Returning home Arjuna was forced into soli- tary exile again for 13 years when his brother Yud- histhira lost everything to the Kauravas in a dice game. In his wanderings he met a hunter—Shiva in disguise—from whom he received the devas- tating Pashupata weapon. In the last year of his exile he served Virata, king of the Matsya people, disguised as a eunuch. There he taught music and dance to the women. He also helped Virata fight his enemies. In the final battle of Kurukshetra, the conclu- sive battle of the Mahabharata, Krishna served as Arjuna’s charioteer. The B HAGAVAD G ITA details Arjuna’s momentary failure of will as the battle is about to begin and Krishna’s teachings to him. After the victory, when the customary ashva medha ( HORSE SACRIFICE ) was done, Arjuna followed the sacrificial horse on its wide wanderings, fighting many kings and claiming many countries for the Pandavas. During these wanderings he encoun- tered his own son Babhruvahana, whom he fought and killed. The son was revived, however, by a Naga princess ( see NAGAS ) who had once been his lover. After the war, in which most of Krishna’s Yadava tribe were killed, Arjuna himself performed the funeral rites for Krishna, who had accidentally been killed by a hunter, and for Krishna’s father, Vasudeva. Arjuna took the remnants of the Yadava tribe and their women back to Hastinapura, the Pandava capital. In his old age Arjuna went to live in the Hima- layas with his brothers and Draupadi, leaving the kingdom to his grandson, Parikshit (Abhimanyu’s son). Further reading: J. A.

The institute is dedicated to the traditional study of advaita V EDANTA , S AN - SKRIT , HATHA YOGA , A YURVEDA , Vedic chanting, MEDITATION , astrology, and other classical Indian disciplines. It offers courses in the U PANISHADS , B HAGAVAD G ITA , V EDANTA S UTRA , and other clas- sical Vedic texts in English. The more than 15 teachers have all studied with Dayananda Saras- wati. The center offers short- and long-term study programs and on-site accommodations. The 54-acre campus includes a temple dedicated to Lord Dakshinamurti, considered the first teacher of Vedic knowledge. The Gurukulam also sponsors the All India Movement (AIM) for Seva, established in New Delhi in 2000, as its service outreach. It hopes to unite Indian society through service and car- ing, in a way that promotes self-sufficiency and dignity among those served. It seeks to transform Indian society by bridging the gap between privi- leged and less-privileged people through a policy of Indians’ caring for fellow Indians.

Arthashastra (c. 300 C . E .) The Arthashastra, the “Authoritative Treatise on Worldly Affairs,” is generally attributed to Kauti- lya (Chanakya) (c. 300 B . C . E .), the minister of the famous Chandragupta Maurya kingdom, although it was apparently expanded at a later time, as the received text includes references to later phenomena. The Arthashastra resembles in many ways The Prince, written in the 16th century by the Italian Nicolò Machiavelli. It is a complete and elaborate treatise on statecraft and law, clearly designed for use by a king. It includes sections dealing with clans and tribes who do not belong to the state proper, the conduct of ministers, government officials, city government, taxation, law, punish- ments, spies, types of conquest, the army, slavery, divorce, women’s property, indigent women, pros- titutes, gambling, alcoholic drinks, and interest rates, among other topics. The book is part of the tradition of authori- tative treatises ( shastras; artha means “worldly affairs”) that relate to the four ENDS OF LIFE . It parallels the D HARMASHASTRA and the Kamashastra (among which is the K AMA S UTRA ). The fourth end of life— MOKSHA —is not generally associated with shastra s; its subject, liberation from birth and rebirth, relies on gurus instead.

Art of Living Foundation (est. 1982) The Art of Living Foundation promotes the spiri- tual endeavors of Sri Sri Ravi S HANKAR (b. 1956) (not to be confused with the prominent musician of the same name). It focuses on the use of ancient Hindu methods for reaching serenity. Shankar is a native of Bangalore, India. As a child he demonstrated great intellectual skills. He could read and discuss B HAGAVAD G ITA by the age of four. In childhood he read Indian literature and was able to grasp complex text material and philosophy. As an adult, Shankar traveled the world from his home in India, teaching the methods revealed in classical texts for developing a serene life, which he called the Art of Living. Shankar’s teachings emphasize ancient science, especially Sudharsha Kriya, a meditative breathing technique that bal- ances natural rhythms in mental, emotional, and physical life. Sudharsha Kriya gained celebrity in 1998 and 1999 when scientific studies confirmed its benefits. The meditative practice is used for stress reduction, conflict resolution, and personal development.

It now has more than 4,000 chapters around the world. Although the foundation claims no religious affiliation, it upholds basic spiritual tenets through its offering of compassionate service around the world, including charitable and educational programs in 142 countries. It is a consulting nongovernmental organiza- tion (NGO) registered with the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United Nations. Services include the 5-H program, a holistic endeavor that focuses on homes, health, hygiene, harmony in diversity, and human values. All programs follow the general philosophy of the foundation, emphasizing the practical and intel- lectual development of human values and the potential of individuals to strengthen society. The Art of Living Foundation has provided many workshops over the years at United Nations summits and conferences. According to the foundation an estimated 2 million people around the world have benefited from Sudharsha Kriya through Art of Living courses. The foundation has also established the Research and Health Promotion Center, which provides scholarships for research into the health benefits of Sudharsha Kriya. The foundation publishes an online journal, Prana. A sister orga- nization, the International Association for Human Values, coordinates volunteer efforts for aid and relief. In 1995, the president of India recognized Shankar’s spiritual accomplishments by giving him the title of Yogi Shiromani (Supreme Flow- ering of Enlightenment) during a major World Conference of Yoga. The center in Bangalore, India, administers the various programs to spread the spiritual pre- cepts of the movement, heighten knowledge of Vedic texts, and engage in community service. In En gland, the United States, and Canada, the work is pursued under the name Art of Living; in Europe it is called the Association for Inner Growth. In Jan- uary 2005 the Art of Living Foundation donated over $34 million for tsunami relief. The founda- tion has also established orphanages for children and homes for women in the affected areas of India and Sri Lanka.

Arundhati Arundhati was the wife of the Rishi Vasishtha and one of the nine daughters of Prajapati by his wife Devahuti. Along with her husband, she is one of the mythical seven rishis, for whom the seven stars of the Great Bear or Pleiades are named. Vasishtha is the middle of the three stars that form the tail. Arundhati is the small faint star (Alcor) beside it. Arundhati is considered the paragon of wifely faithfulness. In the Hindu marriage rites, after the main ceremony and after the marriage meal, the priest takes the couple outside and points out the star Arundhati to the bride. Further reading: Abbé J. A.

Aryaman Aryaman (friend or companion) is a Vedic divin- ity listed among the A DITYAS . When invoked he is usually paired with some other divinity. He is chief of the “Fathers” or Manes, those who have passed from this world and exist in heaven. There are no MANTRAS in the Rig Veda that focus solely on Aryaman. Further reading: Paul Thieme, Mitra and Aryaman (New Haven, Conn.: American Oriental Society, 1957). Aryan (Arya) In the V EDAS , the earliest Indian texts, the S AN - SKRIT word Arya had the sense of noble or worthy person. It was used by the tribes or peoples who recited the Vedas to distinguish themselves from other peoples. Sometimes, in early Sanskrit the term was used to refer to the “respectable” upper three classes of the Indian tradition, to distinguish them from the disreputable classes such as the S HUDRAS and those below them, the untouchables. Most Brahmins still refer to themselves as Aryas, as do all Buddhists and Jains (see J AINISM ). The earliest text of the Vedic tradition, the R IG V EDA , which is set in ancient India, has been dated to around 1500 B . C . E . This rough estimate refers to the time the text was compiled as an anthology. Parts of the text may thus date back some centu- ries earlier, an indication that the Aryas were in India as early as c. 2000 B . C . E . Vedic references to the Aryas are thus syn- chronous with the theoretical migration of Indo- European-speaking peoples into India from the northwest. Much scholarship and speculation have been focused on this issue since at least the 18th century, when it was discovered that Sanskrit was an Indo-European language related to Latin and Greek, while the languages of southern India seemed unrelated. The term Arya also appears in ancient Persian texts (it is reflected in the name of the country Iran), and in Hittite inscriptions from the Middle East around 1500 B . C . E . The name Ireland may also reflect the word, which would be evidence for a simultaneous Aryan migration to Europe. Recent attempts have been made in India to refute the notion that the Aryans arrived from outside the country. It is prudent to say that the issue is not yet settled. Within India itself there are various different understandings of the nature of the Aryans. The linguistic term Dravidian, referring to the tongues spoken in South India, was sometimes used in the 20th century to designate a people or race differ- ent and distinct from the Aryans of the north. The term Aryan was taken up in Europe in the 20th century by the Nazis to designate a person of a “superrace.” Further reading: Edwin F.

Arya Samaj (est. 1875) The Arya Samaj, formerly known as Arya Pra- tinidhi Sabha, is a reformist Hindu sect founded in 1875 in Mumbai by Mul Shankara (1824–83).

As Dayananda Saraswati, his name given at initiation, he wandered all of India for 12 years, finally taking residence in Mathura to study the V EDAS under the scholar Varajananda. Dayananda understood the Vedas to teach gender equal- ity and rejection of caste, a message that clearly opposed the orthodoxy of the day. The movement grew among liberal, educated Indians and became strong in the state of Punjab, where it remains important. The Arya Samaj seeks to restore the central- ity of the Vedas to Hinduism and to reject much of Hinduism’s SANATANA DHARMA (eternal way), including worship of images and PUJA (traditional rituals). The society teaches 10 basic principles: (1) The source of all that is true is God. (2) God is a single, eternal, fully conscious being. (3) All true knowledge is contained in the Vedas. (4) All people should be prepared to accept truth. (5) All acts should be performed with righteousness and duty. (6) The movement should promote physical, spiritual, and social progress for all humans. (7) All relations among humans should be guided by love and justice. (8) Knowledge and realization should be provided for all people. (9) The move- ment should work for the uplift of all, not only personal development. (10) All members should be devoted to the social good. The Arya Samaj sponsors the Purohit Acad- emy to train students in philosophy and in the repetition of Sanskrit MANTRAS . After training, practitioners are certified by the academy to per- form traditional rituals and marriages. With its message of social reform and the universalization of spiritual truth, the Arya Samaj has proselytized since its inception and has become an important element of the Indian DIASPORA around the world, including North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Aus- tralia, and Oceania. Prominent countries in the Indian diaspora all have multiple worship cen- ters, although membership numbers are difficult to estimate.

It is from the root as (to sit). Some say that there were originally 8,400,000 asanas to rep- resent the 8,400,000 births that each individual must pass through before he or she becomes liberated. There are said to be only a few hundred in practice today; 84 is the number most often presented to students. An asana is a means to focus the mind so that it becomes steady, calm, and quiet. It is not intended as any sort of physical exercise per se, despite being commonly understood that way in the West. The various asanas are intended to open up different subtle energy channels in the body and the psychic centers ( CHAKRAS ) that run along the spine. It is understood that the total command of the body at both gross and subtle levels is a path to the total command of the mind. Total command of the mind can lead to the steady, calm, and quiet poise of being, where the highest reality of self and universe can be directly perceived. Breath control, or pranayama, is always a part of asana practice.

Alexander Phipps was born on February 23, 1920, to Protestant parents, Lt. Col. Henry Ramsey Phipps and Lorna Campbell Phipps. His father was an artillery officer and his great-grandfather, a Scottish laird. Alexander attended Sherborne Public School and the College of Aeronautical Engineering at Chelsea, London. He was described as an avid reader but “not successful at school.” In general, he was shy and reserved. Before complet- ing a degree, he went to India to help in the World War II war effort as an aircraft engineer by repair- ing crashed planes at Dum Dum Airport, Kolkata. While in India he met Sri Ramana M AHARSHI in Tiruvannamalai. Fired by his meeting with the South Indian saint, he decided not to return to England after the war ended. He joined the Uttar Brindavan Ashram (founded in 1929) at Mirtola village in the Kumaon region of the Himalayas as a BRAHMACHARYA under his guru, Sri Krishna Prem. In 1947, Krishna Prem gave him the vows of sannyas (renunciation) under the Gaudiya Sampradaya ( see G AUDIYA M AT H ) and named him Madhava Ashish. The Gaudiya Sampradaya of V AISHNAVISM is associated with Sri Radha Raman Temple at B RINDABAN , the birthplace of Lord K RISHNA ; it follows strict vegetarianism and devo- tion to the deity Krishna. After taking up discipleship, Ashish followed a strict Vaishnavite regimen in food, dress, con- duct, and sacramental worship. However, in 1957 he and his guru, Sri Krishna Prem, decided to simplify the rigid framework of full Vaish- navite orthodox discipline, so that it would speak directly to the seekers who increasingly visited Mirtola for spiritual guidance. They advocated a system of self-inquiry, which encouraged disciples to search for the mystery at the root of their own being and to find their essential nature apart from the psychophysical ego personality. The attempt was to merge individual consciousness with the uniting source of all life, a higher center of aware- ness accessible to all. Madhava Ashish oversaw a discipline that included MEDITATION ; service in the temple; assid- uous self-inquiry through introspection, dream analysis, self-remembering, and development of a witnessing awareness in all activities in order to harmonize the inner and outer life. In addition to practices of the Vaishnavite tradition, his teaching drew on the wisdom of others, including N ISAR - GADATTA Maharaj and the Greek-Armenian teacher G. I. Gurdjieff. In addition to guiding disciples at Uttar Brin- davan Ashram, Madhava Ashish served as a mem- ber of the Committee for Hill Development (of the Himalaya region) for India’s premier planning body. He was awarded the Padma Shree by the government of India in 1993 for his contribu- tion to scientific farming. He was also actively involved with environmental work, including sustainable farming, water harvesting, animal husbandry, environmental education, and efforts against deforestation. After his death on April 13, 1997, leadership of Uttar Brindavan Ashram was taken up by his disciple Dev Ashish. The ashram does not have a Web site; its address is P.O.

In later times the word came to designate a place organized for spiritual practice, a refuge where devotees could pursue their paths. Most often the ashram would be under the tutelage and guidance of a particular guru or lineage of teach- ers.

People of other twice-born castes, such as Brahmins, warriors, or merchants, could optionally take on the ashramas. S HUDRAS and Dalits (Untouchables) were not included in this system. The four traditional ashramas are B RAHMACHA - RYA (studentship), grihastha (householder stage), VANAPRASTHA (entering the forest), and SANNYASI (mendicancy). Usually, one was permitted to leave household life after one had seen one’s grandchil- dren. During the vanaprastha stage of life, which ordained austerities in the forest or wildlands, one could optionally be accompanied by one’s wife, as long as chastity was maintained.

Ashtanga Yoga Ashtanga (eight-limbed) Yoga is the system devised by P ATANJALI , author of the Y OGA S UTRA . As the name implies, eight practices are involved, divided into two groups. The five outer practices are YAMA , niyama, ASANA , PRANAYAMA , and pratya- hara; the three inward-oriented practices are dha- rana, dhyana, and SAMADHI . Ashtanga Yoga involved a sitting yoga, some- times called raja yoga, focused on the breath. As one watched the breath, one developed ways of concentrating and eventually controlling the mind. The ultimate goal, as in all yogas, was lib- eration from birth and rebirth, but in the practice of Patanjali, the specific effort was to free the self ( PURUSHA ) from its false attachment to the phe- nomenal world, or PRAKRITI . A SANAS , or postures, play a central role in the systems of Ashtanga Yoga that are disseminated today, but in the Yoga Sutras themselves, “sitting,” or “asana” is simply one of the eight “limbs.” Many of the postures known today may have been later additions to the practice or may have devel- oped through separate practices that later merged with the Patanjali school. There are strong resem- blances between the practices found in Patanjali and those of the Buddhist Pali canon, although the practice postures were never an important component in Buddhism.

The Ashvins do not play a great role in later epic and Puranic mythology ( see PURANAS ), though they are ubiquitous as minor characters. In the Vedas they are called the chil- dren of the Sun (S URYA ) or of the sky. But they also are said to emerge from the tears of A GNI or from V ISHNU . They are said to have a wife in common, the daughter of another Sun divinity (S AVITRI ); they won her in a race contest. Most commonly the Ashvins are known as the physicians of the gods; they are everywhere connected with healing. In the Vedas they make an iron leg for Vishpala, restore Kanva’s eyesight, and restore the youth of Cyavana (after trying to seduce his wife). Through the latter feat they are said to have earned the Vedic S OMA libation, which is offered to them. Further reading: Alfred Hillebrandt, Vedic Mythology (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1990); E.

It is used both for the individual self or soul and for the transcendent “Self” or “All-soul,” which is all reality. Often the individual self is referred to as the jivatman, “the life self,” and the transcendent Self is referred to as the paramatman, or “Ultimate Self.” The Upanishads and Vedanta philosophy focus on realizing the unity between the individual self and the ultimate Self, by means of various prac- tices. When one realizes (not just intellectually knows) the unity of individual self and Ultimate Self, one breaks the bonds of KARMA and escapes from further rebirth. Some sort of meditation or contemplation is always necessary to realize the unity of Ulti- mate Self and individual self. Some Indian paths emphasize “knowledge,” or transcendental real- ization; some paths emphasize devotion; some look to combine devotion and action, or knowl- edge, action, and devotion, to reach this final goal. Though ADVAITA (non-dual) Vedanta emphasizes a total identity between the individual atman and the large atman, other Indian traditions under- stand that there are an infinite number of totally distinct individual selves or atmans that never merge into each other at the highest level.

Aurobindo, Sri (Aurobindo Ghose) (1872– 1950) philosopher sage of modern India and creator of Integral Yoga Aurobindo Ghose, later named Sri Aurobindo, was one of the great sages of modern India. After an influential political career in the cause of Indian independence, he turned to the spiritual and developed the very influential Integral Yoga path, which combined practices from many differ- ent historic Indian yogas. Ghose was born on August 15, 1872, in the Indian state of Bengal to a surgeon, Dr. Krish- nadhan Ghose, and his wife, Swarnalata Devi. His father aimed to turn his fourth child into an Anglicized gentleman, giving him the name Aurobindo Ackroyd (he later dropped his middle name) and sending him at the age of seven to a convent school in Darjeeling. Shortly thereaf- ter he was packed off to Manchester, England, where he was educated at home for five years and isolated from “Indian” influences. In 1889 he entered Cambridge, where he distinguished himself in Latin, Greek, and French. In 1893 he returned to India and joined Baroda Col- lege, where he taught English and French and eventually became vice principal. In 1901 he married 14-year-old Mrinalini Bose, not long after beginning his political activity in support of Indian independence. Because of his absences from home and spiritual pursuits, this marriage, though affectionate, produced no children. Mrin- alini died at the age of 32, just before her planned move to the Pondicherry A SHRAM Aurobindo had established. In 1903 in Kashmir an important spiritual event took place in Aurobindo’s life. Through the aid of a teacher, Bhaskar Lele, he realized the non-dual nature of the “characterless” divine Sri Aurobindo (1872–1950), founder of Integral Yoga (Courtesy Aurobindo Archives, Pondicherry) K 52 Aum 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 52 12/14/06 9:28:19 AM"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"( Nirguna Brahman ). Moving to Bengal in 1906 he plunged into revolutionary political activity, help- ing to found the journal Bande Mataram (Hail to the Mother India!) and writing many articles for it. As a result of these articles he was arrested on August 16, 1907, on a charge of sedition; he was arrested again in 1908 and spent a year in Alipore jail awaiting trial. Aurobindo Ghose is known in India more for this political activity on behalf of India’s indepen- dence (years before Gandhi returned from South Africa) than for his great spiritual work. It is only among Bengalis that is he well known and hon- ored as a sage. The year in Alipore Jail was a turn- ing point for Aurobindo Ghose. There he read the B HAGAVAD G ITA , practiced yoga, and experienced a vision of Krishna that was powerful and trans- formative. Not long after he was released from jail he headed south to the French protectorate of Pondicherry, in part to avoid rearrest by the Indian police. In 1914 a Frenchman by the name of Paul Richard persuaded Aurobindo to write philosophy for a monthly journal called Arya. Aurobindo had begun to develop a reputation as a yogi and Richard was interested in his philoso- phy. All of Sri Aurobindo’s major works except the epic poem Savitri were first published serially in this magazine. As fate would have it, Richard’s wife, Mirra Alfassa, was to find in Aurobindo the fulfillment of her spiritual calling. In 1920 she left her husband and joined Sri Aurobindo in his spiritual quest; she would soon be dubbed the Mother. In 1920 Ghose began to accept the name Sri Aurobindo, and he began delving more deeply into the unique yoga that he had initiated. His new ashram flourished after the arrival of Mirra Richard. On November 24, 1926, Sri Aurobindo announced that he had reached the “Overmind” in his meditations and retired from active ashram life. He left the external activities of the ashram to the care of Mother, who attended to all its affairs and developments until her death in 1973. In 1928 Sri Aurobindo released his book, The Mother, which declared to the doubters that the consciousness of the Mother and his conscious- ness were one and the same. In 1939–40 the ashram released the book Life Divine, one of Sri Aurobindo’s masterpieces. On December 5, 1950, Sri Aurobindo left his body. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother’s yoga had unique characteristics. Sri Aurobindo argued that each of the yogas that had been developed in India had its own important and positive ele- ments, but that practicing any one of them solely would lead to unbalanced spiritual development. In his book Synthesis of Yoga he outlined how the yogas of the Bhagavad Gita particularly could be harmonized into a synthesis that would serve the whole human being: the physical, emotional, mental, psychic (soul), and spiritual levels, he argued, all needed tending. The term for the yoga that would involve all these levels of the human being was in Sanskrit Purna Yoga, or “Complete Yoga.” This term was translated by Sri Aurobindo as Integral Yoga, which he adopted as the name of his path. Sri Aurobindo argued vehemently that the world was real, rejecting the Indian philosophical view that it was illusory. Equally importantly, he believed the world was evolving toward a state of perfection. He drew from science his belief that life emerged from matter and consciousness from life. He argued therefore that superconsciousness or the “Supramental” stage must develop from ordinary consciousness. Sri Aurobindo’s yoga aimed at accelerating the advance of this evolution toward “Super- manhood.” His and the Mother’s efforts were entirely focused on engendering what they called the “Supramental” manifestation, which would transform not only all human beings, but all life and even all matter. Their effort was effectively to unlock the divine within matter itself; thus, they referred to their philosophy as Divine Materialism. This was the vision that was developed in Sri Aurobindo’s massive book The Life Divine. Aurobindo, Sri 53 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 53 12/14/06 9:28:19 AM"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Sri Aurobindo acknowledged at his death in 1950 that he had not yet achieved the “descent of the Supramental” and indicated that this would occur through the efforts of the Mother. In 1956 Mother indeed announced that the descent had occurred. In 1968 she inaugurated A UROVILLE , a new utopian city in southern India dedicated to the realization of her goals. It was intended as an international city, belonging to “nobody in par- ticular.” Along with the ashram in Pondicherry, this city flourishes to this day and is still develop- ing according to the Mother’s and Sri Aurobindo’s principles and philosophy. Significantly, Sri Aurobindo and Mother never desired to create a new cult or religion. Their goal was nothing less than the transformation of the conditions of existence for all of humanity. As a result, no successor was appointed to follow Mother. A loose-knit but devoted group of admir- ers have continued to practice the yoga in creative and ever changing ways. Perhaps the best known admirer of Sri Aurobindo in America was Dr. Hari- das C HAUDHURI , who in 1968 founded the Califor- nia Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco, a graduate school dedicated to the development of “mind, body and spirit.” Ashrams devoted to Sri Aurobindo have been established at several sites in the United States. The first such ashram was the Cultural Integra- tion Fellowship in San Francisco, founded by Chaudhuri in 1951. Another important ashram is Matagiri, founded by Sam Spanier and Eric Hughes in 1968 in the Catskill mountains of New York State. The name Matagiri means “Mother’s mountain” in Sanskrit. A third developing ash- ram in America dedicated to the teachings of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother is the Lodi, Califor- nia, ashram founded in the 1990s, with its well- known Auromere book outlet (books@auromere. com), the main American source for books writ- ten by and about Sri Aurobindo and the Mother.

Translated from the French by Tehmi (Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram, 1970). Auroville Planned as an international experimental town- ship, Auroville was inspired by the evolution- ary vision of S RI A UROBINDO and founded by Mirra Alfassa, known as the M OTHER . The name Auroville has the two meanings: “city of dawn,” from the French aurore (dawn), and “city of Aurobindo,” for the theorist who inspired its foundation. Auroville was inaugurated on February 28, 1968, in a ceremony attended by representatives from 124 nations and all the states of India. In a gesture symbolic of human unity, a boy and a girl from each nation and state poured a handful of soil from their homeland into a lotus-shaped marble urn near the center of the city-to-be. Auro- ville has been endorsed by three resolutions of the UNESCO general assembly and recognized as an international trust by a unique parliamentary act of the Indian government. Auroville welcomes people from all parts of the world to live together and explore cultural, educational, scientific, spiri- tual, and other pursuits in accordance with the Auroville Charter. The idea for Auroville began in the Mother’s thinking as early as 1952, when she called for an international center of education. She wrote: “A synthetic organization of all nations, each one occupying its own place in accordance with its own genius and the role it has to play in the whole, can alone effect a comprehensive and progressive unification which may have some chance of enduring.” She continued, “The first aim then will be to help individuals to become conscious of the fundamental genius of the nation to which they belong and at the same time to put them in contact with the modes of K 54 Auroville 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 54 12/14/06 9:28:19 AM"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"living of other nations so that they may know and respect equally the true spirit of all the countries on the earth.” Naturally, the Mother’s internationalist ideal, embedded in the statement, was firmly joined with her understanding that communal and indi- vidual progress must proceed simultaneously. She imagined in this international center that the individuals would all be in search of their highest spiritual development, while they worked toward collective “unification.” When in 1956 the Mother finally experienced the “Supramental manifesta- tion on earth,” which Sri Aurobindo and she had anticipated, she understood that this was the beginning of a new order on Earth. Her notion of Auroville then was of a place where this new order could take concrete form in an international community with a charter and vision like none before. In 1972 the Mother wrote in regard to her “dream” of Auroville: There should be somewhere upon earth a place that no nation could claim as its sole property, a place where all human beings of good will, sincere in their aspiration, could live freely as citizens of the world, obeying one single authority, that of the supreme Truth, a place of peace, concord, harmony, where all fighting instincts of man could be used exclusively to conquer the sources of sufferings and miseries, to surmount his weakness and ignorance, to triumph over his limitations and incapacities; a place where the needs of the spirit and the care for prog- ress would get precedence over the satisfac- tion of desires and passions, the seeking for material pleasures and enjoyment. There are four principles in the Auroville Charter. In summary, they ask that each resident see himself or herself as a servant of the “Divine Consciousness,” that Auroville will be a place of unending education, that Auroville will be a place where the past and the future meet, and that Auroville will be a site to realize “Human Unity.” The ideals for an Aurovillian emphasize the I NTEGRAL Y OGA , the creative development of each person as a unique point of the Divine, and the synthesis of the yogas of knowledge, love, and work. Auroville’s organization and administra- tion are perhaps the most free and unbounded of any similar township on Earth (it is a flourishing community of about 3,000). It is a measure of the success of this experiment in self-governance (fully supported by the Indian government) that Auroville has several citations from the United Nations for its land use and ecological work. The world’s largest solar kitchen provides meals. In support of the Mother’s belief that the age of reli- gions is past and is to be supplanted by a spiritual age beyond religion, the Auroville Charter states pointedly, “No religions.” Except for the stunning hemispheric Matri Mandir (Mother’s temple), no sign of any religious symbol or building can be seen in Auroville.

Australia Mass immigration of Hindus from India to Aus- tralia occurred later than in most other regions of the British Commonwealth, largely because of the 1901 Immigration Restriction Act, a policy enacted by white Australians to limit the numbers of nonwhite citizens. Prior to the enforcement of immigration poli- cies, small numbers of Indians had entered Aus- tralia as merchants, indentured laborers, and Australia 55 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 55 12/14/06 9:28:19 AM"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"domestic servants. The first immigrants from India arrived in New South Wales in 1830 on a trade ship from the Bay of Bengal to work as laborers on cotton and sugar plantations. Others followed sporadically until 1857, when a gold rush on the continent attracted a steady flow of Asian workers. Most Indian laborers were males, who arrived without their families and returned to India once their labor contracts were fulfilled. Some, however, remained in Australia and made a place for themselves and their families. Some became prosperous, such as Sri Pammull, an Indian merchant, who in the 1850s entered the opal trade in Melbourne and established a suc- cessful family business that has continued for four generations. Approximately 1,000 Hindus resided in Australia at the time immigration restrictions were enacted. Most observed their religion pri- vately at shrines within their homes, as formal places of worship had not yet been established. Although immigration restrictions limited the number of immigrants from India, the laws did not prevent adoption of Hinduism by white set- tlers. Between 1890 and 1920 an enthusiasm for Eastern mysticism spread in Australia. Spiri- tual dissenters, intellectuals, and artists from the middle class promoted the establishment of centers of T HEOSOPHY . In the 1890s Charles Leadbeater founded the Theosophical Lodge in Sydney, which eventually became one of the largest Theosophical centers in the world. Theo- sophical lodges served as resource centers for YOGA , sites for lectures on Eastern wisdom, and sponsors of bookstores that disseminated works on Buddhist and Hindu thought. Theosophical lodges served as cultural centers for white Aus- tralians who sought introduction to and assimi- lation of Eastern spirituality. After the immigration restrictions were lifted in the 1960s and 1970s, the population of Hindus, primarily from India, Sri Lanka, and Fiji, grew dramatically. The new arrivals estab- lished strong communities and maintained tra- ditional Hinduism. In 1977, Australia’s first Hindu temple, Sri Mandir, was established by Dr. Padmanabhan Shridhar Prabhu, Dr. Anand, and Prem Shankar. Sri Mandir has served as a center for Hindu festivals and has propagated Hindu culture and philosophy among Indians and non-Indians. Today, many Hindu organizations and yoga schools are part of the culture of Australia, includ- ing the V EDANTA S OCIETY , S IDDHA Y OGA F OUNDA - TION , D IVINE L IFE S OCIETY , and the I NTERNATIONAL S OCIETY FOR K RISHNA C ONSCIOUSNESS . Australian- born adherents have also participated in the propa- gation of Hindu teachings. John Mumford, known as Swami Anandakapila, has become instrumental in popularizing TANTRIC YOGA through the I NTER - NATIONAL Y OGA F ELLOWSHIP . The current growth in Australia’s Hindu population and the continuing interest in Hin- duism among those of European origin have cre- ated a sort of renaissance of Hindu thought and practice. In the 1990s Hinduism became one of the country’s fastest growing religions. Accord- ing to current census reports approximately 95,000 people in Australia identify themselves as Hindu.

Technically, Shiva never becomes an avatar. In recent times, the word avatar has come to be used for any enlightened teacher. It is, in effect, an honorific bestowed upon the teacher by his or her disciples or the larger community. One such example is Avatar A DI DA SAMRAJ .

Avidya is the funda- mental ignorance that causes us to misperceive the phenomenal world. Ignorance causes us to imagine that what we see is the only reality, when this is not the case. There is an underlying real- ity that transcends the mundane sphere and also underlies it, but which cannot be seen by ordi- nary vision. In the V EDANTA of S HANKARA this misunder- standing or avidya is often equated with MAYA , or illusion. According to Shankara avidya is the perception of an actual reality when there is none there, only a false or illusory reality. The only thing real is the BRAHMAN , which underlies all names and forms. In Hindu tantrism the understanding of avidya is different. In that tradition, avidya is what makes us see the world as other than the divinity. The word is used in theistic, nontantric contexts in the sense of misperception of the nature of things.

Ayodhya Ayodhya is located in North India on the Gogra River (formerly the Sharayu), just east of Faizabad in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is the city where Lord R AMA , the AVATA R of V ISHNU , was born and where he ruled. Rama’s story is told in the ancient Indian epic the R AMAYANA . Since the time of the Ramayana story, Ayodhya has been recognized as an important urban center and both Hindu and Jain (see J AINISM ) mythologi- cal literature mentions this city and its king often. In modern times, Ayodhya has become a place of controversy because of a medieval mosque that is said to have been built upon the birth place of Lord Rama. (Because of controversy over the site the mosque had been decommissioned for many years.) Encouraged by politics, this mosque was destroyed in 1993 by fervent Hindus, commenc- ing a time of sharpened conflict between Hindus and Muslims in India.

Ayurveda Ayurveda (from ayus, “life,” and veda, “knowl- edge”) is the ancient tradition of medicine in India. It is said to originate in the A THARVA V EDA . The text Ayurveda, which is no longer extant, was said to have been written by Dhanvantari, the physician of the gods. Ayurveda stresses the close observation and diagnosis of the patient by the doctor. Medicines are not prescribed so universally as in Western allopathic medicine; when they are prescribed they are tailored to the bodily tendencies of the patient. Much of Ayurvedic medicine is based on the understanding of three humorlike systems in the body called wind, bile, and phlegm. Imbal- ances in these humors are seen to be the cause of various ailments of body and mind. Diet, herbs, water, minerals, and other treatments are used for cures. Some, but not all, of Ayurvedic treatment is homeopathic. The ancient tradition of Ayurveda was first put into textual form (the Charaka Sam- hita ) by Charaka or Agnivesha, who claimed that he drew on the Ayurveda of Dhanvantari.

Ayyappan Lord Ayyappan of Sabrimali in Kerala is a divinity with a synthetic character. He is said on the one hand to be the son of S HIVA and M OHINI , V ISHNU ’s female form. He is also said to be an incarnation of the Buddha. Furthermore he is honored in Kerala by Muslims. According to the myth, the god transformed himself into a baby who was found by the king Pandalam, who was childless. Ayyappan was then adopted as his heir. After a short time, Pandalam’s queen produced her own son, and she tried afterward to get rid of Ayyap- pan. She pretended she was ill and said only tiger’s milk could cure her. Ayyappan went off to the forest and returned riding a tigress. In his search for tiger’s milk, Ayyappan had been sent to heaven by Lord Shiva to kill a demoness, Mahishi. Ayyappan had suc- ceeded in ejecting her from heaven and making her fall to Earth. The demoness asked him to take her as his wife, but, he, being celibate, decided not to accept her. However, Mahishi is given a promi- nent place at the Ayyappan shrine. In recent years a winter pilgrimage has been instituted to the Ayyappan shrine; it takes place between December 15 and January 15, depend- ing on the lunar calendar. This men-only event involves an arduous climb up the hills of the Western Ghats and has become popular through- out India. Participants dress in black, take a vow of celibacy for the duration of the celebration, prepare for the pilgrimage by singing praises to Ayyappan, and then head off on the long trek. All castes and creeds are allowed to enter the Ayyap- pan, shrine, but women in their fertile years are not permitted as Ayyappan is said to be “lord of celibacy.” Ayyappan is sometimes also referred to as Shasta, or “ruler of the realm.” Further reading: E.

E .) the eternal yogi Babaji (Revered Father) is a legendary immortal YOGI who is said to have instructed many of the great historic yogis, in the service of his goal of human spiritual evolution. He is particularly associated with the modern yoga movement of the S ELF -R EALIZATION F ELLOWSHIP . Historical information regarding Babaji is diffi- cult to obtain. Paramahansa Y OGANANDA , founder of the fellowship and the first author to create wide recognition of Babaji, dedicates one chap- ter of his book Autobiography of a Yogi to Babaji, whose other names are Mahamuni Babaji Maharaj (Supreme Ecstatic Master), Maha Yogi (Great Yogi), and Trambak Baba or Shiva Baba (both incarnations of S HIVA ). According to Yogananda, Babaji chooses to live in obscurity in the Himala- yas, beyond a holy place called B ADRINATH , and has intentionally kept secret any information about his birthplace and date of birth, which is believed to have occurred so long ago as to be beyond consideration. Babaji is said to work in the background to guide the evolution of human consciousness; at certain times he appears and initiates certain people to advance their spiritual evolution and to promote new paths for humanity. He is not nor- mally accessible, appearing only when he desires, often at melas (festivals). Babaji is not “religious”; rather, his goal is to help everyone achieve SELF - REALIZATION by means of several forms of the sci- ence of YOGA . Babaji is said to have given yoga initiation to the historical teachers S HANKARA (seventh century C . E .) of the Swami Order and K ABIR , (15th century C . E .), the famous medieval Hindi saint-poet. Around 800–900 C . E ., he appeared as G ORAKHNATH and initiated disciples into HATHA and KUNDALINI yoga disciplines. According to Yogananda, around 1860 Babaji taught KRIYA YOGA (the main teaching of the Self-Realization Fellow- ship), to L AHIRI M AHASAYA (1828–95), the GURU responsible for reviving the discipline. Yogananda claimed that Babaji also appeared to him early in the 20th century and gave him his mission to teach in the West. B"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Stories attest to Babaji’s ability to become invisible at will. Because of this and his implicit instruction to his disciples to keep silent about him, little is known about his life. He can speak in any language but generally uses Hindi. His body is forever young, immortal, and not in need of food. Yogananda is said to have demonstrated this ability by the incorruptibility of his own body after his death in 1952, perhaps a capac- ity that develops after intense practice of kriya yoga. Since Yogananda’s death, many more stories relating to Babaji have emerged. He has been iden- tified with an unnamed person who lived in the foothills of the Himalayas in the Kumaon region from around 1890 to 1922. His followers, acting on his statements, expected him to return after his departure in 1922 and established a number of ASHRAMS for him throughout India. Another teacher, Mahendra Baba (d. 1969), throughout the 1950s and 1960s predicted Babaji’s return. Blessed from childhood with appearances from Babaji, Mahendra Baba (d. 1969), a sainted figure himself, devoted his life to facilitating the reap- pearance of Babaji. Mahendra restored the old ASHRAMS , wrote books about Babaji, and asked everyone to receive Babaji. However, Mahendra died before Babaji returned. In June 1970, a young man identified as Hai- dakhan (also spelled Hariakhan) Baba appeared and moved among the Babaji ashrams for 14 years. From 1970 until his death on February 14, 1984, he traveled around India teaching and healing as more ashrams were opened for him. Tens of thousands of Hindus traveled to see him. Haidakhan Baba/Babaji stayed in the countryside, where he could teach the traditional sacred prin- ciples. He taught by example how to attain spiri- tual awakening silently. Babaji told his devotees that he appeared in many incarnations to restore the SANATANA DHARMA , the eternal truth of creation that has manifested and operates in harmony with Divine Will. He urged his students to live in truth and simplicity, regardless of religious affiliation. According to Babaji, true devotion will replace material obsessions and will cultivate the pres- ence of divine wisdom. He urged people at all times to chant the name of God, using the man- tra Om Namah Shiva, literally “I take refuge in God.” Babaji’s followers sing a song to him each morning and evening in a service called an arati. They practice a fire ceremony called the yagya or hawan. Babaji advocated above all things a dedi- cation to serve humanity through karma yoga, selfless action. Leonard Orr and Sondra Ray, founders of the “rebirthing” movement, were among his Ameri- can disciples, and B ABA H ARI D ASS of Santa Cruz, California, published a book about stories col- lected about Haidakhan Baba, Hariakhan Baba Known, Unknown. The Haidakhan Samaj was established in 1980 near Nainital, Uttar Pradesh state, India, as a cen- tral headquarters for the teachings of Haidakhan Baba/Babaji. The American headquarters of the Haidakhan Samaj is located in Crestone, Colo- rado. American devotees publish American Hai- dakhan Samaj Newsletter. The movement counts more than 8,000 members worldwide. Another Indian teacher, S. A. A. Ramaiah, independently of the Haidakhan Baba movement and Self-Realization Fellowship, claimed that in 1942 he and a journalist, V. T. Neelakantan, became students of Babaji in spirit and received directly from him the texts of three books, The Voice of Babaji and Mysticism Unlocked, Babaji’s Masterkey to All Ills, and Babaji’s Death of Death. Ramaiah reports that Babaji revealed his actual beginning in human form in 203 C . E . in Tamil Nadu, India, as the son of a priest of Shiva. Ramaiah reports that Babaji traveled during the third century to the southern tip of Sri Lanka, where he studied with a guru and had a vision of Lord Muruga, son of Shiva. After studies in Tamil Nadu, he eventually went to the Himalayas to practice kriya yoga. Through his practice he was transformed into a SIDDHA (a perfected person with supernatural abilities) and his body became K 62 Babaji 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 62 12/14/06 9:28:20 AM"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"free of the effects of aging, disease, and death. Since that time, he has continued to exist, main- tain a youthful appearance, and become the guide and inspiration of many of India’s great spiritual teachers. In 1951 Ramaiah founded the I NTERNATIONAL B ABAJI K RIYA Y OGA S ANGAM , which now has loca- tions in 50 countries and teaches all of the kriya yoga material that Yogananda deemed inappropri- ate for introduction to the West in the early 20th century. Since Ramaiah’s death, the Babaji Kriya Yoga Sangam has been led by Marshall Govindan, who was initiated by Ramaiah in 1971. Another guru, Swami Satyaswarananda of San Diego, California, claims to have had contact with Babaji. At Babaji’s instruction, he has republished the writings of Lahiri Mahasaya in a series called Sanskrit Classics.

Badami Badami is an archaeological site in the Bijapur District of the Indian state of Karnataka, capital of the famed Chalukya empire from around the sixth to the 11th century. Four sixth-century temples carved into solid rock there show a com- bination of northern and southern architectural styles. Generally they resemble the temples at E LLORA . To the left of the visitor climbing to the top of the rocks is cave one, dedicated to S HIVA . It shows a 14-armed Shiva on one side of the entrance and a protection deity on the other side. Cave two is dedicated to V ISHNU . Its stone carvings tell the full story of Vishnu’s incarnation as V AMANA , the divine dwarf, to save the world from the ravages of the demon king B ALI . Vishnu’s boar incarnation (V ARAHA ) is also depicted in the cave. Cave three is the largest and most elaborate. It contains large carved pillars and an extensive interior. It too has several images of Vishnu— standing, lying on the divine serpent A DISHESHA , as the boar incarnation Varaha, as the man-lion N ARASIMHA , and as the divine dwarf Vamana. Each depiction is approximately 10 feet high and elabo- rately carved. The fourth cave temple is smaller and is Jain ( see J AINISM ) in orientation. It depicts the 24 Jain T IRTHANKARAS , or divine teachers, on a wall and on pillars in relief. The central image is of P ARSHVANATH . Gommateshvara, the son of the first Tirthankara, R ISHABHA ; he is depicted in his stand- ing, yogic pose, overgrown by carved stone vines. Some distance below the caves near the tank are two smaller shrines to Shiva and a small tem- ple to the South Indian goddess Yellamma. These later shrines are from the 11th century. There are small caves scattered at the site down below, some of which were used or dug by Buddhists between the sixth and eighth centuries.

It is sometimes said to be one of the four shrines that a Hindu must visit in his or her lifetime to reach salvation. It is also known as Badarikashrama and has been an important pilgrimage site from ancient times, mentioned in the M AHABHARATA epic. Badrinath lies on the Alaknanda River, understood to be one of the channels that the G ANGA or Ganges took when descending from heaven. The town has a comparatively modern temple built on a peak, dedicated to a form of V ISHNU called Badarinatha. The name—of the site and of the god—is taken from the berry patch, badari vana, that once existed there. The great ninth- century sage S HANKARA established one of his four famous centers at Badrinath.

Bahubali In Jain mythology Bahubali was the younger son of R ISHABHA , the first T IRTHANKARA (holy teacher) in this half of the cosmic cycle, renowned for his remarkable asceticism. In a contest for control of their kingdom Bahubali defeated his older brother, B HARATA , who then became a monk. Not long afterward, Bahubali himself decided to take vows of renunciation. His initial motive was just to compete with his brother, whose asceticism he envied. When his own austerities yielded no fruit, he eventually concentrated on fierce renunciation. On one occasion he was said to have stood on one leg so long that vines and other plants grew up around him and he became covered with ants. He reached his goal of kevalajnana, highest knowl- edge, and has since been famed for it. Bahubali is one of the 63 great beings in the D IGAMBARA Jain pantheon. He is enshrined in colossal statues, particularly in the state of Karna- taka. One huge statue, the 10th-century Shravana Belagola statue in Karnataka, rises nearly 60 feet from its base atop a small mountain peak. On special occasions this statue is given a huge ritual bathing in milk along with massive offerings. Another Bahubali, built in the 15th century in Udipi District, Karnataka, is 40 feet high.

Bailey, Alice Ann (1880–1949) Theosophical teacher Alice Ann Bailey was a prominent teacher and leader in the Western Theosophical movement. She founded Lucis Trust, the Arcane School, and World Goodwill. Bailey was born on June 16, 1880, in Manches- ter, England. She had a rather confined childhood. A devout member of the Church of England, as a young adult she went to India on its behalf to work with the British army. There she met her first husband, John Evans. The couple moved to the United States, where he served as an Episcopal minister, and had three children. The marriage eventually ended in divorce. About the time of her divorce during World War I, she was introduced to the T HEOSOPHI - CAL S OCIETY . At the society headquarters in Los Angeles she saw a picture of a man in a turban, whom she recognized as the same person who K 64 Badrinath 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 64 12/14/06 9:28:21 AM"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"had appeared to her in England when she was only 15 years old. She later learned that the figure was Koot Houmi, one of the ascended masters who had communicated with the society founder Helena P. B LAVATSKY . Bailey went on to become an active member of the society, where she met her future husband, Foster Bailey. While working with the society she was con- tacted by another of the masters, Djwhal Khul, usually referred to as D.K., or simply the Tibetan. Bailey began to channel writings from the Tibetan, later compiled into 19 books. In an appendix to her unfinished autobiography she explained her method of receiving teachings and writing texts in cooperation with the Tibetan. In the same book she stated the founding principles of the school she would later establish. Bailey’s first book, Initiation: Human and Solar, was initially well received. However, Annie Besant, the international president of the society, frowned upon writings independently received from the masters, and both Alice and Foster were soon relieved of their positions in the society. The Baileys were married in 1921. Soon after- ward they founded Lucis Trust and the Arcane School, to publish and disseminate the writings and teachings of the Tibetan and to facilitate the work of interested students. These teachings continued the synthesis of Western and Hindu thought first articulated by Blavatsky that had become the hallmark of Theosophy. The teachings emphasized the divine plan for humankind, the role of karma and reincarnation, and the existence of a spiritual brotherhood or hierarchy, overseeing the evolution and welfare of humanity. Of note is Bailey’s prolific writing on the science of the Seven Rays, first introduced by Blavatsky. Bailey’s work also emphasized the practical aspects of spiritual discipleship, applied on a human level, in particular the importance of group consciousness and world service. To this end, she also founded World Goodwill, a nongovernmental organization dedicated to the promotion of good human relations on a global scale. The Lucis Trust has consultative status at the United Nations, and World Goodwill is affiliated with the United Nations Department of Public Information. Bailey also introduced a world prayer for peace, enlight- enment, and spiritual assistance called the Great Invocation, as well as a set of creative meditations designed to be observed cyclically, primarily at the time of each full Moon, in order to create human alignment with the divine Plan. In addition to the 19 titles written in coop- eration with D. K., Bailey authored five books by herself. All 24 books carry Bailey’s name. Bailey continued to head the Arcane School until her death on December 15, 1949, when Foster took over to lead the organization for several additional years. The Arcane School and the Lucis Trust, together with the service activities World Good- will and Triangles, continue to function today. In addition, a number of other groups attempt to perpetuate the Bailey teachings. Further reading: Alice A.

He is depicted as having a light color in contrast to Krishna’s dark skin; one legend says that Balarama was created from a light hair of V ISHNU , and Krishna from a black hair. Sometimes Balarama is seen as an AVATA R of Vishnu alongside his brother Krishna; sometimes the two are considered to share an avatar as two “parts” of the whole. He is also sometimes seen as an incarnation of A DISHE - SHA , the divine serpent on whom Vishnu rested.

When Kamsa learned that a son of Devaki’s would eventually kill him, he had the couple guarded and had six of Devaki’s children killed in succes- sion. Miraculously, however, the seventh child, Balarama, was transferred as an embryo into the womb of Rohini, a second wife of Vasudeva. When Krishna, the eighth child, was born, the guards miraculously fell asleep, and Vasudeva was able to deliver his new child to a woman from a cowherd family, Y ASHODA . There are few stories about Balarama indepen- dent of those that associate him with Krishna. He is said to have gone to the ocean to meditate when he was very old, when Adishesha emerged from his mouth and returned to the ocean whence he had emerged. Iconographically, B ALARAMA is known as “Rama with the Plow” and carries a plow and axe in either hand. Further reading: Cornelia Dimmitt and J. A.

Unlike the rest of predominantly Muslim Indonesia, however, Bali is overwhelming Hindu. Its unique history reaches back to the spread of Hinduism to Java in the fourth century C . E ., the rise of Hindu rulers on Java by the seventh century, and the spread of Hinduism to Bali in the 11th century. The Hindu Majapahit kingdom, which emerged in eastern Java in the 13th century. at its peak ruled all of Java, Bali, and Madura. However, its upward trajectory was stymied by the arrival and spread of Islam into the Indone- sian islands. In the 15th century, Islam pushed the Majapahits out of Java and the once-powerful kingdom retreated to Bali, where it survived while Java was divided among rival Muslim sultans. Hindu rule of Bali lasted until the mid-19th century, when the Dutch conquered the island. They held it only until the establishment of the Republic of Indonesia after World War II. Much of the Hindu leadership remained in place under Dutch rule. After the Dutch relinquished administration of the island the Hindu culture remained protected by the Indonesian govern- ment. A government-sponsored organization, the Parishad Hindu Dharma Indonesia (PHDI), or Hindu Council of Religious Affairs, is the high- est religious body on Bali and has been given the power to make decisions on all spiritual matters. Since the 16th century, Hinduism in Bali has developed somewhat in isolation from its roots in India, at the same time absorbing a variety of elements from the pre-Hindu indigenous religion of the island. These two factors shaped a distinc- tive form of Hindu life and practice in the islands, whose Hinduism is a blend of S HAIVISM , Bud- dhism, and ancient ancestor worship. The deity S HIVA is primarily associated with the ancestors of kings; consistently with the indigenous religion of Bali, Hindus there do not distinguish between the ancestors of rulers and the gods. The Balinese do not hold to the vegetarian dietary practices of India; instead, they eat such foods as beef, pork, and dog. Balinese Hindus believe in Sanghyang Widhi, the omnipotent Supreme Being, who manifests in three main forms as B RAHMA the Creator, V ISHNU the Preserver, and S HIVA the Destroyer. However, this deity is not directly worshipped through cult or prayer, and none of the Balinese temples is dedicated to him. Among the deities to whom worship is directed, Shiva is the most prominent. He is usually worshipped in associa- tion with one or more local deities whose gender is indicated by their name— Dewa (male) or Dewi (female). The deities are acknowledged through K 66 Bali, Hinduism in 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 66 12/14/06 9:28:21 AM"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"daily offerings and participation in village and temple events. Bali has become known in the wider Hindu world for its frequent and dramatic ceremonies, rather than for any intellectual or spiritual leadership. Unlike in India, the gods of Balinese Hinduism are not seen as dwelling in their images; they live atop the great volcano Gunung Agung, which is identified with Mt. Meru, considered the axis of the world in many stories of traditional Hindu- ism. During worship and festivals the gods are called down from the mountain to enter their statues and the masks worn by celebrants. When the worship or festival ends, the gods return to their abode. The Balinese generally bury their dead; crema- tion is performed only for the more significant members of society. When a cremation is per- formed, corpses of commoners who have died since the last cremation are dug up and burned along with the newly deceased. These crema- tions are elaborate events; a grandly built tower is burned as part of the rite. The cremation is con- sidered to purify the souls of the deceased. Although the images of the gods are not considered sacred, the temple sites are. Bali has more than 20,000 temples. Each village usually has three main temples: the Village Temple, the Temple of Death (in memory of dead royalty), and the Shrine of the Beginning. At the Village Temple villagers congregate for worship and meetings, which center on shared sacred communal meals. The Temple of Death is associated with the nether world and is dedicated to the ancestors of rulers. In Bali, the dead are perceived as dangerous until they are purified by cremation; the temple keeps these negative forces in check. The most important temple is the Shrine of the Beginning, dedicated to the Original Ances- tor (the equivalent of Shiva) and His Consort. Other temples are dedicated to specific functions: water temples are responsible for irrigation and adequate water supply, sea temples hold back the forces of the underworld, and harvest temples secure abundance of food. Temples are built with inner courts containing shrines to the deities and platforms for offerings, and outer courtyards for more mundane purposes, such as the prepara- tion of food. The inner courts also contain one or more towers that represent Mt. M ERU . Outside most temples are sacred groves, usually banyan trees, where demonic forces are propitiated. Each household also contains a shrine known as the “shrine of origin,” dedicated to ancestors and to the Sun god S URYA . Shiva, in the form of Bhattara Guru, the Divine Teacher, is included. According to the Balinese, the Hindu gods migrated to Bali. Indigenous deities such as Ranga and Barong also have an extensive mythol- ogy, which has been grafted onto the tales of the imported gods. Many Balinese live in a lively world inhabited by spirits of all varieties and ghostly entities, many of whom inhabit vari- ous animals, all existing alongside the deities of the Hindu pantheon. They also fear witches (malevolent sorcerers) who live among them more or less openly. Evil spirits are still looked upon as causes of illness and misfortune. Daily offerings are designed, in part, to appease angry spirit entities. Balinese Hinduism distinguishes between two types of priests: the pedandas and local pemang- kus, or temple priests. The pedandas are always male B RAHMINS ; they perform duties and rituals primarily for the higher castes. The pemangkus are in charge of specific temples and daily rituals and serve as priests for commoners. Pemangkus are primarily men but can be women and can be either of caste or without caste. Unlike pedandas, pemangku priests are allowed to be possessed by the gods. Uma, sometimes called P ARVATI , is the prin- cipal goddess of Bali; she is the Goddess of the Mountain Gunung Agung, where she dwells as the consort of Shiva, the Great Ancestor. She has many manifestations. As Uma, she nourishes and causes seeds to germinate. As D URGA , she is the Bali, Hinduism in 67 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 67 12/14/06 9:28:21 AM"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Goddess of Death and the Mistress of Demons. As Devi Ganga and Devi Danu, she is the goddess of both the lake Bator (the site of her chief temple) and the second largest volcano, Gunung Bator. As Sri, she is worshipped at the temples in the rice paddies. As Ibu Petri, she is the Goddess of the Earth. Her most wrathful form is that of Ranga, goddess of the cemeteries. Among the important temples on Bali is Gunug Kawi, one of the island’s oldest, dating to the 11th century. Carved out of local rock, it is located in the Gianyar Regency. The most sacred site on the island is the shrine Pura Besakih, located on the slope of Mt. Agung. Today, over 90 percent of Bali’s three million inhabitants are Hindu, making the island the larg- est community of Hindus outside India.

Bali, the asura Bali is the asura (antigod) who plays the role of villain in the story of V AMANA , the dwarf AVATA R (incarnation) of Vishnu. The story takes many different forms. In the most common version the demon Bali suc- ceeds, through religious austerities, in gaining supreme power over the Three Worlds, Earth, heaven, and the underworld. When he begins to monopolize the offerings that previously went to the gods, they go to Vishnu to ask for assistance. He takes on the form of V AMANA and approaches the arrogant demon with a plan to trick him. The foolish demon king offers the dwarf a boon of ter- ritory—as much as he can cover in three paces. Thereupon the dwarf takes one step to possess the Earth, another to possess the sky, and another to possess heaven itself. In some versions Vamana takes two paces to step over the whole universe and a third step that ends up on Bali’s head. Thus did Vamana return the worlds to the gods.

Basavanna studied the V EDAS and was a devotee of Shiva from an early age, but he was also a political activist and social reformer. He believed that the caste divisions and ritualism of traditional Indian society should be abolished. Basavanna became a powerful minister to a king, while establishing a new religious movement in which caste, class, and sex were disregarded and only devotion to the Lord was important. He rejected traditional ritualism; in place of temples and icons to Lord Shiva, every Virashaiva was required to wear the LINGAM , or sign of Shiva, around the neck. Basavanna’s vacanas or poems were pure expressions of BHAKTI , or devotion, declaring that one’s own body was the true temple of Shiva, not some stone shrine. Virashaivas decry all external religion in favor of the religion of the heart. Further reading: K.

Baul sect A loosely organized sect originating in Ben- gal around the seventh century C . E ., the Bauls sought escape from orthodox Hindu thought and ritual practice, which they deemed lifeless, seek- ing ecstasy through music and dancing. They are known for their unconventional manner, as indicated by their name: the Bengali word baul (Hindi: baur ) is derived from the S ANSKRIT vat- ula, meaning “mad,” or vyakula, meaning “per- plexed.” Bauls are referred to as “madmen drunk with God.” Songs are their unwritten scriptures, yet they do not record either the words or the music. The original Baul devotees drew inspiration from several religions that flourished at the time in Bengal. They adopted practices from T ANTRISM , the non-dual or ADVAITA conception of the Abso- lute from V EDANTA , YOGA disciplines, elements of Sufi dance and music, and the emphasis on the love in the human heart found in V AISHNAVISM . To these, the Bauls added a tenet that each individual must remain free and individual, and each must become a divinized subtle being. Central to the spiritual path of Bauls is their reverence for gurus. Each guru writes his own songs from his personal experience, so that most songs remain original and individual. Some songs have become common to the community and are repeated at yearly festivals, or melas, which are held in Bengal, near Shanti Niketan, the university founded by Rabindranath T AGORE (1861–1941). It was Tagore who took the Baul sect out of obscu- rity by collecting the words of many of their songs and many of their simple melodies. He felt that these creations by the Bauls expressed the highest truth in simple language. Most Bauls are illiterate members of the poorer classes. Others are learned Brahmins who have been rejected by their caste, Muslims disaffected with orthodoxy, and Sufis who fear persecu- tion from Islamic law. Baul groups are scattered throughout India but remain centered in Bengal. Recently Baul musicians and dancers have begun to tour Europe and the United States to perform their songs.

Benares (Varanasi, Kashi) Benares on the G ANGES is the most visited pil- grimage destination in all of India. It is one of the seven primary pilgrimage cities in India, one of the 12 jyotir LINGAM (lingam of light) sites, and Benares 69 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 69 12/14/06 9:28:22 AM"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"a SHAKTI PITHA site sacred to the Divine Mother. It is considered the most desirable place where a Hindu can die and be cremated, as it is understood that liberation from birth and rebirth is conferred upon a person by the holiness of the city. Myth says that the Ganges flows through the topknot of Shiva down to Earth; for many it is understood that those who bathe in it derive special blessings from Shiva. At Benares any act of devotion whatsoever, be it the smallest offering, act of penance or char- ity, or chant, yields unlimited results. Benares has been known at different times as Varanasi or Kashi (the place of the supreme light). It has been a great center of Shiva worship in particular and has known more than 3,000 years of continuous habitation. Only a few buildings are left from before the 16th century, as Muslim armies from the 12th century destroyed nearly every temple there. The city’s primary Shiva shrine, the Vishwanath Temple, dates only from 1776, when it was rebuilt across the road from its original ancient location. The jnana vapi, or Well of Wisdom, is adjacent to the site of the original temple and is the ritual cen- ter of Benares. The well is said to have been dug by Shiva himself, and its waters carry the liquid form of JNANA , the light of insight. Benares contains so many hundreds of shrines and temples that it is said a pilgrim would need all the years of his or her life to visit them all. Some of these temples are named after the great pilgrimage centers, in other parts of India: R AMESHVARAM , D VARAKA , Puri, and K ANCHIPURAM . In this way, visiting Benares is tantamount to vis- iting all the major shrines and temples of India. Most pilgrims make only short visits of days or weeks to Benares, but there are also many thou- sands who see it as the last port of call of their earthly existence. There are nearly 100 cremation spots in the six-mile expanse of the Ganges at Benares. A well-worn 50-mile pilgrimage path encircles the holy city; pilgrims generally take five days to complete the walk, visiting 108 shrines along the way. A second important Benares pilgrimage route takes two days to complete and has 72 shrines. Bustling, dusty Benares was once an area of sylvan wilderness. Sages and saints such as B UD - DHA , M AHAVIRA , and T ULSIDAS all at one time or another prayed and meditated here. For centuries Benares may have been the most often-visited sacred place on the planet. In any case, for Hindus there is no holier city on Earth.

Bernard, Pierre Arnold (1875–1955) Western tantric teacher Born Peter Coons in Leon, Iowa, Pierre Bernard created the Tantrik Order in America, in New York City, in 1909, perhaps the first Hindu group in the United States founded by a Westerner. As a young man, Bernard moved from Iowa to California, where he held odd jobs. At age 30 he met Mortimer Hargis, with whom he formed the Bacchante Academy in San Francisco to teach hyp- notism and “soul charming,” a term that referred to sexual practices. The earthquake of 1906 lev- eled the academy and Bernard moved east. In 1909 Bernard founded the Tantrik Order in America and gave himself the name Oom the Omnipotent. He taught YOGA and tantric Hin- duism, a branch of the religion that focuses on sexual energies and consciousness. In 1910 he was arrested on charges filed by two women in his group that he was conducting sexual orgies and was keeping women against their will. He was allowed to continue operating his institute but was kept under the eye of the local police. He became legal guardian of his half sister, Ora Ray Baker, later to become the wife of Hazrat Inayat Khan, founder of the Sufi Order.

In 1924, Bernard founded a center and an Ori- ental-Occult Library on his estate in Nyack, New York. His 70-acre property included a mansion that served as his headquarters and an adjacent Inner Circle Theatre, which contained a library of thousands of books on Eastern religion and the occult. Here he hosted gurus and other visit- ing teachers of religious and occult subjects. He became a prominent citizen, offering his estate to refugees from Nazi Germany. His nephew, Theos Bernard, lived at the Nyack estate and later attended Columbia University, where in 1944 he wrote a thesis on HATHA YOGA that has become a classic text. A colorful and intriguing character, Bernard interpreted tantric practices in a manner uniquely his own. His claims of having attained a teaching degree in Hinduism in India are unsubstantiated. His frequent name changes and questionable credentials made him the object of ridicule in journalistic reports of the day, but he did gain an expertise in Hindu thought and practice that made him an important figure in the growth of interest in Hinduism in the United States, in part through his connections with spiritual leaders and occultists of his day. Bernard died quietly after a brief illness on September 27, 1955, in Nyack, New York.

Besant, Annie Wood (1847–1933) English socialist and president of the Theosophical Society Annie Besant was an English socialist reformer who converted to T HEOSOPHY after reading the works of H. P. B LAVATSKY . She became an influen- tial figure in the growth of Theosophy as a world- wide movement and helped spread appreciation of Hinduism in the West. Annie Wood was born in London to a middle- class Irish couple on October 1, 1847. She was raised after her father’s death by her mother in a very religious environment. She followed conven- tion by marrying a minister and schoolmaster, Frank Besant, in 1867. They had two children, but she left the marriage in 1893 and took the chil- dren with her in order to realize the ideals of her emerging progressivism. The couple was legally separated five years later. Besant had begun to write while still with her husband; once separated she started to air her skeptical views in essays. She joined the National Secular Society and lectured on feminist issues. She joined forces with Charles Bradlaugh, the atheist freethinker, to found the Free-thought Publishing Company. In 1877, with Bradlaugh, she was arrested for selling birth control pam- phlets in London’s slums. They were convicted, but the verdict was overturned and the trial helped to liberalize public attitudes. In 1888 she coordinated a strike of unskilled young women laborers at a match factory, which shed light on cruel and unsafe labor practices. She soon estab- lished a reputation as an orator, skeptic, and advo- cate for women’s rights. During the 1880s, Besant became a friend of George Bernard Shaw, who considered her Britain’s and perhaps Europe’s greatest orator; developing an interest in socialism she joined the Fabian Society.

She later said that she found in the revelations of Theosophy answers to questions that she had not found in socialism, free thought, or Christianity. She resigned from the National Secular Society, renounced socialism, and became an ardent spokesperson for Theosophy. After Blavatsky’s death in 1891, Besant became the powerful head of the Esoteric section of the Theosophical Society. After a tour of the United States, where she addressed the World Parlia- ment of Religions in Chicago, she moved to India, which became her home and headquarters until her death. She succeeded H. S. Olcott as president of the Theosophical Society in 1907 and retained the office until her death in 1933; she presided over a time of rapid expansion of the society, after a period of stagnation. In 1909 Besant organized the Order of the Star in the East, in order to prepare for Theosophy’s predicted appearance of a world teacher, who would help all of humanity evolve to higher con- sciousness. When a young South Indian B RAHMIN boy was found near the Theosophy compound at Adyar, outside Madras (Chennai), she became convinced that he, J. K RISHNAMURTI , would be the instrument for the coming world teacher. After receiving considerable grooming for the role of Lord Maitreya, Krishnamurti abdicated the title and suspended the Order of the Star in the East. He continued to call Besant “mother,” but he refused to accept the role of “world teacher” that she felt he embodied. Although she had abandoned her socialist affiliations, Besant carried her social reform values wherever she went. In India, the Theosophical Society founded many schools in India, including some of the first in the country for women. Politi- cally, she fought for Indian independence from British rule, and she was elected president of the Indian National Congress in 1917. To Blavatsky’s emphasis on Buddhism, Besant added an emphasis on Hinduism to the Theo- sophical corpus. She wrote with C. W. Leadbeater, a Theosophist who was also an Anglican priest and later bishop of the Liberal Catholic Church, about the gifts of Hinduism and the East to eso- teric wisdom in the West. Besant died on Septem- ber 21, 1933, at the Theosophy compound. Further reading: O. Bennett, Annie Besant (London: Hamish Hamilton, In Her Own Time Series, 1988); A. W.

E .) early Jain leader Bhadrabahu is revered by both D IGAMBARA and S HVETAMBARA Jains ( see J AINISM ). Both sects regard him as the last of the persons who knew all the early sacred texts of the Jain tradition. Bhadrabahu was born in Pundravardhan in what is now Bangladesh, during the reign of Chandragupta Maurya, the great Indian king. According to the Digambara tradition he led a large group of his adherents from North India to Karnataka and thus introduced Jain tradition to South India. That tradition further recounts that on his return to Pataliputra (Patna) in the north, he found that there had been an official recension of the Jain scriptures; he and his monk followers refused to accept this “new” Jain canon. He also found that the northern monks had taken up unacceptable practices, especially the wearing of clothing, which is forbidden to Digambara (sky-clad) monks. Bhadrabahu and his adherents declared themselves to be the only true Jains.

Bhagavad Gita Bhagavad Gita means “Song about God.” It is a segment, dating from around 200 B . C . E ., of the M AHABHARATA , the classic Sanskrit epic tradition- ally ascribed to V YA S A . It has 18 chapters totaling approximately 700 verses. In the framework of a legendary battle, the poem presents a philosophy of life and states principles guiding the practices of YOGA . The framework story begins when the hero, A RJUNA , asks his charioteer, K RISHNA , to pull the chariot up between the two battling armies. On one side are his own P ANDAVAS who have the right- ful claim to the kingship. On the other side are their cousins, the K AURAVAS , who now are usurp- ers. Seeing that he is about to go into battle with his own guru D RONA ; his grandfather, B HISHMA ; and many of his cousins, Arjuna’s will fails and he sits down, not wanting to fight. Krishna scolds Arjuna and insists that he go to battle; he then begins a lecture on the nature of reality. Krishna, it eventually becomes clear, is God himself, though he has taken a role here as charioteer. He outlines several yogas that will help Arjuna fight the battle of existence. The first of the yogas is that of knowledge ( JNANA ), which involves insight into the Truth of Ultimate Reality, BRAHMAN . This practice involves meditative focus on the Ultimate as beyond all forms and categories. Next is the yoga of devotion ( BHAKTI ), which involves focus on God—Krishna himself, in this case—in a steady, yogic poise of consciousness involving surrender to the Divinity, the being that oversees the universe. The third yoga is that of action ( KARMA ). Krishna explains how one can act in the world yogically without regard to the fruits of one’s actions. Underlying all the three yogas is the fourth yoga, rajayoga, or the yoga of MEDITATION ( dhyana ), which must be practiced in order to do any of the others. The Gita generally favors action in the world and opposes leaving the world to become a renun- ciant. In the Gita, renunciation is redefined as giv- ing up the fruits of actions, not leaving the world to try to be actionless. The Gita also emphasizes devotion to the iconic divinity with form and char- acteristics, although it does not deny that some might pursue the path of realizing the transcendent brahman that is beyond characteristics and action. The Gita often cites the importance of devel- oping what is called “steady mind,” which will prevent perturbation of mind and wrong conduct whatever course we choose to take. It must be emphasized that though the Gita unfolds against a backdrop of war, it is not to be considered a prowar tract. All its commentators from earliest times interpret the text metaphorically; it refers to anyone’s battle against karma and for liberation from the cycle of birth and rebirth. The Bhagavad Gita was the favorite text of Mohandas Karamchand G ANDHI , the foremost proponent of nonviolence. Today the Gita is memorized and chanted as an aid to the realiza- tion of the essence of the yogas detailed therein. Ideally, the entire text is committed to memory and chanted daily.

Bhagavan Bhagavan in Sanskrit means “one who is glorious, illustrious, revered, divine, or holy.” It is the most common word for “God” in Hinduism. In its sense of “holy” or “divine” it is also used as an honor- ific for gurus and divine personages, for example, Bhagavan Sri R AJNEESH .

Bhagavata Purana The Bhagavata Purana is one of the 18 principal PURANAS of Indian tradition; it may well be the most popular of them all. Bhagavata means “that which pertains to god” (in this case, V ISHNU , and more particularly his incarnation as K RISHNA ); a purana is a work describing the actions and his- tory of a divinity. The Bhagavata Purana then is the story about those who are devoted to God. The work is sometimes attributed to V YA S A , author of the Mahabharata. The Bhagavata Purana was probably com- posed in South India, as it makes reference to the devotional A LVARAS Vaishnavite saints of the Tamil country. There are 18,000 verses in this work, 332 chapters and 12 sections or books. The 10th section, the most popular, recounts the tales of Krishna’s life in B RINDAVAN —his killing of demons, his childhood escapades, and his dalliances with the GOPIS or cowherd girls. The work exalts BHAKTI or devotion to God as the highest of paths. Neither by knowledge alone ( JNANA ) nor by action can one reach the supreme, which requires only steadfast devotion. The poem agrees with those V EDANTA philosophers who see the supreme divinity as the embodiment of innu- merable auspicious characteristics and see the world as real and a manifestation of the godhead. As do these philosophers, it equates the BRAHMAN (Ultimate Reality) and the ATMAN (Ultimate Self) of the U PANISHADS with Vishnu or Krishna. According to the Bhagavata Purana, each indi- vidual soul is eternally distinct and real, even when basking in the full effulgence of God after liberation from birth and rebirth. Liberation gives the soul its place in heaven, Goloka, where Lord Krishna resides. Commentaries on the Bhagavata Purana are numerous; the Vedanta (teachers) M AD - HVA and V ALLABHA both wrote full commentaries.

Bhairava Bhairava (frightful or terrible) is a fearsome manifestation of S HIVA , whose icon has long fangs. He is sometimes also called Kalabhairava or Kalaraja, Lord of Time (as K ALI is seen to be the Mistress of Time), and is seen to control time and the world. Bhairava’s frightful nature emerged when Lord B RAHMA spoke to him arrogantly, and he severed Brahma’s fifth upward-looking head with his fin- gernail. Because he had thus killed a B RAHMIN , the skull could not be removed from his hand, where it remained, until he was released from the curse that befalls one who kills a Brahmin.

It was he who wandered through the three worlds to arrive at the Deodar Forest where sages ( RISHIS ) dwelt with their wives. The sages did not recognize Shiva in this naked, fierce beggar, but he was irresistibly attractive to their wives. In a final act of defiance against the confounded rishis, Bhairava brandished his erect penis before the wives to their delight and passion (as he was the ruler of the universe). The rishis put a curse on him to lose his penis, which flew around the worlds like a missile, destroying every- thing in its path. Finally, they had to call upon the Great Goddess to offer her YONI or vagina to hold it in place and pacify it. This is the origin of the Shiva LINGAM , which is always depicted as a phal- lus held in an encircling yoni.

Bhajan, Yogi (1929–2004) Sikh guru Harbhajan Singh Puri was instrumental in estab- lishing the Sikh religion in North America. The future guru was born on August 26, 1929, in what is now Pakistan to a family headed by a medical doctor. He spent a privileged youth in private schools (he attended a Catholic convent school) and summer retreats. At the age of eight he began training in yoga with an enlightened teacher, Sant Hazara Singh, who proclaimed Harbhajan a mas- ter of K UNDALINI yoga at the age of 16. During the unrest of partition in 1947, the young Harbhajan led thousands of villagers from their residence near Lahore, Pakistan, to resettle in New Delhi. He went on to study comparative religion and Vedic philosophy and received a master’s degree with honors in economics from Punjab University and a Ph.D. in communications psychology. He married Inderjit Kaur in 1952 and they had two sons. He entered Indian government service, employed in the internal revenue supervi- sion and customs service. In 1968 Harbhajan immigrated to the United States, via Canada, with a vision of introducing YOGA to the West. He announced that he had traveled to the West “to create teachers, not to gain students.” A devoted S IKH , he helped legally incorporate the Sikh Dharma (order) in the United States in 1971. That year Sant Charan Singh, president of the governing body of Sikh Temples in India, named Harbhajan Siri Singh Sahib, Chief Religious and Administrative Authority for the Western Hemi- sphere. The Akal Takhat, the Sikh seat of religious authority in Amritsar, assigned him responsibility to create a Sikh ministry in the West. He redirected young people who were experimenting with drugs and altered states of consciousness to seek higher consciousness, pointing to their deep desire to real- ize holistic and liberating states of mind. In 1969, Yogi Bhajan created the H EALTHY , H APPY , H OLY O RGANIZATION (3HO) to integrate kundalini yoga, MEDITATION , compassionate phi- losophy, and healthy living. It was one of the most popular of the new religions in the United States in the 1970s and 1980s. He died on October 6, 2004.

They are aimed at focusing the con- sciousness on higher reality, in order to develop the steadiness of mind that is needed to deal with the troubles and difficulties of this life. They also are seen to purify the consciousness so that one can take a step toward ending one’s cycle of birth and rebirth. Thus their purest goal is MOKSHA , lib- eration or release from that cycle.

Compared with the later practice of bhakti, these divinities were not addressed with intimacy and a sense of connection; furthermore, they were never iconographically represented and were not generally visualized in human form; the humanity of the divinity became a very important element in later bhakti. The devotional practices of bhakti are very old, probably originating with the non-A RYAN (thus non-Vedic) population. As the Aryans gradually spread beyond their original settlement in North- west India and established cultural dominance over the indigenous peoples of India, they rather freely incorporated values and traditions from the local substratum. This influence began to show an obvious impact in the development of the bhakti path within Hinduism. The Sanskrit text the B HAGAVAD G ITA , written around 200 B . C . E ., was the first true bhakti text in the Indian tradition, in that case focusing on the worship of K RISHNA . It depicts a very close, personal relationship with God, one with a human form and personality. However, bhakti is still seen as a restrained, austere practice that takes the form of a YOGA . As bhakti began to emerge with full force in the extreme south of India beginning in the third century, the devotion to the gods V ISHNU and S HIVA and to the Goddess became a passionate, emotional experience. Devotees such as the poet- saints who periodically emerged until the 17th or 18th century threw themselves into bhakti with complete abandon. The quintessential devotee took pride in being considered a mad person and would be often completely lost in ecstatic song and trance. One important reason why the bhakti movement eventually swept all India and trans- formed the face of Hinduism was that the songs of the saints were all in the local dialects and lan- guages, not in the Sanskrit language of the priestly elite. These works were lovingly remembered and compiled by their followers. Bhakti often involved PILGRIMAGE to and wor- ship at sacred places where ICONS of the chosen deity could be found. The temple tradition of India developed on the basis of devotion to dei- ties who took iconic shape in stone in temples the length and breadth of the country. Devotees yearned to see the deity and to have audience with him or her. This audience is referred to as DARSHAN , or “viewing,” and is the most special and intimate aspect of the temple visit.

De met Sri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami, head of the G AUDIYA M AT H , an India-wide C HAITANYA -V AISHNAVITE religious move- ment, who became his spiritual master. In 1932 Sri Saraswati initiated De into the Gaudiya Math and gave him the name Abhay Charanaravinda, meaning “one who fearlessly takes shelter at the feet of the Lord.” The GURU told him to prepare to spread the teachings of Krishna worship in the West, but De put aside the suggestion. After his guru’s death two decades later, he wrote his first books: an Introduction to the Geetopanishad and the Bhagavad Gita As It Is. For these publications, a society called the Vaishnavites honored him with the title Bhaktivedanta, meaning “devotion to the knowledge of God.” He left his wife and family in 1959 to study under another teacher, Acha- rya Goswami, at the Radha Damodara temple in B RINDAVAN (Krishna’s birthplace), where he lived austerely in a small room. In 1965 Bhaktivedanta visited the United States to proclaim the message of Krishna. In 1966 he founded the I NTERNATIONAL S OCIETY FOR K RISHNA C ONSCIOUSNESS (known as ISKCON), to propound the ancient tradition of Vaishnavism, as taught in the first half of the 16th century by the ecstatic Chaitanya, among modern seekers. The followers of ISKCON have made BHAKTI YOGA famous in the West through their ubiquitous chanting of the Hare Krishna mantra. The orga- nization has published new translations of many ancient Vaishnavite scriptures, particularly the B HAGAVAD G ITA and the B HAGAVATA P URANA . The movement became one of the most promi- nent of the alternative religions to emerge during the 1970s in America, from which it has spread to every continent. Before his death, Srila Prab- hupada (an honorific) saw the building of many temples, children’s schools, rural communities, and major cultural centers around the world. Since his death, the movement has diminished in size and has fragmented. On July 9, 1977, Bhaktivedanta Swami appointed 11 of his senior assistants to act as officiating priests ( ritviks ) to initiate all future ISKCON members on his behalf. After his death at Brin- davan on November 14 that year, the appointees claimed they were in fact chosen as successor gurus, causing confusion and controversy within the movement. ISKCON members believe that Bhaktivedanta Swami still exerts his spiritual influence on anyone who follows his teachings, and that he remains a highly empowered devotee of their God, Krishna. Effigies of Bhaktivedanta Swami are installed in all ISKCON temples. Today, in additon to ISKCON, a reform move- ment, the I NTERNATIONAL S OCIETY FOR K RISHNA C ONSCIOUSNESS R EVIVAL M OVEMENT (IRM), carries on the teaching of Bhaktivedanta Swami. Further reading: A.

In the 19th century Bharata Natyam was codified and documented as a performing art by four brothers known as the Tanjore Quartet, whose musical compositions form most of the Bharata Natyam repertoire even today. The dance was handed down from genera- tion to generation under the DEVADASI system, in which women were dedicated to temples to serve the deity as dancers and musicians. These highly talented artists and their male gurus kept the art alive until the early 20th century, although the devadasis were by now no longer considered respectable. At that time, a renewal of interest in India’s cultural heritage prompted the educated elite to rediscover it. The revival of Bharata Natyam by pioneers such as E. Krishna Iyer and Rukmini Devi Arundale drew the dance out of the temples and onto the stage. It did not cease, however, to be a dance devoted to the divinities. Contemporary Bharata Natyam is based on solo dances with musical accompaniment, includ- ing singers and percussion. The dance unfolds from a base stance with the body in a lowered position with knees akimbo. From this stance the legs are moved outward rhythmically, beating tempo in play with the percussion. Most perfor- mances include a “pure dance” aspect, but hand and facial gestures ( MUDRAS ) are also important; they communicate, in a coded pantomime, the story being told. The stories are almost always about the gods S HIVA and V ISHNU (in his various incarnations) and their wives and families. The narrative plays on familiar stories that almost always express a devotional sentiment; it is a form of choreographed worship. Today Bharata Natyam is one of the most pop- ular and widely performed Indian dance styles; it is practiced by male and female dancers all over India. Degree courses covering the practice and theory of Bharata Natyam are at last available at major universities of India. Important Bharata Natyam dancers of the 20th century revival include Balasaraswati, sometimes thought of as the last devadasi; Rukmini Devi Arundale, and Yamini Krishnamurti.

Bharati, Baba Premanand (d. 1914) pioneer Hindu leader in the United States Baba Premanand Bharati was among the small group of Hindu leaders who entered the United States in the decades after the World’s Parliament of Religions in 1893. He founded the Krishna Samaj in New York City soon after the start of the new century.

He was a devotee of Krishna and followed a form of Vaishnavite BHAKTI YOGA similar to that popularized in the 1970s by the I NTERNATIONAL S OCIETY FOR K RISHNA C ONSCIOUSNESS . He advocated the repetition of the Hare Krishna mantra as a means of gaining release from the wheel of reincarnation and gain- ing enlightenment. Bharati first worked in New York City, where he organized the Krishna Samaj. He lectured along the East Coast for several years and then moved to Los Angeles, where he built a temple and devel- oped a youthful and loyal following. After only a few years, in 1909, he returned to India, where he died in 1914, still a relatively young man. In the years after his death, Bharati was con- demned by American nativists such as Elizabeth Reed, who were mobilizing public support for the Asian Exclusion Act, which passed in 1917. At about that time the Krishna Samaj was shut down. However, Bharati’s followers later formed several other organizations with similar missions, includ- ing the Order of Loving Service, active only in the 1930s, and the AUM Temple of Universal Truth, which continued to operate into the 1980s, reprint- ing Bharati’s writings in their periodicals and circu- lating his picture a half-century after his death.

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Peoples Party of India, is one of the largest political parties in India, serving as the governing party on the state and fed- eral levels at various times in recent years. The BJP is the political wing of the old R ASH - TRIYA S VAYA M S EVAK S ANGH (RSS), the National Organization for Self-help. It was formed as a separate party in 1980 after internal differences within the Janata Party resulted in the collapse of its government in 1979. BJP held the prime min- istership of India from 1998 to 2004 under the leadership of Atal Bihari Bajpayee. In 2004 it was defeated in parliamentary elections by a coalition led by the Congress Party. The Bharata Janata Party considers itself to be a party of H INDU N ATIONALISM ; its ideology is called Hindutva, defined not in terms of the Hindu religion but as Indianness. The party points to the original meaning of the word Hindu, coined by Arab conquerors to refer to all the people living in India. However, critics have labeled the BJP a Hindu fundamentalist or even a Hindu fascist party. The BJP rose to prominence during the tur- moil surrounding the Babri Masjid Mosque in the Uttar Pradesh city of A YODHYA . This mosque was built in 1528 C . E . on a site claimed to be the birthplace of R AMA , an AVATA R of Visnu. During the 1940s RSS members erected an image of Rama in the mosque, and the government later sealed off the mosque. During the 1980s the RSS began staging violent protests against its very existence. Lal Krishnan Advani, the leader of the BJP and a leader in the V ISHVA H INDU P ARISHAD (World Hindu Council), was indicted on several occa- sions for leading the protests. This mosque was destroyed in 1992 by RSS activists, prompting nationwide riots that killed 3,000 people. In 2006 BJP was voted out of office to a great extent because of the Gujarat violence of 2003, when 3,000 Muslims were killed, for which the BJP chief minister, Narendra Modi, was held responsible.

Bhartrihari (c. fourth or fifth century) grammarian and philosopher Bhartrihari was a philosopher of language whose work was seminal in the development of the Indian theories of language and of MANTRA . There are several extant accounts of his life, but none seem to have a historical basis. He was primarily known as a grammarian, but his works had great philosophical impact as well. Bhartrihari developed a philosophy that came to be known as “word ADVAITA , ” or non-dual- ism, based on the notion that the word ( shabda ) is the transcendent reality. His idea of “Shabda BRAHMAN , ” or Ultimate Reality, as the basis of all language, broke the barrier between grammar and philosophy. He is best known for his work Vakyapadiya (Treatise on words and sentences), which formulates the sphota theory of linguistic utterance, much debated in successive times. Bhartrihari maintained that the study of Sanskrit grammar alone could cause one to attain libera- tion from birth and rebirth.

Bhaskara (c. ninth century C . E .) Vedantic philosopher Bhaskara was one of the most important phi- losophers of V EDANTA . He accepts the notions of non-duality—the unity of reality—as argued by the earlier S HANKARA , but does not accept their notion that the phenomenal universe, the every- day world, is illusory. He instead argues that the universe is a real evolute of the Supreme Reality BRAHMAN , regarded not as a person but as an entity. Only one of his books is extant, a commentary on the Vedantic text the V EDANTA S UTRA . Further reading: S. N. Dasgupta, A History of Indian Philosophy. Vol. 3 (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1975); A.

Sanskrit playwright One of the greatest authors in Indian literature, Bhavabhuti is most famous for his three surviving Sanskrit dramas: Mahaviracharita (Adventures of that great hero Rama), Uttararamacharita (The later adventures of Rama), and Malatimadhava (The story of Malati and Madhava). Mahavira- charita tells with considerable originality the full story of R AMA from his birth to the defeat of his enemy R AVANA . The Uttararamacharita is a story of the children of Lord Rama as they grew up in the forest, a story not told in the original R AMAYANAS . Malatimadhava is basically a romance.

Bhave, Vinoba (1885–1982) leader in the Indian independence movement Vinoba Bhave, a prominent nonviolent leader of the Indian independence movement, was a pro- lific popular writer and a tireless organizer for land redistribution and social reform. He contin- ued to agitate on behalf of Gandhian social values in the decades after independence.

Vinoba (an affectionate nickname) studied the works of Maharashtra’s saints and philosophers as a boy. He had a pas- sion for mathematics, but as had Sri R AMAKRISHNA before him, he seemed uninterested in the ordi- nary course of education. He spent two years in college dissatisfied and adrift. Early in 1916, on his way to Bombay (Mumbai) to appear for the intermediate examination, he threw his school and college certificate into a fire and decided to change course for B ENARES (Varanasi), the Hindu holy city, to study Sanskrit. At Benares, Vinoba encountered the views of Mohandas Karamchand G ANDHI . Enthusiastic about Gandhi’s ideas of uplifting the poor and purity of purpose he joined Gandhi’s ASHRAM at Sabarmati near Ahmedabad in Gujarat state. At Gandhi’s request he took charge of the ashram at Wardha in Maharashtra in 1921. In 1923 he began to publish the monthly Maharashtra Dharma in the regional Marathi language, to which he contributed articles on Indian philoso- phy, including popular studies on the Abhangas of the poet-saint T UKARAM . Later on, the monthly became a weekly and continued to be published for three years. On December 23, 1932, Vinoba moved to Nalwadi (a village about two miles from Wardha), where he tried to implement his idea of support- ing himself by spinning. When he grew ill in 1938, he moved to what he called Paramdham Ashram in Paunar, which remained his headquar- ters. Vinoba was heavily involved in the freedom movement throughout this period. In 1923, he was jailed for several months at Nagda and Akola for taking a prominent part in agitation at Nag- pur. In 1925, he was sent by Gandhi to Vykon in Kerala to supervise the entry of the Harijans (Dalits, or untouchables) to the temple. In 1932, he was jailed for six months for raising his voice against British rule. In 1940, he was selected by Gandhi as the first person to do “Truth Force” ( satyagraha ), Gandhi’s nonviolent method of social action, on his own. Vinoba was jailed three times during 1940–41 for successively longer terms. He became known nationally when Gandhi selected him for indi- vidual action, introducing him in a statement on October 5, 1940. Vinoba took part in the Quit India movement of 1942, for which he was jailed for three years at Vellore and Seoni. Jail for Vinoba had become a place for reading and writing. He saw the proofs of his book Gitai (a Marathi translation of the B HAGAVAD G ITA ) in the Dhulia jail, where he lectured on the Gita to his jailed colleagues; the talks were collected by Sane Guruji and later published as a book. In Nagpur jail he wrote Swarajya Shastra (the treatise of self rule) and completed a collection of the bhajans (religious songs) of the saints Gyaneshwar ( see J NANESHVARA ), Eknath and Namdev. His popular books eventually treated many diverse topics in religion, philosophy, education, and the common good. In March 1948, Gandhi’s followers and work- ers met at Sevagram, to discuss the idea of Sarvodaya Samaj (Society for the uplift of all). Vinoba got busy with activities to soothe the wounds of partition of the nation. In the begin- ning of 1950, Vinoba started several idealistic reform movements. In 1951 Vinoba launched the activity for which he became most famous, the Bhudan (Gift of the Land) movement. For the next 13 years he walked from place to place around the country asking large landowners and villages to offer land to the poor, to help bridge the great divide between the landed and landless. His efforts yielded surpris- ing success by the time he returned to Paunar on April 10, 1964. Over the following several years he continued in his travels, now campaigning against the various divisions within Indian society: caste, language, and class. In 1970, he announced his decision to stay in one place. He observed a year of silence from December 25, 1974, to December 25, 1975.

His spiritual pursuits intensified as he withdrew from his practical work. He passed away on November 15, 1982, at his ashram. Vinoba’s contribution to the history of the nonviolent movement remains significant. All his life he campaigned for “people’s government,” according to the Gandhian principle of extreme decentralization. He believed, as Gandhi did, that government and the economy should be built from the village up, not from the capital city down. Though his idealistic campaigns may have fallen short of their goals, all who encountered Vinaba saw a generous, committed, spiritually directed person. He inspired a whole generation. As a sign of respect for him and his spiritual accomplishment, Vinoba Bhave was referred to most commonly as ACHARYA , “the learned one.” Further reading: S. R.

Bheda means “dif- ference,” abheda means “nondifference”; together the term refers to things that are different and not different at the same time. This school views the individual self as nondifferent ( abheda ) from the divinity, while recognizing that in certain respects the divinity is different from the individual self (for example, regarding its supremacy over the universe). This point of view was expounded by B HASKARA and by the C HAITANYA school, whose approach is referred to as achintya bhedabheda. N IMBARKA ’s school refers to itself formally as Dvaitadvaita, “duality and non-duality,” a different expression of the same concept, although it too is sometimes called bhedabheda.

The five Pandavas were all born of the same mother, K UNTI , with different gods as their fathers. That Bhima’s father was the wind god V AY U explains his violence, temerity, and quickness to anger. He is also known for overweening pride and gluttony. Bhima was prodigiously strong and a formidable, undefeatable wrestler. From childhood, Bhima faced an angry rival in his cousin D URYODHANA , who persistently plotted to usurp the kingdom that rightfully belonged to the sons of P ANDU . One time Duryodhana poi- soned Bhima and threw him into the G ANGES . This action backfired: the poison was neutralized by the snake-people or NAGAS who lived in the river, who also gave Bhima a magic potion to make him superstrong. When Duhshana, one of the Kaurava sons, tried to disrobe D RAUPADI , the wife of the Pandavas, Bhima angrily vowed that he would one day kill Duryodhana and drink the blood of Duhshasana, a vow he eventually fulfilled. Bhima married the demoness Hidimba and fathered a son with her named Ghatokacha, who became a Bhima 83 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 83 12/14/06 9:28:25 AM"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"fierce fighter in the war with the K AURAVAS .

Bhishma Bhishma, “the terrible,” is one of the most impor- tant characters in the great epic M AHABHARATA . He was the son of the river goddess Ganga ( see G ANGES ) and the first son of the king Shantanu. In his old age, Shantanu wished to take another wife, Satyavati, but the woman insisted that any son of hers become king. As a devoted son Bhishma thereupon took a vow that he would never take the throne; as a wise man, he also vowed never to take a wife or father children. Bhishma’s efforts to obtain wives for Satyavati’s son Vichitravirya proved his undoing. When he seized a woman named Amba as a potential bride, she begged to be returned to her country to marry another man, and Bhishma released her. However, her chosen love rejected her, and she returned to Bhishma. This time he refused to marry her to Vichitravirya. Enraged, Amba vowed to kill Bhishma one day, although he had earned the boon that he could not be killed without his consent. Amba angrily haunted the Earth, returning in male form as Shikhandi to fight Bhishma in the great war. Because of her presence Bhishma was killed in that battle, as he resigned himself to death. Bhishma’s half brother Vichitravirya failed to produce an heir; after his death his widows Ambika and Ambalika needed someone to father their children. Bhishma learned of another half brother, V YASA , the “author” (or compiler) of the Mahabharata. Vyasa was a renunciant, but he con- sented to couple with the two women. They bore P ANDU and D HRITARASHTRA , the progenitors of the two sets of cousins whose war over the land of the Kurus is the subject of the great epic. Thus, Bhishma is related through his father to both sides in the conflict. He is called, therefore, great-uncle to them, though he is not their direct progenitor. Since Dhritarashtra was blind and Pandu died when his children were very young, Bhishma became a father figure to both the PANDAVAS and the KAURAVAS . In the great battle Bhishma became the general for the Kaurava side, the side of the usurpers. He was mortally wounded when A RJUNA stepped out from behind Shikandhi (Amba rein- carnated) to shoot him. He lingered for 58 days before dying, giving discourses to Y UDHISHTHIRA that make up the majority of the Shantiparvan section of the Mahabharata. A chapter of the Mahabharata called Bhishmaparvan recounts his role in the story.

A bija is a short mantra, usually of one syllable, which is understood to be the vis- ible or audible form of a deity. A bija mantra ends with the letter m. Examples are Aim for S ARASVATI , Shrim for L AKSHMI , Krim for K ALI , and Gam for G ANESHA . It the tantric tradition such mantras are given to initiates only. In KUNDALINI YOGA there are bija mantras for each of the CHAKRAS ; they are recited in order to raise the kundalini, the divine serpent energy coiled at the base of the spine.

It also can denote the silent point that is the source of all sacred sound. Most YANTRAS , or ritual designs that denote par- ticular divinities, have a dot or bindu at their cen- ter. Sometimes the ritual or devotional dot on the forehead ( see FACIAL MARKINGS ) is considered to represent the bindu. In that form the bindu may be seen as the infinitely dense point of consciousness out of which the universe developed. The Sanskrit writing system uses a dot where the bindu can be taken to represent the individual soul.

Appropri- ate to the status of his family as one of the most wealthy in India the temple is dedicated to L AK - SHMI , goddess of prosperity, and Lord V ISHNU , her husband. It is called the Lakshmi Narayan Temple. The temple was opened by Mohandas Karamchand G ANDHI with the specific proviso that there would be no caste restriction in regard to entry. At that time (and even to some extent today) Dalit (untouchables) were barred from entering temples. A special characteristic of the temple is that it is explicitly (in a plaque at the front of the temple) open to people of any faith or social class; the inner carvings and statuary also pay tribute to the Buddhists, Jains ( see J AINISM ), and Sikhs ( see S IKH - ISM ), as well as to the many Hindu gods. The external surface of the temple is made to resemble Delhi’s prolific Mughal architecture (c. 1500–1800 C . E .); it is made of red sandstone deco- rated with marble. As is any temple it is decorated with many carvings showing scenes from Indian myths. The ICONS of the temple were made by specialists from B ENARES (Varanasi). There were 101 experts employed in its construction, led by a learned specialist, Vishvanath Shasti. The temple was built in Orissan style, which features high, curved turrets that show a ribbed motif at the top of the temple tower.

Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna Hahn (1831– 1891) cofounder of the Theosophical Society Better known by her initials, H.P.B., Helena Bla- vatsky was one of the most influential 19th-cen- tury writers in the fields of Theosophy and the occult. As cofounder of the Theosophical Society and frequent visitor to India, she also provoked wide popular interest in the religious traditions of India. Born in Ekaterinoslav, Russia (now Dnepro- petrovsk, Ukraine), on July 30, 1831, Blavatsky grew up in an affluent Russian family in which the occult and supernatural were not unknown. Birla Mandir, a temple devoted to Vishnu, is an example of a modern Hindu temple in Delhi, India. (Constance A.

Her mother died when Blavatsky was 12 years old and she went to live with her grandfather. At 16 she married General N. V. Blavatsky; however, claim- ing that marriage did not accommodate her “free spirit,” she left her husband and took residence in Constantinople. The trip to Turkey was the start of almost two decades of extensive travel, taking her to Egypt, England, India, and (it was claimed) Tibet. She traveled around the world twice in the decade 1851–61, continuing her investigations in the occult, mediumship, and spiritualism. She founded a spiritualist society in 1871 in Cairo, but the organization failed almost immediately as a result of some members’ assumptions that H.P.B. had produced occult phenomena fraudulently. H.P.B. arrived in New York in 1873 and quickly became familiar with American spiritual- ism. She met the Eddy brothers, mediums who conducted materialization seances. While visit- ing Vermont to demonstrate her own abilities at materialization along with the Eddy brothers, she met Henry Steel Olcott. In 1875, she and Olcott were joined by the lawyer William Q. Judge to found the Theosophical Society in New York City. She began to research and write her first book, Isis Unveiled, published in 1877. To H.P.B., Theosophy superseded spiritual- ism. Whereas spiritualism claimed contact with spirits of the ordinary dead, she contacted the masters or mahatmas, teachers of occult wisdom who resided in elevated planes. She appeared to receive messages on paper from the mahatmas, which arrived, as if from the sky or from within a specially constructed cabinet, at the Theosophical headquarters. The source of the “letters from the mahatmas ” continues to be debated—were they created by H.P.B. or delivered from the psychic realm? H.P.B. and Olcott moved to India in 1878. The following year they began publishing The The- osophist magazine. A donation of land at Adyar near Madras (Chennai) in 1882 allowed them to establish a center, which still conducts education programs and retreats for members of the Theo- sophical Society. After securing the land for the Theosophical Society, H.P.B. returned to London, where in 1884 she demonstrated her powers before the Society for Psychical Research. The viewers were impressed. However, her assistant in India, Emma Cutting Coulomb, destroyed this favorable impression by charging that H.P.B.’s abilities were fraudulent. In 1885, the society commissioned Richard Hodgson to investigate the charges. His report concluded that she was indeed an accomplished fraud. While attempting to live down the scandal, H.P.B. took up residence in Germany after 1885 and returned to London in 1887. Her major work, The Secret Doctrine, was written there and pub- lished in 1889. It remains one of the most influen- tial occult works to appear in the West. Blavatsky died in England on May 8, 1891. Her most famous disciple, Annie B ESANT , who became a convert to T HEOSOPHY after reading H.P.B.’s work, succeeded her as head of the Theosophical Society. Further reading: Blavatsky, H.

Bonder, Saniel (1950– ) contemporary American teacher Saniel Bonder, formerly a leader with A DI D A S AM - RAJ , left that community in 1992 and has since emerged as an independent spiritual teacher. Bonder was born in 1950 in New York to a Jewish family who moved to North Carolina in 1957. He was awakened to spiritual matters in the later 1960s while a student at Harvard Uni- versity. His turn toward Hinduism was influenced by Y OGANANDA ’s Autobiography of a Yogi and by an encounter in India with Ramana M AHARSHI . In 1973 he learned of Da Free John (who is now known as Adi Da Samraj), and he joined the small community around him. He became a student of the ADVAITA V EDANTA philosophy that underlies that community. By the beginning of the 1990s, Bonder decided that the experiment in spirituality led by Adi Da had failed, and in 1992 he withdrew from the community. He began an intense period of self-exploration with the assistance of a psycho- logical therapist and a shaman. His experiences, including an encounter with the Goddess, led him to experience what he termed “Onlyness of Being,” what traditional Hindu teachers term SELF - REALIZATION . From that point he began to conduct workshops and to lead daily MEDITATION sessions. A small initial following has grown into a new community organized around his teaching. He discovered that the new relationships were becoming what he called alchemical catalysts for transformation. Bonder has characterized his approach to spirituality as “waking down.” He contrasts his approach to the common idea that escape from mundane existence is necessary in order to become spiritual. He suggests that the ideal is to “fall” into both one’s pure conscious nature and one’s embodied personhood at the same time. With this “fall” we realize that we already are infinite transcendental Being incarnating as human being. Bonder has described his approach as “aspirant centered.” He tries to assist seekers in realizing their divinity as a beginning point for a life of transformation. He defines self-realization as awareness and confidence in one’s basic inte- gration of both infinite and finite natures. Among those who found their way to Bonder, a number of students, including his wife, have emerged as teachers and adepts. They now assist in leading the community that operates under the name Waking Down in Mutuality. Activities are carried out across the United States. Headquarters are at the Ma-Tam Temple of Being in Portland, Oregon. Bonder has written several books and regularly teaches at Ken Wilber’s Integral Spiritual Center.

Brahma Brahma is a divinity who makes his appearance in the post-Vedic Indian epics (c. 700 B . C . E .–100 C . E .). He has an important role in the stories of the great gods in the epics and PURANAS . He is often listed in a trinity alongside Vishnu and Shiva, where Brahma is the creator god, Vishnu is the sustainer of the world, and Shiva is the destroyer of the world. Brahma is generally considered the creator of the universe, but there are many differ- ent accounts of this act within Indian mythology; in fact, some stories credit other divinities or enti- ties with the creation.

There are only two temples in all of India devoted solely to Brahma; one is at P USH - KARA Lake near Ajmer in Rajasthan and the other is near Idar, on the border between Rajasthan and Gujarat. Brahma is born in the lotus that emerges from Vishnu’s navel as he lies on the primordial M ILK O CEAN . In this image he is the creator god, but still quite subsidiary to V ISHNU . Iconographi- cally Brahma’s vehicle is the swan (Indian goose). Brahma’s wife is S ARASVATI , the goddess of the arts and learning. He is depicted carrying a vessel that pours water, prayer beads, and sometimes the V EDAS . Brahma is always depicted as having four heads. The story is told that he was once in the midst of extended austerities in order to gain the throne of Indra, king of the gods, when the latter sent a celestial dancing girl, Tilottama, to disturb him. Not wanting to move from his meditative position, when Tilottama appeared to his right, he produced a face on his right; when she appeared behind him, he produced a face behind his head; when she appeared at his left, he produced a face on the left, and when she appeared above him he produced a face above. When S HIVA saw this five-headed Brahma he scolded him for his lust and pinched off his head looking upward, leaving Brahma humiliated and with only four heads. He did not attain the role of king of the gods. There are a great many stories about Brahma in Indian mythology. Most commonly he is known as a boon giver who was required to grant magical powers as a reward for ascetics, whether animal, human, god, or demon. Often these beings, ascet- ics, gods, and the like would become problems for the gods when they became too powerful.

It refers to the ancient practice of celibacy for men, considered an indispensable aid for the most avid yogis and seekers who wish to break the bonds of SAMSARA , or worldly existence. Restraint of the senses has always been an important aspect of Indian YOGA s; complete restraint on sexuality is one of the most difficult and spiritually powerful restraints. Brahmacharya was also used to refer to the student stage of a man’s life, in the Brahmani- cal tradition of life stages or ASHRAMA s. One was expected to remain celibate during the 12 years of Vedic learning with one’s guru, from the age of 12 to the age of 24, when one was to take up the household life. These stages of life may never have been precisely practiced by most B RAHMINS , but the ideal was widely known and respected. Further readings: Klaus K.

He entered the jewelry business and earned a considerable fortune as a diamond trader. At age 60, he decided to invest more time in quiet reflection and solitude. In 1936, while in a meditative state, he felt a warm flow of energy surround him and experienced a series of profound visions that revealed truths about the nature of the soul and God, the Supreme Soul. He decided to dedicate his life to understanding the significance and application of the knowl- edge he received and to convey this understand- ing to others in service of world transformation. In October 1937 he formed a managing commit- tee of eight young women, and in February 1938 he gave all of his property and assets to a trust administered by them. Although the BKWSO is not a women’s orga- nization per se, it has been largely administered by women from its inception. The organization states that it is the need for the traditionally more feminine qualities of patience, tolerance, sacri- fice, and love that keeps women in leadership positions. The organization came into being under the name Om Mandali. At first it consisted of a hand- ful of men, women, and children living in Hyder- abad. After one year the organization moved to Karachi, Pakistan, where for 14 years, until after the partition of India and Pakistan, a group of 300 individuals lived as a self-sufficient community, spending their time in intense spiritual study and meditation. In 1950, the community moved to Mount Abu in the state of Rajasthan, India. In 1952, Brahma Baba, as Dada Lekhraj had become known, felt that outreach was necessary to share the knowl- edge and experiences of the community. A few sisters left Mount A BU and moved to Bombay (Mumbai) and Delhi to serve by establishing study centers where the knowledge of Raja Yoga would be taught. The Madhuban community at Mount Abu remains the nucleus of the Brahma Kumaris centers worldwide and is a pilgrimage place for study and retreat. In 1969, Dadi Prakashmani, one of the original eight trustees, was appointed chief administrative head of the Brahma Kumaris. Under her leader- ship the organization has experienced tremendous growth, expanding beyond India for the first time. It now includes 3,200 centers with over 450,000 students in 70 countries. Since 1974, Dadi Janaki has served as coordinator for all Brahma Kumaris activities outside India.

It derives from the root brih, which means to “swell” or “grow,” and evidently first referred to the swell- ing or growing power of the sacrifice and its MAN - TRAS that expand out and create efficacy. The most common early meaning of brahman was simply “prayer.” It is from this term that the word B RAHMIN , “one who prays,” or “priest,” is derived. Certain Vedic text collections are called B RAHMANAS ; they are said to contain the secret of prayer. Eventually, the term brahman was developed in the Upanishads to mean “the All” or “Ultimate Reality.” An understanding developed that the individual self, or AT M A N , was identical to the brahman. These understandings developed in later V EDANTA into both theistic views, in which the brahman was tantamount to a god or goddess, and nontheistic views, in which the brahman was seen as an uncharacterized reality that constituted or underlay everything. Often brahman is spelled as brahma, in part depending on grammatical context. Both forms are commonly used in transliterating Sanskrit. In the latter spelling the word must be carefully dis- tinguished from B RAHMA , the creator god, whose name is pronounced with a long final a.

Sundara Ramaiah, Brahman: A Comparative Study of the Philosophies of Sankara and Ramanuja (Waltair: Andhra University 1974). Brahmana Brahmanas are texts that delineate the work- ings of the BRAHMAN in its oldest sense of the power, efficacy, or energy of Vedic ritual. They are considered SHRUTI or revelation and are part of the V EDAS . They accompany the MANTRA text of the four Vedas and are memorized along with them; the Brahmana of the Black Y AJUR V EDA is interspersed with the mantras; the other three are stand alone texts. All the Brahmanas are written in prose. The Brahmanas are designed to guide and explain the ritual sacrifice ( YA J N A ). Much Vedic mythology is found in the Brahmanas, explain- ing how particular rituals relate to the actions of particular divinities. For example, the S HATA - PATHA B RAHMANA explains that goat hair is to be mixed with other ingredients for a ritual fire (A GNI ), because the gods once collected Agni from among cattle. Brahmanas abound in much obscure, esoteric material that is not easy for the outsider to grasp, but that assure the effi- cacy and intelligibility of the Vedic ritual for practitioners.

The term is derived from the Vedic word BRAHMAN , which means (among other things) “prayer.” In Sanskrit the same Vedic word desig- nates prayer and the one who prays, the overseer of the Vedic ritual and its MANTRAS . In the ancient VARNA or class system the Brahmin was said to emerge from the mouth of the divine being, the warrior from his arms, the ordinary people from his thighs, and the servants from his feet. Originally, Brahminical status was ensured by Vedic authority. Brahmins were responsible for the transmission of the V EDAS over the centuries via oral tradition within Brahminical families. This assured Brahminical authority over all ritual, since it was only through knowledge of the Vedas that the rituals could be performed. All public rituals had to be supervised by Brahmins and all private rituals could be learned only from Brahmins. As the Brahminical tradition was challenged over the centuries to include more and more indigenous forms of religion, and the culture began to move away from exclusive reliance on Vedic ritual, Brahmins began to emphasize “purity” as a new justification for their superior status. This entailed special norms of conduct including very strict vegetarianism. However, they always maintained their dominant role in the transmission of knowledge and, thereby, in realms of social authority. Such knowledge extended far beyond the Vedas themselves. If there is a stereo- typical or ideal role for a Brahmin in the modern world it is teaching. Transmission of knowledge is the traditional role of the Brahmin and remains so today. Brahmins continue to perform the rituals at all the great temples in India, but the role of ritual- ist is now viewed as less important for Brahmins than the role of teacher or preceptor.

Roy was a central fig- ure in the “Indian Renaissance” and the “Bengali Renaissance,” which introduced an emphasis on rationality, women’s rights, and the uplift of lower castes. The society aimed to reform Hinduism by banishing caste, idolatry, and other features it con- sidered debased in favor of reinstituting what it considered were the traditional elements of truth, spirituality, and the unity of religion. Influenced by Christian missionaries and Western ideas that entered India during British colonialism, the soci- ety was firmly theistic, appealing to the worship of one God, omniscient and omnipotent. Distinctly Hindu, the society believes that all truth is from God and that the prophets of all religions are to be respected. Raja Rammohun Roy, Devendranath Tagore (1817–1905), and Keshub Chunder Sen (1838–84) were influential in creating the creed and practice of the society. After Roy’s death the society declined, but it was revived by Devendranath Tagore, father of the famous Indian poet Rabindranath T AGORE . Tagore was opposed to Christian missions, but he did not accept the infallibility of the Hindu scriptures. Under Tagore, the society became an active Hindu missionary organization, attracting educated Hindus in a number of cosmopolitan centers in Bengal and other states. Under Sen, the society became more universal in outlook by drawing on world scrip- tures. While Sen was leader a number of schisms emerged; as a result, the Brahmo Samaj movement began to include several different organizations. Today the movement continues to uphold the Brahmo teachings of faith in a personal God, congregational worship, and condemnation of idol worship and widow burning. The society operates the Brahmo Balika Shikshalaya, a school for girls in Calcutta (Kolkata), which has stressed the emancipation of women since its founding in 1890. The school began a Montessori Section in 1930, the first Montessori school in India. The society sponsors the Raja Rammohun Roy Memo- rial Museum in Calcutta. Although very small today, the society provided a rational critique of traditional ritualistic observances that became part of the secularized democratic culture in Indian society. The society retains its affiliation with Unitarianism in Western countries. See also U NITED K INGDOM ; U NITED S TATES .

The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is a classical U PA - NISHAD connected to the White Y AJUR V EDA . It is probably the oldest of the classical Upanishads and retains much material on ancient Vedic ritual, which the later classical Upanishads ignore. The work opens with a meditation on the ashva medha, or HORSE SACRIFICE , seeing the horse itself as universal reality in all its particulars. This is a feature that is well established in the earlier B RAHMANA literature, which focused on the deeper meaning of ritual. The Upanishad contains a cosmogony of the Ultimate Self or AT M A N as it differentiates into worldly reality. It also preserves several ancient dialogues about the nature of the universe, the atman, and the BRAHMAN . Particularly, it contains the disquisitions or answers of the famous sage Y AJNAVALKYA to these questions. In the course of this Upanishad, the doctrine of the two forms of brahman, the formed and the formless, is outlined (Bri. 2.3. 1–6). This doctrine is repeated in later Upanishads and is a central issue in the thought of later V EDANTA .

(The fourth level appears to be a later development: turiya, the transcendent state of consciousness.) The work also outlines (Bri. 4.4. 3–6) the first extended dis- course on REINCARNATION and KARMA , as well as the karmic paths of the Sun and Moon: liberation is the path via the Sun and reincarnation is the path via the Moon (Bri. 6.2. 16).

The round stone crown on top of its soaring tower is estimated to weigh 20 tons; it could have been moved to its current position, 120 feet in the air, only by a construction ramp approaching from a distance. The temple is also known for its 250 carved LINGAM s. The luxuriant and elegant artistry of this temple has been praised over the centuries. It is considered among the finest pieces of premod- ern Indian architecture still standing. Further reading: R.

Brihaspati (Brahmanaspati) Brihaspati (Lord of Prayer) is the divine priest in the V EDAS who sanctifies human rites. Later he became priest of the gods, while Shukracharya became priest for the ASURAS . He is also known as Brahmanaspati, to whom several individual hymns are addressed in the R IG V EDA . In some myths Brihaspati is a RISHI , the son of the Rishi A NGIRAS . His wife is carried off by the Moon (S OMA ), but is restored to him after a war. She later bore a son, Budha (Mercury), who was claimed by both her husband and the Moon. Still later Brihaspati became identified with the planet Jupiter, which is considered to be auspicious. Iconographically, Brihaspati holds a sacrificial pitcher and a rosary whose beads are from the rudraksha plant.

Brindavan For K RISHNA worshippers, the Brindavan region in Uttar Pradesh has for centuries been one of the main pilgrimage sites, a center for various cultic developments, and the focus of much Vaishnavite devotion. No prayer or song to Krishna will fail to mention it. Although born in Mathura, Krishna spent his childhood and young life in the beautiful environs of Brindavan. There he encountered demons of various sorts and defeated them while just a child. There he became the butter thief who stole from all the families in his neighborhood. And it was there that he dallied with the cowherd maidens, the GOPIS , choosing for his favorite R ADHA . In Brin- davan a pilgrim can visit, walking barefoot, all the places of Krishna’s young life, and sense firsthand his divine presence. C HAITANYA ’s followers moved from Bengal to Brindavan to develop their philosophy and path. The region also hosts a center for followers of V ALLABHA . Further reading: Cornelia Dimmitt and J. A.

Brunton, Paul (1898–1981) British philosopher and spiritual teacher Paul Brunton was a spiritual writer and philoso- pher. His self-appointed task was to interpret what he learned in the East to Western audiences. He became a major figure in the spread of Eastern teachings in the West. Brunton was born Raphael Hurst on Novem- ber 27, 1898, in London. (When he first became prominent as Brunton, he never explained why or when he had changed his name.) His mother died when he was young; his father remarried, and when he too died Brunton took care of his widow. At age 16 he had a mystical experience, and by 1923 he was a member of a small bohemian group who were interested in spiritual matters. Recog- nizing that he had occult and clairvoyant powers, he joined the Spiritualist Society of Great Britain. He married Karen Augusta Tottrup and a son was born in 1923. Barely three years later, Brunton and his wife divorced and she married another member of their circle who became a leader in the Anthroposophical Society, another esoteric orga- nization with roots in T HEOSOPHY . In 1930, Brunton traveled to India, where he met yogis and sages. His popular account, A Search in Secret India, introduced significant Indian teachers of the time, particularly M EHER B ABA and R AMANA M AHARSHI , to a Western audi- ence. His writings indicate that he practiced Ramana’s technique of meditating on the question “Who am I?” and gained some degree of peace of mind and inner illumination from this discipline. From 1934 to 1945, Brunton traveled even more extensively throughout the East and wrote six books about his experiences and his growing commitment to create a complete spiritual teach- ing for the modern world. Most of his writings Brunton, Paul 95 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 95 12/14/06 9:28:27 AM"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"were in the form of organized notes and apho- risms on a host of subjects, comprising more than 7,000 pages withheld for posthumous publica- tion. In his own words, these notes constituted an evolving new East-West philosophy that emerged to meet modern conditions. Brunton became a spiritual teacher and had followers who studied his ideas as well as his prophecies about world affairs. During the last 20 years of his life, Brunton lived in Vevey, Switzerland, where he received students and inquirers. He died there of a massive cerebral hemorrhage on July 28, 1981. In 1986, the Paul Brunton Philosophic Foun- dation (PBPF) was founded in Hector, New York, as a resource for those seeking spiritual under- standing. The foundation, under the leadership of Brunton’s son, Kenneth Thurston Hurst, com- pleted publication of the 16-volume compendium of his notebooks; instituted a program for donat- ing books to libraries, prisons, and world leaders; and initiated a circulating library of published and unpublished writings by Brunton.

E .) founder of Buddhism The Buddha (the Awakened One) is revered among contemporary Hindus, who usually con- sider Buddhism to be another form of Hinduism. The flag of India even shows the Dharma Chakra or “wheel of the law,” which is a Buddhist symbol. The places where the Buddha was born (Lumbini in N EPAL ), preached his first sermon (Sarnath near B ENARES [Varanasi]), where he died (Vaishali), and where he reached enlightenment (Bodhgaya) are still visited as holy places by Hindus. Addition- ally, many old sites in India that preserve Buddhist sculpture and painting, such as Barhut, A JANTA , and E LLORA , are preserved by India and are very popular tourist places. The story of the Buddha’s life is well known to Hindus. The prince Gautama was shielded as a child and young man from witnessing any sor- row: disease, old age, and death. The one time he managed to elude the protection of his family and went out to see the world, he was shocked by what he saw. With the permission of his wife, he left her and their son and ventured off as a renunciant. He tried many different paths includ- ing severe asceticism, which withered his body and nearly killed him. Eventually, he decided that neither severe asceticism nor a worldly life of indulgence was the true path, and he formulated his famous “Middle-Way.” Finally, under the sacred Bodhi tree in Bodh- gaya, Gautama reached his enlightenment; he spent the rest of his life as an awakened teacher wishing to lead the ignorant out of the bonds of karma into a release from birth and rebirth. Though recent and contemporary India looks upon the Buddha as an A VATA R and a holy being, in past eras Indian tradition witnessed great conflict between Buddhism and the Brahminical tradi- tion. Hindu saints of South India, both Shaivite and Vaishnavite, reviled the Buddhist monks and accused them of following a false path. The great B HAGAVATA P URANA , which depicts the 10 incarna- tions of V ISHNU , shows Buddha as the ninth, but in this account he has gone to Earth to preach a creed designed to mislead the ASURAS , or antigods, and not to save humanity.

Robinson, The Buddhist Religion (Belmont, Calif.: Wadsworth, 1986). buddhi Buddhi is a technical term in the S AMKHYA Y OGA system that refers to discriminative intellect. Ulti- mately, one seeks to calm the mind so that the discriminative intellect or buddhi will be able to discern the clear division between the self or soul and the whirling world of phenomena. This dis- cernment is a crucial step in the liberation of the self from the cycle of birth and rebirth. The buddhi is considered to have the greatest predominance of sattva (purity) of anything in existence. Ulti- mately, however, liberation can occur only when buddhi, too, is transcended (in consciousness), as it too is part of the world of phenomena and, in its own way, a hindrance to the highest spiritual realization.

Most were poor lower-caste workers from the states of Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Western Bihar who were hired as indentured laborers to work on the British and Dutch sugar plantations. After their contracts of indenture ended, most of these workers remained. The British and the Dutch treated their workers dif- ferently. The Dutch tended to keep a hands-off policy toward their Hindu workers, with the result that Hindus in Suriname tended to main- tain Hindi as their primary language. The British attempted to convert Hindus to Christianity and to change their culture. The result is that Hindus in Trinidad, Tobago, and Guyana speak primarily English rather than Hindi. In Trinidad a form of language known as Plantation Hindi developed, as expressed in oral histories. Missionaries from the A RYA S AMAJ countered the Christian mis- sionaries in the 1940s. In Suriname a small num- ber of immigrants from Java in I NDONESIA , also introduced as indentured servants, converted to Hinduism. Today, approximately 27 percent of the population of Suriname, 34 percent of Guyana, and 24 percent of Trinidad and Tobago are Hin- dus. Smaller populations of Hindus live on the islands of Jamaica, Grenada, St. Lucia, Martinique, and Guadalupe. All are descendants of indentured servants and have faced evangelization by Chris- tian missionaries. Hinduism in the Caribbean is primarily Vaish- navite and centers around devotion to the monkey warrior H ANUMAN . Other deities such as S HIVA , D URGA , K ALI , and G ANESHA are also recognized. The primary sacred texts recognized by the laity are not the V EDAS or the U PANISHADS , but the R AMAYANA and the B HAGAVAD G ITA . Most homes have a small shrine or prayer house that serves as a site for offerings, devotion, chanting of BHAJANS , and meditation. Because of the schedule of plantation work, the Hindu communities have adopted Sundays as the weekly time for PUJA . Once a year the communities gather for the Ramayana Yajna and D IVALI . Arranged marriages have become the norm among some communities and serve to join Hindus around tra- ditional culture. Apart from recognition of B RAHMIN families and endogamy norms, caste observance has largely disappeared from the region. See also A FRICA ; D IASPORA .

Steven Vertovec, The Hindu Diaspora: Comparative Patterns (London: Routledge, 2000). caste The Indian term jati (birth) is usually translated as “caste,” which is a Portuguese word. It refers to the community into which one is born. In V EDIC tradition the concept of VARNA stratified society into four groups: B RAHMIN (priests), K SHATRIYA (warriors), V AISHYA (common people, including merchants), and S HUDRA (servant classes). The simple stratification of the Vedic tradition became the template for a much wider formal social strati- fication within Indian society. In addition to the four classes of the earlier scheme, a fifth class of people known as untouch- ables (now referred to as Dalits) emerged, possibly when certain non-Aryan tribes began to be inte- grated into the larger A RYAN cultural framework. “U NTOUCHABILITY ” involved cultural concepts of POLLUTION ; “purer” classes and castes avoided eat- ing food with certain other classes or taking food that had been touched by certain other classes. At its most extreme, this required that the lowest castes not touch or have physical contact with upper castes at all. The lowest strata often per- formed work that put them in contact with dead animals, leather, and excrement, all of which were considered polluting. The loose array of four classes (somewhat confused in the south of India, where the British incorrectly classified many agriculturists as Shu- dras) sprouted additional castes that amounted to guilds that protected certain occupations from encroachment by other groups. An intricate array of occupationally defined castes and sub- castes emerged. Marriage between castes is very restricted; even low-status castes jealously guard against intermarriage with groups that are lower in the hierarchy. Brahmins are considered the purest in the hierarchy, by virtue of their cultivation of the ancient tradition of the Vedas and their strict veg- etarianism. They may give food to any group, but they will only accept food from or eat food with other Brahmins. Certain Brahmins who are con- sidered purer than others will not associate with or marry those other Brahmins. Caste ranking has never been and is not now eternally fixed; however, it usually takes more than a generation for a given caste to move up or down the hierarchy. The primary means of advancement is to restrict meat-eating. Vegetari- anism is a highly valued sign of purity, and avoid- ing all meat has aided more than one caste in gaining higher status, if the practice is sustained and universal. Second in importance is avoidance of marriage and association with groups that are low on the caste scale. Third, members must find different forms of employment that do not involve polluting substances. Slipping in any of these areas might cause a caste to lose status. The Indian Constitution, which was written by the untouchable B. R. Ambedkar, outlaws caste. The national and state governments have instituted strict affirmative action in the makeup of parliaments (untouchables and disadvantaged tribals are assured a percentage of seats) and in government hiring. Many great strides have been made in modern India to abolish the evil of caste, but it is an ancient and deeply rooted system that may take generations to abolish, just as it took two centuries to dismantle discriminatory racial laws in the United States.

The river is used as a symbol of Tamil literature and culture ( see V AISHNAVISM ). There are various legends about the river’s ori- gin. One story says that there was once a sage Kav- era who performed austerities in the mountains near the source of the current river to propitiate B RAHMA . Brahma gave him the daughter Lopamu- dra, who manifested herself as the river Cauvery. Later, the sage A GASTYA married Lopamudra and placed the great river in a water pot. As chance would have it, one day a crow tipped over the pot and the Cauvery flowed out. Further reading: G.

Chaitanya, Sri Krishna (1486–1533) Vaishnavite saint Sri Chaitanya was born in Mayapur in what is now West Bengal to a learned teacher of the tradition. The written accounts of this great saint portray him as a miraculous child who had adventures and misadventures while still an infant that resemble those found in the stories of K RISHNA , of whom Sri Chaitanya was considered an incarnation. As were many of the other great teachers of Indian tradition, Sri Chaitanya was a master of S ANSKRIT . When he was only 16 he already knew as much as professors at Sanskrit schools. That same year his wife died of snake bite; he was then married to a daughter of a wealthy and respected teacher, a sign that his social standing was already on the rise. On a trip to Gaya to perform rituals for his ancestors he visited a Vishnu shrine and there fell into a trance. He was caught before he fell by a noted ascetic, Ishvara Puri, a practitioner of devotional V AISHNAVISM . When Chaitanya came to his senses he asked Puri to help him under- stand R ADHA ’s love for Krishna. The stories of Radha’s love affair with Lord Krishna were the backdrop for the intense Vaish- navite devotion that Chaitanya was to experience. Radha’s passionate, uncontrollable love for her lover Lord Krishna was the model for this devo- tional path. Receiving the Krishna MANTRA from Puri, Chaitanya went into a prolonged and ago- nizing state of mystical longing; at times he was ecstatic at realizing the presence of Lord Krishna everywhere; at times he felt deep sorrow from los- ing this sense of passionate contact. At this point Sri Chaitanya ceased being a pandit or teacher, overwhelmed as he was with intense moods of frenzy and mystic passion—the passion of God-love. It was not long before he was recognized as an incarnation of Krishna. He began to attract followers with whom he would spend his days singing praises of the Lord, dancing and falling into trances. It is said that his passion- ate religiosity was so strong that he converted a Muslim ruler of Bengal who had previously been known to persecute Hindus as infidels. At times Sri Chaitanya felt himself to be the embodiment of Krishna; at other times he embod- ied the essence of Radha. He was an exemplar of the most emotional type of devotion, wherein the devotee loses sense of himself or herself in the thrall of the mystic vision. This devotional atti- tude is precisely the one that S RI B HAKTIVEDANTA P RABHUPADA , the founder of the Hare Krishna movement in America, took to the shores of the West to develop and spread. Sri Prabhupada is in the direct lineage of Sri Chaitanya. Further reading: S. N. Dasgupta, A History of Indian Philosophy. Vol. 4 (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1975); Edward C.

These centers do not reside in the gross body, at the physical level, but in what is termed the “subtle body.” Though they have a physical position, they have no definite physical adjuncts or precise nervous system connections as in the case of the Chinese system of meridians in acupuncture. They are instead believed to be connected to a network of channels in the subtle body called NADIS . The chakras are usually visualized as being lotus flowers with differing numbers of petals. Each of the chakras is a center of consciousness of sorts, playing a role in the makeup of the full human being (including his or her transcendent aspect). There are six basic chakras found in almost every kundalini system with a seventh “highest chakra” that technically is beyond the chakras, but is often called “chakras” nonetheless. The names of these chakras vary in different systems. The most common system lists the following chakras, moving from the base of the spine to a place above the head: MULADHARA , SVADHISHTHANA , MANIPURA , ANAHATA , VISHUDDHA , AJNA . In this system the seventh level is usually called SAHASRARA , the transcendent level, which is not in most systems actually a chakra, but for convenience is some- times designated as such. Some accounts include an additional chakra, the LALATA or soma chakra, between ajna and sahas- rara. In kundalini yoga one raises the kundalini, which is seen to be a coiled serpent, through breath control and/or MEDITATIONS so that it pierces in succession each of the chakras, giving the adapt control or mastery over them. This movement results in complete personal transformation and, ultimately, access to the transcendent state.

Chamunda Chamunda is a fearsome goddess who accepts human sacrifices and blood offerings. She is now usually assimilated to K ALI , and Chamunda is an epithet for Kali. The first known historical mention of Chamunda is in the Sanskrit poet B HAVABHUTI ’s drama Malatimadhava (eighth cen- tury C . E .), in which the heroine Malati is captured by a female devotee of Chamunda to be sacrificed to that goddess. Chamunda’s temple is depicted as near a cremation ground. That story has the god- dess dancing so wildly that the world shakes; she has a gaping mouth and a garland of skulls and is covered with snakes; flames shoot from her eyes that could destroy the world, and she is encircled by goblins. Another, South Indian description of Cha- munda has her holding a skull-head mace, a snake, and a wine cup. She has a third eye, a jackal chews on a corpse below her, and her eyes show she has been drinking liquor. Another image of Chamunda, at Jaipur in Orissa, depicts her as emaciated; she holds a chopper and a pronged weapon, a skull begging bowl, and a severed head in her hands. Chamunda is sometimes listed among the matrikas or “Mother Goddesses.” The Markandeya PURANA has Chamunda emerge from the forehead of Amba or D URGA to kill two fierce demons, Chanda and Munda, and her name is explained by combining the names of these two demons.

Chandogya Upanishad The classical Chandogya Upanishad is part of the Chandogya Brahmana, which is attached to the S AMA V EDA . It is one of the oldest U PA - NISHADS . It retains much of the character of the B RAHMANA from which it comes, in that it is largely devoted to delineating the deeper mean- ing and significance of the elements of the Vedic sacrifice or YA J N A (see V EDAS ) . Much of the Chandogya Upanishad is devoted to the true meaning of the Udigitha, the loud chant of the Sama Vedic priest at the sacrificial ritual. The Udgitha is said to be tantamount to OM (Ch. 1.1.1–10) and is identified with the breath (Ch. 1.2.1–14). The esoteric meaning of each of the syllables in the word Udgitha is explicated (Ch. 1.3.1–12). The Udgitha is also identified with the Sun, with space as the ultimate, and with divinities. The Chandoga Upanishad goes on to coordi- nate the sounds of the fuller Sama Vedic chant with cosmic and human entities. Through this process, the elements of the Sama Vedic chant are shown to encompass a wide range of human, worldly, and cosmic entities; it is much more important than a simple musical recitation. Chapter three raises the familiar Upanishadic theme of the identity of AT M A N (the individual self) and the BRAHMAN (the Ultimate Reality). The fifth chapter gives the famous teaching of Uddal- aka Aruni to his son, Shvetaketu; in defining the Ultimate Reality of the brahman he tells his son, “You are THAT” ( TAT TVAM ASI ). This is one of the most well known M AHAVAKYAS or “Great Sayings” quoted in the V EDANTA . Chapters seven and eight relate the nature of the atman or individual self and show that it resides within the human heart. They tell the famous tale in which I NDRA , king of the gods, at last learns the nature of the brahman /atman identity. Further reading: S. N.

Charles, Master (1945– ) founder of Synchronicity Foundation Master Charles is a popular American meditation teacher, who combines the teachings of Swami M UKTANANDA (1908–82) with the insights provided by contemporary psychology and parapsychology. Master Charles Cannon was born on March 14, 1945, in Syracuse, New York, to Italian Ameri- can parents and raised as a Roman Catholic. At one point he seriously considered joining a Cath- olic religious order, but in his later teen years he backed away from the church. He practiced Zen Buddhism for a period and explored parapsychol- ogy. Then in 1970, some friends who had recently returned from India showed him a photograph of Swami Muktananda. Seeing the picture had an immediate and intense effect upon him. In the midst of the altered consciousness into which he had moved, he had a vision of God as Mother (a relic of his earlier devotion to the Virgin Mary), and she instructed him to go to Muktananda. He obtained a copy of the first of Muktananda’s books, Guru, which had just been published in the West, and soon afterward left for India. Cannon settled in at Muktananda’s ashram in Maharashtra (about 75 miles from Mumbai). He remained in India with his guru for 12 years and for a period he served as Muktananda’s pri- vate secretary. Halfway through his stay, he took vows of renunciation ( SANNYAS ). Shortly before his death, Muktananda instructed him to return to the United States. His experience with Muk- tananda culminated in his reaching a state of pure consciousness, which Master Charles described in mystical language. Back in America, he withdrew from the Sid- dha Yoga Dham, the organization that perpetuated Muktananda’s work, and settled in rural Virginia. He also dropped the garb of an Indian monk, began wearing Western clothing, and began to call himself Brother Charles. A small commu- nity gradually gathered around him. In 1983, he founded Synchronicity Foundation to facilitate his work and built a sanctuary to hold various meetings and classes. As his leadership manifested he assumed the name Master Charles. Unique to Master Charles’s teaching activity has been his mastery of contemporary data, gen- erated by transpersonal psychology and parapsy- chology, concerning MEDITATION and altered states of consciousness. He integrated this information into the meditation he learned from Muktananda to create what he termed the Synchronicity High- Tech Meditation Experience. Master Charles continues to teach and develop his scientific form of meditation from the head- quarters of the Synchronicity Foundation in Nel- lyford, Virginia. He publishes compact discs of meditative music that use binaural-beat technol- ogy to induce meditative states.

It dates from approximately 400 B . C . E . The Char- vaka motto can be approximately translated as “Eat, drink, and be merry.” In addition to being pure materialists, the Charvakas were strict empiricists who believed that the only valid source of knowledge is direct perception; they believed only what could be seen by the eyes directly. They rejected even inference as a method of investigation. Though none of their texts were preserved, the Charvaka viewpoint was condemned in many philosophical contexts over two millennia. The R AMAYANA and M AHABHARATA both contained argu- ments against it. Nearly every subsequent Indian philosophical system, including that of the Bud- dhists and Jains, formulated arguments to answer them. Modern Marxists in India have sought to make this ancient system better known. Further reading: Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya and Mri- nal K.

In 1949 he received his Ph.D. from the University of Calcutta for a dissertation on Sri Aurobindo’s philosophy, “Integral Idealism.” Dr. Chaudhuri then became a professor and chair of the department of philosophy at Krishnagar Col- lege in Krishnagar. In March 1951, Dr. Chaudhuri immigrated to the United States upon the direct recommendation of Sri A UROBINDO , who had received a request from Dr. Frederick Spiegelberg of Stanford University to nominate someone for a position in the Ameri- can Academy of Asian Studies in San Francisco, which was just opening.

In 1968 Dr. Chaudhuri founded the California Institute of Asian Studies in San Francisco (which in 1981 became the California Institute of Inte- gral Studies). This graduate school is devoted to the promotion of cultural understanding between East and West, offering masters’ and doctoral degrees in philosophy, psychology, Asian stud- ies, and interdisciplinary studies. Dr. Chaudhuri started an accreditation process for the school that reached its fruition in 1981, six years after his untimely death of a heart attack there in June 1975. Dr. Chaudhuri wrote numerous books in English. Among them are Modern Man’s Religion (1966), Philosophy of Integralism (1954), The Rhythm of the Truth (1958), Shri Aurobindo: Prophet of the Life Divine (1959), and Integral Yoga: The Concept of Harmonious and Creative Living (1965). He wrote two lesser known books in Bengali: Ma (1944) and Sri Auboinder Sadhana (1949). Dr. Haridas Chaudhuri had a strong impact on philosophical and religious studies and affairs in the San Francisco Bay area and beyond. He was host to Swami M UKTANANDA at the Cultural Integration Fellowship on one of the Swami’s first trips to the United States. He also played host there to the American spiritual figures Alan Watts, Ram Dass, and Sant Keshavadas. He hosted and provided venues for such famous musicians as Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan in their early years of touring of the United States. Among his students and those he strongly influ- enced can be counted Michael Murphy, cofounder of Esalen Institute, and Michael Toms, founder of New Dimensions radio, both in California. Dr. Chaudhuri also kept up an active correspondence with his Asian friend U Thant, secretary-general of the United Nations in the 1960s.

Chetanananda, Swami (1949– ) teacher of Kashmir Shaivism and Trika Yoga Swami Chetanananda is an American teacher in the tradition of Swami R UDRANANDA . At his two institutes, he propounds a S HAIVISM that generally downplays asceticism and withdrawal from life and draws on Tibetan and Kashmiri practice. J. Michael Shoemaker was born in Kentucky the son of a pharmacist and a nurse, both devout Catholics, and he was raised in the Catholic faith. He attended school in Connersville, Indi- ana, where he was a football player and swim- mer. He attended but dropped out of Indiana University. Shoemaker studied with Swami Rudrananda and lived in his ashram in Big Indian, New York, until 1973, the year of Rudrananda’s death. In 1971 he founded the Nityananda Institute upon instructions from Rudrananda in Bloom- ington, Indiana, to foster Shaivite teachings. After Rudrananda’s death, he traveled to India and was initiated into SANNYAS (renunciation) by Swami M UKTANANDA in Ganeshpuri, India, in 1978 and given the name Chetanananda (the bliss of pure awareness). He was also initiated into the ancient Tibetan Buddhist ritual practices of Phowa and Chod, and others from the Longchen Nyingthing and Padampa Sangye Shi-je tradition. After Rudrananda’s sudden death, Chetanan- anda read the Shiva Sutras, a text in the Trika school of Kashmir Shaivism; he discerned a close connection with the teachings of Rudrananda.

In 1983, he embraced the ancient K ASHMIRI S HAIVITE practice of Trika Yoga, the philosophical framework for the practice of Kundalini Y OGA . According to Rudrananda, Trika Yoga denies that renunciation is the superior path to spiritual development, but instead embraces all ethnic lifestyles as avenues to realization. Trika Yoga emphasizes a commit- ment to positive participation in life as a means for developing spiritual discernment. Swami Chetanananda, as an advocate of Trika Yoga, teaches MEDITATION and the philosophy and tantric practices of Kashmiri Shaivism. He over- sees a translation program for both S ANSKRIT and Tibetan spiritual texts and has expertise in Indian, Tibetan, and Indonesian art, history, and archae- ology. He has studied ASANA (postures in HATHA YOGA ) practice, cranial osteopathy, homeopathy, and acupuncture. He is the author of several books on spiritual practice, published by Rudra Press. Although he received initiation into SANNYAS (renunciation), he does not give sannyas initiation to others. Chetanananda serves as abbot of Nityananda Institute and Rudrananda Ashram, both of which are now located in Portland, Oregon. He is spiri- tual teacher, mentor, and guide to students. The institute emphasizes the role of the teacher in promoting spiritual growth and the importance of being engaged with a specified lineage within which the teacher was trained. The Nityananda Institute, under the imprint of Rudra Press, pub- lishes books on Kashmir Shaivism, Trika Yoga, and hatha yoga. The institute also includes the Abhinavagupta Institute, which offers scholarly translations of Kashmiri Shaivite texts.

Chidambaram Chidambaram in the South Arcot District of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu has been an impor- tant pilgrimage center for those devoted to S HIVA since about the ninth century, when the site was known as Tillai. Tradition says that a Kashmiri king who was afflicted with an incurable disease bathed in the temple tank 1,500 years ago and was cured. He is said to have enlarged the temple in appreciation. Chidambaram is known for its phal- lic-shaped LINGAMS of light ( jyotirlingas ), which are set in bases of the vulvic goddess; they are a primary iconic symbol of Shiva. Chidambaram is best known as the center of the cult of Shiva as the divine dancer or N ATARAJA . It is said that one of the Chola kings (ninth to 13th centuries), Vira Chola, saw a vision of Shiva performing his cosmic dance near the shrine. He then built the Golden Shrine with Shiva Nataraja in it. In another section of the temple are the 108 dance postures found in Bharata’s N AT YA S HASTRA , sculpted in high relief in honor of Shiva the cos- mic dancer. Shiva himself is said to have once danced in the hall there. The Goddess K ALI was the first inhabitant of Chidambaram, but Kali and Shiva entered into a dance contest, whose loser was to leave town. Shiva then defeated the Goddess by doing a dance pose with his leg straight up in the air. Kali, out of modesty, it is said, could not duplicate the feat and left. Her shrine is found in a temple on the borders of the town. Later South Indian kings expanded the Chidambaram temple, which now is a sprawl- ing complex with shrines to many other deities besides Shiva. The great Tamil Shaivite saints A PPAR and S UNDARAR sang of the shrine, and S EK - KILAR , the great compiler of the compendium of the works of the Tamil Shaivite saints, the P ERIYA P URANAM , used to recite there; notables and even kings traveled to hear him.

Chidvilasananda, Swami (Gurumayi) (1955– ) Shaivite teacher and head of Siddha Yoga Dham Swami Chidvilasananda is a prominent interna- tional teacher, writer, and SIDDHA YOGA master. She was chosen by Swami M UKTANANDA to be succes- sor to his lineage. Chidvilasananda was born on June 24, 1955, in a village in Karnataka state, India. Follow- ing the Indian custom, the family GURU , Swami Muktananda, gave her her name—Malti. She met the swami for the first time at age five when she visited his ASHRAM with her parents. That same year Muktananda had a senior disciple take the young child several times to the nearby village of Ganeshpuri for the blessing of his own guru, Bhagawan N ITYANANDA , who at that point had only a few months left to live. From then on Malti was educated under the guidance of her guru. She lived with her family in Bombay (Mumbai) and spent weekends and school holidays in Muktananda’s ashram, chant- ing scriptural texts, following the disciplines of yoga, and attending to her guru. Even at a young age, Malti possessed a longing to know God, which fueled an intense focus on spiritual prac- tice. When she was 13, Swami Muktananda gave Malti SHAKTIPAT DIKSHA , the spiritual initiation that awakens KUNDALINI energy. Beginning in 1969, Malti traveled extensively with Swami Muktananda in India and the West. In 1975, in Oakland, California, Muktananda asked her to become his translator. She was 19 at the time. Her role was to provide English translation during Muktananda’s public lectures, which were sometimes delivered to audiences that numbered in the thousands, and at his private meetings with students, dignitaries, and public officials from East and West. Through her translation, Malti learned to communicate the essence of Swami Muktananda’s teachings. She was also called on by her guru to perform a variety of other duties, including performing administrative duties with the newly formed Siddha Yoga Dham Association (SYDA) Foundation, a global nonprofit orga- nization; teaching courses; giving her own lec- tures on K ASHMIRI S HAIVISM , V EDANTA , and other philosophies fundamental to Siddha Yoga prac- tice; assisting with the translation of his books; and handling his correspondence with devotees around the globe. In April 1982, when Malti took vows of san- nyas, Muktananda gave her the name Swami Chidvilasananda, “the bliss of the play of con- sciousness.” Then he initiated and installed her Gurumayi Chidvilasananda (b. 1955), a Shaivite teacher and the head of Siddha Yoga Dham (SYDA Foundation) K 108 Chidvilasananda, Swami 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 108 12/14/06 9:28:30 AM"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"as a Siddha Yoga guru, the direct descendant in his lineage. In the months that followed, in a final act of tutelage, he sent Swami Chidvilasananda to teach, on her own, in India and America. Her personal skill as a teacher and her capacity to fulfill the spiritual demands of the guru’s lineage were thus consolidated and guaranteed. In Octo- ber 1982, Swami Muktananda died (in traditional Hindu terms, the guru “took mahasamadhi”). Since then, as head of this lineage of medi- tation masters, Gurumayi Chidvilasananda has taught Siddha Yoga meditation to students on six continents. Gurumayi’s books, filled with her teachings and poetry, have been translated into 12 languages. She has taken a special interest in making the Siddha Yoga path available to children and young people. Gurumayi’s teachings are dis- seminated by the SYDA Foundation. The philanthropic aspect of Gurumayi’s work is expressed through the PRASAD Project. Estab- lished by Gurumayi in 1992, this charitable organi- zation offers aid in seven countries, administering medical, dental, and nutrition assistance as well as community development projects. In 1997, Gurumayi founded the Muktabodha Indological Institute, an educational foundation that preserves endangered elements of India’s scriptural heritage and the oral tradition of the V EDAS . As a teacher, Gurumayi directs her students to assume responsibility for making the effort needed to succeed in their spiritual path. She emphasizes the importance of spiritual practice and the neces- sity of integrating the fruits of practice into the fabric of one’s worldly life. She imparts the Siddha Yoga teachings in a way that makes them acces- sible and directly applicable to the challenges and opportunities of modern life. Gurumayi teaches Siddha Yoga students to live in the awareness of the Self so that they can transform their world as well as themselves. And she continues to awaken spiritual energy in her students, through the vehicle of the Siddha Yoga Shaktipat Intensive, a course of study that teaches students a practice and discipline and that introduces them to the transmission of energy from Gurumayi to each of them, the profound spiritual awakening of kundalini S HAKTI (spiritual energy).

At Lucknow University he became active in campus life. In 1942 he joined the Indian inde- pendence movement, writing and distributing leaflets, organizing strikes, and giving speeches. He became quite visible in the movement and the British issued a warrant for his arrest. He went into hiding but soon after returning was caught and put in prison, where he spent several months under difficult conditions. While in prison he studied the works of major writers of contempo- rary Hindu thought and practice and was inspired to follow a path of inquiry. After working as a freelance journalist, he decided to devote himself to the quest for SELF - REALIZATION . He studied V EDANTA with Swami S IVA - NANDA at the Divine Life Society in Rishikesh for a number of years and in 1949 was initiated into SANNYAS (renunciation) by Swami Sivananda. His name, Swami Chinmayananda Saraswati, means the “one who revels in the bliss of pure conscious- ness.” At Sivananda’s suggestion, he studied with Swami Tapovan Maharaj high in the Himalayas at Uttarkashi. He accepted Swami Tapovan as his guru and studied with him for seven years. In 1948 he made a trek to several traditional Hindu pilgrimage centers in the Himalayas, recording his account in My Trek through Uttarkhand. In 1951, Chinmayananda started his mission of teaching and preaching to public audiences, a pattern that he followed until his death. He gave discourses and held meditation camps in India and abroad. In 1963 he set up his headquarters, Sandeepany Sadhanalaya, in Bombay (Mumbai). From there he established centers, ashrams, and schools in many parts of India. He organized children’s clubs to teach the principles of Hindu religion and culture. The Chinmaya Mission, which has grown considerably over the years, sponsors 62 schools for elementary education, nursing, and management in India that teach normal school curriculum as well as the Vedic heritage. The mission also sponsors free clinics, hospitals, vocational schools, orphanages, and retirement homes. Chinmayananda was foremost a S ANSKRIT pun- dit (scholar and teacher) and commentator on Hindu scriptures. He expounded each scripture verse by verse and then interpreted deeper levels of meaning against a backdrop of both Hindu and Western philosophy. He insisted that serious seek- ers find GURUS , teaching that a guru’s guidance is necessary. He also taught that over time work with an external guru changes into guidance by a more pure and enlightened intellect within the student himself. An erudite and acclaimed teacher of ADVAITA V EDANTA , Chinmayananda always stressed the importance of BHAKTI or devotion, which he defined as a consistent effort to raise the ego from its entrenchment in false values to an appreciation of selfhood. His centers contain temples and altars to several Hindu deities. Chinmayananda was elected president of the Hindu Religion Section of the Centennial Con- ference of the Parliament of World Religions in Chicago in 1993, where he was to receive recog- nition as a world-renowned teacher of Vedanta and selfless servant of humanity. Unfortunately, he died on August 3, 1993, before the conference took place.

His father, Shashi Kumar, was a super- visor for the railroad and later a banker. Both his father and his mother, Yogamaya Vishwas, died before Chinmoy was 12 years old. In 1944, the 12-year old child took residence at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry, South India, where his eldest brother, a sannyasi (renunciant), and some elder members of the family were already living. Here he practiced meditation, wrote poetry and essays, and created songs as part of his spiritual practice. He also excelled in sports. The young Chinmoy studied in Pondicherry for 20 years and often took the blessing of both Sri Aurobindo and the M OTHER . After achieving accomplishment in advanced states of meditation, he moved to New York City in 1964 at the age of 32 to share the spirituality of India with seekers in the West. He continues to travel widely, offer- ing concerts, lectures, and public meditations. He does not charge a fee for his spiritual guidance or performances. His teaching focuses on the heart’s aspiration as the creative spiritual force that lies behind all great advances in religion, culture, and science. Self-tran- scendence and living in the heart advance fulfillment and attunement to the highest reality. His message is consistent with the basic themes of Hinduism: that God is inside each person and that God at every moment is transcending his own reality. Sri Chinmoy has centers in various parts of the world where his students practice spiritual disciplines according to his inspiration and guid- ance. Each Sri Chinmoy Centre is dedicated to harmonizing the inner life of aspiration and the outer life of dedication. Chinmoy has been creative in several fields— writing and performing songs and music, creating visual art, and engaging in sports.

He was the first Jain master to leave India to preach and lecture in the West. Gurudev Sri Chi- trabhanu was born on July 26, 1922, in Rajasthan, India. After an experience of spiritual awakening at the age of 20, he became sensitive to questions of the purpose and meaning of life. His search for answers led him to the J AIN religion. For 28 years he lived the life of a monk, the first five years in silence. Through his practice, Chitrabhanu came to the realization that the purpose of life is to be liberated from attachment and desire. Leaving the monastery with this wisdom, he promoted a message of enlightenment and became known to millions across India. Chitrabhanu became an advocate of AHIMSA (nonviolence) during the same period that Mohandas Karamchand G ANDHI pursued his nonviolent struggle for Indian independence. After the upsurge of violence afflicting the West- ern world during the 1960s, Chitrabhanu made a conscious decision to spread ahimsa around the world. In 1970, he was invited to the Sec- ond Spiritual Summit Conference in Geneva. He became the first Jain master ever to travel to the West, excusing himself from the doctrine that Jains should travel only by foot. The following year he attended the Third Spiritual Summit Conference at Harvard Divinity School and lec- tured at a number of universities in the eastern United States. In 1974, he founded the Jain Meditation International Center in the Ansonia section of New York City. The center follows the fundamental principles of ahimsa, promoting the mission to create unity within the diversity of humankind. Chitrabhanu teaches that everyone must become his or her own master, believing that the approach to peace begins with oneself in everyday living. The mis- sion of one’s life is to realize this inner mastery and peace. The J AIN M EDITATION I NTERNATIONAL C ENTER includes 67 centers across North America as well as in England, Africa, Japan, and India.

Chittirai festival The Chittirai festival that takes place in Tamil Nadu state, in MADURAI and Alakar Kovil Temple and points in between, is one of the largest South Indian festivals. It takes place in the Sanskrit lunar month of Chaitra (Tamil, Chittirai), correspond- ing to April or May. It brings together the Shaivite and the Vaishnavite ( see S HAIVISM ; V AISHNAVISM ) communities of the region in a single, two-part celebration. Apparently, this larger festival is in fact a combination of two festivals that once took place a few weeks apart. The joining of the two into one festival was the work of the Telegu king of Madurai Tirumala Nayak (1623–59). The Madurai part of the celebration tells the tale of M INAKSHI , the goddess of Madurai, and her marriage to Sundreshvara (Shiva).

Here, the festival lasts 12 full days, but it is the 10th day, when the huge temple car carrying Minakshi and her husband, Shiva, is pulled by devotees on the streets that encircle the temple, that is most dramatic. This temple car is elaborate and grand with wheels about 10 feet high and a canopy over the divinities that reaches to 40 feet. Devotees vie to pull on the heavy one-foot-thick ropes to con- vey the cart on a circumambulation of the temple. This temple parade is carried out each year after Minakshi and Sundereshvara (Shiva) are married. The kings of Madurai were traditionally associ- ated with the god Shiva. The festival’s marriage of the god Shiva to Minakshi not only joins an indigenous, non-Aryan goddess to an A RYAN and Brahmani- cal divinity, but symbolizes a link in sovereignty between Shiva/king and the local population. The second part of the festival starts in the mountains 70 miles west of Madurai. There the god Alakar, a form of Vishnu, proceeds toward Madurai and the Vaikai River as part of his annual outing. As it happens, V ISHNU is the brother of Minakshi and is going to give the bride away to Shiva. Unfortunately, when he reaches the Vaikai River, in sight of the great temple of his sister, he discovers that he has arrived late at the wedding and must return. The Kallar community, relatively low-caste devotees of Vishnu, play a prominent role in this part of the festival, which lasts nine days. Further reading: D.

The Malakara Orthodox Church, head- quartered in Kerala, has provided a Christian presence within the larger world of Hindu life. This Orthodox community has generally lived a peaceful existence over the centuries, but one largely cut off from the mainstream of the Chris- tian world. The Roman Catholic nation of Portu- gal claimed portions of India in 1498, and, once a Catholic bishop was placed at the Portuguese colony of Goa, an aggressive mission program was initiated by the Jesuits. For a short time, the Orthodox realigned with the Catholics but soon saw their interests diverge and returned to an independent status.

They were joined by a few other efforts to evange- lize the country, but mission work did not begin in earnest until the early 19th century, when it won the backing of British colonial authorities. The number of conversions was modest, with occa- sional episodes of what were termed mass move- ments, when an entire community or caste would suddenly convert to Christianity. Often, these mass movements would originate among people at the lowest levels of the caste system, especially untouchables (Dalits), who had little to lose by abandoning Hinduism. ( See UNTOUCHABILITY .) During the missionary era from the 18th cen- tury onward, Protestants adopted various plans for developing a successful thrust into Indian society, including the building of modern colleges and hospitals, intellectual appeals to elites, and enticing of Dalits and various fringe groups away from lives devoid of privilege. The end result was the development of the third largest religious community in India (after Hindus and Muslims), although today the 60 million Christians repre- sent barely 6 percent of the population. Throughout the 20th century before Indian independence, Christianity enjoyed a favored relationship with the colonial government and often used that special status to engage in aggres- sive campaigns of proselytizing. Such aggressive actions created a level of hostility among Indian Hindu leaders, who developed an extended list of grievances against the church, not the least the missionaries’ use of their favorable status and relative wealth to woo converts to their reli- gion instead of teaching the merits of their faith. Moreover, Hinduism was not a missionary faith, and it saw itself at a disadvantage in the face of aggressive proselytizing. Finally, Hindu lead- ers complained of the ways that the Christian churches, often in league with colonial authori- ties, were disrupting a traditional and sacred social order. As native Indians, such as Vedanayagam Sam- uel Azariah (1874–1945), the first native Anglican bishop, gained positions of authority in Indian Christianity, they began to address some of these issues. In particular, these native Indians criticized Western missionaries for failing to distinguish between the faith they expounded and the West- ern culture from which they emerged. Because of ignorance or thoughtlessness, they complained, missionaries frequently tried to impose Western culture, provoking more opposition than they would have if they had focused exclusively on the religious message of Christianity, which was not necessarily offensive to Indians. At the same time, a new generation of more thoughtful Western Christian missionaries, who were also students of comparative religion, arrived in India; they were willing to appropriate features of Hindu piety and spirituality, and to shape a Christianity that incor- porated as many elements of Indian thought and practice as possible. By the middle of the 19th century, Christians attempted to initiate dialogue with Hindu believ- ers, especially groups of liberal believers that evolved from the Hindu Renaissance. Among the first results of these early conversations was a decision by the Unitarian Church that the B RAHMO S AMAJ , founded in 1823 by Raja Rammohun R OY (1772–1833), was actually preaching the same basic doctrines as traditional Hinduism, uncor- rupted (by sati [suttee], polygamy, and the wor- ship of idols). The Unitarians, then, withdrew from the field of proselytization and used their missionary allocations to support the Brahmo Samaj in various ways that continue to the pres- ent, including the opening of American Unitarian seminaries to train leaders of the Brahmo Samaj. Meanwhile, various Hindu leaders began to develop a range of views on the nature of Jesus Christ. Roy saw him as a moral and religious reformer, Sri R AMAKRISHNA (1836–86) saw him as an enlightened soul leading others to enlighten- ment.

Roman Catholic thinkers such as Brahmabandhav Upadhyaya (1861–1907) and currently Raimundo Panikkar (b. 1918) attempted to integrate Hindu concepts into an Indian Christian theology. In 1899, in spite of British attempts to suppress his efforts, Upadhyaya established a Catholic ashram, called Kasthalic Matha. These efforts at syncre- tism have contributed to the development of a Christian theology that includes Hindu religious categories. Such attempts have always had to answer charges from both Western Christians and Hindus that the process of articulating an Indian Christianity distorts both faiths. On a more practical level, two Frenchmen, Jules Monchanin (1895–1957) and Henri Le Saux (1910–73), the latter better known as A BHISHIK - TANANDA , tried to combine elements of Western and Eastern monastic practice. In 1950 they founded Saccidananda Ashram in Tamil Nadu, South India. The pair adapted Benedictine monasticism to the Indian ascetic tradition, which resulted in what has been termed Christian SANNYAS (renunciation). Both Protestants and Catholics have found points of connection with Hindu and Christian practice and spirituality, ranging from the monastic experi- ments of Dom Bede Griffiths (1906–93) to the philosophical and scientific contributions of Ravi Ravindra to the ashram movement founded by the Methodist E. Stanley Jones (1884–1973). In the post–World War II environment, the value of world faith communities to one another has been an increasing theme in religious writings. The World Council of Churches has emphasized interreligious dialogue, although it has taken second place to building intra-Christian relations. In like measure, in 1964, in the midst of Vatican II, the Roman Catholic Church established the Pontifical Council for Inter-Religious Dialogue. One of its major departments is designed to build new levels of understanding and respect of Hin- duism. The council supported Pope John Paul II’s (1920–2005) periodical meetings with Hindu and other religious leaders voicing his concern for interreligious dialogue in which the followers of the various religions can discover shared elements of spirituality, while acknowledging their differ- ences. As the 20th century came to a close, Pope John Paul II offered an apology for the attitudes of mistrust and hostility assumed by Catholics toward followers of other religions, as part of a broad papal acknowledgment of the failings of Christians in pursuit of their missions. Most recently, religious leaders in India have led in initiating interreligious dialogue with the founding of such organizations as the World Fel- lowship of Religions (1973) and the World Union (1958). In the D IASPORA , Hindus have been very active in many national interreligious councils and have been especially prominent in the Coun- cil for a Parliament of the World’s Religions based in Chicago, Illinois, which holds international conferences in different parts of the world every five years. Among North American organizations that attempt to encourage and focus on dialogue between Hindus and Christians is the Society for Hindu-Christian Studies, which is currently administered by scholars at Notre Dame, Indiana, and Thiruvanmiyur, Madras (Chennai), India. They also publish the Journal of Hindu-Christian Studies. As the new century begins, India has been hit with a wave of anti-Christian activity fueled by anger over the proselytizing activity of the increasing number of missionaries. Occasion- ally, this has erupted in violence. These violent incidents have only increased attempts by Hindu and Christian leaders to pursue understanding through dialogue. Further reading: B.

Cohen, Andrew (1955– ) teacher of spirituality and evolutionary enlightenment Cohen is an American spiritual teacher in the tradition of H. W. L. P OONJA . His influential pub- lications and lectures focus on the evolution of consciousness. Born in New York City on October 23, 1955, Cohen experienced a deep spiritual awakening at age 16, without the help of any spiritual path. Beginning in his early 20s, he studied and prac- ticed martial arts, KRIYA YOGA , and Buddhism. He met his guru, H. W. L. Poonja, in Lucknow, India, in 1986 and experienced a life-changing awaken- ing in his presence. Cohen’s teaching centers around trying to guide aspirants to a place in which the ego is tamed, and each individual is more passionate about the evolution of world consciousness than about his or her individual liberation. According to Cohen, the energy of enlightenment wants to express itself as a force of evolution. Each indi- vidual can and should serve as a portal for that energy to express itself. In 1986 Cohen began giving teachings in London. He then moved his headquarters to Marin County, California, and now resides in Lenox, Massachusetts. He travels the world giv- ing public talks and holding retreats. His stu- dents have formed the International Fellowship for the Realization of Impersonal Enlightenment; it has centers in Europe, Asia, and the United States and runs a retreat center in the Berk- shire mountains in western Massachusetts where Cohen lives. Cohen’s magazine What Is Enlightenment?, founded in 1992, features interviews with spiri- tual and cultural leaders of the age and addresses questions of ecology, spirituality, and psychol- ogy. Since 2000, the magazine has sponsored a speaker series with presentations by evolution- ary thinkers from around the world. Known as EnlightenNEXT since September 2005, it has become a major publication in the spiritual com- munity in the United States.

Daksha Daksha is a RISHI , best known as the father-in-law of S HIVA . He is the son of the god BRAHMA and father of Shiva’s first wife, S AT I . Daksha is best known for the events surround- ing a Vedic sacrifice that he sponsored without inviting Shiva. When Sati found out that this special sacrifice was going to take place, she con- fronted her father. He replied with verbal abuse, which resulted in her death, because of a curse that had been placed on him. When Shiva heard, he (or his creation Virabhadra) cut off Daksha’s head and destroyed the sacrificial grounds. Daksha was later restored to life, with the head of a ram. In the epic and P URANIC literature, Daksha the rishi frequently appears in different cycles of creation. He is said to have had 50 daughters, 13 of whom were married to the rishi Kashyapa. His daughter Svaha was married to A GNI , god of fire; Sati was married to Shiva; and the 27 remaining daughters were married to the god of the Moon, C HANDRA , and are identified with the lunar aster- isms, stars that are seen to be astrologically related to the Moon. As a Vedic divinity Daksha is listed as one of the A DITYAS — SONS OF A DITI —although he is some- times said to be Aditi’s father. Thus, in some Vedic literature he is considered to be the grandfather of the gods and the asuras (antigods or demons), who are all brothers in Vedic literature. ( See DEMONIC BEINGS ; V EDAS .)

Danielou, Alain (1907–1994) scholar of Hindu music and literature Alain Danielou was an accomplished musician and artist who developed an intense interest in Hindu music and literature. He won a respected status in the West for classical Indian music; he also wrote many popular books that expound Hinduism and Indian culture. Danielou was born on October 4, 1907, at Neuilly-sur-Seine near Paris, France. As the son of an aristocratic family, he spent much of his time in the country being educated by tutors. He occupied his time in the library, learning piano and paint- ing. Danielou’s mother was a devoted Catholic, who founded a religious order; his father was an anticlerical politician. Danielou’s artistic abilities took him to the United States, where he attended school in Annapolis, sold paintings at exhibits, and played piano at movie theaters. When he returned to France he continued to study music under Charles Panzera and Max d’Olonne. In 1932 Danielou began to travel extensively throughout North Africa, the Middle East, and Asia with the Swiss photographer Raymond Burnier. While in India he became fascinated with its tra- ditional culture. He became acquainted with the poet Rabindranath T AGORE , who employed him as director of the school of music in Shantiniketan, Tagore’s university. Danielou later moved to B ENARES (Varanasi) and met the Indian music master Shiven- dranath Basu. He remained in India for the next 30 years. During that time he learned both Hindi and S ANSKRIT . He was introduced to Swami Karpatri and translated some of his works. Swami Karpatri later initiated Danielou into Shaivite Hinduism (see S HAIVISM ) and gave him the name Shiva Sharan. He continued a dialogue over the years with René Gué- non, scholar of Sufism and ADVAITA V EDANTA , on the philosophy of Hinduism. In 1954, he left Benares to become director of the Adyar Library of Sanskrit Manuscripts in Madras (Chennai). Danielou became sympathetic to the Indian independence movement. After India won its inde- pendence from Britain, he returned to Europe in 1963 and devoted himself to the mission of pre- senting a true understanding of Hinduism to the West. He founded the Intercultural Institute of Comparative Music Studies in Berlin and Venice, which he led for decades. Through this institute he organized concerts featuring Asian musicians and began recording traditional Indian music through an arrangement with UNESCO. Danielou is cred- ited with raising the status of Indian classical music in the West to that of a recognized art form. Danielou is best known for his scholarship on Hindu culture. He authored over 30 books on topics ranging from music to religion. In 1971, he published a Brief History of India, which has since been translated and republished in 12 different countries. His works on religion have signifi- cantly shaped the conversation on the relationship between ancient Western culture and Hinduism. In Gods of Love and Ecstasy: The Traditions of Shiva and Dionysus, Danielou illustrates the similarities in rites and beliefs between ancient Greek religion and Shaivism. He claims further that the loss of such rites has left humanity in the West alienated from nature and the divine. Danielou’s books continue to be a source of great influence to those exploring Hindu culture. His works, written in French, have been translated into eight different languages, including English, Italian, and Spanish. He has also written piano arrangements to songs by Rabindranath Tagore. In his later years, Danielou continued inter- preting the music and philosophy of India to the K 118 Danielou, Alain 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 118 12/14/06 9:28:32 AM"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"West. In 1981 he received the UNESCO/CIM prize for music and in 1987 the Kathmandu medal. In 1992 he was appointed member of the Indian National Academy of Music, Dance and Theater.

Darshan can by itself confer grace upon a seeker and result in spiritual benefit. So, Hindus eagerly visit temples as well as divine persons for darshan. If during a festival an icon is paraded through the streets, everyone vies to catch sight of it, to receive its glance and grace. No icon in the form of a person is considered an active divinity until the ritual opening of its eyes. Further reading: Diana Eck, Darsan: Seeing the Divine Image in India, 3d ed. (New York: Columbia University Press, 1998). Dasha Mahavidya The Mahavidyas ( maha great, vidya knowledge) are 10 ( dasha ) goddesses who are grouped together in various literary, iconographic, and mythical contexts in India. It is a tantric grouping, though some of the goddesses are from a nontantric, nor- mative context. In TANTRISM , a VIDYA is equivalent to a MAN - TRA , but used for goddesses (the term mantra is restricted to devotion to male divinities). It is understood in the tantric context that the mantra or vidya and the divinity are identical. Therefore this group of 10 goddesses can be logically referred to as the 10 vidyas. Each of these goddesses can in fact grant the ultimate “knowledge” or vidya that can lead to liberation from birth and rebirth. The 10 goddesses constituting the Mahavidyas are K ALI , Tara, Tripura-sundari (Sri Lalita), Bhu- vaneshvari, Chinnamasta, Bhairavi, Dhumavati, Bagalamukhi, Matangi, and Kamala (L AKSHMI ). Kali is the fierce black goddess, the ruler over time ( kala ), who helped D URGA defeat the demons in order to restore order to the world. Tara, known as “She who takes one across the ocean of birth and rebirth,” is more prominent in Buddhism. Iconographically, she very much resembles Kali, as she is depicted seated or stand- ing upon the supine S HIVA . She is associated with the cremation ground and images of skulls. Tara reveals, however, a nurturing aspect that is usu- ally not found with Kali. At Tarapith in Birbhum, Bengal, she is depicted nursing Shiva from her breast. Tripurasundari is none other than Sri Lalita, the 16-year-old goddess who is the transcendent One. She is usually shown with a benign aspect, although she is in fact the incarnation of all god- desses, whether benign or fierce. Bhuvaneshvari, who is often seen as the embodiment of the physical world, is vermilion in color, has three eyes, and wears a jeweled crown. She has a smiling face and a crescent Moon on her brow. She can be depicted with two, six, or 20 hands holding various objects including the lotus and a bow. She is usually depicted sitting in the cross-legged, “lotus position” yogic posture and is generally shown without clothing. A god- dess described in the text Prapancasara called Dasha Mahavidya 119 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 119 12/14/06 9:28:32 AM"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Prapanceshvari appears to be identical to Bhu- vaneshvari; this text is the fullest source for details on Bhuvaneshvari. In most aspects she resembles S ARASVATI . In tantrism, her worship resembles in many details the worship of Sri Lalita. Chinnamasta has the most startling repre- sentation of all these goddesses. She stands, self-decapitated, with her head in one hand and the large cutting instrument in the other. On two sides attendants drink her blood. She stands on the recumbent, copulating couple of Kama, god of love, and R AT I , his mate. As does Kali she wears a necklace of human skulls, and, as does S HIVA she has a cobra encircling her upper body. Her body is naked, except for ornaments. One myth has Chinnamasta as a form of P ARVATI , the consort of Shiva. Another sees her as Parvati in the form of C HANDI . In both myths the goddess is begged for food by her attendants and cuts off her head to offer them her blood. There are specific texts that outline the worship of this goddess with mantras and YANTRAS . Bhairavi (the fierce goddess) is described as wearing red silk and a garland of severed heads (again as does Kali). Her breasts are said to be smeared with blood. She has three eyes with a crescent Moon on her forehead. She smiles, wear- ing a jeweled crown. She is shown with four or 10 hands. She holds a sword and a begging bowl in two of them. She is sometimes shown in sexual intercourse sitting astride Shiva. The literature often regards Bhairavi as Mahadevi, or Supreme Divinity. She is seen as supreme above even the male divinities B RAHMA , Shiva, and V ISHNU . Unusual epithets call her “Fond of semen and menstrual blood” and “She who dwells in the YONI [the vagina].” Such epithets show her transgres- sive, tantric character. Dhumavati, the widow goddess, is a rare and unusual personage. She is seen as black in color, ugly, old, and angry. She has hanging breasts, a long nose, and dirty clothes. She rides a convey- ance that has a banner with a crow on it. She has only two arms. In one hand is a winnowing basket and the other shows the “boon-granting” ( VARADA MUDRA ) gesture. (But sometimes she will hold a begging bowl made of a human skull and a spear.) Dhumavati is only rarely found independently of the Mahavidyas. Dhumavati’s origin myths show her being born from the smoke of the funeral pyre of the prototypical self-immolated goddess, S AT I . Another myth shows her as a form of Sati, forced to become a widow through a curse of Shiva. Her separate temples are few. At her temples liquor, meat, and a marijuana drink are offered in addi- tion to the usual offerings. Though her mytho- logical history seems to depict this goddess as dangerous, she is approachable in temples and offers boons and protections, as any other local goddess. Bagalamukhi is depicted on a lion throne. She has a yellow complexion and wears a yellow dress and yellow ornaments. She is surrounded and covered with things of yellow. One myth shows this goddess as a form of Sri Lalita. In a more popular myth she stops a demon named Madan who is killing people merely by speaking. She grasps his tongue and he becomes her devotee and therefore is not killed; there are iconographic and pictorial depictions of this event. In another myth Bagalamukhi is created by a curse of Shiva upon Parvati. Bagalamukhi is associated with magic and occult power. She is often approached for magical powers such as the ability to immobilize or attract people. Sometimes, as with all of these tantric deities, she is associated with sexuality and sexual intercourse. As have several of the Mahavidyas, she has aspects that belong to Kali and she is sometimes said to sit upon a corpse, often while holding on to the tongue of the demon described in her myth. Matangi is an unusual goddess who prefers offerings that are “polluted” in the Hindu sense, food that has been partially eaten or left over, things that have menstrual blood on them or have touched the dead. She is depicted as a 16-year-old K 120 Dasha Mahavidya 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 120 12/14/06 9:28:32 AM"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"girl, with blue or greenish skin and three eyes, wearing red clothing and accoutrements, seated on a corpse. She has two or four hands. In one tale she emerges from leftover food that Shiva, Parvati, Vishnu, and Lakshmi have just eaten. Another myth calls Matangi a sister of Shiva, cursed by Parvati to be reborn in an untouchable (Dalit) family, forced to survive on leftovers and other polluted things. Matangi is also sometimes associated with the giving of magical powers. The final of the 10 Mahavidyas is Kamala. She is identified with Lakshmi and carries Lakshmi’s typical characteristics and iconography, except that she is never shown in conjunction with her husband, Vishnu.

Datta Yoga Center (est. 1986) The Datta Yoga Center in West Sunbury, Penn- sylvania, is a center of KRIYA YOGA practice and teaching. It was founded in 1986 by Sri Ganapati Sachchidananda Swami (b. May 26, 1942) as the American branch of Avadhoota Datta Peetham in Mysore, India ( see AVADHUTA ). The swami also founded the Datta Temple and Hall of Trinity in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in 1997. As a child, Sachchidananda was fond of the religious life and became a devoted yoga practi- tioner. As a young adult he became known as a healer in his home village of Mekedati, Karnataka, in southern India. To his devotees, Sachchidananda is considered an avadhuta , or liberated one, following in the tra- dition of Lord D ATTATREYA . His teachings empha- size kriya yoga, which focuses on breath as a means of turning attention toward one’s inner self and the realization of God. The Datta Yoga Center is a nonmembership organization. Centers serve as temples for worship services and dissemination of the avadhuta ’s message of love, peace, freedom, and service and provide a place where devotees can develop spiritual values. Music, in the form of bhajans (songs) and instrumentals, many of which have been com- posed by Sachchidananda, are a significant part of worship services. He says, “Music is my reli- gion, music is my language, music is my soul and music is my expression.” Sachchidananda has organized Music for Healing and Meditation con- certs throughout the United States and Europe. He is also an advocate of ayurvedic medicine (see A YURVEDA ) and the sponsor of a hospital for the underprivileged in India. The Datta Yoga Center publishes books by Sachchidananda, a monthly newsletter called Bhakti Mala, and CDs of Sachchidananda’s perfor- mances of his musical compositions.

He initiated students into Yogananda’s practice of kriya yoga. In 1953, after a stint in the U.S. Army Medi- cal Corps at Fort Riley, Kansas, Davis became an independent spiritual teacher and withdrew from SRF. He founded New Life Worldwide in St. Petersburg, Florida. In the early 1960s Davis worked with Edwin O’Neal and the Christian Spiritual Alliance (CSA) in Lakemont, Georgia. He was associated with several New Thought churches, including Unity School of Christianity and Divine Science; joined the New Thought Alli- ance (INTA); and developed relationships with other teachers in the Hindu tradition, including S WA M I R AMA , S WAMI M UKTANANDA , and S AT YA S AI B ABA .

Natarajan Iyer was born on August 15, 1930, the second son of Valambal and Gopala Iyer in the small village of Manjakkudi in Thanjavar District in Tamil Nadu, India. He was raised in a tradi- tional Brahmin family who primarily made their living selling coconuts. Described by family mem- bers as quiet, reflective, dispassionate, yet daring, Natarajan helped to manage his family’s small plot of land after his father died when the boy was only eight. An excellent student, Natarajan excelled in all subjects related to logic, including physics and mathematics. He was known to be a voracious reader, harboring a large collection of books in his small home, where he regularly read until early morning. Forced to grow up rapidly, and unable to afford college, Natarajan moved to Madras (now Chennai) to find a job that would allow him to continue his studies. He learned stenography and typewriting and began a career as a journalist with a job at a weekly, Dharmika Hind. When the paper seemed to be failing, he joined the air force as a combatant and was posted to the Ground Train- ing Station in Bangalore; after military service, he returned to journalism, with an interim period as campaign manager for an independent candidate for state assembly, when he fine-tuned his public speaking skills. In 1952 he was still waiting for his promised position with the prestigious newspaper Indian Express, when he accidentally met Swami C HINMA - YANANDA during a 41-day public teaching. At the end of the teachings Natrajan volunteered to orga- nize the feeding of the poor, which traditionally K 122 Daya Mata, Sri 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 122 12/14/06 9:28:32 AM"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"followed a period of study and sacrifice. Swami Chinmayananda, attracted to Natrajan’s earnest- ness and organization skills, informed him that he would return the following year for further teach- ings. The 22-year-old Natrajan was certain that he was meant to pursue these teachings and thus became an active member of the newly formed Chinmaya Mission, an organization inspired by the vision of Swami Chinmayananda. His previous experience in journalism and editing put him very close to Swami Chinmayananda. In 1957 Natarajan gave up his work to follow Swami Chinmayananda. In 1962 he was the sec- ond student to be initiated into SANNYAS (renun- ciation) by Swami Chinmayananda and was given the name Swami Dayananda Saraswati. He would later continue his development as a teacher under the tutelage of several teachers, including Swami Pranavananda of Gudiwada. Known today as an authoritative teacher of traditional ADVAITA V EDANTA and an accomplished scholar of Hinduism, Swami Dayananda has con- ducted six three-year residential courses in both India and the United Sates, producing well over 300 Vedanta teachers around the world. He has established three institutions: two in India, the A RSHA V IDYA G URUKULUM in Coimbatore, which offers three-year residential courses, and the Swami Dayananda Ashram in Rishikesh, a retreat center and place for continued studies, and the Arsha Vidya Gurukulam in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, which serves as a retreat center and venue for residential courses. Swami Dayananda is known for his scholar- ship, his depth of understanding, and his appre- ciation for Western culture, attributes that give him a wide appeal. He travels the world teach- ing in a variety of venues, including American universities and international conventions. He has presented papers at UNESCO and the United Nations, where he participated in the Millennium Peace Summit. In November 2001, in Delhi, he convened the First World Congress for the Pres- ervation of Religious Diversity, inaugurated by the Dalai Lama and former Indian prime minister Vajpayee. Swami Dayananda also actively par- ticipated in forming the Women’s Global Peace Initiative, which convened at the United Nations in Geneva in October 2002. In addition to teaching, Swami Dayananda emphasizes a commitment to peace and social justice. He instituted the All India Movement (AIM) for Seva, a public service organization that provides medical, educational, nutritional, and social support to villagers in remote rural Indian communities.

Indian tradition, it must be noted, does not see the demons in completely polarized terms, as, for instance, in Christianity, in which Satan is an absolutely evil counterpart to God. The asuras are known to be the sons of the same father as the gods, and both asuras and rak- shasas finally go to heaven after their battle with the different gods, its being understood that they have played a role in the glorification of God by being his (or sometimes her) opponents. In the V EDAS a special role is played by the demon ( asura ) Vritra, a serpent being who is the enemy of god I NDRA , king of the gods. Indra strikes Vritra with a thunderbolt to force him to release the terrestrial waters. Sometimes Vritra in his mountain lair holds back the summer waters of the “seven streams” of the I NDUS River, so demonic beings 123 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 123 12/14/06 9:28:33 AM"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"important to the A RYANS ; Indra must force him to release them. A later example of a demon or asura, found in the epics and puranas, is B ALI , who through severe austerities usurped the throne of Indra himself to perpetrate evil in all the worlds. V ISHNU finally must take incarnation as the V AMANA A VATA R , the divine dwarf, to depose him. Beginning with the epics, the demonic group is enhanced by the addition of the rakshasas, demons who are cannibilistic and blood-thirsty. In the M AHABHARATA the P ANDAVA brothers encounter various such demons in their travels. B HIMA in fact had a son named Hidimba by a female demon. The most famous rakshasa must certainly be Ravana, ruler of Lanka. He was depicted as having 10 heads and 20 arms. It was he who abducted R AMA ’s wife, S ITA , in the R AMAYANA ; Rama destroyed him in the end, as was the divine plan. Rashasas are seen in later puranas (c. sixth through 16th centuries), as they are in the epics, often attacking sages in the wilderness and disrupting Vedic rites.

Desai, Guru Amrit (1932– ) yogi and founder of Kripalu Yoga Fellowship Amrit Desai has been a prominent teacher of yoga in the United States for several decades. His career has survived expulsion from his own ashram on charges of sexual misconduct. Amrit Desai was born on October 16, 1932, in Halol, Gujurat state, India. Little is reported about his family or childhood. In 1948 at age 16, he met Swami K RIPALVANANDA , student of Swami Kaivaro- han, reputed to be the 28th incarnation of S HIVA . Desai studied with Kripalvananda and taught Sahaj Yoga with the SWAMI . In 1960, he traveled to the United States to study art and design at the Philadelphia College of Art, as he worked in fac- tories to support himself. He created a successful career in the arts and his wife and son joined him in America. In 1966 Desai founded the Yoga Society of Pennsylvania, which drew a large following. In 1970, Kripalvananda called Desai back to India to initiate him into SHAKTIPAT DIKSHA (energetic trans- ference from master to student to awaken spiritual energy). After his initiation, Desai experienced what he called a spiritual implosion, in which he instantaneously flowed from one ASANA (yogic posture) to the next and felt powerful KUNDALINI energy. In 1972 Desai moved his fellowship to the suburbs of Philadelphia and changed its name to the Kripalu Yoga Fellowship. In addition to teaching K RIPALU Y OGA , Desai and his fellowship became pioneers of holistic health. In 1983, the ashram and fellowship moved to a 350-acre for- mer Jesuit retreat in Lenox, Massachusetts. The practice of yoga and the ASHRAM lifestyle were strictly observed, including separation of genders, silent meals, required SADHANA (practice) and satsang (attendance at teaching sessions), and BHAJANS (singing of devotional songs). In 1988, Kripalu gained the legal status as a spiritual/vol- unteer organization and became a leading spiri- tual retreat center in the United States. Throughout his teaching in the United States, Desai was a charismatic and impressive GURU . Yet, in 1994, his integrity was compromised by sexual misconduct with members of the ashram and ash- ram guests and he was forced to leave the spiritual K 124 Desai, Guru Amrit 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 124 12/14/06 9:28:33 AM"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"center he founded. Many members of the com- munity were saddened by the disclosure of Desai’s behavior, but the Kripalu Yoga and Health Center has remained a prominent, respected spiritual and health center, reoriented around Desai’s teacher, Swami Kripalananda. Desai has returned to teaching and travels throughout the United States, offering workshops and teacher training. His new organization, Amrit Yoga Institute, teaches the Amrit Method of Yoga Nidra to provide tools for banishing unconscious fears and habits. The institute also publishes Sacred Pathways Magazine, a bimonthly journal of yoga and higher consciousness. The Amrit Yoga Institute is headquartered in Salt Springs, Florida.

Desai, Yogi Shanti (mid-20th century) teacher of yoga and founder of Shanti Yoga Institute Born in Gujarat state, India, Yogi Shanti Desai studied yoga and Hindu scriptures from an early age. As a youth he met and was initiated by Swami Kripalu, the inspiration of the Kripalu Yoga Institute. After receiving a B.S. in India, Desai immigrated in 1961 to the United States, where he received an M.S. in chemistry from Drexel University. He worked as a research chemist while teaching yoga until 1972, when he turned to teaching yoga full-time. He opened the S HANTI Y OGA I NSTITUTE AND Y OGA R ETREAT in Ocean City, New Jersey, in 1974 to provide instruction in yoga as a way of life. From 1977 to 1985 he directed the Glassboro (New Jersey) Ashram for spiritual communal liv- ing, and after 1981 he directed Prasad, a yogic health food store and restaurant. He personally directs the Ocean City facility with his wife, Nay- ana. The institute offers yoga classes, seminars, and workshops.

Desjardins, Arnaud (1925– ) founder of Hauteville Ashram Arnaud Desjardins is a French teacher of ADVAITA V EDANTA . After a successful career making docu- mentaries about Indian and other Eastern reli- gious leaders and traditions, Desjardins eventually founded the first ASHRAM in France. He is the most popular and influential spiritual teacher in the francophone world. Arnaud Guerin-Desjardins (he later dropped Guerin) was born on June 18, 1925, into a devout French Protestant family. His father, Jacques Guerin-Desjardins, was a hero in both world wars, and a prominent figure in Protestant circles. Close to Baden-Powell, the founder of the scouting movement, to whom Arnaud was introduced as a young boy, Guerin-Desjardins wrote books, gave lectures, and gave his two sons and one daughter a strict religious education. He earned a middle- class living as an executive for Peugeot, while his wife, Antoinette, also a devout Protestant, cared for the children at home. As a young boy, Arnaud, although afraid of his father, was very interested in religious sub- jects, but was also tormented by questions rather uncommon for most children of his age, such as What about Catholics? Could they really be so wrong? If he had been born a Catholic, would not he be convinced that the truth lay in the Catholic Church? At the end of his teens, having seen plays given at the Comédie Française in Paris as part of his cultural education, Arnaud developed a pas- sion for theater and acting, learning whole plays by heart. His parents very reluctantly consented Desjardins, Arnaud 125 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 125 12/14/06 9:28:33 AM"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"for him to attend the Cours Simon, at the time the most reputed drama school in France. He eventu- ally studied law and political science, but his heart was with the Cours Simon, which opened a whole new world for him. There, he met young men and women, many of whom were to become famous actors, who lived in a different, more relaxed and open world than the one in which he had grown up. His ambition was to join the Comédie Fran- çaise as an actor, yet, when he passed the first part of the exams at the national drama school, the Conservatoire, his parents put tremendous emotional pressure on him to renounce the the- ater. The young man finally gave in but became depressed. The future seemed grim when he joined a bank but became bright when he fell in love with a young Protestant woman, to whom he was soon engaged. That beautiful dream came to an abrupt end when Arnaud, age 24, was struck with tuberculosis. His prospective father-in-law broke the engagement and Arnaud was sent to a sanatorium, never to see his fiancée again. Feel- ing abandoned and betrayed, he read voraciously and discovered the teachings of G. I. Gurdjieff and P. D. Ouspensky and learned about Hindu gurus through Jean Herbert’s Spiritualité Hindoue, in which the author recounted his meetings with A NANDAMAYI M A , Sri A UROBINDO , R AMANA M AHARSHI , and Swami R AMDAS . After his recovery from tuberculosis, Desjar- dins returned to Paris, where he joined a Gurdjieff group in the early 1950s and started working as an assistant for the embryonic French television system. In the Gurdjieff group, he met Denise, an impressive young woman a few years his senior who was an artist of growing reputation. They were married in 1957. In 1959, having become a television director and filmmaker, Arnaud went through a difficult time in his professional life. His projects were refused one after the other, and he then decided to travel to India by car, to see for himself whether those masters he had read about lived up to Jean Herbert’s description; he planned to film them with a 16-millimeter camera. In 1959 he traveled to India, where he met and filmed Swami S HIVANANDA S ARASWATI of Rishikesh, Swami Ramdas, and Anandamayi Ma. Back in France, his finished documentary was shown on national television and very well received by the public as well as critics. He then specialized in documentaries on living spiri- tual traditions, filming with his 16-millimeter camera, assisted only by his wife. They traveled for extensive periods, taking their two children with them. In 1965, Desjardins produced several documentaries on the Tibetans, became close to the Dalaï Lama, and went on to produce films on Zen Buddhism in Japan and Sufi brotherhoods in Afghanistan. Those films, available today on DVD and videotapes, are considered unique documents. The expeditions enabled Desjardins to spend a lot of time in close contact with some of the greatest teachers of the East and to pursue his spiritual quest while developing a growing reputation in France as a filmmaker and lecturer. In 1965, feeling that despite his devotion to Anandamayi Ma, he could not really consider himself as her student, he went, with her blessing, to meet a swami he had only heard about, who lived a reclusive life, away from spiritual curiosity seekers, in the heart of Bengal. Sri Swami Praj- napad, while immersed in Hindu tradition, was a very unorthodox teacher. He advocated a path rooted in non-duality ( advaïta ) that takes modern psychology into account. Swami Prajnapad was an ardent admirer of Freud, whose works he had studied as early as the 1920s, and had developed an approach through which students could open to their unconscious through private interviews, which he offered every day to one or two students. In that remote ashram, where the teacher was very accessible, spoke fluent English, and had an understanding of Western culture, Desjardins felt he had found his spiritual path. He then embarked on a very intense process with Swami Prajnapad, K 126 Desjardins, Arnaud 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 126 12/14/06 9:28:33 AM"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"visiting him every year for one to three months and applying his teaching in daily life. In 1971, after going through a crisis in his personal life, Desjardins went to Swami Prajnapad and experienced a deep shift of inner perspec- tive. Now aspiring to a quieter life, he planned to end his professional career as an administrator in French Television, but Swami Prajnapad saw a different future for his student. The guru plainly told him that his true calling lay in passing on the teaching, even if only to a few people. Since a group of people who had seen his films and read his books wanted to embark on the path with him as their guide, Desjardins started planning the opening of what was to be the first French ash- ram, examining it in detail with Swami Prajnapad. Having bought Le Bost, a large but modest house hidden in the heart of Auvergne, Arnaud retired from television and, in 1974, started welcoming a few students, whom he trained in the spirit of what he himself had experienced with Swami Praj- napad. A few weeks after Le Bost opened, Swami Prajnapad passed away in India. The ashram was not open to visitors or adver- tised. Nevertheless, word of mouth spread and Desjardins was soon faced with an ever more demanding schedule. Nine years after he had opened Le Bost, after having experienced serious signs of utter exhaustion, he decided to rest for a few months and then open a new, more open ash- ram in the south of France. That was Font d’Isière, which also lasted nine years. Despite the lack of publicity, Arnaud’s reputation as teacher kept growing. In 1987, he and Denise parted ways as husband and wife, although their friendship and collaboration in the work continue to this day. In 1995, at the age of 70, Desjardins embarked on a daring adventure—the foundation of a large ashram under his leadership where others could teach as well, and where many people could study and practice at different levels. Surrounding himself with a few senior stu- dents and staff, Desjardins founded Hauteville, in the Ardèche, a place dedicated to traditional SADHANA (spiritual discipline), interreligious dia- logue, and sanctuary for spiritual aspirants. Des- jardins has become the best-known and most respected Hindu teacher in the French-speaking world. Seekers from all over the world travel to Hauteville for retreats where they meet not only Desjardins himself, who still is available, but also his senior students. In 1996, Desjardins married Veronique Loiseleur, one of his long-term col- laborators. Today the words of Desjardins are published by Hauteville’s publishing house, La Table Ronde, in Paris. Desjardins travels widely, especially to Quebec, where he has a thriving ashram. Only two of his numerous books have been published in English. He regularly participates in inter- religious dialogue at Karma Ling in the Savoie region of France with Lama Denis Teundroup, a Frenchman given the title of lama in the Tibetan tradition.

There are numerous gods in the V EDAS and PURANAS , so the word has a polytheistic connotation. When one calls out to a singular God one uses the term B HAGAVAN . The gods of the Vedas are numerous; the most important are I NDRA , god of storms, and A GNI , god of fire. Later V ISHNU , S HIVA , and the GODDESS or D EVI (feminine form of deva ) became the preeminent divinities. deva 127 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 127 12/14/06 9:28:33 AM"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"devadasi Devadasi literally means, “a servant of god.” This term was applied to women who lived in temples as the wives of the male divinity there. Tradition- ally the women were married in a solemn cer- emony to the divinity. The women were seen to be the essential power and energy (S HAKTI ) of the divinity incarnate; men would offer great gifts to the temple in order to have relationships and even sexual intercourse with the devadasis. The devada- sis were rigorously trained in the arts and were very well educated. Several of the Indian dances that are well known today were preserved and developed by devadasis in the temples of India. Most notable are B HARATA N AT YA M and Odissi. When the British arrived they regarded these sacred women as nothing but prostitutes and banned the institution of the devadasi in the late 19th century. The practice continued secretly, however, for some time afterward. Further reading: Saskia C.

Deva Foundation (est. 1980s) Dr. Deva Maharaj (b. 1948) established the Deva Foundation in Sweden and Beverly Hills, Califor- nia, during the 1980s. Its mission is to provide a space where Asian and Western ideas and phi- losophy about holiness can meet. The foundation serves to educate individuals and groups in the areas of transformation, enlightenment, and indi- vidual growth. It offers a variety of services and treatments designed to facilitate personal growth and healing. These methods include acupressure, massage, nutrition, self-hypnosis, and SHAKTIPAT , a technique that serves as the catalyst to awaken the KUNDALINI energy believed to rest in a latent state at the base of the spine. Often pictured as a coiled serpent, this vibrant energy is believed to stimulate the opening of the CHAKRAS (energy cen- ters) located along the spine, serving to promote spiritual enlightenment. Dr. Deva established the foundation to serve others, using the credentials he had earned in India as a homeopathic and ayurvedic medical practitioner ( see A YURVEDA ). Members of the foun- dation may also take classes at the Tantra House, an auxiliary facility that functions as an esoteric school. Students at Tantra House are taught that the wedding of spirituality with sexuality hastens enlightenment and that mastery of the mysterious should be accompanied by holistic health prac- tices. Through the years Dr. Deva has become a frequent guest on radio and television, where he demonstrates telepathy and clairvoyance. He trav- els often to teach and heal. In India, he frequents the Yoga Center in New Delhi, an educational center promoting his mission abroad. The membership of the Deva Foundation includes two groups in the United States and a sole mission in Canada. The organization reports some 1,000 members through North America and at the several international centers. Further reading: J.

Devaki’s husband, V ASUDEVA , was minister to the evil king Kamsa of Mathura. The king was determined to kill Devaki’s children to forestall a prediction that one of her sons would assassinate him. He had the couple put under guard and had the couple’s first six children killed. The seventh child, B ALARAMA , was miraculously transferred while an embryo into the womb of Vasudeva’s second wife, Rohini. By divine inter- vention, when the eighth child, Krishna, was born, all of the king’s guards who kept watch over the couple fell asleep, and Vasudeva was able to deliver Krishna to his foster mother, Y ASHODA , with whom he was raised.

Devanagari Devanagari (“of the city of the gods”) is the script that is used for Hindi, Sanskrit, and Marathi. It developed out of the earlier Brahmi script toward the end of the last millennium B . C . E . It has been used regularly for Sanskrit ever since. When Hindi was recognized and developed as a separate writ- ten language in the 19th century, Devanagari was the script chosen for it. As with most other scripts that derive from Brahmi, Devanagari uses a system of abbreviated vowel markings to show vowels after conso- nants, when the vowels are not the first letter of the word. Full vowel forms are made beginning a word. There are 48 to 51 letters in the Deva- nagari alphabet depending on whether certain unusual vowels are included and whether one includes conjunct consonants at the end.

Devayani and Yayati Devayani and Yayati are the romantic protago- nists in an old and popular myth, which also con- siders them to be ancestors of K RISHNA . Devayani, daughter of the famous rishi Ushanas Kavya, was swimming in a pond with Sharmishtha, the daughter of the king of the asuras (antigods or demons) and a student of Ushanas Kavya. In those days such interchange took place between gods and asuras. When Lord Shiva happened by they rushed to get their clothes. Sharmishtha took Devayani’s clothes by mistake. Devayani upbraided Sharmishtha severely, and the latter in anger threw her friend into a well and took her clothes. King Yayati, who was hunting, happened by and rescued Devayani. When he touched her hand, she announced that she would never touch another man’s hand. Kavya gave his daughter to the king; following Devayani’s wish he also handed over Sharmishtha as her slave, admonish- ing the king never to have carnal relations with the daughter of the asuras. Devayani soon bore the king glorious sons, one of them Yadu, an ancestor of Krishna him- self. Sharmishtha became jealous and managed to seduce the king to break his promise to Kavya. When Devayani heard this she went home to her father. The king followed, chastised, and sought her return. When he reached her home, her father, Kavya, cursed the king with immediate old age as an antidote to his uncontrolled lust. The king begged a way out of the curse and was allowed to transfer the curse to someone else. He convinced his youngest son to take the curse of old age, and the son became a ruler while for a thousand years Yayati enjoyed the pleasures of love with Devayani. Finally, tiring of the life of the senses, the king took back his old age from the son and renounced the world. Further reading: C. R.

Devi, Indra (1899–2002) Western hatha yoga teacher Indra Devi was a highly popular Russian-born yoga teacher. In her long, active life she established a series of learning centers in several countries on three continents, popularizing yoga among celeb- rities and ordinary people around the world. Eugenie Peterson was born on May 12, 1899, in Riga, Russia, the daughter of a Russian noble- woman and a Swedish bank director. In 1920 Eugenie and her mother escaped the turmoil of the Russian Revolution and settled in Berlin, Ger- many. She joined a theatrical company as an actor and dancer and toured throughout Europe. In 1927, she toured India as a member of the performing troupe and remained there for 12 years. She married Jan Trakaty, a Czecho- slovakian diplomat in Bombay (Mumbai), and became a movie star in Indian films, taking the stage name Indra Devi. She met many leaders and teachers in India, including Jiddu K RISHNAMURTI , R ABINDRANATH T AGORE , Jawaharlal Nehru, and the maharaja and maharani of Mysore. The maharaja requested that she be allowed to study with him. He accepted his first non-Indian female student. At the palace at Mysore, Eugenie met Tirumalai Krishnamacharya, a yoga master, whose students included B. K. S. I YENGAR . Devi, also known as Mataji (revered mother), discovered her passion in life. She stayed in India, studying and practicing yoga until 1939. Healed of a serious heart condition through her practice, she became an avid student. She followed her teacher’s methods of HATHA YOGA , which advocated a unique practice for each individual body. She studied PRANAYAMA (breath work) and dhyana ( MEDITATION ). She continued her studies in the Himalayas after the death of her first husband. She adopted the name Indra Devi for her persona as yoga teacher. In the late 1940s, Devi traveled to Southern California. She founded a yoga studio in Holly- wood and taught many people, including celeb- rities. In 1953, she married Dr. Sigrid Knauer, a physician and humanitarian. They bought a ranch in Tecate, Baja Mexico, which served as a home, school, and retreat center for 24 years. She traveled throughout the world teaching yoga and lecturing. In 1966, Devi met S AT YA S AI B ABA , who pro- foundly affected her subsequent practice and instruction. She developed Sai Yoga, a system of moving through ASANAS (yogic postures) with spiritual consciousness. In 1985, she moved to Argentina and estab- lished the Indra Devi Foundation. She traveled all around the world and included many famous people as her students, including Gloria Swanson, Greta Garbo, Jennifer Jones, Olivia de Haviland, and Madame Chiang Kai-shek. She popularized yoga and meditation in Hollywood in the 1940s and 1950s and, through a series of books and innovative classes, helped to promote yoga in China, the Soviet Union, and Latin America. She remained active well into her 90s, teaching two classes daily. She died on April 25, 2002, at the age of 102.

Social activity was traditionally very much circumscribed by tradition; following dharma meant doing what was required. Starting as early as the fourth century B . C . E ., a voluminous literature in Sanskrit was created called D HARMASHASTRA (authoritative texts on dharma). These included the Dharmasutras (aphoristic texts). Dharma later became personified as a god in mythology and literature. His son was Y UDHISHTHIRA , one of the five P ANDAVAS in the M AHABHARATA story. In the Jain tradition, dharma refers to the complex of duties required of a Jain. Jains recog- nize 10 forms of dharma that monks are to follow ( see J AINISM ).

Dharmashastra The Indian literary genre of Dharmashastra (authoritative scripture prescribing the rules of right conduct) began around the fourth century B . C . E . It included the subgenre of Dharmasutras, or aphoristic works about DHARMA . Traditionally, the L AW S OF M ANU ( Manusmriti or Manavadharma- shastra ) is considered the first and most authorita- tive text, written by the legendary M ANU . Dharmashastra literature prescribes the laws, norms, rules, and regulations of life for both the individual and the community. It covers social norms, ethics, and moral tenets but also includes direction on the proper performance of rituals and ceremonies. It is usually quite specific concerning diet, domestic law, the proper conduct of kings, and, most important, the proper conduct of each caste. Major Dharmashastras were written by Apastamba, Gautama, Baudhayana, and Vasishtha, among others. Further reading: Wendy Doniger with Brian K.

Diaspora Although there is some disagreement about the term Hindu Diaspora, most members of the world- wide Hindu community use it to describe the millions of Hindus of South Asian origin who live outside India. While the majority of the world’s Hindus reside in India, those living abroad have established Hindu practices and communities in places such as A USTRALIA , Canada, the C ARIBBEAN REGION , the U NITED K INGDOM , Fiji, M AURITIUS , and the U NITED S TATES of America. The practices of overseas Hinduism have had a significant influ- ence within India, because of frequent travel and contact between family members and institutions located in India and abroad. While exact numbers of overseas Hindus are difficult to determine, partly because of census restrictions (for example, the United States cen- sus does not record religious affiliation), scholars Diaspora 131 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 131 12/14/06 9:28:34 AM"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"have estimated the number of Hindus living in particular countries. For example, the sociologist Prema Kurien suggests that Hindus accounted for approximately 65 percent of more than 800,000 people of Indian origin reported in the 1990 United States census. Using the same calcula- tion on the 2000 U.S. census figure of almost 1.7 million people of Indian origin, one arrives at a figure of approximately 1.1 million Hindus in the United States. Mauritius, a small country with a long history of Indian migration, is home to more than half a million Hindus, 48 percent of its total population. Indians have been migrating since premodern times, both inside and outside India. The large- scale migration of the modern period, according to the historian Roger Daniels, may be the result of the British abolition of the slave trade and then of slavery itself during the first half of the 19th century. Without slaves, the British began to rely on indentured servants and contract laborers to work their plantations from Fiji to the Caribbean. The Indian subcontinent provided much of this cheap labor, and the British transported these workers throughout their empire. Some of these laborers eventually returned to India, but most of them remained in these distant colonies. Bhikhu Parekh, a political theorist, estimates that approx- imately three-quarters of the indentured laborers during the period from 1834 to 1924 were Hindu. Many Hindus were among the farmers and skilled laborers from Punjab and merchants from Gujarat who migrated as individuals to destinations such as East Africa and Canada. Because purity and pollution are significant concerns for many classes of Hindus, orthodox Hindus, especially in the early period, were skep- tical of travel abroad. At the least, international travel meant living among people who would be considered polluting. Further, many felt it would be difficult for Hindu sojourners to resist engag- ing in polluting activities such as MEAT - EATING or drinking alcohol. Members of the upper castes did begin to travel abroad, often for higher education, but significant numbers did not settle abroad until the last half of the 20th century. The patterns of global dispersal among Hin- dus have shifted since World War II as members of the middle and upper rungs of Hindu society began settling abroad in increasing numbers. Great Britain faced a labor shortage after the war and immigrants from India filled labor needs in the 1950s and 1960s. At first, these migrants were mostly single men, but women joined them and helped establish families there in the 1970s and 1980s. Although migration directly from South Asia slowed in Britain during the 1970s and 1980s, many East Africans of South Asian origin decided to migrate to Britain when political pressures forced them to leave Africa. Having lived abroad for multiple generations, those Hindus among them had already established Hinduism in the Diaspora and took strong orthodox traditions to Britain. This newer wave of South Asian migrants began to arrive in the United States in the late 1960s. After decades of racist immigration laws that discriminated against Asians, among others, Lyndon Johnson signed the Immigration Act of 1965, drastically altering U.S. immigration policy. This act replaced an immigration quota based on national origins with preferences for relatives of residents of the United States and members of certain professions. The new law also increased the limits on immigrants from countries outside the Western Hemisphere. Many of the earliest post-1965 Indian immigrants were well-educated, English-speaking professionals, who tended to be from upper castes. On the basis of the family preferences in the new law, many of their relatives began to join them in the 1980s and 1990s. These different historic immigration patterns affected religious communities in different ways. Parekh notes, for example, that the Hindus in French colonies such as Mauritius faced assimila- tion policies and many adopted Christianity, albeit in a hybridized form. Hindus in East Africa, by contrast, often remained connected to India and lived in more independent, homogeneous settle- K 132 Diaspora 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 132 12/14/06 9:28:34 AM"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"ments, retaining strong Hindu traditions. There are, however, some common patterns of Hindu- ism in the sites where Hindu immigrants more recently settled, such as the United Kingdom and the United States. In these countries the home often remains a central site of Hindu practice. Families frequently set aside space in the home for a PUJA (worship) room, in which they install images of the deities. Worship there may range from daily practice to rituals associated with important Hindu festivals and life events. Because religious specialists are harder to find outside India, many Hindus living abroad learn how to perform practices for which they would have hired a priest if they had been living in India. Members of the community often believe that their children need to see people outside the family engaged in Hindu practice. This is one of several reasons why many overseas Hindus regu- larly participate in one or more religious activities outside the home. Some participate in informal groups of families from similar backgrounds who meet to perform the same ritual on a regular basis. Many overseas Hindus also participate in temple activities, which may encompass the traditions of a wider variety of Hindu practices. Transnational religious movements such as the S WAMINARAYAN group have highly developed organizations that tend to the needs of members living both in India and abroad. Other, smaller organizations send gurus abroad to tend to the needs of Hindu householders and their communities. Hindus living abroad often return to India for short peri- ods, most often for visits to family members, but sometimes for religious pilgrimages. It is important to note that the Hindu Diaspora properly speaking includes people who are not of South Asian descent but who have accepted Hindu practices as integral to their lives. This includes, for example, the many members of the I NTERNATIONAL S OCIETY FOR K RISHNA C ONSCIOUS - NESS , popularly known as the Hare Krishnas, who are not of South Asian descent.

Digambara Digambara is one of the two main divisions of the Jain tradition (see J AINISM ). It literally means “those wearing the sky as a garment,” a refer- ence to the complete nudity of the monks of this Digambara 133 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 133 12/14/06 9:28:35 AM"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"branch. The Digambara Jains, who are relatively few in number, are concentrated in the south of India, while the S HVETAMBARAS (those wearing white garments) are concentrated in the west and north. The Digambaras hold that during a famine in the north around 300 B . C . E ., the teacher BHADRAB - AHU led a group of Jain monks southward to Kar- nataka. Years later, when he and his community returned north, they were shocked to find that the community of monks had deviated from the true tradition and had begun to wear white garments. The Digambara Jains believe that all of the origi- nal texts of the Jains, the P URVAS and the A NGAS , were completely lost; any text claimed by the Shvetambaras is at best a corruption of the origi- nal knowledge. (The Shvetambaras also accept that the Purvas have been lost.) Both groups agree that Bhadrabahu was the last to know all the original texts. The oldest Digambara sacred text is Shat- khandagama, “Scripture of six parts,” written in Prakrit. It is said to have been composed by the monk Dharasena (c. second century C . E ., who summoned two monks, Pushpadanta and Bhuta- bali, to a cave to record scriptural knowledge that he feared was dwindling away; the pair later put together the Kasayapahuda, “Treatise on passion.” These two texts constitute the earliest and most sacred Digambara scripture. Another very impor- tant text for Digambaras is the Tattvarthasutra, “ Aphorisms on the meaning of the constituent aspects of the universe” by the monk Umasvati. This text, coincidentally, is the only Digambara text that is also accepted by the Shvetambaras. It appears that the differences between the two branches of Jain tradition are due to their separate development, rather than to any direct disputa- tion. The most important difference concerns the nudity of Digambara monks. Digambaras under- stand that if a monk is to be truly possessionless and therefore truly detached, he (there are no female monks) must not possess even a garment. Following this rigorous logic Digambara monks were never allowed to carry even begging bowls and were forced to beg only with their hands. Doctrinally, this concept has consequences for the potential of women to become liberated from the cycle of rebirth. Since women cannot take the final step into nudity, Digambaras judge that females cannot reach liberation until born in a male body. Shvetambaras think that women can reach liberation in the female body. In fact Mallinatha, one of the T IRTHANKARAS , enlightened teachers, is understood by the Shvetambaras to be female, and by the Digambaras to be male. This is the only dis- agreement in the lists of Tirthankaras maintained by the two sects. Until this day, there is little interchange between these two divisions of Jains, even though they share most of their doctrines. They have actively contended against each other for control of several important shrines in India, and in cer- tain localities they are not on good terms. Gener- ally, however, where both are present they tolerate each other, although they do not mix in festivals or in other spiritual contexts.

For instance, many sects and traditions require the transmission of a MANTRA to members, in some cases by one’s father, in other cases by the GURU . Most mendicant orders require a formal ordination that involves a ritual that is also called a diksha. A SANNYASI , one who renounces the world, is required to undergo a dik- sha that includes rituals usually done at a person’s cremation after death. The Hindu ceremony at which the SACRED THREAD is invested on young boys is also formally called a diksha.

Jay Dinshah was an American proponent of the vegan diet. He buttressed his arguments with Hindu concepts of nonviolence and respect for animals. H. Jay Dinshah was born in Malaga, New Jersey, on November 2, 1933, and raised as a lactovegetar- ian by his parents, Irene Grace Hoger Dinshah and Dinshah P. Ghadiali, an Indian who immigrated from Bombay (Mumbai) to the United States in 1911. Ghadiali was a scientist and health educator and an early advocate of the vegetarian lifestyle. He educated his son on the value of a vegetarian diet from the time he was a small child. The boy was home-schooled by both parents. When Dinshah was 23, out of curiosity, he visited a slaughterhouse on Front Street in Philadel- phia. His wife, Freya Smith Dinshah, later recalled that the experience changed his life forever. In 1956 Dinshah read the influential book Why Kill for Food? by Geoffrey L. Rudd, published by the Vegetarian Society in England. Dinshah became an advocate of vegetarianism and sold copies of the book via clas- sified ads. After reading literature from the Vegan Society in England, Dinshah stopped consuming dairy products and refused to wear leather. In 1957, he became a vegan, restricting himself to fruits, veg- etables, salads, legumes, and nuts. Dinshah founded the American Vegan Society in 1960 and served as its president for 40 years. His efforts contributed to the steady growth of veganism throughout North America. Individuals seeking knowledge on veganism were welcome to stay at his home as long as a month to learn the ethics of veganism and ways to maintain a healthy diet. In the mid-1970s, the society purchased an office building in Malaga, New Jersey, and expanded its services. Dinshah rooted the American Vegan Society in the doctrine of AHIMSA , a Sanskrit concept mean- ing no killing, no injury, and no harm, which was central to the work of both Mohandas Karam- chand G ANDHI and J AINISM . Dinshah did not view veganism as a mere dietary choice, but rather as an ethical responsibility to all living creatures. He taught the principles of ahimsa through an ana- gram: (1) abstinence from animal products; (2) harmlessness with reverence for life; (3) integrity of thought and deed; (4) mastery over oneself; (5) service to humanity, nature, and creation; (6) advancement of understanding and truth. Dinshah was an accomplished orator and writer. He gave lectures and talks around the world on veganism and the mistreatment of animals. In 1975 he helped organize the World Vegetarian Congress at the University of Maine. He authored and self-published several books and was also chief editor of the American Vegan Society’s periodical Ahimsa, which is now called American Vegan. He died on June 8, 2000.

Divali (Dipavali) Divali may be the most popular Indian festival. Unlike some other festivals, such as R AM L ILA , it Divali 135 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 135 12/14/06 9:28:35 AM"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"is celebrated in all parts of India. It starts on the 14th day of the lunar month of Ashvayuja and extends to the second day of the lunar month of Kartikka. It usually falls around the end of Octo- ber and the beginning of November. The origin of the festival of Divali cannot be traced, but it is known to be at least 1,000 years old. As a “festival of lights” it resembles many other festivals in the world with quite ancient roots. On the first day of the festival one makes an offering to the god of death, Y AMA , after pray- ing for expiation of sins. One lights a lamp to “the underworld” where Yama lives. After feasting, rows of lamps are lighted in the evening on ledges and external places of houses. Temples and public places are also illuminated the same way. On the second day L AKSHMI , the goddess of wealth, is worshipped; in Bengal K ALI is worshipped instead. Lights are also lit on this day, when late at night a huge racket is created with drums and such to drive away Alakshmi, Lakshmi’s (or Kali’s) inaus- picious counterpart. In fact, by tradition every day of Divali is filled with the sounds of firecrackers. The third day is devoted to the unusual wor- ship of a demon, B ALI , the demon king who was vanquished by V ISHNU . One is to stay awake the whole night. On the day of Bali it is common for people to gamble, since many believe that this was the day that P ARVATI defeated her husband, S HIVA , in a game of dice. On this third day cows and bulls are also worshipped, as is a pile of food that rep- resents the hill Govardhana, which K RISHNA lifted to protect his people from storm. People also pass under a rope of grass tied to a pole and tree in order to assure safe journeys. The final day is a brother and sister day, when brothers are invited to the homes of their sisters for feasting.

Draupadi Draupadi is the joint wife of the five P ANDAVA brothers in the Indian epic M AHABHARATA . Her name derives from her father, King Drupada, of the Panchalas. Draupadi and her brother, Dhristhadymna, were born from the sacrificial fire in the altar of the house of Drupada. She was a partial incarna- tion of the goddess S RI , who is associated with kingship and kingly success. As she was supremely attractive and desirable her father decided to hold a “self-choice” festival, where, after a competi- tion of her kingly, princely, and other suitors, she would be able to choose her husband. In the competition, whoever among the suitors could hit a revolving, fish-shaped object suspended from a tall pole would receive Draupadi in marriage. K RISHNA and B ALARAMA , the two AVATARS of V ISHNU , participated in the contest, but it was the Pandava A RJUNA who successfully hit the target and was garlanded by Draupadi. The five Panda- vas, accustomed to sharing travails and rewards, argued on the way home as to who should receive this lovely woman as his wife. When they arrived at home and announced that they had obtained a prize, their mother, distracted with another task, absentmindedly told them that they should share it as brothers. Because holding to one’s word was more important than anything in those times, the mother, K UNTI , could not release them from her command; nor could they refuse a mother’s direct requirement. Therefore, Draupadi became the wife for all five. Henceforth, she stayed two days with each husband in turn. Draupadi figures prominently in the famous “dice scene” in the M AHABHARATA . Y UDHISHTHIRA , trying to win his kingdom back from his evil cousins the K AURAVAS , wagers everything he owns—and loses. Finally he offers his wife, Draupadi, as a wager. He loses her as well. Drau- padi, in menstruation, was rudely taken from her quarters into public view by the Kauravas. Drau- padi argues that since Yudhishthira has already lost himself in the dice game and has become a K 136 Draupadi 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 136 12/14/06 9:28:35 AM"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"slave, he can no longer be considered in posses- sion of her and his wager was invalid. Angered at this “arrogance,” D URYODHANA , eldest of Kaura- vas, commands Duhshana, one of the Kauravas, to disrobe Draupadi in order to humiliate her. As Duhshasana grasps her sari, Draupadi prays to Krishna for protection. Krishna answers her prayers and her sari becomes an endless garment that cannot be removed. The disrobing of Draupadi is one of the most popular and reenacted parts of the Mahabharata. For this act Draupadi swears that she will not adorn her hair again until the blood of Duryod- hana and Duhshasana flows in defeat on the battlefield. Draupadi accompanies her husbands through their exiles and experiences everything along with them. In the great war all five of her sons die, but she does eventually see the day when she can adorn her hair once again. In regional mythology Draupadi is often con- sidered the Great Goddess. This tradition is partic- ularly well developed in the Tamil country, where she takes on not only the role of the goddess Sri, but also exhibits the characteristics of K ALI and is celebrated in many shrines, rituals, and dramas. The dramas are often accompanied by possession rituals and walking on burning coals. Further reading: J. A. B. van Buitenen, trans. The Mahabharata, Vol. 1, The Book of the Beginnings.

Dravidian The adjective Dravidian defines a family of Indian languages that differs from the other families, mainly the Indo-Aryan, Munda, and Tibeto-Bur- man. In the 19th and 20th centuries people speak- ing these languages in South India began to see themselves as possessing a separate culture, and a movement to create a separate Dravidian state, which was particularly strong between the 1930s and the 1970s, emerged. The term itself is from the Sanskrit terms dramila, dramida, and dravida, referring in dif- ferent contexts to peoples of the south of India, the South Indian region, and Tamil, one of the major Dravidian languages. The term is also sometimes used to refer to the people who speak the Dravidian languages; this usage is somewhat misleading in that it implies a racial designa- tion such as A RYAN , while in fact there are many ethnicities represented by speakers of Dravidian languages. In the ongoing debate regarding the cultural nature of the ancient Indus Valley civili- zation, some believe its script reflects a Dravidian language and connect the Indus Valley peoples to contemporary Dravidian speakers. Others believe the language of the script is Indo-Aryan. There are 26 Dravidian languages, spoken by some 250 million people. All but two of them are spoken in India; Brahui is spoken on the Afghan- Pakistani border in Baluchistan, and Kurux is spoken in Nepal. They are also spoken by old diasporic communities in Sri Lanka and Malay- sia, and in newer D IASPORA countries around the world. The largest Dravidian languages are Tamil and Telegu, each with about 70 million speakers, and Kannada and Malayalam, each spoken by about 40 million people. Other far South Indian dialects include Tulu and Toda, a tribal language. Other tribal Dravidian languages of southern and central India include Gondi, Kulumi, and Kurukh. Great literatures have developed in all of the four major Dravidian languages. Tamil literature, however, has the most impressive corpus of extant ancient literature, dating from the second century B . C . E ., as well as a large corpus of literature dating from the sixth century to the 12th century, when Dravidian 137 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 137 12/14/06 9:28:35 AM"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Telegu and Kannada begin their literary records. Malayalam literature developed later. Scholars of Dravidian linguistics important for reference include M. B. Emeneau and T. Burrow. There are many scholars of Dravidian literatures; George Hart (Tamil), Velcheru Narayana Rao (Telegu), and A. K. Ramanujan (Tamil and Kannada) are important translators and scholars in this area.

Drona Drona (Bucket) is a Brahmin who played an important role in the Mahabharata epic. His unusual name derives from the fact that he was conceived in a bucket from the semen of his father, the RISHI Bharadvaja, who had been excited when the nymph Ghritaci accidentally showed herself to him naked. Drona was a descendant of Angiras, an ancient rishi, and the grandson of B RI - HASPATI , a god. Drona’s GURU was Agnivesha, son of the famous rishi A GASTYA . Drona taught martial techniques and military science to both the P ANDAVAS and the K AURAVAS , but he joined the latter in the great war between the two groups. After their great uncle, B HISHMA ’s , death, he became their commander. This was considered unusual, as he was a Brahmin and not a warrior by birth. In the battle Drona killed Drupada, the father of the Pandavas’ wife, D RAU - PADI . In turn he was killed by Drishtadyumna, Drupada’s son and brother to Draupadi. Further reading: J. A.

Duce was an American proponent and leader of Sufism. She spread the universalist teachings of M EHER B ABA . Ivy Duce was born Ivy Judd and raised in the Episcopal Church. She served in the American Red Cross during World War I and after the war mar- ried and became a mother. During the 1930s she became interested in astrology. Around 1940, she became fascinated with the chart of Rabia Martin (aka Ada Ginsberg, 1871–1947) and decided to meet her. It turned out that Martin was the succes- sor in America of the Indian Sufi teacher Hazrat Inayat Khan (1882–1927), who had offered an Islamic mysticism largely devoid of the peculiari- ties of Islamic thought. Duce became a follower of Martin’s Sufi movement and eventually succeeded her as the leader in 1947. In 1948, Duce met the Indian teacher M EHER B ABA , of whom she had already developed a positive opinion from conversations with Martin. Over the next several years she adopted his per- spectives, and he worked out a plan to redirect the Sufi movement she headed. Thus in 1952, Duce founded Sufism Reoriented, which was seen as the creation of Meher Baba. From this point on Duce viewed Sufism not as a form of Islam but as what she termed Universal Truth. She considered anyone who had reached God realization a Sufi. Meher Baba named her spiri- tual director or murshida of the organization, identified her as a seventh-plane master, and promised that her successors would be of an equally high status. He also promised that Sufism Reoriented would be a pure channel for God for the next 700 years (until his next incarnation as an AVATA R ). Duce was the only person in the West whom Meher Baba ever appointed as a spiritual teacher. Though head of a relatively small organization, she was widely recognized by the loosely orga- nized movement that grew up around Meher Baba. Duce served for almost three decades.

Her role is to intervene on behalf of the gods to defeat demons who threaten the cosmos. The Devimahatmya, the most famous text to extol Durga’s deeds, shows her intervening on three major occasions on behalf of the gods: against the demons Madhu and Kaitabha, against the demons Shumbha and Nishumbha, and, most famously, against Mahishasura, the buffalo demon. In the first case, Durga fought on behalf of Lord B RAHMA and V ISHNU . The story goes that Madhu and Kaitabha were born from Vishnu’s ear wax. They threatened to kill Lord Brahma. As Vishnu was sleeping at the time, Brahma calls on Durga to come forth out of Vishnu as the goddess of sleep, so that Vishnu can awaken and kill the demons. She does so and Vishnu kills them. In the case of Shumbha and Nishumbha, the two demons performed austerities that com- pelled S HIVA to give them riches and strength that would surpass that of the gods. Thereupon, they began a war against the divinities. Finally, the gods had to perform religious austerities to Durga to obtain her blessing. Hearing of Durga’s charms (though usually ferocious in aspect, she could change her form at will), Shumbha sent his deputies one after another to win her favor. After she easily destroyed the deputies Chanda and Munda she was forced to confront their com- mander, Raktabija, who had the power sprout up from his own blood whenever wounded. The angry Durga then sprouted K ALI from her forehead; Kali went forward and systematically drank up the blood from Raktabija’s wounds until he was defeated. Finally Shumbha himself, along with Nishumbha, stepped forward, and they too were defeated. The D URGA P UJA fall festival celebrates par- ticularly Durga’s defeat of the buffalo-headed demon Mahishasura. The story of this ASURA (antigod) begins when he becomes lord of heaven after defeating all the other gods—he had won The goddess Durga slaying Mahesha, the buffalo demon (calendar print) Durga 139 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 139 12/14/06 9:28:36 AM"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"the boon that he could not be defeated by any male god or demon. When the defeated gods approached Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma for help, the three divinities became so angry that the light of their anger combined, taking the powers of all the gods with it to create the most formidable power ( Mahashakti )—the goddess Durga. Durga will be able to defeat the demon because she is female. Armed by the gods she begins a horrific battle with the buffalo-headed demon and eventually defeats him by driving her spear through him—a scene often depicted in her ico- nography. She is always represented in superior position over the demon, sometimes putting her foot on his neck. Durga is the goddess of the universe, oversee- ing every realm. Durga’s primary characteristics are that she dwells in inaccessible places and relishes meat, blood, and intoxicating drink. Durga is probably a form of the goddess from the tribal, non-Aryan realm of India, who came to be respected and adopted as the great goddess in the Brahminical tradition. Perhaps her early character is revealed in her association with the growth of plants and fertility. The Durga Puja is held from the first through the ninth days of the first half of the month of Ashvin (September and October), as part of the N AVARATRI ceremonies in most parts of India. A bundle of nine plants is worshipped as represen- tative of the goddess. The festival celebrates her battle against Mahishasura and her role as killer of that buffalo-headed demon. She is also cast as a married daughter, returning during the festival time from her home far away. She is particularly feted as the wife of Shiva and may be seen by some as an aspect of P ARVATI . In the texts, as opposed to popular and local mythologies, her role as wife is not important. Durga is said to have been asleep for several months when she is awakened to be worshipped at Durga Puja. The ritual of the festival includes reci- tation of parts of the Devimahatmya, an important goddess text. Further reading: Robert T.

In the story of the churning of the M ILK O CEAN , told in the PURANAS , Durvasas offers a beautiful gar- land to A I R AVATA , I NDRA ’s white elephant. The elephant picks up the garland with its trunk and throws it on the ground. Indra tries to placate the furious sage but he will not relent, saying that he is known for his implacability and lack of forgiveness. He curses the gods to have ill fortune. It is a result of this ill fortune that they must eventually stir the Milk Ocean to obtain good results. Another story, from the last chapter of the R AMAYANA , pits Durvasas against Lakshmana. The latter is guarding the entranceway to his palace while his brother, R AMA , talks with the god of death, Y AMA . Yama has demanded that the meeting remain uninterrupted and has made Rama swear that he would kill anyone who inter- rupts them. Unfortunately, the perpetually angry Durvasas arrives at the entranceway and insists that he receive hospitality. Lakshmana asks for his patience but he has none. Durvasa threatens to curse all the kingdom, including Rama and Bharata, if he is not received. Lakshmana there- fore tells Rama of Durvasa’s arrival, knowing that Rama will be obliged to kill him. In the end Rama merely exiles Lakshmana, claiming that banish- ment and death are the same to noble men. Numerous tales are told in the mythology about the angry Durvasas, but one story in the K 140 Durga Puja 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 140 12/14/06 9:28:36 AM"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Mahabharata credits him with giving Kunti a boon for treating him as a proper guest—she will have children by five gods.

Duryodhana Duryodhana was the eldest of the 100 K AURAVAS , the evil sons of Dhritarashtra in the M AHAB - HARATA story. He was the chief conspirator among the Kauravas against their cousins the P ANDA - VA S , whose kingdom they tried to seize. He was a fierce fighter, as his Sanskrit name implies: duryodhana means “tough in battle.” He had a particular rivalry with B HIMA , physically the strongest of the Pandavas. When Duryodhana’s cousin Y UDHISHTHIRA was designated as heir to the throne, he persuaded his father to banish the Pandavas to a city where he had them placed in a house made of wax, where he planned to burn them to death. They escaped and went into hiding for some time. Later he challenged the Pandavas to a dice game in which he had the game fixed. After Yudhishthira lost everything in this game the Pandavas’ wife, D RAU - PADI , was publicly humiliated. The dice game was replayed and the Pandavas lost again and went into exile for 13 years. After they returned from exile, Duryodhana refused to split the kingdom with them and the great Mahabharata war began. Duryodhana was slain by his lifetime rival Bhima, and the Kauravas were defeated. Further reading: Manorama Bhavanagara, Duryod- hana (Delhi: Anila Prakashan, 2000); J. A.

Abrahamic traditions in their normative form— Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—would be seen as dvaita or dualistic because they believe that the human soul is a separate entity and reality from God. Normative Hinduism tends toward forms of ADVAITA , non-dualism, the opposite of dvaita. But there are some Indian systems that are truly dvaita in nature. One form of V EDANTA , championed by M ADHVA , a 12th-century sage, is authentically dvaita. Also, the South Indian tradition of Shaiva Siddhanta can be classified as dvaita. Further reading: S. N.

Dvapara Yuga In the Indian tradition the Y UGAS , or ages, refer to throws in an ancient dice game. Dvapara is named after the throw “two” ( dvi ), which is the third best throw or the second worst throw. Dvapara Yuga is 864,000 years in duration. In Dvapara the deterio- ration in human and worldly life continues. Pas- sion, strife, greed, and war develop, and truth is no longer adhered to in the same way. In Dvapara Yuga, the once-unified V EDA was divided into four parts by V YA S A . Because differences of opinion had arisen, the different Vedas (R IG , S AMA , Y AJUR , A THARVA ) developed distinctions. Death arose among humankind, as well as disgust with exis- tence, calamity, suffering, and disease. In dvapara a notion of “wisdom” became necessary as a result of the perception of the faults that now existed.

K RISHNA is said to have fled here to escape from the evil Mathura king Kamsa, who had tried so often to kill him, and the city is con- sidered the capital of Krishna’s kingdom. Dvaraka is on the sea in Saurashtra, a region of Gujarat. Krishna’s birthday, the H OLI festival, and D IVALI are three special festival days at Dvaraka.

For four decades he taught nonsectarian techniques of meditation through courses, lectures, and more than two dozen books. Eknath Easwaran was born on December 17, 1910, into an ancient matrilineal family in Kerala, India. He grew up under the guidance of his grandmother, whom he was later to honor as his spiritual teacher. From her he learned the tradi- tional wisdom of India’s ancient scriptures. When he was a boy, she sent him to the temple priest to learn S ANSKRIT from one of the purest traditions in India. Easwaran fell in love with English literature in high school. At 16 he left home to attend a Catholic college. Here he excelled in debate and read columns by Mohandas Karamchand G AN - DHI (1869–1948) in Young India. Easwaran spent his 20s as a journalist in Secunderabad, Andhra Pradesh, where he soon became recognized as a public speaker.

Easwaran earned graduate degrees in law and English from Nagpur University. In 1946 he began teaching at Amravati in Maharashtra. With articles appearing in the Times of India and the Illustrated Weekly of India, his reputation spread. He was soon promoted to full professor at Nagpur Univer- sity and won acclaim as a writer and lecturer. In February 1948, when his grandmother died, Easwaran recalled, “All my success had turned to ashes.” Meditating on passages from Bhagavad Gita gave him peace. He developed a regular med- itation practice and created a method to share his experience. He developed an Eight Point Program of meditation for solving physical and emotional problems, releasing deeper resources, and pursu- ing life’s highest goal, SELF - REALIZATION . Easwaran immigrated to America in 1959 through the Fulbright exchange program. Attend- ing the University of California at Berkeley, he lec- tured on India’s spiritual heritage and soon attracted a dedicated group of people who studied his teach- ings. Among them was his future wife, Christine, who helped him establish the Blue Mountain Cen- ter of Meditation, now in Petaluma, California. In January 1968, at Berkeley, he inaugurated a course on meditation, believed to be the first of its kind offered at any major university in the United States. In 1970 the Blue Mountain Center of Medi- tation moved to Marin County and Easwaran trans- ferred his teachings there. Nilgiri Press, a small publisher operating out of Oakland, began printing many publications including the Bhagavad Gita for Daily Living (1975), Laurel’s Kitchen (1976), and his best-selling Meditation (1978), which sold over 200,000 copies. Easwaran’s writings include 26 books about meditation and the classics of world mysticism, which have been translated into 26 lan- guages, with over 1 million copies in print. Until the end of his life, despite chronic ail- ments, Easwaran continued to hold regular retreats and deliver talks, drawing students from around the world. He taught nonviolence, concern for endangered species, and meditation. He died on October 26, 1999. The Blue Mountain Center of Meditation preserves Easwaran’s teachings through the lead- ership of Christine Easwaran. A nonprofit and nonsectarian organization, the center has a mis- sion to share Easwaran’s teachings through a quarterly journal, The Blue Mountain, Nigiri Press books, and video and audio products.

Eckankar (est. 1965) Eckankar or ECK, the “Religion of the Light and Sound of God,” was founded in 1965 by former journalist Paul Twitchell (c. 1909–70). During the 1950s Twitchell became a student of numerous esoteric and spiritual movements. He studied L. Ron Hubbard’s Scientology for a time before find- ing a place in Swami Premananda’s Self Realiza- tion Church of Absolute Monism. Later, Twitchell was initiated into Ruhani Satsang (fellowship of true seekers) in the R ADHASOAMI movement, and received formal training from its founder, Sant Mat Master Kirpal Singh. Eventually he departed from Radhasoami after a disagreement and established his own teaching. He moved to San Francisco and began lecturing, writing, and practicing a form of surat shabda yoga, which involves contact with inner light and sound. In 1956 Twitchell revealed that he had experi- enced “God-realization” after being trained by the Order of the Vairagi Masters, spiritual teachers. According to Twitchell, these beings have secretly K 144 Eckankar 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 144 12/14/06 9:28:37 AM"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"imparted the teachings of ECK to individuals throughout history. Twitchell believed that he was entrusted by these masters to disseminate ECK teachings to the modern world. In 1965 he proclaimed himself as the Living ECK Master and the 971st Mahanta. He founded Eckankar later that year and established its headquarters in Las Vegas, Nevada. Twitchell spent the next few years working with his wife, Gail, to build a following for the movement. He also wrote several books on the teachings of Eckankar. In 1969 Twitchell published Eckankar: The Key to Secret Worlds. During the same period Brad Steiger wrote a biography on Twitchell entitled In My Soul I Am Free. Both books increased the popularity and notoriety of the movement. Eckankar is an eclectic religious movement. The Light and Sound of God has been described as the science of soul travel, in which the soul departs from the body in an ascent to invisible worlds. ECK beliefs and practices resemble the teachings of Radhasoami as well as the Western occult teachings of Rosicrucians. The other fun- damental teachings of ECK appear to be similar to the teachings of K IRPAL S INGH (1894–1974), teacher in the S ANT M AT tradition. It was revealed after his death that Twitchell may have plagiarized teachings from Julian P. John- son, a disciple of the Radhasomai Satsang. Eckan- kar maintains in response that ECK teachings have permeated various teachings throughout history, and that Twitchell has made them more accessible for the modern world. Twitchell also used different terminology than Sant Mat. Eckankar teaches that God is the source of all being flowing, from the transcendent downward to the material world. The Light and Sound of God (ECK) is the energy cur- rent from which life flows and can be understood as the Holy Spirit in Christian terms. The numer- ous practices offered by ECK masters aim to guide individuals to the realization of God and their place as coworkers with God. A primary means of attaining realization is through the chanting of HU, an ECK name for God. After Twitchell’s death in 1971, Gail Twitchell announced Darwin Gross as successor and the 972nd Living ECK Master. The choice of Gross was controversial. He was a recent inductee of the movement and his eventual marriage to Gail Twitchell fueled suspicion. Despite the loss of sev- eral devotees (known as chelas ), ECK continued to grow. Headquarters were moved to Menlo Park, California. Gross relinquished his position as the Living ECK Master in 1981 and named Harold Klemp as the 973rd Mahanta. Gross’s status of ECK master was revoked in 1984, and he is no longer affiliated with Eckankar. Lengthy litigation over the use of the name Eckankar ensued between Gross and the organization, and Eckankar eventually prevailed. Harold Klemp was born in 1942 in Wisconsin and raised on a small family farm. He had a reli- gious upbringing at a Milwaukee boarding school and later attended college, where he studied reli- gion. After enlisting in the U.S. Air Force he was assigned to a military installation in Japan. It was here that he first encountered Eckankar. Under Klemp’s direction, Eckankar headquarters were moved to its present location in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In 1990, he established the Temple of ECK, the spiritual center of the movement. Klemp has authored over 40 books and routinely attends Eckankar conferences and seminars. Since his induction as Living ECK Master, Klemp has redirected the emphasis of ECK teachings toward divine love and service to others in daily life. Eckankar maintains 164 centers in the United States and over 360 worldwide. The organization includes a publishing company called Illuminated Way Press, located in Crystal, Minnesota. Publica- tions include books by Twitchell, Klemp, and other ECKists. An annual ECKANKAR Journal is also published. Eckankar has the status of a nonprofit religious organization and church with members in 130 countries. Its mission as an educational orga- nization is to promote the knowledge of soul and God realization. The organization offers courses in dream interpretation, soul travel, and life service.

Hindu reli- gious stories, imagery, and symbolism are used to support the view that the universe is divine in all of its aspects and nature is sacred in its essence. Aspects of nature including mountains, seas, riv- ers, trees, flowers, animals, and even the elements of soil, water, and air have often been personified in Hindu myth as divine beings to be worshipped and cared for. Various forms of vegetarianism have been practiced widely among different Hindu groups for centuries. The deep respect for all forms of life in the beliefs and practices of Hinduism pro- vides a natural alignment of Hindus with any con- certed effort against environmental degradation. In India, the traditional home of Hinduism, over 950 nongovernmental organizations work for environmental causes that address ecological problems from rural deforestation to urban pol- lution. As record rates of industrialization and urbanization press upon the limited resources of India, groups have mobilized to find ecologi- cally sound practices in residential settlements, farming, mining, fishing, and water management. Threats to India’s land, rivers, and seas, and air and the displacement of millions of people through construction of dams and mines are heightened by population expansion and the consumerism of a burgeoning middle class. Traditionally India relied upon ecologically sound management practices in its rural areas and included a religiously based cultural order that respected the sacredness of all life. Mohandas Karamchand G ANDHI ’s activities in the movement for Indian independence gave political legitimacy to the religious and ecological sensibilities of India, particularly Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. His dedication to the values of nonviolence ( AHIMSA ), holding to truth ( S ATYAGRAHA ), personal asceti- cism, minimal consumption, self-reliance, simplic- ity, sustainability, and community-based economics was based on his interpretation of Hindu values. However, since the days of Gandhi, the political leadership of the country has stressed seculariza- tion and growth so that India has continued to industrialize, urbanize, and modernize at a rapid rate. Loss of arable land, deforestation, water pol- lution, unplanned urbanization, dam construction, and pesticide pollution are critical problems being addressed by various ecological movements that draw on the Hindu devotion to life and the sacred. Two locally based movements in India dem- onstrate the application of Hindu precepts to eco- nomic and environmental challenges: the Bishnois and the Chipko movement. The Bishnois are a small Rajasthani community who view environ- mental conservation as a religious duty. Their leader, Guru Maharaj Jambaji (b. 1451 C . E .), wit- nessed a severe drought and the cutting of trees as food for animals, which resulted in the desolation of both animals and plants. He constructed a pro- gram that prohibited the cutting of any tree and the killing of any animal. The ethic of the guru endured over centuries and the area became lush with vegetation. In the 18th century, the king of Jodhpur sent loggers to cut down the Bishnois’ trees for construction of a new palace. The villag- ers protested, and, when their protests were not heeded, they protected the trees by surrounding the trees with their bodies. Upon hearing of the villagers’ dedication, the king granted them state protection and their protection of trees and ani- mals persists today. The Bishnois’ tactic of encir- cling trees to protect them inspired the Chipko movement of the 20th century.

The villagers encircles the trees, as had the Bishnois before them, and provided a human shield against deforestation. The strategy was repeated in several villages in the Himalayas, creating the Chipko movement, which exists today as a grassroots ecodevelopment movement. Both the Bishnoi and the Chipko movements demonstrate how environmental conservation is aligned with Hindu religion and culture. Hindu scriptures contain implicit environmental ethics that encourage respect for and stewardship of a sacred universe. The central concepts of DHARMA (right conduct) and KARMA (action in the world) have been used to support initiatives for environ- mental protection. Ecological writers call for a partnership between Hindu religious leaders and ecological activists to join the insight and devotion of traditional Hindu thought in collaboration with scientific strategies of sustainable development. A series of 10 conferences on the world’s reli- gions and ecology was held at the Harvard Divinity School Center for the Study of World Religions from 1996 to 1998. Subsequently, the Forum on Religion and Ecology and its Web site were announced by the founders, Mary Evelyn Tucker and John Grim, during a report to the United Nations and subsequent press conference in 1998. In both the initial conferences and the continuing activities of the forum, scholars and practitioners promote a dialogue on the global environmental crisis and efforts to create public policy in alignment with the teachings of the world’s religions. The relationship of Hinduism and ecology has become one focus of the Forum on Religion and Ecology. Scholars and religious leaders have made pre- sentations about Asian religious traditions and ecology at the Parliament of World Religions. The Green Yoga Association, founded by Laura Cornell in Oakland, California, in 2004, seeks to promote an ecological ethic in its practice of traditional yogic techniques and to interpret yogic texts, such as P ATANJALI ’ S Y OGA S UTRAS , in terms of environmental ethics.

It is observed as a fast day by many Hindus and is an obligatory day of fasting for Vaishnavites, worshippers of V ISHNU , as it is associated with his worship. When one observes ekadashi as a result of a vow, one must stay awake that night and worship Vishnu (as is done with S HIVA during M AHASHIVARATRI ), as well as fast. The ekadashi in the bright half of the month of Margashirsha (November–December) is known as “heaven ekadashi, ” in reference to the heavenly abode of Vishnu. It is a very important temple day, as those who go through the temple doors on this day are believed to go to heaven. Further reading: Abbe J. A. Dubois, Hindu Manners, Customs and Ceremonies.

The four are artha (prosperity, worldly well-being), kama (pleasure, erotic satisfaction), DHARMA (right conduct, adherence to social law), and moksha (liberation from the rounds of birth and rebirth). They offer a balanced approach to the world. Though Indian tradition is known to focus upon transcendence and the search beyond the world, V EDIC tradition always emphasized family, prosperity, pleasure, and well-being as worthy goals, as long as they are not pursued or cultivated in the extreme.

Europe Excluding Great Britain and the Netherlands, Europe has had little immigration from India and today has a small Hindu population. Great Britain and the Netherlands had colonies into which South Asian laborers migrated. Many Hindus from Guyana ( see C ARIBBEAN REGION ) and Kenya ( see A FRICA ) left the struggling economies and racial persecution of those countries to enter Great Britain. Over 65,000 South Asians were exiled from Uganda under the directive of Idi Amin in the 1970s and nearly all fled to Britain. In Britain today, Hinduism flourishes in a variety of practices, and many temples exist ( see U NITED K INGDOM ). Because these Hindus remain close to their native land through Commonwealth ties, they have imported influential political and religious movements from India. Most neo-Hindu movements as well as the Vishwa Hindu Parishad are active in Great Britain. The Netherlands also has a sizable South Asian community, populated largely by Hindus who fled economic and political hardship in Suri- name. As in Great Britain, they remain in contact with Hindu movements in India and reflect the traditional practices as well as the conflicts repre- sented in contemporary Indian Hinduism. Eastern Europe remains the main residence for the Gypsies or Romany, who were originally Hin- dus from the Punjab and Afghanistan. The lan- guage and customs of the Gypsy ethnicity retain vestiges of a Hindu past, even though the Gypsy population is not considered a Hindu movement.

The most common Vaishnavite ( see V AISH - NAVISM ) forehead marking is a large U-shaped mark with a vertical dot or line placed precisely in its center, not touching the bottom of the U. Variations include a more square U, and different placement of the center vertical line (which is sometimes made of a series of dots). Some Vaish- navite markings show only two parallel, vertical lines with or without a center dot, or three parallel vertical lines, sometimes with a dot placed on the middle line, or just above or below it. Shaivite ( see S HAIVISM ) facial markings are most commonly three, equidistant, parallel lines on the forehead in varying patterns. A dot or line of red saffron or ash might be placed on the forehead by anyone after a PUJA to mark an enhanced devotional state, or by a GURU or teacher at all times as a sign of devo- tion. In either case, the dot represents the open- ing of the third eye, which indicates heightened consciousness. Women in India often wear a dot on the fore- head, sometimes as a conventional decoration, but sometimes as protection from the evil eye. It might also be interpreted as a recognition of the existence of the third eye of consciousness. Some women in North India put a mark of red saffron on the part of the hair to signify that they are married.

In 1969, the holy man took up residence in San Francisco. One year later, the foundation was established there and centers began to be created around the world. The purpose of the foundation is to break through religious, national, and racial boundaries to create a harmonious relationship of nations. The foundation reveres Shiva as the creator of all things, the destroyer of ignorance, and the force that moves each person to strive for perfection. The foundation, still headquartered in San Francisco, has over 5,000 members in the United States. In 1997 it claimed 25,000 members worldwide. It has 21 centers in 10 countries, including India, England, France, the Neth- erlands, and Australia. Audio CDs of Sunday meetings and other events are sold through the foundation archives. funeral rites Indian anyeshti (funeral rites or final sacraments) are formally outlined in the Dharmashastra law books and other texts, including a special sec- tion of Garuda Purana. Actual practice, however, frequently diverges from the textual tradition. There are rituals to be performed before death, those that relate to the disposition of the body, those that take place after death to prevent the soul from taking on the form of a ghost, and those done later when the person is honored as an ancestor. A person will almost always be cre- mated at death, unless he or she is an infant or a mendicant, in which case the body is most often buried. Part of the postdeath ritual involves placing the body on a bier, in either a sitting or a lying position, to be carried to the cremation ground by relatives or taken in a bullock cart or other conveyance. At least part of this trip will be accompanied by ritual singing. The body is then lain on the funeral wood, always facing southward, as the south is the direction of death. The eldest son is the lay officiant at the cremation. After cir- cumambulating the body, he pours oblations of water on it, cracks the skull to release the soul, and lights the funeral pyre. The funeral party will most often wait until the body is almost com- pletely consumed. Once the cremation is complete the funeral party returns home to do expiations, using man- tras and other rituals, in order to ward off “death pollution” or the effects of being in proximity to a corpse. B RAHMINS in particular observe a period of 10 days when no one in the family is allowed to leave the house after a death. After a day or two the eldest son will return to the burning grounds to retrieve the ashes and bones. The ashes are usually put into an urn and either buried or poured into a sacred river such as the Ganges or Cauvery, thus guaranteeing liberation or heaven for the deceased. Often an 11-day ritual is performed to provide a spiritual body for the deceased, in order to prevent the deceased from becoming a ghost and wandering homeless for eternity. Later, the shraddha or ancestor rites are performed yearly to sustain the person in the other world. Brahminical mendicants or SADHUS are buried in a special rite. The body is placed in a deep hole in yogic, sitting position. It is then covered in salt from bottom to chin, and the whole is covered with earth. Saints in India are usually buried in tombs. Often the tomb’s covering protrudes above ground so that the constituted SAMADHI or grave site becomes a place of holy pilgrimage.

K UBERA , the god of wealth, is considered the lord of the gandharvas. Etymologists have traced the word gandharva to gandha, or “scent.” Perhaps this is why the gandharvas are sometimes said to have emerged from the creator god’s nose. Other sources say their father is the rishi Kashyapa and their mothers are the daughters of another rishi, D AKSHA . Gandharvas are all said to have sweet voices, and they are seen as radiant, graceful, and beautiful. They are known to sing on various mountains including M ERU , the central mountain of the earthly portion of the cosmos, but they are also heard in the sky and woods. They usually live in a sky world. The kinnaras, another class of beings who are sometimes considered the best of musicians, are also classified as gandharvas. The gandharvas are known to Buddhist and Jain tradi- tions (see J AINISM ) as well as to Hinduism. Further reading: Cornelia Dimmitt and J. A.

Gandhi, Mohandas Karamchand (Mahatma) (1869–1948) leader of the Indian independence struggle Mahatma Gandhi was the greatest political leader in 20th-century India. He led the Indian indepen- dence movement to success and fought for reli- gious and social reforms as well as restoration of preindustrial cultural traditions. His philosophy of nonviolent political action has been considered an inspiration for various opposition movements around the world. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in the village of Porbandar in Gujarat, into a Hindu merchant family. As a young man of 13, he was married, as was the custom, to Kasturba Makharji, who was then 12 years of age. Their first son, however, was not born until 1888. He and Kasturba had three more sons.

Since his father had a high position in government, and wanted the same for his son, Mohandas was persuaded to study law in England. In 1889 at the age of 19 Mohandas entered University College at the University of London. Before he left he promised his mother to observe the strict precepts of his family’s V AISHNAVISM , which forbade consumption of meat and alcohol. Once in England he made a study of vegetarian- ism to justify his vow intellectually and joined the Vegetarian Society, where he met various Theosophists interested in Buddhist and Hindu scriptures. It was through them that he first read the B HAGAVAD G ITA , which later became his moral guidebook. Ironically, his first study of it was in English translation. He also became inter- ested in other religions at this time, particularly Christianity. After admission to the British bar, Mohan- das returned to India to set up a law practice in Bombay (Mumbai). He was not able to establish a practice, and after brief stints in various jobs, he took a one-year contract to work for an Indian firm in South Africa. Until this point he was not apparently interested in politics, but the treatment Mohandas Karamchand “Mahatma” Gandhi (1869–1948), leader in the Indian independence movement, is known for his nonviolent tactics and dedication to truth.

Gandhi was forced off a train to Pretoria after he refused to leave a first-class berth to accommo- date a white passenger. Another time he was forced to travel on the footboard of a stagecoach to accom- modate a white passenger. He decided to remain in South Africa, just at this time the Natal legislature was taking up a bill to deny the vote to Indians. Gandhi was asked by the Indian community to lead the opposition to this bill. He failed to stop the measure, but he did draw attention to the grievances of Indians in South Africa. In 1894 he formed the Natal Indian Congress to fight for the rights of Indians. This organization became a great force in South African politics. In 1896 Gan- dhi went back to India to take his wife and chil- dren to Africa with him. In 1897 in South Africa he was attacked and nearly lynched by a white mob, but by then he had abandoned his legalistic views in favor of a stricter ethical approach, and he refused to press charges against the men who attacked him. At the beginning of the South African War (the Boer War), Gandhi thought that Indians must support the war effort in order to legiti- mize their claims to full citizenship. He helped organize a volunteer ambulance corps of 300 free Indians and 800 indentured laborers. At the end of the war, however, conditions for Indians did not improve. In 1906 the Transvaal government passed a new act compelling the colony’s Indian population to register. In Johannesburg that year Gandhi held a mass protest. For the first time he articulated his philosophy of satyagraha or “Truth Force,” asking his fellow Indians to defy the new law nonviolently. In seven years of difficult strug- gle, Gandhi was imprisoned several times, and many other Indians were jailed, shot, or beaten for refusing to register. Finally, however, the gov- ernment was forced to negotiate a compromise with Gandhi because of the negative publicity the campaign had generated. During his years in South Africa, from 1893 until 1914, Gandhi continued to study the Bhaga- vad Gita. He was also influenced by Leo Tolstoy, who himself pursued an interest in Indian phi- losophy. Gandhi corresponded with Tolstoy for two years. Gandhi was also influenced greatly by Henry David Thoreau’s essay on civil disobedi- ence. In 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, Gandhi returned to India to begin a new phase in his life and imbue new vigor in the Indian inde- pendence struggle. Gandhi initially supported the British war effort in World War I and the recruitment of Indi- ans into the British army. However, when the Row- latt Act of 1919, which allowed the government to imprison Indians without trial was passed, Gan- dhi launched a new call for satyagraha, nonviolent disobedience, his first such effort on Indian soil. The government response to this disobedience was violent, resulting in the Amritsar Massacre of Indians by the British army. The deaths shocked Gandhi and forced him to halt the agitation, but he had succeeded in organizing Indians to stand up against the British rulers. In 1920, Gandhi was elected president of the All-India Home Rule League; the following year he became head of the Indian National Con- gress. Under his leadership congress became more militant, adopting the goal of self-rule in its new constitution. Gandhi helped transform congress from an elite organization to one with mass mem- bership and mass appeal. He began to develop a policy of boycotting all foreign-made goods, especially British goods, as a way both to pressure the government and to build Indian economic self-reliance. An enduring symbol of this policy was Gan- dhi’s promotion of home-spun cloth in place of foreign-made fabric. The spinning wheel, which Gandhi began to use to spin thread for cloth for all his own clothing, became the symbol of the Indian independence movement. The boycott that Gandhi had begun was expanded to British educational facilities, and even to a refusal to pay Gandhi, Mohandas Karamchand 159 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 159 12/14/06 9:28:39 AM"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"taxes. Once again the agitations in 1918 ended with violent reprisals by the British, and Gandhi called off the agitation before he was jailed by the British for six years for sedition. He served two years of this sentence and was released for health reasons in 1924. Gandhi did not play a central role in the inde- pendence movement in the early 1920s. However, he stepped forward again in 1928. The Brit- ish government had appointed a constitutional reform commission with not a single Indian on it. Gandhi presented a resolution at the Calcutta Congress in 1928 asking the British government for dominion status in one year. With no response by the British in the year 1929, Gandhi launched a new nonviolent resistance campaign, this time against the tax on salt. Gandhi’s famous campaign against the salt tax included his 250-mile Dandi March from Ahmed- abad to the seaside village of Dandi, where he sym- bolically made his own salt. This campaign gained huge attention and participation from the Indian populace; 60,000 people were imprisoned during the salt tax protest. The government in response signed the Gandhi-Irwin pact of 1931, agreeing to free all political prisoners in return for suspension of the agitation. Additionally, Gandhi was invited to the Round Table Conference in London, as the only representative of the Indian National Con- gress. The conference failed to yield gains for the movement; it was followed by further repression by the new head of government in India. In 1932 Gandhi began a campaign to improve the lot of India’s untouchables (now called Dalits; see UNTOUCHABILITY ), whom he renamed harijans, “children of God.” In 1933 he fasted for 21 days to protest the Indian government’s treatment of Indians, the first in a series of important political fasts. In 1934 three attempts were made by the British on Gandhi’s life. In 1934 Gandhi, discouraged at the lack of commitment of those in the Indian National Congress to his program of nonviolence as a way of life for the new India, resigned as party leader and left the congress. Jawaharlal Nehru became the new leader. Gandhi disagreed with Nehru but at the same time saw him as preferable to other potential leaders of the movement. At this point Gandhi threw himself totally into efforts to edu- cate rural India, fight against untouchability, and promote the manufacture of homespun clothing and other village-level cottage industries. For five years he lived very humbly in Sevagram, a village in central India. Gandhi was jailed by the British from 1942 to 1944 for this agitation. Gandhi believed in cooperation between the Hindu and Muslim communities in India and maintained many friendships across religious lines. He was adamantly opposed to any parti- tion. Eventually, however, the Indian National Congress acceded to a partition agreement that in 1947 created two states out of British India: India and Pakistan. Gandhi personally was able to quell terrible riots between Muslims and Hindus on the eastern border between India and the new Pakistan, but when he returned to New Delhi to try to calm the communities there on January 30, 1948, he was assassinated by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu radical who opposed Gandhi’s embrace of Muslims. The long journey of the champion of nonviolence was ended with a gunshot. Gandhi’s last words were said to be a call to his chosen deity, “Ram.” In the process of partition, millions had to flee their homes, and perhaps a million or more people were slaughtered in communal riots. Gandhi, critical of all organized religion, also saw the value in every tradition. He once said that he was a Hindu, a Christian, a Muslim, and a Jew. More than religious, though, Gandhi was deeply spiritual and saw the search for truth and nonvio- lence in every aspect of life as the secrets to God. Gandhi was given the name Mahatma, or, “great soul,” by India. He is considered the father of the modern Indian nation. More than that he was a giant on the world stage. India was one of the few countries freed from colonial domination that relied primarily on the K 160 Gandhi, Mohandas Karamchand 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 160 12/14/06 9:28:39 AM"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"path of nonviolence; this was due to the enor- mous power and prestige of the humble, home- spun cloth–clad Mahatma Gandhi.

Ganesha Ganesha, lord of beginnings and remover of obstacles, is probably the most worshipped divin- ity of the Hindu pantheon. With the head of an elephant and a human body that shows a pro- truding belly—the sign of Ganesha’s fondness for sweets—the god is a central figure in the cult of S HIVA , as the elder son of Shiva and P ARVATI . He is also worshipped as a deity on his own, as is shown in Ganesha PURANA . Nearly every Indian PUJA or worship service commences with verses to and adoration of Ganesha. The figure of the sitting Ganesha and his incongruous vehicle, the rat, is found near the entranceway or one of the entranceways of many, many Hindu temples. As is usual in Hindu mythology and lore, there are many and various stories about the events of Ganesha’s life. The most common story of his ori- gin is that he was made by Parvati, who rubbed off material from her skin and formed it into a shape of a person. She set this “child” Ganesha to guard her shower or inner chamber. Shiva, unaware of this, found Ganesha at his post and thinking that he was a lover or intruder he cut off the child’s head. Scolded by an angry Parvati, Shiva hastily rushed off to find a new head for the child and returned with the head of an elephant. In one popular story Parvati declares a race around the universe between the ponderous Gane- sha and his younger brother, Skanda or K ARTTIKEYA . The younger boy takes off on his swift peacock vehicle swift as lightning, leaving the slow Gane- sha with his pitiful rat vehicle far behind. Thinking a moment, Ganesha realizes that his mother and father themselves constitute the entire universe. He simply walks around his mother and father Lord Ganesha, the elephant-headed god, is the son of Lord Shiva and known as remover of obstacles.

Ganesha is also said to have written down the M AHABHARATA epic as quickly as its reciter V YA S A was able to tell it. For this Gane- sha broke off one of his tusks to use as a stylus. In South India Ganesha is known as a bachelor, but in other parts of India he is seen as married. Iconographically Ganesha appears in many poses and forms, but he is most often sitting, accompanied by the rat, with one tusk broken. Most often he is shown with two arms, but he is also depicted with several pairs. In his hands are sweets, his tusk, an axe, a noose, or an elephant goad. After his popularity had been well established in the Brahminical tradition, Ganesha appeared in Jain tradition as well ( see J AINISM ), in which he was seen as a remover of obstacles. Outside India Ganesha is found in Buddhist contexts as a TA N - TRIC deity, with sometimes unbenign characteris- tics. He is found in Southeast Asian art, in Tibet, in China, and even in Japan. The cult of Ganesha is probably quite old, originating in the worship of the elephant, but its actual origin is difficult to determine. The cult is visible in extant sources dating from the fourth century C . E . He is not mentioned at all in earlier texts such as the Mahabharata or the RAMAYANA , in which Shiva and V ISHNU and their emerging cults are developing. Further reading: Robert L.

Gangaji (1942– ) teacher of advaita Vedanta The American-born Gangaji is a popular interna- tional teacher of V EDANTA in the tradition of Sri Harilal P OONJA . Antoinette Robertson Palmer was born on June 11, 1942, in Mississippi and graduated the University of Mississippi. She married Eli Jackson Bear, himself a spiritual teacher, and began a quest for spiritual fulfillment. She moved in 1972 to San Francisco, where she participated in several forms of Buddhist practice. She practiced Japanese Zen Buddhism and South Asian vipassana (insight) MEDITATION and helped manage a Tibetan Buddhist meditation center. She also took the bodhisattva pledge, in which a person vows to help human- ity until all people reach enlightenment. Later she studied acupuncture and became a licensed acupuncturist. Still on a quest to find a deeper level of being, Palmer went with her husband to meet the teacher of enlightenment P OONJAJI in Haridwar on the G ANGES River in northern India. There she found realization of the Self in the presence of her teacher, a fulfillment that he confirmed. He gave her the spiritual name Ganga, for the Hindu god- dess of the Ganges River. Poonjaji asked her to introduce his teachings to the West. As a popular teacher of ADVAITA (non-dualist) Vedanta, Gangaji does not base her teachings on any specific scriptures, but on her own experience of the Self. She holds regular satsangs (teachings) at her center in northern California and appears weekly on public access television. She travels widely and gives retreats in many places around the world. Her foundation’s Prison Program pro- vides books, audiotapes, and videotapes and orga- nizes visits to prisons by volunteers.

Its prominent mention and sacred status are fully established only in the PURANAS , Indian texts of mythology. There the river is said to have descended from heaven, taken down to Earth by the prayers of the sage Bhagiratha to sanctify the ashes of the sons of his progenitor Sagara. The latter had dug out a huge hole look- ing for a lost horse, but the Ganges filled this vast expanse to form the ocean. Descending from Lord V ISHNU ’s toe, the river might have inundated all the Earth, had not S HIVA agreed to let it first flow through his topknot. Shiva has since that time been depicted with the Ganges flowing through his hair. Ganga is considered a goddess, the eldest daughter of H IMAVAT (the Himalayas). Ganga’s husband is Shantanu; their son B HISHMA plays an important role in the M AHABHARATA epic, as great uncle of both the warring factions. Ganga’s water is always pure and purifying, and pilgrims take flasks and casks home for rituals and blessings. It is every Hindu’s wish to have his or her ashes thrown into the Ganges after cremation. It is widely believed that such an act confers heaven or liberation on the dead person. Because of the sacredness of the Ganges and its importance to Hinduism India has made great efforts to try to clean up this very heav- ily polluted waterway. Activist movements have for decades agitated for cleaning up this valuable resource.

Garuda Garuda is both the mount of V ISHNU and the king of birds. He is depicted with the body of a man and the face of an eagle. He is considered the son of the RISHI Kashyapa and his wife, Vinata. Garuda is known to be an enemy of snakes, a natural characteristic of a bird of prey such as the eagle. In his case the enmity is attributed to a rivalry between his mother and her sister Kadru, mother of the serpents. Kadru had taken Vinata captive but agreed to set her free if she would give her the nectar of immortality ( AMRITA ). Garuda was successful in going to heaven and defeating the two snakes who guarded it there. It was this deed that gained him the reward of being Vishnu’s mount. The story did not end at this, however. I NDRA , ruler of heaven, wanted his nectar returned. Finally, he allowed Garuda to feed on snakes, the traditional food of eagles, in exchange for return- ing the nectar of immortality. Sometimes Garuda is iconographically represented holding a pot of ambrosia ( amrita ).

Vedantic philosopher Gaudapada is best known as the guru of Govinda, guru of the famous philosopher S HANKARA . He is the earliest writer in the movement to revive the U PANISHADIC tradition of non-dual ( ADVAITA ) philosophy. His is author of a commentary on the M ANDUKYA Upanishad, called the Mandukya- karika, which consists of four segments or books. This work was commented on in turn by Shan- kara. Notable in the text of Mandukyakarika is the use of Buddhistic terminology. This has been shown to reflect not Buddhist influence on the V EDANTIC tradition, but rather an attempt to pros- elytize the Buddhists. Further reading: T. M. P.

The modern revival of the BHAKTI (devotional) yoga tradition of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486–1534) is generally attributed to the efforts of Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur (born Kedarnath Dutta, 1838–1914). A lifelong follower of the devotion to Lord K RISHNA , he concentrated his last decades on creating various programs to spread the devotion, especially the Nama Hatta program designed to promote the chanting of the holy name. Among his accomplishments, along with his colleague Srila Jagannath das Babaji, was the rediscovery of the birthplace of Sri Chaitanya. Bhaktivinode Thakur’s work was carried for- ward by his son, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur (1874–1937). Bhaktisiddhanta, together with Kuñja Babu and other devotees, founded the Gaudiya Math in the 1930s. He emphasized the personal nature of the godhead, in distinc- tion to the view that had become dominant in eastern India, that the divine was basically impersonal. He also worked to build the preach- ing centers established by his father into full ashrams. Most importantly, he tried to put into effect the desire of his father to send Vaishnavite disciples to the West. The first center of bhakti yoga in England opened in 1933 as the Gaudiya Mission Society of London; on July 20, representatives of the Gaud- iya Math had an official meeting with the king. A second European preaching center was opened in Berlin. Meanwhile, additional centers were being established across India, with a concentration in Bengal and along the route of the G ANGES River to B RINDAVAN . A conscious effort was made to establish centers in the places known to have been visited by Chaitanya. An active publishing pro- gram was developed. Besides its own accomplish- ments, the rise of the Gaudiya Math was seen as a stimulus to other organizations that continued Chaitanya’s teachings. The math has become best known through the Western Mission started by one of his former members, A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (1896–1977), a disciple of Bhaktisiddhanta. The later told Prabhupada in 1936 to prepare himself for a mission in the West. In 1965, already of advanced years, he moved to the United States and began the I NTERNATIONAL S OCIETY FOR K RISHNA C ONSCIOUSNESS (ISKCON). Though independent of the math, ISKCON would become the most effective instrument in carrying out the goals of the math’s founder. In the last decades of the 20th century, in spite of numerous ups and downs, it was still teaching devotion to Krishna in many countries of the world. ISKCON’s success spawned more than 20 new organizations that follow Krishna devotion. In the 1990s, most of these organizations joined with the surviving Gaudiya Math in India to create the World Vaisnava Association, as part of an attempt to coordinate and unify the global mission.

Within ISKCON, one group of conservative thinkers wanted to venerate all teachers in the organization as GURUS . A reform faction led by B. V. Tripurari opposed other ISK- CON gurus’ accepting veneration in the same manner as had been shown Prabhupada. Eventu- ally Tripurari led many of the reform group away from the original organization and this group formed the Gaudiya Vaishnavite Society. Tripurari Swami first met Prabhupada, a saintly holy man, when he visited the United States in September 1965. He became a student of the master and after a short time became a sannyasi, one who renounces the world to live a holy life. Amid the turmoil that follow Prabhupada’s death in 1977, Tripurari remained loyal to his lineage, pointing reformists to honor Bhakti Rakshak Srid- hara Maharaj (1895–1988), Prabhupada’s god- brother (meaning that they had received their initiations from the same guru). While Prabhupada had concentrated on the development of a mission in the United States. Sridhara Maharaj had developed an international following related to the work he had started through the Sri Chaitanya Saraswati Math in West Bengal, India. As knowledge of his work spread, he had built up communities abroad that sup- ported his mission. Several challenges emerged when the Gaudiya Vaishnavite Society became active in missionary efforts. In 1986, the city of San Francisco forbade society members to pass out their literature on the streets. The Gaudiya Society took the case to court and won. In 1988, the organization began to print its periodical The Clarion Call, similar in design and perspective to ISKCON’s main magazine, Back to Godhead. This periodical was able to cross reli- gious boundaries and reach far beyond the follow- ers of the society. It especially addressed a variety of issues important to the New Age community, such as human and animal rights, reincarnation, holistic health ideas, vegetarianism, and spirituality. The Gaudiya Vaishnavite Society remains in harmony with the religious beliefs and principles initially articulated by ISKCON. The major issue originally confronting ISKCON was resolved as its members spiritually realigned to Sridhara Maharaj as their leader. There was never any problem with remaining loyal to the spiritual ideal promoted by ISKCON. Society members, however, now trace their lineage from Sridhara Maharaj and not Prabhupada. The Gaudiya Vaishnavite Society teaches a form of BHAKTI (devotional) yoga that encourages mem- bers to engage in temple worship, in contrast with other forms of Hinduism that focus on worshipping at a home altar. Precepts include belief in a theistic (personal) deity. The society’s views thus differ from the traditional perspective of ADVAITA (non-dualist) V EDANTA , which supports a monist perspective in which the ultimate divine is conceived in imper- sonal terms. The Gaudiya Vaishnavite Society (and related groups such as ISKCON) build their rela- tionship with God through personal devotion. A major element in that devotional activity concerns the frequent repetition of the following MANTRA that calls upon the name of God: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, / Krishna, Krishna, Hare, Hare, / Hare Rama, Hare Rama, / Rama, Rama, Hare, Hare. The mantra is chanted several hours daily by devotees as a means of elevating their conscious- ness, quickening enlightenment, and hastening progress to SAMADHI , an elevated state of con- sciousness.

Made up of 12 chapters containing 24 songs, the Gitago- vinda traces the passionate love affair of the young, handsome cowherd Krishna and his married lover R ADHA , a young woman who also herds cows ( GOPI ). Both sacred and profane, the work details the love play of the fickle god with Radha, Radha’s pain in separation from him, his eventual pain in separation from her, and their passionate reunion. In theological terms, Radha is the devotee who seeks God, tastes the sweet pleasure of mystic union, and then is abandoned only to have the love renewed in further mystical experience. In later Vaishnavite theology Radha was seen as an extension of the fullness of the divine, who was (mysteriously) both identical and separate from him. Radha, then, becomes the energy of Krishna that allows him to experience and impart joy. This explains why in Gitagovinda god himself is seen to yearn for the devotee (Radha) in parting. Krishna needs the devotee nearly as much as the devotee needs Krishna. Gitagovinda is a masterpiece of Sanskrit literature that was very influential among the Vaishnavites of Bengal. It was considered to be C HAITANYA ’s favorite work, and stories tell of his relish for the songs of this book. It also influenced the Vaishnavite Sahajiyas, a tantra-influenced sect that saw sexuality as an expression of Krishna’s liaisons with Radha. The Sahajiyas esoteric prac- tice joined a man with a woman not his wife as part of the realization of the mysterious union of Radha and Krishna.

E .) that appear to be goddess figurines and indicate a focus on the divine feminine. In the R IG V EDA (c. 1500 B . C . E .), the oldest of India’s extant texts, the primary divinities AGNI and I NDRA are male, as are the great majority of divinities mentioned. Some important goddesses, however, are also cited. Perhaps most important is V ACH , goddess of speech. Since speech in its form as MANTRA is the locus or primary source of ritual power in the V EDIC context, the goddess of speech is all-encompassing. In fact, in Rig Veda (X.125) a verse to this goddess of speech shows her to be an all-encompassing reality, surpassing all the male gods. Other important goddesses in the V EDAS are U SHAS , R AT R I , and A DITI . Ushas is the goddess of the early dawn light, possibly before sunrise. Ratri is her sister, who is the goddess of the night. Aditi is understood to be the mother of the male gods. Another goddess, S ARASVATI , is hailed in the Rig Veda as an important river. She gains later fame, beginning with late Vedas when the same name is used for the goddess of learning. Finally, Shaci, the wife of Indra, is frequently mentioned and sometimes taken to be all-powerful. Hinduism developed by mythically interlink- ing the male gods V ISHNU and S HIVA , among oth- ers, to various local divinities throughout India. Vishnu is found in the Vedas, where shiva (the auspicious) was an epithet of the god R UDRA . As theistic Hinduism developed, these gods emerged as a sort of cultural meeting place for various local mythic traditions. They are, in essence, amalgams of characteristics derived from different, and perhaps sundry, cultural sources. As the A RYANS moved east and south, many local divinities were identified with these greater divinities. Some of them, such as G ANESHA , the elephant-headed god, for instance, became members of a larger family; Ganesha became the son of Shiva. In this context, local goddesses were under- stood to be wives of Shiva and Vishnu. It is pos- sible that S AT I , Shiva’s first wife, derived from just such a local non-Aryan cultural complex. P ARVATI , his second wife and the daughter of the Himalaya mountain, may well have been a distinct divin- ity in ancient times. Later, as D URGA and K ALI became recognized as wives of Shiva, many of the local goddesses lost some or all of their original character and began to be understood as Durga or Kali under other names. Parvati was probably the model, here, as many local goddesses under other names are identified with her, too—for example M INAKSHI of Madurai. As was the case with Shiva, certain goddesses became identified with Vishnu’s wife, Lakshmi; they may be seen as Rukmini or Radha the wife and lover, respectively, of Vishnu in his form as K RISHNA . Some are identified with S ITA , the wife of R AMA , another AVATA R of Vishnu. Vishnu and Shiva are the main divinities for V AISHNAVISM and S HAIVISM , respectively (the god- dess-oriented sect of S HAKTAS is discussed later). They are both loosely related to the divinity B RAHMA , who has a clear post-Vedic development. Very few male divinities around India become associated with him, but there are many goddesses who are identified with his wife S ARASVATI , god- dess of wisdom and learning. The development of the two main Hindu cults to Vishnu and Shiva began with the great India epics (c. 700 B . C . E . to 100 C . E .). In the early centuries of the Common Era, additional texts recounting their deeds, incarnations, and adventures began to emerge, called PURANAS . At about this time the cult of Mahadevi, or the Great Goddess, began to develop as well; texts such as the Markandeya Purana (c. 300–600 C . E .) actually praised the goddess as the supreme being above Shiva and Vishnu. This represented the beginning of the cult of the Shaktas, who focus their worship on the goddess as S HAKTI (supreme divine energy). Undoubtedly, Vedic divinities such as Vac helped form the model for this development, but the cul- tural roots of the Great Goddess must be seen to be in the pre-Aryan substratum of Indian culture, in which goddesses were probably worshipped from Neolithic times.

In the Shakta context TANTRIC forms of worship are more likely to be found, though the Shaivites have also always had a well-developed set of tantric cults drawing on the same prehistorical sources in Indian culture. There are also rare cults of Vaishnavite tantra. Sometimes these tantric cults took up the worship of the D ASHA M AHAVIDYA , a pantheon of goddesses joined for specialized worship. These included well-known goddesses such as Kali and Lakshmi, who are worshipped alongside specialized cult goddesses such as S RI L ALITA or other more unusual divinities such as Dasha Mahavidya, who is worshipped with pol- luted things such as cloth that has been stained by menstruation ( see PURITY / POLLUTION ). In Shaktism ferocious, frightening forms of the divine feminine are common; they often are worshipped with the understanding that since the goddess is all of reality, we must learn to love her in the most frightening, dark forms to understand her totality. In tantrism this realization about the divinity takes the form of engaging in activities in a ritual context that are usually forbidden, such as eating beef or having sex with someone to whom one is not married. This is done in order to compre- hend the divinity beyond all social or mental con- ception. This sort of tantric practice involves only a very small minority of goddess worshippers.

When Krishna went to the woods alone at night to play on his seductive flute, the cowherds, all married women, secretly left their houses to rendezvous with him. They would dance the Rasa Lila (loosely, the divine play of the essence of divinity); with Krishna standing in the middle, each gopi thought he was dancing with her alone. Some versions of the story say that Krishna multiplied himself so that he could dance intimately with each of the cowgirls simultaneously. The gopi becomes the symbol, in the theol- ogy of Krishna worship, of the devotee who is willing even to flout convention to go to her or his passionate “assignation” with the divine. In later versions, Radha appears as the favored gopi of Krishna. She, then, becomes the symbol of the passionate devotee. The love of Krishna and Radha is frequently depicted in literature, painting, and dance and is a central theme in Hindu devotion. Further reading: Edward C.

Originally centered in western India, the practice spread throughout northern India, with both Buddhist and Hindu offshoots. Several early teachers in the lineage, including Gorakhanath, are included in Tibetan Buddhist TANTRIC lin- eages. Known to both is Mastyendranath, who is seen in North Indian Nath Yoga to be the guru of Gorakhnath. There is a vast literature attributed to Gora- khanath, including several important S ANSKRIT texts and numerous poems in Hindi, Bengali, and Rajasthani. A rich mythology emphasizes his magical, divine powers: he was known for being able to raise the dead at will. The Nath Yoga practices in the tradition of Gorakhnath are tantric in orientation, but they did not involve any of the sexual practices of tan- trism, as the Naths generally took a misogynistic view of women. They adopted antisocial behavior as a norm; as in earlier Shaivite sects, it was part of their esoteric practice to smear themselves with ashes from the cremation ground and even human feces, to eat disgusting things, and to act in outra- geous, antisocial ways ( see S HAIVISM ). Gorakhnath and his followers to this day are known for their propensities toward magic and their use of oxides of mercury and other secret substances and potions meant to create bodily immortality. Their practice generally conforms to that of the SIDDHAS , tantric yoga specialists, of India over many centuries. In terms of yoga practice, those in the Gora- khnath tradition perfect forms of HATHA YOGA ; they concentrate on an invisible web of bodily channels called NADIS , through which one can channel breaths to gain both occult powers and liberation from birth and rebirth. Philosophically the views of the followers of Gorakhnath varied from region to region, but generally they had a non-dual ( ADVAITA ) tantric character, which saw the divine as not merely a transcendent reality, but an immanent, worldly reality as well.

The goals of these teachings are to live in each moment, to dedicate one’s self to growth and free- dom beyond rules and regulations that squelch growth, and to transcend the struggles with our- selves, the culture, and the environment. Short has woven together strands of mindfulness practice with TANTRA to produce a novel path. Students of the Way of Radiance have the opportunity to grow and choose their way of relat- ing.

E ., the gunas were the strands or fabric of nature or PRAKRITI ; they eter- nally evolved into new universes, which would be destroyed only to reemerge. Prakriti itself was seen to be eternal. There are three gunas: sattva, rajas, and tamas. Sattva is that aspect of nature that is lucid, white, and placid. Rajas is that part of nature that is mud- died, reddish, and agitated. Tamas is that part of nature that is impure, dark, and inert. Everything in worldly reality is made of the three gunas in lesser or greater proportions. Sattva predominates in discriminative intellect ( BUDDHI ), while tamas predominates in earth. Samkhya yogic practice seeks to realize the self that is beyond and untouched by the three gunas of worldly existence. Samkhya became the philosophical basis for later yoga practice that focused on breath control and postures. Further reading: S. N. Dasgupta, The History of Indian Philosophy.

Gunadhya Gunadhya is the author of a lost work, the B RI - HATKATHA , a vast collection of tales dating from the early centuries of the Common Era. The stories generally had a secular character and imparted nuggets of wisdom. Nothing is definitively known about Gunad- hya’s life, but legends do exist. One well-known legend tells the fabulous story of how the book came to be written. Gunadhya was made a min- ister of the great king Satavahana. One warm day, the king and his wives began to bathe in the lake. When the king splashed water on his wives, one of them asked him to stop in the S AN - SKRIT language. In response to her request, the Gunadhya 171 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 171 12/14/06 9:28:42 AM"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"king ordered sweets. His wife laughed, saying, “I never knew I had such an ignorant husband! How can we eat sweets when we are so wet? You don’t understand Sanskrit well enough to know that I said, ‘Stop splashing me!’ ‘Stop splashing’ in Sanskrit sounds like ‘bring sweets’ if you don’t understand the simple grammatical rule that two words often run together!” The king thereupon returned to his palace and shut himself in his rooms. For the rest of the day he sat silently staring into space, refusing all food. When his two wisest ministers, Sarvavarma and Gunadhya, arrived to help, the king broke his silence, asking, “How long, my ministers, will it take me to learn Sanskrit if I work hard? What good is it to be a king, to have all this wealth, all these wives, these lands, if I am ignorant?” First Sage Gunadhya answered: “Most people need 12 years to learn Sanskrit grammar, but I will teach you in six years!” Sarvavarma jealously retorted, “The king does not have time to spend six years in such hardship. I will teach you in six months!” Gunadhya made this vow: “Sarvavarma, if you accomplish such an impossible feat, I shall renounce Sanskrit, Prakrit, and all the vernacular languages.” Sarvavarma replied angrily, “And if I don’t accomplish this, I shall carry your shoes on my head for 12 years!” The king was happy, feeling he would soon be rid of his ignorance. Sarvavarma knew that what he had promised was impossible. He prayed to S ARASVATI , goddess of learning. As a result of her intervention Sarvavarma was able to teach the king Sanskrit very quickly. The king bowed down to Sarvavarma, calling him “great teacher.” Gunadhya, having lost the bet, left the kingdom with two of his disciples. Gunadhya traveled in silence since he had vowed to give up all known languages. During his wanderings, he entered a wild forest, where he met a group of Paishachas, demons who spoke their seemingly incomprehensible demon lan- guage, used only in remote parts of India. The sage was able to learn this unusual language and begin speaking again, since the language was not one of the three types he had sworn to give up. Gunadhya was now able to understand the words of a wild-looking old forest dweller. This man greeted Gunadhya joyfully as if he had been awaiting this moment for many years, and in fact he had. He was a celestial who had been cursed to become a man, but he knew the curse would be lifted if he told a certain story to Gunadhya, who had been the cursed man’s companion in a previ- ous life. The curse would end if Gunadhya could make the story famous. When Gunadhya realized the man’s true iden- tity, he appealed to him: “Tell the story told by S HIVA so that our curses will all end!” As the man recounted the divine tale, which comprised seven stories in the Paishachi language, the area where he sat seemed covered with a canopy of celestial beings hovering as they listened in the air above his head. Finishing his story the forest man returned to the celestial realm. For the next seven years, Gunadhya recorded the story he had heard in 700,000 couplets, using the demon language. Since he had no ink and no paper, the great poet wrote the story’s verses on tree bark in his own blood. When he finished he sent it to the king Satavahana, so that it would spread through the world. But when the king, who now knew Sanskrit, saw this disgusting book written in blood in a low language, he ordered it thrown away. Gunadhya grew sad and depressed. He went with his students to the top of a hill and made a sacred fire. He had saved the last seventh of the tale, consisting of 100,000 verses, because his stu- dents loved it. As he was reading this tale aloud and beginning to burn its pages, every animal in the surrounding area listened and wept. In the meantime, the king had fallen ill and needed meat, but because all the animals were lis- tening to Gunadhya and not eating, they were too lean to kill. When the king heard this, he asked the hunters to lead him to the man telling the tale. He recognized Gunadhya, who appeared to be a forest K 172 Gunadhya 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 172 12/14/06 9:28:42 AM"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"dweller with long matted hair, sitting in the midst of the circle of weeping animals. Gunadhya then told the king the curse and the circumstances that caused the great story to descend to Earth. The king then knew that Gunadhya was a celestial. He begged him for the full story, but, unfortunately, only one-seventh remained. The king took the great story, called the Brihatkatha, and went to his palace. He had the work translated into Sanskrit, and that is how the story indeed became famous throughout the world.

The Guptas were a powerful dynasty who ruled most of North India early in the Common Era. They patronized Jains (see J AINISM ) and Buddhists ( see B UDDHA ) as well as Hindus. The famous Bud- dhist monastic university of Nalanda (a site now in western Pakistan) was founded by the Gupta kings and associates. Other Buddhist sites such as Bodh Gaya and Sanchi also benefited from Gupta attention and largesse. The Gupta rulers were known for their adher- ence to traditional V EDIC norms in ritual and conduct. While patrons of the heterodox Bud- dhists and Jains, they were devotionally attached to V ISHNU and remained Hindus by faith. Chandra Gupta I (320–34 C . E .) began the dynasty by con- solidating power in the eastern Gangetic heart- land. His successor, Sumudra Gupta (355–76 C . E .), made Pataliputra (now Patna) the center of a great empire reaching from Assam in the east to the Pun- jab in the west. He took tribute from other kings in the west, notably those of Rajasthan, and con- quered much of the eastern Indian coastline down to K ANCHIPURAM . Though he withdrew his armies, he remained overlord of southeastern India. Chandra Gupta II (c. 376–415 C . E .) defeated the western Shaka armies and extended the rule of the empire up to the Indus River, controlling everything to the east. Chandra Gupta II ushered in a new era of cultural magnificence, becoming patron to the great poet K ALIDASA and other poets and scholars. He may have had the title Vikra- maditya cited by Kalidasa. During his reign the Chinese traveler Fa-shien, a Buddhist, traveled to India to record the wonders of the land. Chandra Gupta’s son, Kumara Gupta I (c. 415–54), was killed in battles defending western India as fierce invaders, the Central Asians known as Hunas, challenged Gupta rule there. Kumara Gupta was known for his worship of S HIVA . Skanda Gupta (c. 455–67) took power upon Kumara’s death. He fended off the invaders, but Gupta power had begun to weaken. The rest of Gupta rule was spent in fending off attacks from the west. The empire succumbed completely when it lost con- trol of Bengal in 550 C . E .

He treated the guru as his father and served his household as well. Today, a guru is a person’s spiritual father, who is entitled to special deference, as are his wife and daughter. The guru is a spiritual guide. Almost all tra- ditions understand that spiritual progress and liberation from birth and rebirth cannot occur without the aid of a guru.

(Touching of the feet in India is a sign of deep respect.) So important is the guru that every year a holiday, Gurupurnima, is celebrated. It takes place on the full Moon in the lunar month of Ashadha (June–July). It was dedicated originally to the sage V YASA , who compiled the V EDAS and the M AHAB - HARATA , but it is observed by worship or honoring of one’s teachers and gurus. The S IKH tradition, which was founded by Guru Nanak in the 16th century, honors a line of 10 gurus whose teachings form the core of the tradition. The teachings were eventually gath- ered together along with the teachings of certain Indian saints into the Sikh sacred scripture, the Granth Sahib or Guru Granth. Since then the book has became the true “guru” for the Sikhs, and none other has been recognized. Further reading: M. G. Gupta, The Guru in Indian Mys- ticism (Agra: M.

Guyana Guyana was the first country in the Western Hemi- sphere to receive Hindu immigrants from India. On May 5, 1838, the British ship Whitby docked at Guyana’s Berbice Colony with 249 immigrants on board, 164 of whom were East Indians bound for the sugar plantations of Davidson, Barclay and Company in Highbury and Waterloo. As many immigrants to the Caribbean were, these East Indians were contracted as indentured laborers to fill the labor shortage that resulted from Britain’s abolition of slavery in 1833. As newly freed Afri- cans demanded higher wages and entered dif- ferent labor markets, colonial officials turned to India as a source of cheap labor. Guyana attracted many from western Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh, and other regions in north- ern India that had been affected by famine and poverty. Between 1838 and 1917, 238,960 Indian men, women, and children immigrated to Guy- ana. Most were farmers, but a small number of educated Brahmins also arrived, despite British policies aimed at preventing their passage. British officials believed that Brahmins would incite dis- sent among workers. As many as 75,000 inden- tured servants returned to India at the completion of their contracts. The rest remained and settled in permanent colonies. Hindus endured unfair treatment on the plan- tations and were pressured to convert to Chris- tianity. Work in the fields had no regard for the needs of Hindu prayer, ritual, or religious ceremo- nies. Hindus were sequestered, placed on separate plantations, and allowed to leave designated areas only with a validated pass. Long days in the field left little time for other activities; workers quickly adapted to certain patterns of Christian worship and adopted Sunday as a day for Hindu prayer and ritual. During the 1850s Christian missionaries fre- quently visited the settlements of Indians in attempts to convert Hindus to Christianity. In order to counter conversions Brahmin priests began providing spiritual rites to all Hindus regardless of caste. The rate of conversion to Christianity slowed, but a breakdown of the tradi- tional Indian caste system followed. Official policy of the British colony barred Hindus from employment in the civil service unless they first became Christian; many Hindus converted for this reason but privately continued to practice Hinduism. Discrimination against Hin- dus gradually subsided in the 1930s as the social status of Indian immigrants improved. Hindus who immigrated to Guyana took many of the traditional forms of their religion. Although these traditions were altered to suit the conditions K 174 Gurupurnima 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 174 12/14/06 9:28:42 AM"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"and circumstances of living in a multicultural society, the fundamental differences among sects found in India were reestablished in Guyana. The most popular traditions in Guyana remain V AISH - NAVISM and S HAIVISM . The largest Hindu organiza- tion in the country, Guyana Sanathan Dharma Maha Sabha, sustains most of the temples. Other organizations such as the Guyana Pandits Soci- ety maintain the tradition of Hindu orthodoxy in Guyana. In the Vaishnaivite tradition, the Ramayana is the main text of Hindus in Guyana; it supports devotion to the deity H ANUMAN and an annual observance of Ramayan YAJNA . Among Shaivite practitioners, daily observances include bathing a S HIVA LINGAM . Small shrines and prayer houses appear in front of homes throughout the country. Temples are the sites of chanting, MEDITA - TION , ritual, and worship. As in Trinidad, D IVALI , the festival of lights, is a national holiday in Guyana. Families and com- munities prepare special foods and decorate their homes and neighborhoods. Another Hindu cel- ebration, H OLI , is also a national holiday. The holi- day commemorates the lore about a traditional king who was killed by his son. It represents the triumph of good over evil and features the throw- ing of red dye on family and friends, representing the blood of the king. Smaller groups following the Hindu faith have emerged over recent decades, including the I NTER - NATIONAL S OCIETY FOR K RISHNA C ONSCIOUSNESS , the S AT YA S AI B ABA movement, and the A RYA S AMAJ . Most notable is the Guyana Sevashram Sangha, which was established in the mid-20th century by Swami Purnananda (no dates). Purnananda went to Guyana to foster Hinduism by teaching the Hare Krishna mantra and publishing Aum Hin- dutvam, a book to help guide Hindus in Guyana. The Guyana Sevashram Sangha serves as the only institution in the Caribbean that trains young brahmacharis (spiritual students; see BRAHMACHA - RYA ) and is the first to produce its own swami, Swami Vidyarand. Approximately 280,000 Hindus make Guyana their home. It is the second largest religion in the country, after Christianity. Further reading: D. A.

Hanuman The monkey god Hanuman is one of the most universally worshipped divinities of the Hindu pantheon. He is the son of Anjana, an APSARAS (nymph) who was herself born as a monkey, and V AY U , the god of the wind. In the R AMAYANA story, Hanuman is a friend to Lord R AMA , the incarna- tion of V ISHNU . He is equally worshipped by Vaish- navites (worshippers of V ISHNU ) and Shaivites (worshippers of S HIVA ). It is said that Hanuman as a child saw the Sun, thought it was a fruit, and leaped up 300 leagues to catch it. B RAHMA once gave him the boon that he would not be slain in battle. In the Ramayana, Hanuman flies over to the island of LANKA to see whether Rama’s wife, S ITA , is there. He finds her, but she dissuades him from tak- ing her back lest he besmirch Rama’s reputation. In a scene famous in Indian mythology, he is captured on Lanka by the demons ( rakshasas ). They march him through the streets to his execution, humiliat- ing him by tying an oil-soaked cloth to his tail and lighting it. Furious, he jumps from building to building and sets the capital city on fire. Hanuman fought bravely in the battle against the demons; he is remembered for going off to find herbs to revive L AKSHMANA , Rama’s slain brother. Not knowing which herbs to collect he took a whole mountain of them; from them medicine was found that restored Lakshmana to life. Hanuman follows Rama back to A YODHYA to serve him; the god gives him the boon of everlast- ing youth and longevity. Hanuman is seen as the foremost of the devotees of Rama. Hanuman is also found in one passage of the M AHABHARATA , where he meets B HIMA , another son of his father, Vayu. Bhima, known for his power, fights with Hanuman and is defeated. Only after- ward do they realize they are half brothers. Hanuman is known for his superhuman pow- ers, his celibacy (though in some parts of India he is seen as married), his ability to expand and con- tract himself, and his learning, including grammar and the Vedic sciences. He is often regarded as a village protector and is the special divinity of wrestlers and acrobats. Iconographically Hanuman is usually depicted with only two hands, carrying a club, but other images give him eight hands that hold several weapons and a shield, for fighting in the war against the demons. In one hand he holds the H 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 177 12/14/06 9:28:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Sanjivini mountain, the mountain of herbs that saved Laksmana’s life. Further reading: K.

Hanuman Foundation (est. 1974) The Hanuman Foundation is one of the creations of the American spiritual teacher Baba R AM D ASS , born Richard Alpert, April 6, 1931, in Boston, Massachusetts. After working with psychedelics with Timo- thy Leary at Harvard University and being dis- missed with Leary, from their teaching positions there, Alpert went to India in 1967 and met his GURU , N EEM K AROLI B ABA . Neem Karoli gave him the spiritual name Ram Dass (servant of God) and introduced him to Hindu spirituality. In his time with Neem Karoli, he learned about H ANU - MAN , the deity depicted as a monkey who is a symbol of selfless service in the Hindu tradition. Ram Dass became an affectionate devotee of Hanuman. The Hanuman Foundation was incorporated in 1974, after Ram Dass’s pilgrimage to India in order to supply information from the teachings of Neem Karoli Baba, who, although deceased, still teaches. Ram Dass founded the Neem Karoli Baba Hanuman Temple, located in Taos, New Mexico, in a remodeled adobe building. The central focus of the temple is a 1,500-pound marble carving of Hanuman imported from India. This temple primarily serves some 300 Indian families spread between Albuquerque and Denver. Major services featuring chanting and singing are held every Tuesday (as that is considered Hanuman’s day). Neem Karoli Baba’s mahasamadhi (death/liberation day) is celebrated in September. The foundation has become over time a central archive and headquarters of a number of projects. The Orphalese Foundation controls a tape library and the ZBS Foundation (also known as Amazing Grace) has released several recordings on spiritual topics with the assistance of Steven Levine. The foundation also works closely with the Seva Foundation, founded by Larry Brilliant (b. 1946), a devotee of Baba, on social service projects, especially the eradication of blindness.

Hari Dass, Baba (1923– ) teacher of Ashtanga Yoga For over 50 years, Baba Hari Dass has been teach- ing A SHTANGA Y OGA and instituting organizations for social service in the United States, Canada, and India, while maintaining vows of monastic silence. Born in 1923 near Almora, India, in the foot- hills of the Himalayas, Baba Hari Dass left home at age eight to join a sect of renunciants in the jungles of the lower Himalayas. In 1942, he took initiation as a monk in the V AIRAGI Vaishnavite order. After years of MEDITATION , he decided in 1952 to become a MUNI SADHU , a monk who prac- tices continual silence. The observance of silence is aimed at gradually quieting the mind and elimi- nating unwanted thoughts. He writes on a small chalkboard to communicate his teachings. Despite this vow, he has been able to implement his plans for the extension of his version of religion and spirituality, while developing ASHRAMS and teach- ing YOGA . In addition to teaching classical Ashtanga Yoga (the Yoga of the Eight Limbs, originally codified by P ATANJALI ), Baba Hari Dass is an author, builder, philosopher, sculptor, and pro- ponent of A YURVEDA (the ancient Indian system of health and healing.) In 1971, he traveled to North America, and he has continued to work in India, Canada, and the United States. He and his teachings have inspired the Mount Madonna Center near Santa Cruz, California; the Dhar- masara Satsang Society/Salt Spring Center near Vancouver; the Ashtanga Yoga Fellowship in Toronto; and the Sri Ram Ashram in Haridwar, India, all organizations dedicated to yoga educa- tion, retreats, service projects, and publishing. The California-based Hanuman Fellowship was formed in 1974.

Haridvar (Haridwar; Hardvar; Hardwar) Haridvar ( dvar, doorway, to Hari, a name for V ISHNU ) is one of the seven sacred cities of Hindu India. S HIVA followers call the city Hardvar (Har, a name for Shiva). Haridvar is located in the northern state of Uttaranchal, in the Himalayan foothills. The city has been called Mayapur, Gangadwar, and Kapila at different times in its history. It has been men- tioned in scripture and other writings from the time of the B UDDHA (600 B . C . E .). The city is considered the starting point for a PILGRIMAGE path that includes B ADRINATH , K EDAR - NATH , Gangotri, and Yamanotri. It is the place where Bhagiratha is said to have taken the G ANGES down to Earth in order to bless the ashes of his ancestors; pilgrims annually honor the descent of the Ganges. They also perform the special shrad- dha FUNERAL RITES for deceased loved ones. Pil- grims visit a stone footprint of Vishnu and bathe nearby. The three major gods, B RAHMA , Shiva; and Vishnu, have been said to visit the city. Numerous temples to both Shiva and Vishnu grace the city. There are also temples to the god- dess, including the Mayadevi temple, considered one of the SHAKTI PITHAS where the heart (or navel) of the goddess is said to have fallen. Nota- ble also is the temple to D AKSHA , father-in-law of Shiva; Daksha performed his famous sacrifice here without inviting Shiva, thus provoking a quarrel and eventually the death of his daughter S AT I . Haridvar/Hardvar is one of the sites for the K UMBHA M ELA and the larger Maha Kumbhamela festivals.

Harihara Harihara is an iconic deity who combines the forms of V ISHNU (Hari) and S HIVA (Hara). He is revered by a syncretic cult based mostly in South India. There is a Harihara image in B ADAMI in Kar- nataka that is dated to the sixth century. The South Indian kings of the V IJAYANAGARA (1336–1565) patronized Harihara’s temples. Some of their kings even took his name. A number of Harihara temples still exist in the Indian state of Karnataka today. Harihara also appears in the iconography of Nepal. Though a minority cult, the Harihara phenomenon demonstrates the elasticity and syn- cretic character of Hinduism.

Its origins are obscure, but it is likely that the system began to develop in the early centuries of the Common Era. Hatha yoga includes basic practices that can be found in A SHTANGA Y OGA , which relies on the Y OGA S UTRA of P ATANJALI . It includes different arrays of postures ( ASANAS ), joined to various TANTRA prac- tices. The term hatha originally meant “violent,” and it is possible that this style of YOGA originated in certain types of severe yoga that were later soft- ened for protection of the body. Some types of hatha yoga include or even focus on KUNDALINI practice. Here the focus of breath control is on the “serpent” or “Goddess Energy” at the base of the spine, which must be awakened and forced upward to pierce the psychic centers or chakras that run parallel to the spine. The NADIS , or subtle bodily channels, are used to guide breath into the central spinal channel to help the raising of the kundalini through the centers. Finally, the kundalini meets SHIVA at a point above the head called SAHASRARA CHAKRA . This meeting provokes absolute enlightenment. Traditionally, hatha yoga has encompassed a wide range of practices including those of such sects as the N AT H Y OGIS , who sought bodily immortality through the ingestion (and transfor- mation) of poisons such as oxides of mercury and practiced a physical alchemy. Today, in the West, hatha yoga is typically confined to postures and a simple focus on the breath; more advanced prac- titioners may begin to focus on the kundalini and the channeling of the breath in the nadis.

He reached out to the youth of the 1960s, recognizing that their experimentation with drugs expressed a need for liberation and wholeness. Yogi Bhajan introduced many young people to kundalini yoga as a natural and healthy alternative. As word of his teachings spread, the organization grew and centers were established throughout the United States. Since then the 3HO has become a popular and dynamic community dedicated to personal growth and sharing of the ancient techniques upon which the organization is founded. The organization has fulfilled one of Yogi Bhajan’s stated intentions, “I did not come to collect students, but to train teachers.” The practice of kundalini as taught by Yogi Bhajan is based on kriyas (ritual action). It is an integrative and authentic system that combines physical exercise, breath control, and medita- tion. These yoga techniques constitute a spiritual technology that expands awareness, opens the potential of mind, and draws forth one’s inner being. The benefits of kundalini, as cited by 3HO, include the strengthening of the nervous system, the reduction of stress, self-awareness, concentra- tion, and peace of mind.

V EDIC Hinduism conceived of a realm beyond the sky called svar or svarga, a realm of immortality and happiness beyond this world. One reached it through proper performance of the Vedic duties, especially the rituals ( YAJNA ). In later mythology, beginning in the epics R AMAYANA and M AHABHARATA , svarga began to be understood as the realm of I NDRA , king of the gods. His paradise contained the sacred wish-giv- ing tree and the cow who grants all wishes. The beautiful courtesans of the gods ( APSARASES ) reside there, along with the divine musicians ( GANDHAR - VA S ). There all desires for pleasure are instantly satisfied. Later Hindu traditions, starting around 400 B . C . E ., considered svarga or heaven to be only a waystation in the transmigrating life. One could enjoy one’s accumulated KARMIC merit there but would still be reborn into the physical world. In Shaivite tradition, S HIVA resides in Kailash, a para- dise of sorts located at an actual mountain in the H IMALAYAS , but one was only meant to visit this site once in a lifetime. It generally was not seen as a place for souls to go after death. Among Vaishnavites (V ISHNU devotees), the ancient realm that once belonged to I NDRA remains as a goal, to be reached after liberation from birth K 182 heaven 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 182 12/14/06 9:28:44 AM"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"and rebirth.

Jain yogi and philosopher Hemachandra was one of the foremost Jain S HVET - AMBARA sages and teachers. He is known for his many writings, including the vast Jain PURANA in Sanskrit, which catalogued the lives and adven- tures of the 63 venerated personages in the tra- dition of J AINISM . Included among the 63 are all the T IRTHANKARAS , enlightened teachers, of the current half-era, plus the story of B AHUBALI , one of the sons of the first Tirthankara, and even a Jain version of the story of K RISHNA . This work was highly influential in popularizing and spreading the Jain faith. Hemachandra’s Yogashastra is one of the best sources for some of the lost practices of Jain YOGA . In the area of philosophy Hemachandra wrote Pra- manamimamsa and Anyayogagavyavacchedika, which are widely studied as Jain contributions to the Indian logical school of the N YAYA . The second of the two is famous for its commentary by Mall- ishena, entitled Syadvadamanjari, which laid out a sophisticated Jain relativistic philosophy. Further reading: Helen M.

Himalayan International Institute of Yoga Science and Philosophy (est. 1971) The Himalayan International Institute of Yoga Science and Philosophy was founded in 1971 by Swami Rama (1925–96); first based in Illinois, headquarters were moved to Honesdale, Penn- sylvania, in 1977. The institute promotes its founder’s teachings on mind-body consciousness. Courses in holistic health, HATHA YOGA , RAJA YOGA , MEDITATION , and psychology are offered there. Raja yoga, considered the royal road of yoga, is promoted as a prime way to balance mind, body, and spirit. Swami Rama always aimed to awaken the nascent consciousness, bolster its energy, and raise spiritual intensity so that the individual blends with the Universal Self. He advocated what he termed super conscious MEDITATION , a system that included relaxation, prana (breathing), ASA - NAS (postures), and chants, or MANTRAS . After being orphaned at an early age, Swami Rama was raised by an accomplished yogi from Bengal. He spent time as a child and young man in the cave monasteries of the H IMALAYAS . He was an adept pupil eager to learn, and in 1949 he attained the level of Shankaracharya, a title that was con- sidered a great honor. He gave up his title in 1952 and committed himself to an arduous discipline in order to prepare himself for attaining and teaching the highest spirituality. In 1969 Swami Rama ventured to the United States; he became a research consultant for the Menninger Foundation Research Project, which viewed his project on voluntary control of exter- nal states as worthy of research. Little was known about how to induce the body to override the involuntary, autonomous nervous system. Swami Rama began to work with the husband-and-wife team of Elmer and Alyce Green, the on-site psy- chologists. He demonstrated an uncanny ability to control physical feats and body functions. His extraordinary skills offered significant material for laboratory analysis of mind-body connections. The Himalayan Institute has published over 80 books on meditation and philosophy. It also publishes the bimonthly Yoga International. There are 37 branches, serving an international market, with affiliated centers in the United States, Can- ada, India, Germany, Italy, Great Britain, Trinidad, Himalayan International Institute of Yoga Science and Philosophy 183 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 183 12/14/06 9:28:44 AM"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Curaçao, and Malaysia.

Himalayan Mountains Himalaya (the abode of the snows) is a vast moun- tain range spreading across six countries: India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, China, and Tibet (ruled by China). Geographically it separates the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan plateau. Fourteen of the highest peaks in the world are found in the Himalayas. The sources of several of the rivers of India are found here. Both the Indus River of Pakistan and the G ANGES of India begin in these snow-covered mountains. The Himalaya is an important mythological site for Indian tradition. Lord S HIVA and his wife, P ARVATI , are said to live on the peak K AILASA , an important pilgrimage site in Tibet just across the border from Nepal. The Himalayas are personified as H IMAVAT , the father of S AT I , Shiva’s first wife. The Himalayan lake Mansorovar is said to be the source of the Ganges. H ANUMAN the monkey god was said to have gone to the Himalaya to get the mountain of herbs that saved L AKSHMANA ’s life in the R AMAYANA story. Further reading: Cornelia Dimmit and J.A.

Himavat Literally “possessed of snow,” Himavat is the personification of the Himalayas found in Indian literature and mythology. His wife is Mena. Many stories are told of Himavat, his wife, and their family. One story holds that the couple had three daughters, Ragini, Kutila, and K ALI , and one son, Sunabha. The first daughter, Ragini, was reddish colored and dressed in red. The sec- ond daughter, Kutila, was fair and wore garlands and clothes of white. The last daughter was the dark Kali. Six years after each girl’s birth they all began to practice austerities. Successful in her austerities, Kutila was taken to heaven by certain divinities to meet B RAHMA , as there was a need for someone to bear a son to S HIVA to save the universe from tor- ment by the demons. Brahma told the divinities that this fair girl could not bear such a son, but in her temerity she insisted to Brahma that she could. This incurred his anger and he cursed her to become the river in his land (later to be taken to earth in the form of Ganga or the G ANGES ). The second, ruddy, daughter, Ragini, did aus- terities and was also cursed by Brahma when she too became angry at him. Because of her ruddy complexion, she was turned into the twilight. Finally, it was time for the dark one, Kali, to go to heaven because of her austerity. At this point Mena, in anguish at the prospect of losing yet another daughter, shouted out, “u! ma!” (Sanskrit for Oh, no!). U MA is another name for P ARVATI , and at this point her name was officially changed. She, of course, was successful in becoming Shiva’s wife. There are many stories of Himavat’s encoun- ters with his divine son-in-law, Shiva. Usually, they show him and his wife to be uncomfortable with the antisocial ascetic with whom their daughter K 184 Himalayan Mountains 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 184 12/14/06 9:28:44 AM"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"had fallen in love. In one example, Himavat has a ragged beggar thrown from his house only to learn later that this was Parvati’s beau Shiva, with whom she had become enthralled. Further reading: Cornelia Dimmitt and J.

Hinduism Today (est. 1979) The quarterly magazine Hinduism Today was founded on January 5, 1979, by Satguru Sivaya S UBRAMUNIYASWAMI (1927–2001) as part of the nonprofit educational activity of the Himalayan Academy, the publishing and research organiza- tion of the S AIVA S IDDHANTA C HURCH . The publica- tion is produced by a small monastic community on Kauai Island in Hawaii to “inform and inspire interest in Hinduism, dispel popular myths sur- rounding the religion, foster solidarity among sects and lineages, maintain respect for the Vedas, promote the continuing renaissance of Hindu- ism and serve as an educational resource for the promotion of Sanatana Dharma.” It employs over 100 reporters and dozens of photographers. It is distributed across 39 countries, reaching millions of readers. In 1951 the Himalayan Academy began pub- lishing a series of books on Hinduism and meta- physics. The quarterly emerged in response to a growing need in the late 1970s for a nontechni- cal publication accessible to a wide audience that could serve as a central resource for those maintaining the faith outside India. In addition to articles directly relating to Hindu philosophy, the Hindu D IASPORA , and international news of Hindu communities and temples, the publication includes topics ranging from AYURVEDA medicine to VEGETARIANISM and YOGA . Interviews with popu- lar Hindu teachers, reformers, and activists appear regularly. The publication has become a reputable source on the Hindu way of life for many outside the reli- gious community. Governments, libraries, theolo- gians, and scholars use it to research the beliefs, practices, and contexts of Hindu groups around the world. Hinduism Today has changed from its first dis- tribution in 1979 as a black and white newsletter to the current full-colored magazine and Internet journal. In 1996, the publication expanded to include a CD-ROM called Dharma Graphics, con- taining 1,500 illustrations of village arts and crafts selected from 20 years of images.

Hindu nationalism Hindu nationalism is a contemporary movement with religious, cultural, and political aspects, oriented toward creation of a Hindu state in India and a monolithic Hindu identity, based on Hin- dutva (Hinduness). Critics charge that these nationalists define Hindu to emphasize Brahminical and upper-caste values, ethics, and practices. The movement also includes extremists and Hindu supremacists who have targeted the economic and political rights of cultural and religious minorities. Supporters point out crimes Muslims have committed against India and the depredations of the Christians in the form of the British and call for an uprooting of “non- Hindu” elements in India as much as possible. Hindutva declares Christians and Muslims to be “foreign” to India because their faiths have holy lands outside the boundary of the modern Indian nation-state. Critics point out that the ideology of Hindutva supports violence against religious and cultural minorities, including sexual violence against women of minority groups and Hindu women who defy Hindutva’s mandates. Further, the Hindutva agenda for nation building Hindu nationalism 185 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 185 12/14/06 9:28:44 AM"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"subordinates the lives and livelihoods of adivasis (indigenous tribal peoples), Dalits (economically disadvantaged, former “untouchable” castes), and the poor to higher-caste Hindus. In general, Hindutva is not sympathetic to the historical and present struggles for the human rights of spiritually and politically distinct groups, such as tribal groups, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs, as these groups are understood to be antinational and anti-Hindu. Hindutva’s tenets were first described by V. D. Savarkar in his text Hindutva: Who Is a Hindu?, published in 1922. Hindutva’s agenda is carried out by various groups, including the S HIV S ENA and the Sangh Parivar, a network of organizations. The Sangh’s major parties are Rashtriya Swayam- sevak Sangh (RSS); National Volunteer Corps, formed in 1925, which provides social service and militant training; Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP); World Hindu Council, formed in 1964, which frames the Sangh’s cultural and religious agenda and works to spread the Hindu nationalist agenda on an international level; and the Bajrang Dal, the militant youth group. Hindu national- ist political parties took various forms through the 20th century, and the B HARATIYA J ANATA P ARTY (BJP), “Indian People’s Party,” created in 1980, is the most recent incarnation of the Sangh’s politi- cal wing. While the BJP advocates a clear Hindu supremacist agenda, other political parties also empathize with and support “soft” Hindutva, which contains certain aspects of Hindutva that shun violence. The Sangh also operates through a vast network of development groups and service and education organizations, such as Ekal Vidya- layas, Sewa Bharti, Utkal Bipanna Sahayata Samiti, and Vanvasi Kalyan Ashrams. The rise of Hindu nationalism can be traced to anticolonial movements during the late 19th century, when Hindus mobilized to fight British rule. Some of these movements protected the privileges and rights of the Hindu middle and upper classes against the struggles for equal rights of other minorities and lower-class and tribal peoples. Scholarly analysis shows that Hindutva drew upon the ethnic and cultural nationalisms of Germany and Italy in the early 20th century, to promote physical training conducted in cells called shakhas and ideological training that linked “Hindu pride” to the subjugation of perceived enemies, such as the Christians and Muslims. The rise of Hindu nationalism is thus framed by the inequalities and struggles in India’s history. When India and Pakistan became independent nations in August 1947, divided along religious differences, widespread violence between and within religious communities accompanied the massive displacement of people across newly drawn national borders. Large groups of Muslims moved into Pakistan (a self-proclaimed Islamic state), and non-Muslims moved into India (a self- proclaimed secular state). Official estimates put the displacement at about 12 million and deaths at several million. More than 75,000 women were abducted and raped by members of their own or other communities. The forms of violence that struck within and across religious lines during the Partition still fill the social memory of India and provide rationale for mutual resentment and anger between Hindus and Muslims. On January 30, 1948, Nathuram Godse, a former member of the RSS, shot and killed M. K. G ANDHI . At the time, Hindu nationalists expressed intense dissatisfaction with what they termed Gandhi’s “appeasement” of minorities, especially Muslims. Though Godse was not an official mem- ber of the RSS at the time, the RSS was banned for approximately a year. The language of “minority appeasement” continues to be a mobilizing rheto- ric for Hindu nationalism. In 1984, with Indira Gandhi’s assassination as a trigger, Sikh communities were targeted by large-scale violence, concentrated in Delhi. It is widely accepted that the violence was largely the responsibility of Hindutva, abetted by the Con- gress government’s complicity in not prosecuting instigators. In 1992, leaders of the BJP, VHP, and RSS incited Hindu nationalist crowds to destroy K 186 Hindu nationalism 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 186 12/14/06 9:28:45 AM"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"the 400+-year-old Babri Mosque at A YODHYA in Uttar Pradesh. According to the Sangh’s mythol- ogy and grievance, the mosque stands upon the ruins of a Hindu temple, rumored to be the birth- place of R AMA , a Hindu god. The destruction of the mosque was accompanied by systematic anti- Muslim violence throughout India, concentrated in Mumbai, for which the Srikrishna Commission has held Hindu nationalists responsible. The BJP gained power in India at the national level at the head of a coalition of political parties called the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The NDA controlled the national government until 2004, when the Congress-led United Pro- gressive Alliance won elections at the national level, though the BJP continued to rule in various states, alone or within political coalitions. In the spring of 2002, the torching of 58 Hindutva activists on a train near the town of Godhra, Gujarat, set off a systematic and govern- ment-backed massacre of Muslims throughout the state. Immediately after the train fire, some of the local-language press and state-level BJP lead- ers insisted that local Muslims had conspired to burn the train, though the Banerjee Commission later declared this allegation to be unfounded. Starting on February 28, violence broke out in 16 of Gujarat’s 24 districts, attributed by most to Hindu nationalist groups. Muslim homes, busi- nesses, and places of worship were destroyed by large mobs armed with swords, tridents, kerosene, and liquid gas canisters. Both girls and women were subjected to sexual atrocities: gang rape and collective rape, as well as sexual mutila- tion with swords and sticks, before being burned to death. Independent fact-finding groups have placed the number of dead at no fewer than 2,000, and the number of displaced at 200,000, most of whom were Muslims. Human rights observers classified the events in Gujarat as “genocide” by the standards of the United Nations Genocide Convention of 1948. India’s National Human Rights Commission charged the state government with complicity at the “highest levels.” Police and high-level BJP officials, according to fact-finding reports, supported the violence through inaction or active participation, including leaking electoral rolls indicating the locations of Muslim residences and businesses. Since the violence in Gujarat, impunity has reigned, as reported by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Several high-profile cases were moved out of the state by the Indian Supreme Court, because of the court’s lack of confidence in the ability of Gujarat’s judi- cial system to deliver justice for the survivors. Since these incidents in Gujarat, groups in India and the D IASPORA have begun to trace inter- national political and financial support for Hindu nationalist organizations. Two reports tracked the funding of Hindu nationalist activities: the Cam- paign to Stop Funding Hate released one report on the activities of the India Development and Relief Fund, a United States–based charity, and Awaaz South Asia Watch released another report on the Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh, a United King- dom–based charity. Sangh leaders have been quoted as promising to strengthen the Hindutva movement in Orissa, a state in eastern India, and in other parts of the country. In Orissa, as of 2005, Hindutva already has a strong network of Sangh organizations and activists, who are reportedly carrying out forced conversions of Christians and tribals to Hinduism, destroying churches, committing selective mur- ders, imposing social and economic boycotts of minorities, and imposing a ban on cow slaughter, which threatens the livelihoods of poor Muslims and Dalits .

Paradoxically, it has both a masculine and a feminine aspect. It is referred to as “he,” but it is also the “womb” of manifest reality. From the beginning the term hiranyagarbha has had multivalent and sometimes contradictory meanings. In Rig Veda X.82 it is the cosmic egg that separates into two hemispheres, in the begin- ning of the world, its upper portion forming the sky and its yolk becoming the Sun. This vision is elaborated in the PURANAS , where other elements of the egg make up elements of the manifest uni- verse: the water in the cosmic egg, for instance, becomes the ocean. Various Hindu traditions have offered vari- ous and quite different understandings of this ancient image, even within the same tradition. Influenced by S AMKHYA concepts, some say that the PURUSHA (the transcendent divine) with the cooperation of PRAKRITI (nature) made the cos- mic egg from which the world emerges. In one context B RAHMA , the creator, emerged from the egg to create the universe. In other contexts, however, Brahma is himself the hiranyagarbha; the word can be used as an epithet or alternate name of Brahma. In Shaivite ( see S HAIVISM ) contexts hiran- yagarbha is seen as a creation of S HIVA that embodies aspects of him. From hiranyagarbha, in turn, Brahma or the universe can emerge. In Vaishnavite ( see V AISHNAVISM ) mythology, V ISHNU inspires or creates the hiranyagarbha, from which the universe derives. In the V EDANTA of S HANKARA the term takes on various meanings depending on the lineage and tradition expounding upon it. In this tradition it is often associated with a state of consciousness rather than an entity per se. For example, in Shankara’s own commentaries hiranyagarbha is considered synonymous with the manifest universe, which is the product of M AYA . Further reading: Cornelia Dimitt and J.

Hiranyakashipu Hiranyakashipu means “he who wears a golden robe” and is the name of an arrogant asura, or demon king, who ruled over and tormented all the worlds. Unfortunately, he had earned boons from the gods so that he could not be killed by man or beast, by day or night, indoors or outdoors. He had become so powerful through boons that he had usurped the sovereignty of Indra, the king of the gods. V ISHNU was called to take on an incarnation to deal with this cruel, ignorant tyrant. According to the myth Hiranyakashipu felt disgraced that his son, P RAHLADA , loved and wor- shipped Vishnu. He tried to force his son to reveal Vishnu’s whereabouts. Knowing that V ISHNU was everywhere, Prahlada pointed to a pillar. The demon king brashly kicked the pillar and out sprang the man-lion or (Narasimha) incarnation of Vishnu (see NARASIMHA AVATA R ), who ripped him apart. He was able to be killed here because the pillar was in the doorway (neither indoors nor outdoors), it was twilight (neither day nor night), and in the Narasimha form, Vishnu was neither man nor beast.

Hiranyaksha Hiranyaksha (lit. he with golden eyes) was a demon in the story of V ISHNU ’s VARAHA AVATA R (incarnation in the form of a boar). Hiranyaksha had in a previous life been doorkeeper at Vishnu’s palace in heaven. Because he had refused admis- sion to many sages, they cursed him, and he was reborn as the son of Diti, the mother of the ASURAS or antigods. His father was the RISHI Kashyapa and his brother was the demon H IRANYAKASHIPU , who was killed by Vishnu in the incarnation as man- lion or N ARASIMHA A VATA R . When the Earth was at the bottom of the sea in ancient times, Vishnu took the form of an enor- mous boar to lift it up to the surface of the waters with his tusk.

Hittleman, Richard (d. 1991) pioneer hatha yoga instructor Richard Hittleman was an American writer and teacher who popularized YOGA to a mass audience starting in the late 1950s. Hittleman was born in New York City and raised in the city’s Jewish community. He initially encountered yoga through a Hindu maintenance man who worked for his parents. He sought out additional teachers and during the 1940s devel- oped his own system of HATHA YOGA , which he began to market as “Yoga for Health.” In 1957 he opened the American Academy of Yoga in Coral Gables, Florida, but within a few years he relo- cated to California. In 1961 he initiated the first yoga television show. Through the show and more than a dozen books, he introduced the practice of yoga ASANAS (postures) to a huge audience. Over the next decades he would sell more than 8 mil- lion books. In 1964, in his small volume Yoga Philosophy and Meditation, he noted that many who had been attracted to yoga as exercise had also requested to know more about the teachings from which the practice arose. The request led to his writing several additional books on yoga philosophy and meditation, including Guide to Yoga Meditation (1969) and Yoga: The 8 Steps to Health and Peace (1976). These volumes, never as successful as his hatha yoga texts, exemplified ways hatha yoga could be used as an introductory tool to Hindu life and thought. In 1977, Hittleman established the Yoga Universal Church, based in Rapid City, South Dakota. He had accepted ordination and chartered his church through the Universal Life Church in Modesto, California, the famous mail-order denomination set up by Kirby Hensley. Hittleman closed the Yoga Universal in the early 1980s. He subsequently formed a new organization, Yoga Universal, in 1982, not connected with the Uni- versal Life Church. Yoga Universal continues to offer yoga-based events through Hittleman’s asso- ciates John Roddy and Mary Conley. Hittleman remained active into the 1980s. He died in 1991. His last years were spent fighting the Internal Revenue Service about back taxes. He died before the matter was settled, and the tax bill remains in litigation with his estate.

Accessed August 16, 2005. Holi The Holi festival takes place on full Moon day in the Indian month of Phalguna (February–March) in most North Indian areas. It is very ancient, probably celebrated (with the name Holika ) before the Common Era began. One early form of the celebration was a rite for married women to celebrate the happiness and well-being of their families. In some areas today, the rite acquires sexual and erotic elements that may point to an origin in spring fertility rites. Sexually explicit songs may be sung and men may brandish penis-shaped objects. One of the names for the Holi festival is Kamamahotsava or the cel- ebration for the God of Love. The most popular feature of the Holi festival is the throwing or shooting of colored water on everyone. Celebrants wear white garb so that all the varied colors are visible. In villages it was not uncommon in years past for men to imbibe large quantities of bhang, a potent marijuana drink. Three stories are told to explain the festival. In the first it is said that Holi is the day that S HIVA opened his third eye and turned the god of love into ashes. In another story Holika, the sister of the demon H IRANYAKASIPU , took P RAHLADA on her lap to kill him that day, but the devotee of V ISHNU survived unharmed. Finally it is said that there was an ogress Dhundhi who troubled children in an ancient kingdom, until the shouts of the mis- chievous boys of the town (something heard often on the festival of Holi) made her run away, since she was, through a curse, made vulnerable to the taunts of children.

Holy Shankaracharya Order (est. 1974) The Holy Shankaracharya Order was founded in 1974 by Swami Lakshmy Devyashram (d. 1981), a disciple of Swami S HIVANANDA S ARASWATI (1887– 1963). Swami Lakshmy had started on a spiritual path alone when she met the late Shivananda, who taught her the techniques to enter samadhi (the highest state of mystical consciousness). The meeting occurred in a vision, which convinced her that she should travel to the Poconos and con- tinue under his tutelage there. In 1969, she took the vows of the renounced life and was ordained by Swami Swanandashram into the Holy Order of Sannyasa, the same spiritual order in which Shiva- nanda had been ordained. In the early 1970s, Swami Lakshmy estab- lished contact with the ancient S HANKARACHARYA O RDER headquarters at its monastic complex in Sringiri, India. In 1974 she was selected Maha- mandaleshwari or great overlord of the Holy Shankaracharya Order in the United States. By this time a small group of Indian Americans had begun to attend services at the temple’s property in rural Pennsylvania. Having purchased property in Virginia, she began building a second ash- ram-temple there, completed in 1977. In 1978, Jagadguru Shankacharya Abhinava Vidyateertha Maharaj traveled from his seat at the Shanka- racharya Order at Sringiri to visit and satisfy himself of the accomplishments of the Ameri- can Shankacharya Order. Subsequently, additional Indian families began to accept the leadership provided by Swami Lakshmy. Responding to a request by the order in Srin- giri, Swami Lakshmy established a shakti peetam (monastery), called Sri Rajarajeshwari Peetam. As Swami Lakshmy attracted students to her teach- ings the ashram grew, and new instructors and teachers were ordained. They serve the order as guides for the different activities and programs developed to serve others.

The success of this undertaking further convinced Indian Hindus that although an American, Swami Lakshmy could lead. Her leadership has also paved the way for more women to become accepted as leaders in other spiritual camps. In 1981, Swami Saraswati Devyashram, a disciple of Lakshmy, was ordained as her succes- sor. She assumed authority shortly before Swami Lakhsmy died. A trailblazer herself, she, much as Swami Lakshmy had, maintained and enriched the outreach program. Swami Saraswati is responsible for a new center in Tucson, Arizona. During 1982, a winter heritage camp was established there. In 1988, Saraswati Devyashram retired and passed her lineage to Swami Parvati Devyashram. In early 1991, she moved the Holy Order from Pennsylvania to Rush, New York (near Roches- ter). It continues as a small organization of pri- marily Indian American Hindus.

The exact requirements for its performance are detailed in the 13th chapter of the S HATAPATHA B RAHMANA . The sacrifice could be performed for various purposes, but it was usually a means to demonstrate the king’s power. The chosen horse would be left to run loose for one year. The horse would be followed by a large contingent of the king’s army, which would be charged to subdue whatever land the horse entered. At the end of the year, the horse would be sacrificed at a large festival. The B RIHADARARANYAKA U PANISHAD within the Shatapatha Brahmana begins with a meditation upon the sacrificed horse as the universal reality and dwells upon the esoteric interpretation of this sacrifice. This sacrifice was performed by many kings throughout Indian history, probably for the last time in the 18th century. Further reading: Julius Eggeling, trans.

In the V EDAS of the A RY - ANS there is no mention of image worship, and it seems unquestionable that the image worship of later Hinduism is a Brahminization or Vediciza- tion of a common indigenous practice. In India, icons are made from special materi- als—specially selected and shaped stone, metal, or wood. Icons are installed in temples or other locations with special rituals. First, the icon is consecrated and brought to life. Usually, this involves the transfer of the power of the divinity from a container, a clay pot with water and a palm frond in it, through a string that is tied to the icon. MANTRAS are used to empower the icon or bring the divinity to life within it. Bare stone is not by itself an icon; only when the deity has been implanted within it does the image gain potency. Once the life breath ( PRANA ) has been established in the iconic deity, its eyes are painted in or finally formed; this prepares the icon for DARSHAN , the meeting of its eyes with those of its worshippers. An anthropomorphic icon is treated in its context as a royal human being—awakened early in the morning, sung to, bathed, clothed, fed, fanned, and entertained. Such activity is carried out throughout the day until the deity is put to bed. Icons that do not have a basically human form, such as the S HIVA LINGAM , are usually treated the same way, as though the god where present in them. When a temple or icon is decommissioned, another careful ritual must be performed to remove the life from the image, lest it become angry at not being treated properly.

Indo-American Yoga-Vedanta Society (est. 1971) The Indo-American Yoga-Vedanta Society was founded in 1971 when His Holiness Sri Swami Sat- chidananda Buaji (b. 1890) settled in the United States. The swami had been visiting and teaching in North America and Europe since 1948. Satchidananda was born with a crippling birth defect, for which there was no medical treatment at the time. His parents were told he would not survive to adulthood. However, they allowed their son to be raised by a teacher and yogi, Swami Maharaj. Maharaj treated him with herbal remedies while teaching him HATHA YOGA in incremental stages to straighten out his dis- figurement. Buaji began to heal. By the time he was a young man he had been successfully cured of his disability and was also a master of YOGA . He dedicated his life for a number of years to the Divine Life Society founded by Swami S HIVANA - NDA S ARASWATI . When he began to travel he allowed himself to be the subject of scientific studies researching how the body functions. He revealed considerable prowess in masterful demonstrations of yoga for the public. As an elderly man he settled in the United States and founded the Indo-American Yoga-Vedanta Society, headquartered in New York.

Indonesia For approximately 1,500 years the chain of islands today known as Indonesia were a part of what was known in the subcontinent as Farther India. Indian merchants began trading Indonesian spices with the West during the days of the Roman Empire. Indian-style royal courts were established on several of the Indonesian islands, with major courts in Java and Sumatra. Hinduism developed (and declined) differently on the islands of Bor- neo, B ALI , Java, and Sumatra. As early as the fourth century C . E ., both Bor- neo and Sarawak were centers of both Buddhist and Hindu worship, as evidenced by statues from this period created in the Tamil style. Unlike Java and Sumatra, Borneo never developed a signifi- cant dynasty, and most of the surviving cultures there have until recently retained their indigenous forms. Hinduism can be found only among the few Indians who live there. During the 14th century the Majapahit dynasty of Java occupied land outside its borders and extended the scope of Hindu influence to a south- ern portion of Borneo. On other islands, indig- enous populations remained virtually untouched. Papua-New Guinea/Irianjaya and the Philippines were untouched by the Indianization of Indone- K 194 Indian calendar 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 194 12/14/06 9:28:46 AM"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"sia. True Brahminic Hinduism was to be found only among the aristocracy of Java, Sumatra, and Borneo. The common people either retained their indigenous folk religions or blended them with Hindu features. The result was a form of Hindu- ism quite different from that in India. The arrival of Islam caused the Hindu states to collapse. The royal courts of Java fled to Bali, leav- ing Bali as the only remaining Hindu state, even though pockets of Hindu belief and practice can still be found on Java and Sumatra. After the collapse of Hindu states, Javanese Hin- duism survived without a Brahminic tradition and became an amalgam of older indigenous religions, Shaivite Hinduism ( see S HAIVISM ), and Mahayana Buddhism. The result is a type of Hinduism that is similar in some ways to the folk religion found in Bali. However, Hinduism in Java has lacked a royal court and a Brahmin caste for centuries and has become primarily a folk religion in Hindu guise. All priests are laymen and not Brahmin. Javanese Hinduism includes ancestor worship and belief in nature spirits, both malevolent and benevolent. The latter are often associated with ancestors and tend to be the ancestor spirits of each immediate family. Shiva is associated with the god of the Bromo volcano. The various gods are not seen to dwell in the temples, but rather on the mountains; the gods are ritually called out of the mountains into the temples. Popular culture in Indonesia often includes puppet plays enacting scenes from the R AMAYANA and the M AHABHARATA . Recently a resurgence of Hinduism has appeared throughout Indonesia, resulting in the Pasek movement, the S AT YA S AI B ABA movement, and the Forum Hindu Dharma Indonesia. These new movements are more con- sistent with forms of Hinduism found in India, including several types of yoga; the older tradi- tions with their emphasis on ancestor worship are considered backward by many.

He is associated with the thunderstorm and is said to hold a lightning bolt in his hand. Many early Vedic hymns tell of his battle with the snake demon, Vritra, in the course of which Indra splits a mountain to release the terrestrial waters that Vritra has held back. Indra also fights a demon named Vala in order to release the “cows of the dawn,” perhaps indicating that he was the creator of daylight. Indra’s enemies are the Dasas and Dasyus; these have often been taken to refer to the indig- enous tribes of India, but the context is not at all clear. At times the terms can best be translated as “enemy,” and at times they are seen to be mytho- logical beings. In the Vedas Indra is also known as a great drinker of Soma, an intoxicant used in the Vedic ritual. S OMA itself is seen as a god. Indra is frequently invoked ritually in Vedic ritual. There are more hymns to him in R IG V EDA than to any other god. Sometimes he is invoked along with A GNI (the god of fire), probably link- ing the main divinity of the heavens, Indra, with a primary terrestrial deity, Agni, who is also the messenger of the gods. The Vedic tradition often mentions Indra’s wife, Indrani. Post-Vedic mythology gives Indra the white elephant A IRAVATA as a mount to ride. Eventually Indra loses his supremacy and begins to be challenged and even ridiculed. K RISHNA pro- tects his village from Indra by holding a mountain up as an umbrella to keep away his rains. Indra is cursed for consorting with a sage’s wife (A HALYA ) and is afflicted, in one version of the story, with 1,000 vaginas, which are then changed into 1,000 Indra 195 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 195 12/14/06 9:28:46 AM"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"eyes to justify his common Vedic epithet “thou- sand-eyed one.” Further reading: Jan Gonda, trans., The Indra Hymns of the Rig Veda (Leiden: E.

Its original Sanskrit name was Sindhu. This river became Indos in Greek and eventually gave its name to the country of India. The ancient Per- sians pronounced the name as Hindu, so that the people living there came to be called Hindus. The Indus was one of the two largest rivers mentioned in the V EDAS ; it was included in the ancient list of the “seven rivers” praised by the Vedic sages. It was along the Indus River in 1924 that Sir John Marshall, director general of the British Archaeological Survey, unearthed a previously unknown culture, which was dubbed the I NDUS V ALLEY CIVILIZATION . Later work by Sir R. E. Mor- timer Wheeler at Harappa and others at Mohenjo- Daro showed it to be an extensive and elaborate city-centered culture dating from as far back as 3600 B . C . E . Further reading: Shane Mountjoy, The Indus River (Philadelphia: Chelsea House, 2005). Indus Valley civilization The Indus Valley civilization (c. 3600 B . C . E . to 1900 B . C . E .) was one of the largest civilization complexes in the ancient world. Excavations at the primary sites of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa show that the civilization stretched at least from the lower to the middle reaches of the Indus River, now almost entirely in Pakistan. First excavated by Sir Mortimer Wheeler in 1921, the remains show a highly developed city culture with grana- ries, bath houses, city planning, sculpture, and a form of writing. Most important for the history of Hinduism, there are elements that foreshadow later develop- ments in the religion. Several artifacts seem to indicate goddess-oriented worship. These godlike forms, interestingly, closely resemble those exca- vated in Neolithic Europe. Among the Indus Valley artifacts are numer- ous seals, possibly used for commercial purposes, which depict animals, humans, and possibly gods and goddesses. One of these seals seems to show a female divinity being worshipped in a tree, resem- bling very much the later worship of YAKSHAS , or tree beings. One artifact that has garnered a lot of attention is a depiction of a seated figure with an erect penis and a buffalo style headdress. This figure has been called Proto-S HIVA and linked to the later concept of Shiva as Pashupati or lord of the animals. The relationship between the Indus Valley remains, later V EDIC culture, and the A RYANS has been the subject of much controversy. Most modern Western scholarship dates the Rig Veda, India’s oldest extant text, to around 1500 B . C . E ., comfortably after the fall of the Indus Valley civili- zation. Some, particularly in India, however, seek to find in the Indus Valley the earliest Aryan and Vedic culture. Two facts complicate this claim of a Vedic Indus Valley civilization. First, the Rig Veda barely mentions city life. Most Vedic hymns dwell on horses and herds of cows; none of them even men- tions a large building, let alone any feature that might be associated with advanced city life. More importantly, the Vedas frequently mention large horses pulling men in chariots. Archaeological research indicates that large horses are not indig- enous to India, but are of Middle Eastern genetic stock. Large horse remains have been found in the northern Punjab, where the Vedic people are believed to have lived, but not a single verifiable K 196 Indus 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 196 12/14/06 9:28:46 AM"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"find has been made at any Indus Valley site—only remains of the smaller native Indian horse. Undoubtedly, certain Hindu traditions may trace back to the Indus Valley civilization. Recent research has shown that elements of Indus Val- ley culture survived and spread in western and central India several centuries after 1900 B . C . E ., previously believed to be the end date for the civilization. Additional research will probably find more examples of continuities in Indian traditions, particularly ceramic and pottery tradi- tions. Cities did not emerge again in India until 800 B . C . E ., so there is no reason to believe that the historical cities owed their existence to this early civilization.

Intergalactic Culture Foundation (est. 1981) The Intergalactic Cultural Foundation was founded in Los Angeles in 1981 by Sri Swami Shyam Paramahansa Mahaprabho, an Indian guru with a mission to the United States. The founda- tion was initially known as the Lovetrance Civili- zation Center, but the name was changed in 1986 to reflect the institute’s new focus. Four sections were created to advise students along specific paths of spiritual aspiration, defined by personal proclivities and strengths: the path of the heart, the path of intellect, the path of action, and the path of reflection. The foundation has published prolifically. Its periodicals include Hindu Digest, Golden India, and Enlightenment Connoisseurs Newsletter. Their publications catalog includes over 100 books, as well as correspondence courses, videos, and audio cassettes. Sri Swami Shyam has made speaking and teaching tours across the United States and has created the International Galactic Chronicles lecture series. By 2002, Swami Shyam had pro- duced 2,000 pages of his own commentary on the Srimad Bhagavatam and 1,500 pages of his viewpoints on Yoga Vasistha, Viveka Chudamani, and the U PANISHADS , and 70 audio discourses on the Bhagavat Katha. The headquarters of the foundation in the United States is in San Pedro, California. Inter- national headquarters is in Rishikesh, India. A number of electronic books are free.

He then spent years in retreat in the H IMALAYAS and emerged, having overcome the limitations of death. He would become known over the centuries as the immortal Babaji (the same personage introduced to the West by Para- mahansa Y OGANANDA in his Autobiography of a Yogi ). According to S. A. A. Ramaiah, in 1944 Babaji saw the need for an organization through which he could contact his devotees throughout the world. Thus, in 1951 the International Babaji Krija Yoga Sangam was established with Ramaiah as chief administrator. Ramaiah became a model in the 1960s for those interested in yogic methods; he traveled to the United States and demonstrated in scientific tests that he had control of a variety of bodily functions. For example, he could vary his body temperature by 15 degrees in either direction from the norm of 98.6 degrees. Ramaiah founded a mission in America with monks and disciples from India. They opened their headquarters in Norwalk, California. Kriya centers, sometimes called sadhana centers, were established for the more highly developed forms of yoga that had a rigorous method. These were generally set up in rural locations so as to enhance the experience of contemplation and MEDITATION for attendees. In Imperial City, California, Ramaiah founded a shrine to Ayyappa Swami, a holy figure from the PURANAS , ancient sacred Hindu stories. Since 1970, each December the disciples conduct an annual pilgrimage from the shrine to Mount Shasta in Northern California, a distance of some 500 miles. In India the Sangam operates the KBYS Holis- tic Hospital and Colleges of Yoga Therapy and Physiotherapy, located in Athanor, Tamil Nadu.

International Meditation Institute (est. 1970s) The International Meditation Institute in Kulu, Himachal Pradesh, India, was founded by Swami Shyam (b. 1924), an Indian teacher who taught meditation in Canada in the early 1970s. There he developed a following of enthusiastic devotees who returned with him to India. They bestowed upon him the unofficial title of SWAMI , although he is a householder, with a wife and five children. When Shyam was a young man, he expe- rienced an altered spiritual state that left him forever a changed person. That space of pure consciousness, which he named Shyam Space, was described as pure existence and pristine consciousness where one drops the mortal self, becomes detached from the mundane world, and identifies with the pure Self. This perspective is usually expressed of terms of ADVAITA (non-dual) Vedanta, a form of Hindu thought that forms the infrastructure of various yoga techniques for enlightenment. Today, disciples of the institute live in inde- pendent group houses near the MEDITATION center, which they visit for meditation and teaching. Swami Shyam’s teachings have been taken to other areas of the world. Centers now exist in Taiwan, the United States, Europe, New Zealand, Israel, and Japan. The North American headquarters is in Montreal.

International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) (est. 1966) The International Society for Krishna Conscious- ness ( ISKCON ) was founded in 1966 by the Krishna devotee and Vedic scholar Swami Prabhupada B HAKTIVEDANTA (1896–1977). He entered New York City at age 69 in 1965, when the U.S. quotas on immigration from Asia were abolished, and quickly attracted a following of young men and women by chanting the Hare Krishna mantra ( Hare Krishna / Hare Krishna / Krishna Krishna / Hare Hare, / Hare Rama / Hare Rama / Rama Rama / Hare Hare ). The first ISKCON temple was established in a tiny New York storefront at 26 Second Avenue, and from here the movement spread quickly, first throughout North America, London, and Ham- burg, and then all over the world. In just over a decade Bhaktivedanta Swami had established 108 Krishna temples and published 70 volumes of books, more than 100 million copies of which were distributed by his disciples, who in the late 1970s numbered in the thousands. ISKCON’s teachings are based exclusively on Bhaktivedanta Swami’s translations and explana- tions of classical Hindu scripture, particularly the B HAGAVAD G ITA and the B HAGAVATA P URANA . ISK- CON sees itself theologically as representing the monotheistic central core of Hinduism. According to this position the absolute truth is a supremely powerful being, K RISHNA , and all individual souls are of the same spiritual nature as Krishna, but never equal to him. By chanting the Hare Krishna mantra, which was introduced 500 years ago by Sri Krishna C HAITANYA (1486–1533), believed to be an incarnation of Krishna, the individual soul can reawaken its dormant love for God and at the time of death return to the spiritual realm to serve Krishna eternally in full bliss and knowledge. All other Hindu deities are seen as either subservient demigods, such as D URGA , S HIVA , and B RAHMA , or direct expansions of Krishna, such as V ISHNU and Narayana. Members of ISKCON are strict lactoveg- etarians and offer their food to Krishna before eating. Such offered food is called prasadam or the Lord’s mercy. Practitioners living in temple ashrams are expected to rise early for religious observances (known as aratis ) in the temple, the first starting at 4:30 A . M . During these ceremonies devotees sing Sanskrit songs while dancing before elaborately decorated forms of Krishna and his consort, Radha. After chanting the Hare Krishna mantra on beads and worshipping a form (or murti ) of Bhaktivedanta Swami, the morning pro- gram ends with a class based on a verse from the Bhagavat Purana. Ceremonies and observances are standardized in all temples throughout the world. ISKCON grew rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s but has seen a recent decline in membership, attributed by some observers to the controversies surrounding the leadership succession after Bhak- tivedanta’s death and the creation of subsequent reform movements.

According to IRM, all future disciples within ISKCON were supposed to revere Bhaktivedanta Swami as their GURU , not any successor. However, shortly after Bhaktivedanta Swami’s demise on November 14, 1977, these ritviks ignored the directive; instead, they divided the world into 11 zones, each claim- ing to be the guru or spiritual successor in a dif- ferent area. By early 1978 the 11 ritviks had begun to initiate disciples on their own behalf, acting as gurus for the movement. Over time, a number of the gurus suffered law- suits, suicide, and other problems. The movement was plunged into confusion and acrimony. By the mid-1980s the Governing Body Commission (GBC), which managed ISKCON, issued a new interpretation of Bhaktivedanta Swami’s direc- tive. What he had really wanted, it said, was for all disciples to become initiating gurus, not just the 11 ritviks. Today new gurus are added to the roster via a majority vote by the GBC at its annual meetings in Mayapur. Currently ISKCON gurus number around 80. IRM contends that both the zonal guru system and its replacement multiple-guru system are unauthorized innovations. Citing GBC resolu- tions and management directives approved by Bhaktivedanta Swami, the IRM insists that ISK- CON will continue to flounder as long as it fails to comply with the orders of Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. The IRM has grown quickly in the few years of its existence, claiming members and temples on every continent, including the ISKCON temple in Bangalore, the largest ISKCON temple in the world. It publishes an international magazine, Back to Prabhupada, and an electronic newsletter. They have also met with considerable opposition from those supporting the current multiple-guru system in ISKCON. The IRM’s followers consist of both current and former ISKCON members, ISKCON Life Members, and members of the Hindu community at large. The IRM’s ultimate goal is to rebuild an ISKCON movement operating just as Bhaktive- danta Swami intended, with him as the sole guru and authority. Further reading: Swami A. C.

International Society of Divine Love (est. 1975) Swami H. D. Prakashanand Saraswati (b. 1929) was born into a B RAHMIN family in A YODHYA , India. His early life was fraught with intense religious feelings, and as a youth he became a reclusive mystic so that he might find God in the silence. He took the vows of SANNYAS (renunciation) at age 20 from his guru, Jagadguru Krupalu Swami of Pratapgarh. He spent the next 20 years as a wandering mendicant in the Himalayas and in the forests of central India, ending in Braj, the reputed earthly home of Lord K RISHNA . In 1975, emerging from his solitary life, he established the Interna- tional Society of Divine Love. Later on he traveled to America and founded a home for devotees and disciples. By 1981 Swami Prakashanand, who had begun to be thought of as a distinguished sage and a saint, conceived of creating a global mission movement. Swami Prakashanand is of the lineage of the great Vaishnavite sage of West Bengal Sri Krishna C HAITANYA (1485–1553).

Communication between the visible and invisible is taken for granted and is an essential factor in many types of Hindu devotion. Chai- tanya is assumed to be in charge of his lineage even today. Devotees of the society believe Krishna to be the ultimate and highest God. Krishna is written about in the Mahabharata and, especially, in the B HAGAVAD G ITA . According to the Gita, Krishna has the divine ability to disguise himself and give teaching and counsel while appearing to be someone else. His teaching to A RJUNA in the Gita has become one of the sacred texts of the path of BHAKTI YOGA , which emphasizes his loving activ- ity; dedication to Krishna is considered a devo- tional pathway to enlightenment. This devotional approach is expressed in Prakashanand’s writings based on the Vedas, Upanishads, and Bhagavata Purana. Among the significant practices of this approach is chanting the name of God while offering oneself to Krishna as a devotee. The society has members in India, England, Ireland, Singapore, New Zealand, and Australia. During the 1990s the Society of Divine Love constructed its main Western temple and ashram complex in Austin, Texas, which was dedicated on October 8, 1995.

International Yoga Federation (est. 1965) The International Yoga Federation is a loose con- federation of YOGIS and YOGA associations; it is administered by the World Yoga Council, founded in 1965 by Mahavatar Kirsha Kisore Das at Ben- gal, India. The council is composed of grand yoga masters for each continent: Asia, America, Africa, Europe, and Oceania. The presidency rotates across continental representatives. In 2005, the executive office was located in Buenos Aires, Argentina. After 2006, the executive work rotates to Europe. International Yoga Fellowship (est. 1980s) The International Yoga Fellowship has grown out of the work of Swami Satyananda Saraswati (b. 1923), a former disciple of Swami Shivananda Saraswati (1887–1963). Satyananda took the vows of the renounced life ( sannyas ) in 1943 and subsequently spent 12 years at Shivananda’s Divine Life Society based in Rishikish, India. He then spent nine years wandering India in pursuit of divinity. In 1964, the year after Shivananda’s death, Satyanananda founded the Bihar School of Yoga, and to honor his guru and his teachings, established the Shiva- nanda Ashram on the shores of the G ANGES . Here, Satyananda continued to pursue his guru’s ideas that everyone should have access to YOGA and spirituality, despite caste, marital status, or other challenges. He also explored the possibilities of a tantric path to God ( see TANTRISM ). As did his guru, Satyanananda believed in outreach programs to share their teachings. His missionary focus took him far and wide, first throughout India, then to other destinations. During the 1970s, he founded 10 ashrams in India. However, his more significant missionary activity occurred outside India. The develop- ment of the ashrams abroad had begun after his 1968 world tour to disseminate his teachings. Leaving India he encouraged missionary activ- ity in Ireland, England, Greece, France, Sweden, Colombia, Australia, and Indonesia. Encouraged by the response, he founded the International Yoga Fellowship.

First, Llewellyn Publica- tions in St. Paul, Minnesota, published a major work by Swami Anandakapila (aka John Mum- ford), who had been a major supporter and stu- dent of Satyananda in Australia. The publication of Sexual Occultism became the springboard of Mumford’s 1976 tour to teach tantra and pro- mote its study. Not long afterward, a New York publisher released Yoga, Tantra and Meditation by Janakananda Saraswati, a teacher of Satyananda’s work in Scandinavia. Meanwhile, in 1965, students and disciples of Satyananda began to migrate to the United States, taking their teachings with them from India. The new immigrants formed small gatherings. In the 1980s, Swami Niranjannan Saraswati (b. 1960) began to organize ASHRAMS for the International Yoga Fellowship in the United States. On October 28, 1980, he formed Satyanandan Ashrams USA as an affiliate of the mother organization in India. Niranjananda stayed in America to help build the work. In the summer of 1982, the American group was visited by Swami Amritananda, a major female leader in the fellowship. Her trip was fol- lowed not long afterward by Satyananda’s first tour of North America. By the time of Satyananda’s American tour, he had long since developed his idea to include a complete system of tantric yoga, which begins with awakening of the KUNDALINI energy and includes sexual intercourse as a means of blending the male and female energies. Bliss is the ultimate reward for successful disciples of the so-called left-hand path. The International Yoga Fellowship is reported to be one of the largest organizations teaching yoga. It is not always easy to find practitioners in the West, as most members live quietly in ethnic communities, but there may be tens of thousands of people affiliated in North America. Interna- tional headquarters remain at the Bihar School of Yoga in Bihar, India, where the fellowship’s jour- nal, Yoga, is published.

Isha Upanishad The Isha Upanishad appears in the White Yajur V EDA ; it constitutes the Veda’s last chapter (unlike most Upanishads, which are found within the B RAHMANAS of the Veda). Isha literally means “lord” or “ruler,” and the Upanishad clearly has theistic overtones. It is a short Upanishad of only 18 stanzas. The Isha opens with a stanza describing the world as “indwelt by the Lord” ( ishavasya ). Stanza 5, frequently quoted, describes the BRAH - MAN or ultimate reality: “It moves. It moves not. It is far and it is near. It is within all this; it is outside all this.” This attempts to show the incomprehensible infinitude of the ultimate. Also quoted often is verse 11, which states that the path of ritual and the path of knowledge of brahman are complementary. The cryptic verses 9, 12, 13, and 14, which speak of the relation- ship between higher knowledge and ignorance, have been frequently explicated by the classical commentators.

Isherwood was born into a well-to-do fam- ily in Cheshire, England. He was educated at Repton School and Corpus Christi College at Cambridge, though he did not finish his degree program. In 1925 he reestablished a friendship with his fellow writer W. H. Auden, whom he had met in prep school, and, along with Ste- phen Spender, would constitute the so-called Auden Gang of angry young writers who made their mark on the English literary scene in the 1930s. Isherwood’s initial contributions were his novels, All the Conspirators (1928) and The Memorial (1932). In 1939 Isherwood moved to the United States and began to write for Hollywood films. At this time he became associated with the V EDANTA S OCIETY and became a disciple of Swami Prabha- vananda, who headed the Los Angeles center. An emergent pacifism, fed by his experience in Ger- many during the 1930s, was integral to his adopt- ing advaita V EDANTA as a philosophical-religious perspective. Over the next several decades, he assisted Prabhavananda in preparing translations of Hindu texts and wrote several books on Vedanta himself. His edited volume, Vedanta for the Western World (1945), later issued as Vedanta for Modern Man, was arguably his most lasting contribution. Among his later works was an autobiographical volume describing his relationship with his teacher, Prabhavananda, My Guru and His Disciple (1980). Beginning in 1953, Isherwood lived with his significant other, Don Bachardy. His 1964 autobio- graphical novel A Single Man represented his public acknowledgment of his gay life. He later became involved in various gay-rights efforts. His last novel mixed his Hindu and gay experience. A Meeting by the River (1967) tells the story of a bisexual movie producer who tries to stop his younger brother from taking vows as a Hindu monk.

(1918– ) yoga teacher Bellur Krishnamachar Sundararaja Iyengar was born on December 14, 1918, in the small village of Bellur in the Kolar District of Karnataka state in India, during the worldwide influenza pandemic. His mother had an attack of influenza while car- rying and birthing Bellur. Both of them miracu- lously survived, but the child was left with a weak constitution, and he often suffered from malaria, typhoid, and tuberculosis. Bellur was the 11th of 13th children, 10 of whom survived. His schoolteacher father, Sri Krishnamachar, died of untreated appendicitis when Bellur was nine years old, leaving his family in a state of poverty. His mother, Sheshamma, was known to be simple, kind-hearted, and religious in a highly orthodox way. Bellur’s poor health and lack of financial resources affected his education. He struggled to stay well enough to pass exams and to collect funds to pay for his high school education. In 1934, at age 15, he went to live with his sis- ter in Mysore. His brother-in-law, the famous YOGI Sri T. Krishnamachar, was in need of someone to perform yoga ASANAS (postures) at the Yogashala, the school of yoga. Bellur was initiated into the G AYATRI M ANTRA and began to learn yoga practice from his brother-in-law, which slowly helped him to overcome his maladies. He began to train students at the school and soon ended his formal education in order to devote his energy to yoga instruction. He won certificates in the elementary, intermediate, and advanced diploma courses in yoga. In 1937, Krishnamachar sent the young Bellur to Pune, India, to teach yoga. His commitment to a disciplined practice grew, as did his conviction not to publicize or beg for work or recommenda- tions. He was devoted to living a yogic life as long as God willed. In 1943, Iyengar married Ramamani; they had five daughters and one son. Although the 1950s continued to be financially challenging, Iyengar began to have contact with eminent personalities, such as the spiritual leader J. K RISHNAMURTI , the freedom fighter Jayaprakash Narayan, Achyut Patwardhan (commandant of the National Defense Academy), Prime Minis- ter Nehru, and the violinist Yehudi Menuhin. Iyengar trained Menuhin in yoga, which helped him to have better control over his violin. This special friendship, begun in 1952, continued over time and gained Iyengar great respect in the West. From the 1960s onward, Iyengar traveled abroad regularly to train students and perform demonstrations. In 1975, Iyengar opened the Ramamani Iyen- gar Memorial Yoga Institute (RIMYI) in Pune, named after his wife. His eldest daughter, Geeta, and son, Prashant, are actively involved in teach- ing yoga there. Iyengar has based his teachings on the tradi- tional eight limbs of yoga as presented in the Y OGA S UTRAS by P ATANJALI , written over 2,500 years ago. His first book, Light on Yoga, explains Patanjali’s philosophy while introducing Iyengar’s emphasis on body, mind, and spirit integration. This work, first published in 1966, has been translated into 18 languages.

Jain festivals True to their more austere nature and image, the festivals of the Jains (see J AINISM ) are much less exuberant celebrations than those of the Hindus. Jains in fact distance themselves from the more raucous festivals of Hinduism such as H OLI . One of their religious days is devoted entirely to silence— Maun Ekadashi, or the eleventh of the month. This observance is celebrated in the bright part of the lunar month Margashirsha (Novem- ber–December). It should be noted that there are also Hindu festivals, such as the Magha Mela at Prayag (A LLAHABAD ), which are observed with vows of silence.

In both these festivals books are cleaned and repaired and manuscripts are recopied. Most important for the Jain festival cycle is the time called Chaturmas, the four months of the rainy season, when Jain monks traditionally do not travel, so as to prevent injury to water beings and other small creatures that emerge only in the monsoon. Paryushan is an eight-day observance for Shvetambaras during these four months. It is a time of fasting and concentration on purifica- tion for the lay person. One of the central events of Paryushan is the recitation of the Kalpa Sutra by monks. The final day of the festival includes a ceremony of communal confession and asking of forgiveness of creatures for the harm that may have been inflicted over the year. The Digambara equivalent to Paryushan is called Dashalaksanaparvan, the Festival of the 10 Religious Virtues. It is conducted in the temples. The T ATTVARTHA S UTRA is recited and homilies are delivered relating to the 10 virtues outlined in that text. Divali (Dipavali) is celebrated by Jains, but the lights of the festival are intended to commemo- rate the final liberation of Mahavira. As among the Hindus, however, worship of L AKSHMI is per- formed (by laypeople only) in order to promote prosperity. Another festival celebrated by both major sects of Jains is Akshayatritiya (Undying Third), celebrated in the bright half of Vaishakha (April– May). It is a commemoration of a gift of “undying merit” to R ISHABHA , the first T IRTHANKARA in our half-era. Further reading: John E. Cort, Jains in the World: Reli- gious Values and Ideology in India (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001); Paul Dundas, The Jains (Lon- don: Routledge, 1992). Jainism The name Jain derives from jina (victory); Jainism is thus the religion of the “victorious one”—any human being who by his or her own effort has conquered the lower passions and thus become free of attachments to things. Most Jains believe that their faith was founded by a lineage of 24 teacher/saints, the T IRTHANKARAS . The Tirthan- karas have provided human beings with a means to cross the ocean of SAMSARA (the cycle of exis- tence) by providing a vessel, namely, the DHARMA , or teachings. Most scholars consider the 24 Tirthankaras to be mythical or at best semimythical beings. For example, one of the 24, Nemi, is said to have lived for 1,000 years. They believe that Jain history really begins with P ARSHVANATHA (c. 900 B . C . E .), the son of the ruler of B ENARES (Varanasi). A successful soldier and husband, at the age of 30 Parshvanatha withdrew from his elite existence to become an ascetic. As he wandered India, he gath- ered followers to whom he advocated four laws of life—do not take life, do not lie, do not steal, and do not own property. He built the first Jain mon- astery on Mount Sammeda, where he died; it is a prominent pilgrimage site for Jains. More important for the development of Jain- ism was Vardhamana (c. 599–c. 527 B . C . E .), later known as M AHAVIRA , the last of the 24 Tirthan- karas. Mahavira lived most of his life without clothes, the most visible symbol of the renounced life. After some 12 years as an ascetic, he managed to overcome worldly passions and become the Victor. Jains describe his state of mind as kevala- jnana, or perfect perception, knowledge, power, and bliss. He lived another 30 years traveling around India and attracting people to his life. A large lay community emerged to supplement the small monastic community created three centu- ries before by Parshvanatha. Mahavira reorganized K 208 Jainism 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 208 12/14/06 9:28:48 AM"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"the Jain movement with followers assuming one of four roles: monks ( sadhu ), nuns ( sadhvi ), lay- men ( shravak ), and laywomen ( shravika ). Mahavira articulated the primary principles by which Jains live: nonviolence ( AHIMSA ), or the refusal to cause harm to any living things; truth- fulness ( satya ), or the speaking only of harmless truth; nonstealing ( asteya ), not to take anything not properly given; chastity ( brahmacharya ), or refusal to indulge in sensual pleasures; nonpos- session ( aparigraha ), or detachment from people, places, and material things. Monks took these as their law of life, while laypeople simply adopted a less austere existence. Several hundred years after Mahavira, the oral tradition that had until then guided the Jain community began to be written. According to Jain tradition, Mahavira had 11 chief followers, or ganadharas. All these disciples are said to have achieved omniscience after 12 years of mendicancy. The last of the 11 to reach omniscience were Indrabhuti Gautama and Sud- harman, who were left to lead the fledgling Jain community. It is they who probably created the various rescensions of the extant Jain canon; they also figure prominently as the chief questioners of Mahavira in the canonical dialogues. Around 300 B . C . E , Jainism split into two basic communities, the S HVETAMBARAS (clothed) and the D IGAMBARAS (unclothed). Each subsequently divided into a number of sectarian bodies.

JAIN BELIEFS Jains picture a three-story universe with humans residing in the middle level. The earthly realm is the realm of human action. Humans should be seeking the state of MOKSHA (liberation), pictured spatially as the top of the universe; there they can remain in a state of eternal bliss and peace. How- ever, the average person goes to the lower realm at the end of earthly existence, to be punished for his or her misdeeds. Each being has a jiva, or soul: humans, ani- mals, and even some plants. This soul accumu- lates KARMA as dust clings to an object. Karma is considered a physical reality and can be removed only by the most concerted right conduct, which must eventually include strict asceticism. Only then can the karmic matter be scraped off the soul so that the soul may go to the top of the universe and exist in eternal effulgence forever. The three “jewels,” main tenets of Jainism, are right knowl- edge ( samyagjnana ), right action ( samyakcaritra ), and right view ( samyagdarshana ). One important concept for Jains is bhavyatva — a special quality that most souls possess that makes it possible to reach salvation through a permanent escape from the bonds of KARMA and rebirth. Bhavyatva is viewed as something of an inert possibility, which may or may not be trig- gered by the karma of the person who possesses it. The Jains, unlike most Hindus, accept the idea that some souls will never escape the round of birth and rebirth; they may lack bhavyatva, or they may lack the ability to activate it. Today, a person wishing to adhere to the Jain community must profess belief in the teachings of the jinas and simultaneously renounce his or her attachment to any other religion. The con- vert then vows (1) not intentionally to take life ( ahimsa ); (2) not to lie or exaggerate ( satya ); (3) not to steal ( achaurya ); (4) to refrain from marital unfaithfulness and unchaste thoughts ( brahmacharya ); (5) to limit accumulation of possessions and give away extras ( aparigraha ); (6) to put bounds on oneself so as to decrease the possibility of committing transgressions ( dik ); (7) to limit the number of both consum- able and nonconsumable items in one’s posses- sion ( bhoga-upbhoga ); (8) to avoid unnecessary evil ( anartha-danda ); (9) to observe periods of MEDITATION ( samayik ); (10) to observe periods of self-imposed limitations ( desavakasika ); (11) to live periodically as an ascetic/monk ( pausadha ); and (12) to support the monastic community ( atithi samvibhaga ). The vows imply that Jains will be vegetarians (most do not even consume eggs) and will refrain from vocations that include the taking of life. The more strictly observant would not, for example, take up farming, which might lead to killing of living creatures (worms, insects, etc). Jains prefer business and various intellectual activities. The monastic life is most preferred. Jains see themselves as following a path to SELF - REALIZATION . Steps along the path include the gaining of right perceptions ( mati ), clear scrip- tural knowledge ( sruta ), supernatural knowledge ( avadhi ), clear knowledge of the thought of oth- ers ( manahparyaya ), and omniscience ( kevala ). Those few who attain kevala are considered to be perfected ones ( siddhas ). The path generally takes many lifetimes. Ultimately, the fully realized soul moves to the top of the universe to reside forever in a karma-free condition. The many Jain temples are sites of worship and veneration of the jinas, which assist on the road of SELF - REALIZATION . These may be identified with the Jain symbol, a swastika above which are three dots and a half Moon. The symbol predates the German Nazi swastika by many centuries and bears no relation to it. Inside the temples one generally finds statues of one or more of the Jain saints, who in Digambara temples are usually pic- tured in the nude.

C . E . and became formalized around 300 B . C . E ., when the Jain scripture was written. The division between monks who wore clothes and those who did not eventually resulted in the separation of the Digambaras from the Svetambaras. The Digambaras teach that nudity is integral to the teachings of Mahavira; they believe that monks should be devoid of any possessions, including clothes, and should not want to pro- tect their bodies from the elements. They depict Mahavira in complete nudity, without any orna- mentation, with downcast eyes. They also teach that Mahavira never married and was celibate throughout his earthly existence. Digambaras also teach that the words of Mahavira, reputedly contained in the 11 A NGAS of the Jain canon, were lost forever at the end of the fourth century B . C . E . That loss, they believe, caused the Jains to write the rest of their scrip- tures. They refuse to accept the 11 angas that are considered canonical by the Svetambaras, which now form part of the 41 sutras. Finally, the Digambaras do not allow women to join the order of the renounced life, as women are not believed to be qualified for the austerity demanded of renouncers. In contrast, the Svetambaras teach that some of the original Tirthankaras lived as clothed per- sons. They emphasize that Parshvanath, the saint immediately prior to Mahavira, wore white robes. Mahavira, they note, did not become an ascetic until his parents died and he fulfilled his neces- sary family duties. The Svetambara believe that the words of Mahavira were not lost and may be found in the 11 surviving Angas of the Jain canon. They also believe that women can attain saint- hood, noting that at least one of the Tirthankaras, Malli, was a female. Today the Digambaras are found mostly in the southern part of India, especially in Mysore state, while the Svetambaras are primarily to be found in Gujarat and Rajasthan. Meanwhile, the modern Indian government has made various attempts to limit public nudity by the Digambara monks. CONTEMPORARY JAIN COMMUNITIES Today, in India, most Jains are found in business and trade. Unlike S IKHS and B UDDHISTS , they have not attempted to distinguish themselves from Hindus, and the two communities have a working relationship. The austere Jain lifestyle tended to slow the spread of the community beyond India. Besides, many taught that travel by monks by any means other than foot was immoral. One of the earliest appearances of a Jain outside India occurred in 1893, when Virchand Gandhi made a presentation at the W ORLD P ARLIAMENT OF R ELIGIONS in Chi- cago. A few other individuals, such as Champat Rai Jain, who traveled to England in the 1930s, appeared in the West through the early 20th cen- tury, but real communities did not emerge until the 1950s, when migration to England began. By the end of the century there were some 30,000 Jains in the United Kingdom, most from Gujarat, who organized the Federation of Jain Organisa- tions in the United Kingdom. Migration to North America followed in the 1970s, and now centers can be found throughout the eastern half of the United States plus Texas and California. These joined with Canadian centers in the Federation of Jain Associations in North America. Several Jain teachers in the United States founded organizations that attempt to spread Jain teaching among non-Indians: the International Mahavir Jain Mission is centered in New Jersey and the J AIN M EDITATION I NTERNATIONAL C ENTER with several branches in the United States and Canada. Jains may also be found in Australia, Sin- gapore, Hong Kong, and Japan. Further reading: John E.

Jayadeva (late 12th–early 13th centuries) Sanskrit poet As with most poets, scholars, and saints in the Indian tradition, very little is verifiably known about the life of Jayadeva, the prolific Sanskrit writer best known for the devotional work G ITA - GOVINDA . All that we know is gleaned from hints in the author’s poetry, hints that often are subject to several interpretations. Some say that he was born in Kenduli village on the Ajaya River in the Birbhum District of West Bengal. Others say his birthplace was Kenduli village on the Praci River in the Puri District of Orissa. Other claims are made for the same village in Bihar and Maha- rashtra. It is evident that the poet was a Vaish- navite. Jayadeva’s patron while he composed the Gitagovinda was King Lakshmanasena of Bengal (1179–1209 C . E .). Jayadeva, as did many poets before him, became a saint for Vaishnavites. In the 17th cen- tury Nabhadas wrote a Hindi text called Bhakta- mala, which retold the lives and miracles of many poet-saints, including Jayadeva. The stories are meant to inspire worship of V ISHNU , while show- ing that the poet-saints, as ideal devotees, were themselves worthy of worship. In fact, they refer to the poet-saints as AVATARS of Vishnu, in the looser sense of the term—they are incarnations of the god for the purpose of showing all people the way to devotion. The following is a selection from the hagiog- raphy: 1. When Jayadeva was still a child, his par- ents had to surrender their house to a neighbor. One day it caught fire; as soon as the boy ran inside, the fire extinguished itself. 2. It is said that Jayadeva was left as an orphan as a child. He lived in rags and survived on water alone, but he sang the praises of God wherever he went. He was said to be so ascetic that he preferred not to write poetry, but instead to perfect his soul. It is said that he did not even carry writing implements, which he felt were luxuries. He would not even sleep under the same tree two nights in a row, lest he become too attached to earthly delights and fail to think of God. 3. In order to lure him away from asceticism and to get him to write the Gitagovinda, God arranged for Jayadeva to marry a wife, Padmavati. She taught him human love, so that he could write about the divine love of Radha and K RISHNA . 4. Once in devotion to Krishna Jayadeva made a pilgrimage to Puri. On the way he fell down, fainting from thirst. It is said that Krishna in the form of a cowherd rescued him, gave him water and milk, and fanned him. It is said that Jayadeva composed his poem, the Gitagovinda, after having a direct vision of Krishna playing his flute. 5. Once Jayadeva went to the home of a merchant to be his GURU or teacher. On the way home he was accosted by two K 212 Jain Meditation International Center 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 212 12/14/06 9:28:49 AM"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"thieves. Jayadeva told them to take what they wanted. They did so and then cut off his hands and feet and threw him into a pit. Jayadeva went into a trance, worship- ping God and thinking of the irrelevance of the body. The king happened to pass by as the mutilated Jayadeva was singing the songs of the Gitagovinda from the pit. When the king got him out of the pit and asked how he had come to have his hands and feet amputated, Jayadeva said that he had been born that way. The king asked to become Jayadeva’s disciple then began making obeisance to every devotee, giving service and alms to every SADHU or holy man. The thieves who had robbed Jayadeva heard of the king’s generosity and went to him. Jayadeva asked the king to take special care of them. The thieves, fearing a stategem, told the king that Jayadeva had lost his hands and feet in another court because of the evils he had committed there. Krishna could not bear hearing this calumny against Jayadeva and the earth opened up and swallowed the thieves before everyone’s eyes.

Jaya Sati Bhagavati, Ma (1940– ) American guru Joyce Green was born on May 26, 1940, the young- est of four children in a working-class Jewish family in Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York. Her father, Harry Green, ran a stand selling hot corn, and her mother was a legal secretary. The family was often impoverished and the mother died when Joyce was 13 years old. Joyce attended Lincoln High School but did not graduate. At age 15, she married Salva- tore DeFiore, an Italian Catholic businessman. She became a housewife and mother of three children. In 1972, Joyce learned a yogic breath disci- pline in a YOGA class and practiced the breath for seven days consistently. As a result, she was awakened to spirituality by a vision of Jesus Christ, who told her, “Teach all ways, for all ways are mine.” She was visited by Swami N ITY - ANANDA of Ganeshpuri, not in physical form, who became a teacher to her. In 1973 her guru N EEM K AROLI B ABA appeared to her, also not in physical form, and gave her teachings. As she deepened her appreciation of the teachings of these two Hindu masters, a group of students began to grow around her and she became known as Ma, or mother. In 1976 she founded Kashi Ashram in Sebas- tian, Florida, where she continues to teach in the Shaivite ( see S HAIVISM ) lineage of Swami Nity- ananda. The ashram is a residential community with members living on the campus and nearby.

Spiritual practices include MEDITATION , K ALI Y UGA , KIRTAN , and DARSHAN from Ma, and celebration of Hindu holy days. Kashi commu- nity also includes temples and shrines devoted to Judaism, S IKHISM , Christianity, and Buddhism. In 1990, Ma founded the River Fund, Kashi’s service organization, and inspired the founding of Mary’s House, a home for children who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In 1994, she founded the River House, a respite for those with AIDS and other life-challenging illnesses. She and her students work with indi- viduals who suffer from AIDS, homelessness, and abuse and those near death. She has become an advocate for those who have human immunodefi- ciency virus/AIDS (HIV/AIDS), for gay rights, and for the rights of women and minorities. Through the River Fund, which she founded in 1990, she and her students engage in service to communi- ties around the world. In 1996, Ma founded the Dattatreya Kali Saraswati Order of monks and SANNYASIS (renun- ciants). She has developed the teaching of Kali Yoga, a system of ASANAS (postures) drawn from ancient roots and adapted for modern times, as well as spiritual teachings in the traditions of KUNDALINI and tantric yoga ( see TANTRISM ). Kali Yoga emphasizes the divine feminine and selfless service to humanity. Ma teaches internationally and regularly gives satsang group teaching in Florida, California, and New York. Her interest in joining people of diverse faiths led to her nomination as a trustee in the Governing Council of the Parliament of the World’s Religions. She has worked with Tenzin Chogya, brother of the Dalai Lama, to establish World Tibet Day to honor the culture of Tibet and to raise awareness of the plight of the Tibetan people. Ma has taken an active role in the interfaith movement and is a delegate to the United Reli- gions Initiative. She serves on the advisory boards of the Institute of Religion and Public Policy and Equal Partners in Faith. Also an artist, Ma Jaya has created works illu- minating Hindu themes that have been shown in numerous galleries and museums. In 2004 Ma Jaya was honored by inclusion in the International Hall of Honor at Morehouse College, and she received the Inter-Parliamentary Paradigm of Peace Award, ratified by 26 governments around the world.

The role of jnana is developed in the philosophy of the U PANISHADS and most clearly outlined in the ADVAITA (non-dualist) philosophy of S HANKARA . Much thought and writing have focused on the nature of jnana in Indian tradition. Some see it as a cognitive function: once one understands the truth of the unity of brahman and the self intellectually, that is enough. Others require a realization of a mystic sort. V EDANTA has often been characterized as interested only in gaining jnana, but it has many paths that stress BHAKTI or devotion as the first step on the path toward the ultimate.

At 19, without money or a destination, he took a train to Cal- cutta (Kolkata). Political tensions and mass violence had bro- ken out in India at the time, and refugees were flooding into West Bengal by the thousands. During this time Rama worked for an aviation company in Calcutta; when offered a partnership in the company, he decided to leave and instead volunteer his services to help the refugees. Dur- ing this time he lived on a railway platform some- where close to the border of India and East Bengal (now Bangladesh). He soon became the leader of the entire volunteer effort, working more than 20 hours per day. A year later, as the inflow of refugees began to subside, Rama moved back to Calcutta. Here he turned down a government position in order to work for the rehabilitation of refugees. Rama chose to live alone on the fringes of Calcutta in an ASHRAM , where he learned classi- cal music, sitar, religious studies, and prayer. In the contemplative atmosphere he began to have visions. His MEDITATION , YOGA , and PUJA practices increased, and soon he knew where his life’s work was leading him. He lived in silence for close to a decade, focused on the goal of God realization. In those years he made many pilgrimages through- out India, but his “awakening” is attributed to the time he spent in a temple village near the source of the G ANGES River. In 1958, Rama was initiated into Vidyut San- nyas (lightninglike monasticism) in B ADRINATH in the H IMALAYAS and given the name Swami Amar Jyoti (eternal light). Now he was ready to com- municate to the world. He founded his first center, Jyoti Ashram, in Pune, in the state of Maharash- tra close to his mother’s home. In 1961 he was invited to the United States by a devotee; on this trip he gained a degree of popularity. In 1974, he set up the Sacred Mountain Ashram near Boulder, Colorado. A few years later he established the Desert Ashram in Tucson, Arizona, under Truth Consciousness, a nonprofit organization created to disseminate Swami Amar Jyoti’s teachings. He continued to travel and teach until his death on June 13, 2001. Jyoti Ashram is a pilgrimage site. It contains a memorial temple housing the remains of the swami.

He is revered by Muslims, Hindus, and Sikhs, although his work includes much social and religious criticism of Islam and Hinduism. The poet was born in B ENARES (Varanasi) into a weaver family who had recently converted to Islam. As with other poet-saints such as R AM - PRASAD and T UKARAM , the actual details of his life are not known for certain; it is not even known which of the poems attributed to him were authentically his. Indian poet-saints, particularly those who relied upon song to communicate, very quickly became legendary figures, the possessions of everyone. More important than the concrete details of these people’s lives or the verses that may be authentically theirs is the collective imagi- nation of them, which makes them part of the cultural consciousness and makes their writings a collective possession. It is understood from his verses that Kabir was illiterate, but in India this is less important than in the bibliophilic West. Real Indian tra- dition, the culture that occupied the center of Indian consciousness, was always oral and aural first. Written texts were the abode of scholars and pundits but less important for the transmission of tradition. Kabir was the disciple of the GURU Ramananda, a famous c. 15th-century teacher. A story tells how Kabir, a convert to Islam, tricked this ortho- dox Hindu into accepting him as a student. Kabir is said to have lain upon the steps that the guru always took in the morning to do his bathing and ablutions in the river. Tripping in the dark over the supine Kabir, the guru in fear uttered, “Ram! Ram!” This is, in fact, a MANTRA in and of itself, and so the crafty Kabir insisted he must be accepted as a disciple since he had heard the guru’s mantra. (It should be added that Kabir’s understanding of the mantra R AMA is not an orthodox one. For him the word did not designate the AVATA R of V ISHNU of that name, but was a divine “name” that leads one to an undifferentiated ADVAITA (non-dual) consciousness.) There exists a story, probably apocryphal and invented by Hindus, that Kabir was actually born of a B RAHMIN woman and set afloat in a basket on a pond to be found by a Muslim couple. Both Hindus and Muslims still claim Kabir as their own (while his words are included in the sacred books of the Sikhs, the Guru G RANTH S AHIB .) It is said that when Kabir died, Muslims and Hindus K 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 219 12/14/06 9:28:51 AM"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"confronted each other, each wanting to take the body for their own rituals. Before they could come to blows, however, they pulled up the shroud only to find there a heap of flowers, which they happily divided in half. There is hardly a person who grew up in North India over the last 400 years who has not been able to recite many verses of “Kabir” by heart. His work is deeply ingrained in the culture of North India. This said, his poetry combines highly eso- teric N AT H Y OGI symbolism, highly mystical non- dual devotion that envisions a “divinity” beyond any form or description, a deep criticism of the orthodoxy of both Muslims and Hindus, and a strong social critique of the hierarchy of Hindu society. In his poetry he again and again evokes the watchword Ram without any sectarian con- tent. It is a mantric word used to point toward the highest consciousness that sees beyond the veil or M AYA of this world. Kabir’s poems are found in the Guru Granth Sahib of the Sikhs ( see S IKHISM ); in the Panchvani, a compilation of sayings of five northern saints; and in the Bijak, an anthology attributed to Kabir alone. All of these were first published around the 17th century, although the Guru Granth Sahib in its formative stages may have contained these poems earlier. Further reading: P. D.

Kailash, Mount (Mount Kailas or Mount Kailasha) Kailash (from kelasa, crystal) is the name of a mountain peak about 18,000 feet up in the H IMA - LAYAS . It is sacred to both Hindus and Tibetan Buddhists. In Indian mythology it is seen as the abode of the Lord S HIVA and of K UBERA , the god of wealth and of the northern direction. Mythology places it to the south of Mount M ERU . Kailash is sometimes also said to be the source of the G ANGES River. Throughout history it has been an impor- tant Hindu pilgrimage site.

The term originated in the ancient S AMKHYA tradition and is important in the yoga tradition of P ATANJALI . Both living and dead per- sons may be in the state of kaivalya. It is a unique state where one becomes absorbed in the root- consciousness of the Self ( purusha ) alone. Bliss is not an element of traditional kaivalya. Further reading: M. N.

Kali The name Kali has two derivations. In the sense of “she who is black” it is from kala (black).

Kali is the most frightening of the goddesses and the most misunderstood by non-Hindus. Mythologically, she originates in the fury of the goddess D URGA and emerges physically from that goddess’s forehead. She has a terrible, frightening appearance. She is originally very black (though in modern depictions she is often lighter), usually naked, emaciated, with long disheveled hair. She wears a skirt of severed arms, earrings made of the corpses of children, and a necklace of human skulls. In one hand she holds a cutting instru- ment, in another the severed head of a man. She has long sharp fangs, bloody lips, and a bloody lolling tongue. In iconography Kali is often depicted as stand- ing upon the chest of the supine corpse of S HIVA , her nominal husband. She is known to frequent the burning grounds where burned and unburned corpses abound, where she is always accompanied by female jackals. She, as does D URGA , likes liquor, meat, and blood. There is little doubt that Kali is a fierce autochthonous non-Aryan goddess who has been absorbed into the larger Brahminized pantheon of Hinduism. Kali first appears in developed liter- ary form in the Devibhagavatam of the 11th to 12th centuries, where she is seen to be P ARVATI , wife of Shiva, who becomes completely black out of fury when battling the demons Shumbha and Nishumbha. She also appears in the 16th-century Devimahatmya, part of the Markandeya Purana; this is the source of the story that Kali emerged from the enraged Durga. Kali is most associated with eastern India, particularly Bengal. Her devotional literature and cultic followings began to proliferate as early as the 13th and 14th centuries. Bengal is the only state to worship Kali during the all- India festival of D IVALI . The medieval Bengali poet Ram Prasad is best known for his Bengali hymns in devotion to “Mother Kali,” and the modern Bengali Saint R AMAKRISHNA , who had perhaps the greatest influence in the West of any Indian spiritual figure, was known as a devotee of Kali alone. Devotion to Kali requires the utmost surrender and the ability to see that her chaotic and fearsome visage is only a barrier placed before the devotee, who must have the courage to seek the inner depths of her compassion and the SHAKTI or uni- versal power she represents. When one has accom- plished this step, one can learn to become Kali, as Sri Ramakrishna so clearly demonstrates. When one has learned to be her truth, then one’s con- sciousness and being are completely transformed The temple to the goddess Kali, in Dakshineshwar, Bengal, where Sri Ramakrishna served as a priest (Constance A.

Kali has been associated with tantric religious forms. T ANTRISM in this context focuses on the cremation ground; normative elements and prac- tices are frowned upon or forbidden. When one realizes the divinity within even the lowest reali- ties, within the rotting corpse, within the dark of the cremation ground, then one has learned to find the limit of time and one can began to see the secrets buried in the depths of reality. Then one can begin to experience Kali as the sweet, compas- sionate, nurturing mother that she is. Iconographically it is understood that Kali’s nakedness symbolizes the stripping away of illu- sion; the severed head is a symbol of her cutting away of the ignorance that binds one to the cycle of birth and rebirth. Kali’s lolling tongue is most often taken to indicate her anger, but some in India have taken it to be a gesture, like “biting the tongue” in shame.

Sanskrit poet Kalidasa is considered one of the greatest S ANSKRIT dramatists and poets. Little is known for certain about the life of the poet and dramatist Kalidasa. He appears to have lived in the time of the imperial G UPTAS , perhaps in central India, in what is now called Madhya pradesh. Three dramas are attributed to him: Malvikagnimitra, Vikramorvashiya, and Shakuntala. Malvikagnimitra begins as a story of political alliances toward the end of the Mauryan dynasty, but the political aspect is eventually equaled or overshadowed by the love affair between the princess Malvika and the prince Agnimitra. The drama Vikramovashiya tells how one of the celestial nymphs, or ASPARAS , Urvashi goes to live with her lover Pururavas thanks to his prowess or vikrama. It has been called a drama of “luster and brilliance” with no plot or real action. In the skeleton story the celestial nymph Urvashi falls in love with an earthly king, Pururavas. She loses her celestial status but is allowed to live with him. The play is graced with nature description, beautiful poetry, and supernatural effects. Abhijnanasakuntalam sometimes abbreviated to Shakuntala, is recognized as its author’s mas- terpiece. The heroine Shakuntala is the daughter of the celestial nymph Menaka and the sage Vish- vamitra. She is abandoned by her parents and is raised by the caring sage Kanva in his forest hermitage. The king Dushyanta finds the hermit- age and falls in love with the beautiful, simple maiden. In Kanva’s absence the lovers consum- mate a permitted “love marriage.” The king has to leave but gives Shakuntala his signet ring and promises to send someone for her in a few days. Shakuntala soon realizes that she is pregnant. While Shakuntala daydreams about her lover, the irascible sage D URVASAS visits; enraged at being ignored, the sage curses her that her lover will forget her. Shakuntala loses the king’s signet ring, her only proof of their meeting. She visits the king in her pregnancy, but he swears he has never seen her. Finally the ring is discovered in the belly of a fish and is taken to the king, who then remembers. Eventually the king flies back to the hermitage in a celestial chariot provided by I NDRA and sees a boy playing there who he recognizes must be his son. The drama ends happily. Among Kalidasa’s great poems is Raghuvamsha, a look back at the dynasty of R AMA , the hero of the R AMAYANA . The poem describes the lives of all of the ancient progenitors of his line. He also wrote Kuma- K 222 Kalidasa 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 222 12/14/06 9:28:51 AM"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"rasambhava, a consummate masterpiece about S HIVA and P ARVATI and their young son, Kumara. Another of his great works is Meghaduta (Cloud messenger), a charming poem about the God Kubera’s sending a message of consolation to his lover far away by means of a cloud messenger. Nature here is beauti- fully described. Finally, Ritusamhara, a short lyric uncertainly ascribed to Kalidasa, includes a beauti- ful description of the four seasons and the amorous moods appropriate to each.

Kali Yuga All of the Y UGAS or ages in the Indian tradition refer to throws in an ancient game of dice. Kali (spelled differently in Sanskrit from the goddess of that name) is the “four,” the worst throw of the dice, comparable to “craps” in the Western dice game. Our age is understood to be the Kali Yuga, in which TA M A S , the worst aspect of nature, pre- dominates. Trickery, envy, and even the murder of holy persons are the norm in this era, as are fatal disease, fatal hunger, fear, and instability. Kings in the Kali Yuga are angry and debauched. People are short-lived and short in stature. Money, power, pleasure, and falsehood reign. B RAHMA , V ISHNU , R UDRA , and the Sun are all worshipped in the Kali Yuga.

Today we are in the K ALI Y UGA , or Iron Age, a period of decline. It was preceded by the ages of gold, silver, and bronze. After the end of the K ALI Y UGA and a short hiatus, a new age will begin: the age of truth (K RITA Y UGA ), when all the wick- edness, strife, and dissension of this era will be replaced by righteousness. It is understood that this age will be ushered in by Kalki, the future incarnation or AVATA R of V ISHNU , riding on a mag- nificent white horse. Further reading: Shakti M.

He is found in the V EDAS as a divinity, but his character was developed in the Indian epics and PURANAS . Most famously Kamadeva is known to have been burned to ashes by the third eye of Lord S HIVA . In that tale, Shiva was in a state of MEDITATION and ascetic withdrawal. The gods des- perately wanted him to marry and have progeny, because they knew that his offspring would be Kamadeva 223 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 223 12/14/06 9:28:51 AM"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"able to defeat the demon Taraka who was plaguing them. They sent the god of love to awaken sexual desire by shooting him with his flower arrows. Shiva became angry at Kamadeva for his presump- tion and he incinerated him with his third eye. Upon the mournful request of Kamadeva’s wife, R AT I , Shiva relented and restored the god of love to life, but without a body. This is why he is invis- ible. In other versions of the story, Kama is not revived, but rather reborn as Pradyumna, the son of K RISHNA .

Kamakhya Situated near the top of Nilachal Hill in Guwa- hati, overlooking the majestic Brahmaputra River, Kamakhya Temple is a famous pilgrimage site. It is the most important of the SHAKTI PITHAS , or centers of devotion for the GODDESS . According to Hindu mythology, when S HIVA carried the body of his wife, S AT I , her YONI fell to Earth, where the Kamak- hya Temple stands today. According to local mythology, it is here that Shiva descends to unite with the goddess’s yoni. Thus, Nilachal Hill is the symbolic site of Shiva and the goddess’s eternal sexual union and is the primordial or original seat of the goddess. This association points to Kamakhya Temple’s strong tantric tradition ( see TANTRISM ). It remains one of the holiest pilgrimage sites in India for tantra practitioners, who associate it with the powerful creative force of the mother goddess. It is a center of tantric worship and transmission of tantric traditions by devotees, adepts, and GURUS . The image of the goddess Kamakhya (also called Kamarupa, the shape or form of desire) at the shrine is actually a stone, the matri yoni or “Mother’s mound of Venus.” Steep stone steps lead from the entrance of the temple to a cave deep in the earth, where Ma Kamakhya sits along- side stones of Matangi (S ARASVATI ) and Kamala (L AKSHMI ). Kamakhya herself is a form of Shodashi, or Tripura-Sundari, one of the DASHA MAHAVIDYAS , each of whom has a dedicated temple on the hill. Kamakhya is also associated through various Hindu and tantric traditions with S RI L ALITA and P ARVATI . In June, during the height of monsoon season, the spring that flows inside the cave is said to turn to menstrual blood, signifying the start of one of the holiest festivals in India. In fact, the water that washes over the stone at this time of year has a reddish color due to its chemical components. During A MBUVACHI (Ameti) Festival, the temple is closed for three days, as are all the temples in the area; then it is believed to be inauspicious to start new ventures, cook food, study scripture, plant seeds, or till the earth. On the fourth day, the doors open to tens of thousands of scarlet- clad pilgrims, who carry flowers, sweets, and other offerings. The goddess’s blessing is given in the form of angadhak (ritu), the water that is the menstrual blood of the goddess, and angabastra, a piece of the red sari draped over the stone during its menstruation. The origins of the first temple on this site are shrouded in mystery. Some say it was built by the demon Narakasura, whom K RISHNA fought when he tried to marry the beautiful goddess Kamakhya (she foiled his plans by outwitting him). The orig- inal temple was destroyed in the 16th century by Mughal invaders and then rebuilt in 1665 by King Nara Narayana. This temple has a beehivelike structure, surrounded by carved panels pictur- ing figures such as G ANESHA , C HAMUNDA , temple dancers, animals, and women menstruating and giving birth.

Kama Sutra The Kama Sutra (Aphorisms on love) by Vatsya- yana, probably the most widely known of Indian texts, was written around the second century C . E . It consists of 1,250 verses. It is divided into seven parts, divided into 36 chapters, and further divided into 64 paragraphs. Legend says that the author Nandi originally wrote the Kama Sutra in 1,000 chapters, later abbreviated to 500 chapters by the poet Shveta- ketu. Babhravya, a descendent of the Panchalas (whose homeland is south of Delhi), abridged it still further to 150 chapters under seven heads or parts: Desire or Kama as a part of life; Sexual Intercourse; Acquisition of a Wife; the Wife; Wives of Other People; Courtesans and Prostitutes; the Arts of Seduction. The sixth of these parts was expounded by Dattaka at the request of the prostitutes of Pataliputra (Patna); the other parts were explained by Charayana (first part), Suvar- nanabha (second part); Ghotakamukha (third part); Gonardiya (fourth part); Gonikaputra (fifth part); and Kuchumara (seventh part). Given this confusion of authors, and the length and difficulty of the original material, Vatsyayana decided to compose his own work as a sort of condensation of all the previous efforts. A quote from the introduction to the Kama Sutra says that “this treatise was composed, according to the precepts of the V EDAS , for the benefit of the world, by Vatsyayana, while leading the life of a religious student at B ENARES [Vara- nasi], and wholly engaged in the contemplation of the Deity. This work is not to be used merely as an instrument for satisfying our desires. A person acquainted with the true principles of this science, who preserves his DHARMA [virtue or religious merit], his artha [worldly wealth] and his kama [pleasure or sensual gratification], and who has regard to the customs of the people, is sure to obtain mastery over his senses. In short, an intel- ligent and knowing person attending to dharma and artha and also to kama, without becoming the slave of his passions, will obtain success in everything that he may do.” The Kama Sutra ’s audience is clearly male and it is oriented toward the fulfillment of male desires, particularly the sexual. Even the chap- ter on courtesans is intended to guide them on how males are best pleasured. Parts of the book give details on how men might increase women’s sexual pleasure, but even this is framed in a male- centered way. A brief summary of the seven parts of Vat- syayana’s Kama Sutra is as follows: In Part I, Vatsyayana justifies the study of Kama, desire, against those who feel that it is not appropriate. They may argue, for instance, that the pursuit of prosperity, another of the sanctioned goals of life, requires giving up the pursuit of pleasure. Vatsyayana argues that pleasure is necessary for the natural maintenance of the body, although he adds that it must be sought in moderation. Part one also tells of 64 arts relating to pleasure that a young woman (and a wise man) should know; gives a detailed account of the pleasures and amusements of a citizen, such as gambling; and tells men what sort of women are appropriate for sexual intercourse. Part II gives all the details of sexual intercourse and its elements, such as kissing, biting, and role playing. Part III discusses courtship and marriage. Part IV prescribes the conduct of a wife in her husband’s absence and how she should act toward his other wives. Part V describes how a man might Kama Sutra 225 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 225 12/14/06 9:28:52 AM"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"gain the confidence of and seduce women other than his own wife. Part VI discusses the duties and activities of courtesans and prostitutes and advises them on how to earn more money; it also discusses the different classifications of prostitutes. Part VII discusses additional methods of seduction, includ- ing aphrodisiacs. There are two well-known commentaries on the Kama Sutra. Jayamangala or Sutrabhasya was written between the 10th and 13th centuries; Sutravritti was written somewhat later.

Kamban (c. ninth to 12th century) classical Tamil author Kamban is the author of the Tamil language Ira- mavataram (The Avatar of Rama), perhaps the most ornate and aesthetically pleasing of all the many versions of the R AMAYANA written in the regional languages of India. The details of Kamban’s life, as those of many other classical Indian authors, are uncertain. Even his name, which is not his given name, can be interpreted in different ways. The traditional account has him the son of Adita, a resident of Muvalur village in Tanjore District of Tamil Nadu. He belonged to either the drummer CASTE or the caste of hereditary priests in the K ALI temples. He mentions his patron, Sataiyan, in his verses. A con- temporary Chola king is said to have given him the fief of a place called Kambanatu (a possible source for his name) and the title of “king of poets.” Some believe that the poet was murdered by the Chola king himself out of jealousy for his fame. The extant manuscripts of the Iramavataram, varying from 10,000 to 12,000 verses in length, probably include interpolations. From the very beginning of the poem R AMA is presented as the AVATA R of V ISHNU ; he is referred to by Vishnu’s epithets throughout. This is quite different from the S ANSKRIT version of V ALMIKI , in which Rama is clearly associated with Vishnu only in the first and last chapters. In other ways, the story as told by Kamban is very much along the lines of Valmiki; in many places it is clear that the author is familiar with the Sanskrit version. Among the noticeable varia- tions is that Kamban omits the entire final chapter of the Sanskrit version (the Uttarakanda) of the Ramayana, which recounts a tale of Rama’s chil- dren and the history of the demon king R AVANA . When Kamban’s Ramayana ends Rama and S ITA live happily in the ideal kingdom. Also, although Kamban relates Sita’s abduction by Ravana, in his version Ravana cannot touch Sita, who is protected by a deadly curse. Finally, in the story of A HALYA , the maiden who was turned to stone on account of her dalliance with I NDRA , the curse that was put upon Indra varies between the two versions: in the Sanskrit tale he is cursed with the testicles of a goat; in the Tamil version he is cursed with 1,000 vaginas (which he begs the gods to transform into eyes—thus his epithet “the one with 1,000 eyes.”) Further reading: George L.

It has been an important South Indian religious and cultural center since well before the Pallava dynasty of the sixth to eighth centuries, when it served as the capital city. It also served as one of the Chola capitals in the ninth to 13th centuries and as a secondary Pandyan capital around 1000. The city has been influenced by V AISHNAVISM , S HAIVISM , and J AINISM . Between the fourth and sev- enth centuries Kanchipuram was also known as one of the great centers for Buddhism, and there are still vestiges there of the Buddhist presence. S HANKARA (c. seventh century) established one of his five original Mathas or site for monks in Kanchipuram. The city has a sizable Jain popula- tion today concentrated in an area known as Jain Kanchi, where there are many Jain shrines and a few quite remarkable ancient Jain temples. The oldest Hindu temples in Kanchipuram, dating from the seventh and eighth centuries, are the Kailasanatha temple devoted to S HIVA , and the V AIKUNTHA Perumal temple devoted to V ISHNU , both built by the Pallavas. Additionally, the Kamakshi Temple, dedicated to the goddess Kamakshi, dates from the same period. Notable also are two temples in the later V IJAYANAGARA style (circa 14th through 16th centuries): one of them dedicated to Varadara- raja (Vaishnavite) and also to Shiva in LINGAM form, and the other known as the Ekambaranatha temple, which has an ancient mango tree on its grounds.

Kanya Kumari Kanya Kumari (Virgin maiden) is a town of approximately 200,000 people at the tip of India at the meeting place of the Arabian Sea, the Indian Ocean, and the Bay of Bengal. The local goddess Kanya Kumari is considered by some to be a form of D URGA . The story goes that the god of Suchindram, a nearby town, was going to marry the goddess. The gods did not like this—if she married she would lose her powers to fight demonic forces. They asked the RISHI N ARADA to solve the prob- lem. When Suchindram was on the way to the ceremony, Narada made the call of a rooster. Thinking that he had departed too late for the ceremony Suchindram returned home and left the goddess in her virgin state. Because of this she was able to kill the demon Bana and protect her land. The seashore temple of Kanya Kumari is one of the most visited PILGRIMAGE sites in India today. Offshore, a newer temple to memorialize Swami V IVEKANANDA has also been created. The town has been a pilgrimage site since very ancient times, since it is mentioned in the aranyaka parvan of the M AHABHARATA , which took its current form by the second century C . E . (with some sections going back to perhaps the fifth century B . C . E .). Further reading: Francis X.

He is said to have passed on his knowledge to Asuri, who in turn passed it on to Panchashikha. According to the oldest commen- tary on the samkhya karika, a later text, Kapila was a “wise ascetic, . . . born of heaven, . . . and innately endowed with the four fundamental dis- positions of virtue, knowledge, renunciation, and supernatural power.” The story is told that Kapila, out of pity for suf- fering humanity, selected a B RAHMIN householder, Asuri, as an appropriate person to whom to reveal Kapila 227 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 227 12/14/06 9:28:52 AM"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"the knowledge of Samkhya. Kapila approached him as he was performing sacrifices (as he had been doing for thousands of years). Asuri would not listen. Only after being approached two more times did he relent and become Kapila’s student. Some sources say Kapila is the son of Svambhu- va’s daughter, M ANU , and P RAJAPATI ’ S son, Kardama. Other sources say that he may be an incarnation of V ISHNU who learned his wisdom directly from S HIVA ; as such he would then be known as HIRANYA - GARBHA , or lord of the world. There are numerous references to Kapila in the epics and later texts, which give him various powers and statuses.

Indian philosophy often contrasts the karma kanda (action aspect) of tradi- tion with its jnana kanda (knowledge aspect). Later, the term karma came to refer to the “law of action.” According to this ethical concept, the actions or karmas of individuals in their current births shape their lives in their next births. Finally, in the con- text of the B HAGAVAD GITA , karma yoga refers to a YOGA of action in the world without regard to its fruits. Mohandas Karamchand G ANDHI made the term karma yoga well known, as his political actions were all undertaken under this name. The Indian traditions of Hinduism, J AINISM , Buddhism, and S IKHISM all accept the notion of karma. Further reading: C. F. Keyes and E.

Karttikeya Karttikeya is the younger son of S HIVA and P ARVATI ; G ANESHA is the elder son. There are many versions of his life story, as is usual in Hindu tradition. In the best known version, from the PURANAS , Shiva accidentally spills his semen into fire (A GNI ). The fire is distressed because of the semen’s incred- ible power and asks the G ANGES River for help. She agrees and the semen is thrown into her cool waters. The Ganges waits 5,000 years for the seed to gestate and produce a child, but none comes forth. She goes to B RAHMA to ask for advice. He tells her to leave the seed in a vast grove of reeds for 10,000 more years. After that long period a child is indeed born in the reeds. As he cries out, the six krittika goddesses (the Pleides) vie with each other to be the first to nurse him. Because of their quarreling he develops six faces around his head to look at all of them at once. As he is reared by these six goddesses, he receives the name Kart- tikeya, from their names. Once the word spreads that this child is born, the god of fire suddenly renews his interest and wants to claim him. The Ganges also wants him. They go to Shiva and Parvati to settle the dispute, but this only creates complications, as the couple also want the child. They all agree to ask the child and to accept his choice. The boy, loving them all, becomes four versions of himself. The one named Karttikeya became son of Shiva, the one named Kumara becomes son of the Ganges, the one named Skanda becomes son of Parvati, and the one named Guha becomes the son of fire. Karttikeya is depicted iconographically with a peacock vehicle, some sort of weapon in his hand, and a rooster on his banner. At times he is considered unmarried, while other stories give him a wife named Devasena; in South India he has a second wife, Valli. Karttikeya is very popular in South India, where he takes the name Murugan along with his other traditional names.

Kashmiri Shaivism (est. ninth century) Kashmiri S HAIVISM includes the philosophies and practices of the ADVAITA (non-dual) Shaivite tradi- tions that flourished in Kashmir from approx- imately the ninth to the 13th centuries C . E . Kashmiri Shaivism describes ultimate reality as Paramashiva, or supreme Shiva, and teaches that nothing exists that is not one with Paramashiva. All of reality, with all of its diversity and fluctua- tion, is the play of this single principle. The two aspects of this single reality are inseparably united: S HIVA and S HAKTI . Shiva is the self-luminous, static consciousness, and Shakti is the dynamic, blissful power of awareness. Through their union, the universe is constantly established, sustained, and withdrawn. Kashmiri Shaivism also teaches that Para- mashiva is the true nature and Self of every human being. Through self-effort and divine grace individuals can know both their Self and the world around them as supreme Shiva. A being who lives with the constant experience of this is jivanmukta, liberated in this lifetime. Within Kashmiri Shaivism, the most crucial element of this journey to liberation is the relation- ship between the GURU and the disciple. The dis- ciple receives SHAKTIPAT , the descent of divine grace or power, from the guru. This essential initiation awakens the dormant spiritual energy within the individual called KUNDALINI Shakti, and ultimately leads to the realization of Paramashiva. The earliest texts of Kashmiri Shaivism have no known human authors and are considered revealed sacred texts. According to tradition, in the ninth century C . E . Shiva revealed to Vasugupta the Shiva Sutra, a text composed of aphorisms that presents the early teachings of Kashmiri Shaivism. The Spanda Karika, whose authorship is attributed to either Vasugupta himself or his disciple Kalat- tabhatta, expands upon the teachings in the Shiva Sutra. In particular, the Spanda Karika describes the nature of Paramashiva as spanda, the divine pulsation or vibration. Paramashiva’s nature is to expand and contract, and thereby to emanate and withdraw the universe on both a cosmic and a mundane level. A disciple can thus realize Shiva as his or her own nature by perceiving vibration as part of his or her own experience. Somananda and his disciple Utpaladeva developed Kashmiri Shaivism further by estab- lishing the teaching of pratyabhijna, the recogni- tion of Shiva as one’s own Self. They describe the experience of liberation as this recognition. Somananda first introduced this teaching in his work Soma Drishti, and Utpaladeva systemati- cally presented it in his writings, including the Pratyabhijnakarika. Kashmiri Shaivism reached its creative climax with the teachings of A BHINAVAGUPTA and his dis- ciple Kshemaraja in the 10th and 11th centuries. In his magnum opus, Tantraloka, Abhinavagupta encompasses almost every aspect of Kashmiri Shaivism and gives the most sophisticated and comprehensive expression of its teachings. Ksh- emaraja continued his work and made Kashmiri Shaivism more accessible to wider audiences through commentaries and digests. Kashmiri Shaivism has continued to influence and inspire people in India and throughout the world. Leading modern exponents include Swami L AKSHMANJOO (1907–91), who was raised and taught in the oral tradition of Kashmir, and Swami M UKTANANDA (1908–82), who traveled through- out the world sharing the teachings of Kashmiri Shaivism.

Kathakali Kathakali ( katha, story, kali, performance) is a special type of Indian dance-drama. It originated in the state of Kerala in South India more than 500 years ago. It combines drama, dance, music, and ritual. Characters with vividly painted faces and elaborate costumes reenact stories from the epics M AHABHARATA and R AMAYANA and the Puranas. The most popular stories enacted are “The Death of D URYODHANA ,” “The Story of Nala,” “The Fight between A RJUNA and S HIVA ,” and “The Story of Devayani and Kacha.” As has happened for centuries new stories are added to the Kathakali repertoire from time to time when they become sufficiently popular. In recent times stories from the Bible or Shake- speare have been added to appeal to modern audiences. The dramatic form is based, somewhat as opera is, on the notion that the audience is fully familiar with the stories being told. In the play the elaborately costumed actors (all male, even for female roles) do not speak; they pantomime the dialogue, while accompanists sing the lyrics. The language is an amalgam of Malayalam and S ANSKRIT . The traditional Kathakali show begins at night and lasts till dawn; in the modern urban context in India and abroad the plays last only several hours. The actors in Kathakali are always accompa- nied by drummers and singers; the lead singer controls the entire show with a special rhythm instrument. The story is conveyed purely through hand gestures ( MUDRAS ), facial expressions, and body movements. Complete control over facial muscles is a prerequisite for this demanding dramatic art form. It takes a minimum of eight to 10 years for a Kathakali dancer to become fully trained. The training is very demanding and includes the study of one of the traditional martial arts of Kerala to create stamina, con- centration, and physical flexibility. It also, not incidentally, prepares the actors for the many dramatic fight scenes in the epics. There are 24 main mudras in Kathakali and a number of less commonly used ones. Kathakali uses a set “color code” for the makeup of the characters. Noble characters such as A RJUNA have their faces painted green. Evil characters who have heroic roles will have green makeup with red marks on the cheeks. Very angry or very evil characters will have red makeup and a red beard. Women and mendicants have yellow painted faces. Hunters and forest dwellers have primarily black painted faces. As in most other classical Indian forms, such as B HARATA N AT YA M , facial expressions for Kathakali actors accord with the nine RASAS (sentiments): love, humor, com- passion, fear, disgust, anger, wonder, valor, and tranquility. With elaborate costumes projecting larger- than-life images, loud music with a heavy percus- sive element, and very vigorous dance steps that require great stamina and balance, the Kathakali is the most powerful of dramatic instruments: the audience is left not merely enthralled but often completely mesmerized. This art form had its roots in shamanic costumed possessions that were taken up by Sanskritic culture and adapted to the Sanskrit language and sensibility. The pri- mordial element, surviving from traditional pre- A RYAN Kerala culture, is quite palpable in these performances.

The work is the source for dozens of stories that have since been repeated over and over in various forms and versions within the Indian literary tradition, both in Sanskrit and in the vernacular languages. The work itself consists of 22,000 verses, more than the Iliad and Odyssey combined, divided into 18 books. The first section tells stories about how the collection itself was created—for example, the story of Gunadhya and the story of king Satava- hana. Among the many popular tales in the later sections are the story of Indra and King Shibi, the story of Urvashi and Pururavas ( see APSARAS ), the story of A HALYA (which appears in another form in the R AMAYANA ), and the story of the B RAHMIN and the mongoose. Still other tales include the story of Udayana, the story of Kadambari, and the story of the 10 princes ( Dasakumaracarita ). In the collection are stories of animals such as The Mouse Merchant; The Ichneuman, the Owl, the Cat and the Mouse, the Crane and the Crocodile, the Lion and the Hare; The Parrot Who Was Taught Virtue by the King of the Parrots; and The Ass in the Panther’s Skin. Many of these stories closely resemble Aesop’s fables in their structure and moral objectives. However, a large proportion of the hundreds of stories in this work are dedicated to the lives and adventures of kings, some of whom may have been historical, such as Satava- hana and Vikramaditya.

Katha Upanishad The Katha Upanishad is part of the Black Y AJUR V EDA . It is based on an ancient story of a young man, N ACHIKETAS , who is mistakenly sent to hell by his father after he questions his father’s gener- osity. When the boy reaches the realm of the god of death (Y AMA ), he finds no one at home. Since he, as a guest, is kept waiting, Yama offers the young, but very wise, boy three boons. The story of the three boons of the god of death forms the narrative core of this Upani- shad. The first boon the boy asks for is that he be returned to the upper world to live with his father. The second boon he asks for is the secret of preserving good works. His final request is to learn the secret of overcoming continuous rebirth. Death gladly assents to the first two requests, giv- ing the boy the Nachiketas fire, named for him, to fulfill the second wish. When asked for the secret of ending rebirth, however, Death tries to dissuade the boy with offers of wealth and other boons. When Nachiketas persists he is given the secret of Ultimate Reality or the BRAHMAN . Further reading: Swami Nikhilananda, trans., The Upa- nishads (New York: Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center, 1975); S.

Kauravas The 100 Kauravas (descendants of K URU ) are the chief villains in the great Indian epic the M AHAB - HARATA . They also descend from the ancient king Bharata. These sons of the blind king Dhritarashtra, led by Duryodhana, the eldest, conspire to steal the throne of the land from its rightful heirs, their cousins the P ANDAVAS . Kaurava is only a convenient designation, as the Pandavas are also descendents of King Kuru via Pandu, Dhritarashtra’s brother. The story tells that Dhritarashtra’s wife, Gand- hari, receives a boon that she will bear 100 sons. She is pregnant for two years, when she hears that Kunti, wife of Pandu, has given birth. She then aborts herself, yielding a hard ball of flesh. The ball is sprinkled with water and severed into 101 parts, which are incubated and put into sepa- rate pots. From these come forth the 100 sons of Gandhari and Dhritarasthra, plus one daughter named Duhshala. (Dhritarashtra also incidentally has one bastard son, Yuyutsu.) After his older brother Pandu dies, Dhri- tarashtra becomes regent and his sons (always called “the 100” although in actuality 101), led by Duryodhana, begin plotting to destroy their cousins, the five Pandavas. The story of the epic revolves around the struggle for the kingdom between these sets of brothers, culminating in the “Mahabharata” war, in which the Pandavas are triumphant, but with frightening losses.

The answer to the initial question is found in the second stanza: “That which is the hearing of the ear, the thought of the mind, the voice of speech and also the breathing of breath, and the sight of the eye” is the thing by which everything comes about. This short Upanishad, with about 34 stanzas, tells a story (vss. 14–28) about the gods’ first encounter with the BRAHMAN . They approached the unknown being to see whether they could overpower it, but all were defeated. I NDRA himself could not overcome it, but on his way back the goddess Uma told him that the being was brah- man. He passed on this information to the rest of the gods, and was recognized as the greatest of the gods because of this knowledge. Uma somehow does not get the credit.

Sant Keshavadas was born on July 22, 1934, on the Hindu holy day of Ekadashi, in Bhadragiri, a small village near Mysore in southern India. He was named Radha-Krishna by his parents, Ven- kataramana Pai and Rukmini Bai, At his birth, a priest cast his horoscope and predicted that the child would spread the devotion of God around the world. At age 11, he received a mystical vision of Lord V ISHNU , which inspired him to sing the word of God wherever he went in order to spread sanatana DHARMA “the eternal way”—a synonym for Hinduism—across the world. In 1956, Radha-Krishna earned a B.A. from Mahatma Gandhi Memorial College, and two years later he received an L.L.B. at the Udipi Law College. After graduation he married Srimathi Rama Mataji, who joined him in his mission and helped him establish an ashram in Bangalore, Sant Keshavadas (1934–1997), prominent teacher of Vedanta philosophy and yoga, known for his entranc- ing music and storytelling (Courtesy Temple of Cosmic Religion, Oakland) Keshavadas, Sant 233 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 233 12/14/06 9:28:53 AM"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Karnataka, in the 1960s. Between 1959 and 1966, Keshavadas made 47 pilgrimage tours of India, singing and speaking about his teaching. In 1966, at the K UMBHA M ELA festival in Allahabad, Keshavadas met the immortal B ABAJI , who encouraged Keshavadas to go to the West to establish a following for the cosmic religion. Keshavadas and his wife (called Guru Mata) took this advice and traveled that year to Ger- many, England, and New York City to spread the message of sanatana dharma. Their message was received enthusiastically in the West and Keshavadas continued to make frequent trips across the world over the next 30 years. He established several ashrams in India, including his headquarters at the Vishwa Shanti Ashram in Bangalore, an ashram in Trinidad, and one in Oakland, California. Keshavadas taught that mysticism or direct experience of God is the future of religion. On the basis of this belief he established the Temple of Cosmic Religion. He believed that humanity is preparing itself for cosmic consciousness, but that the ego prevents each person from reaching transformation to a higher consciousness. His main teaching focused on overcoming doctri- nal differences by emphasizing unity among all religions. He offered many different approaches to unity but taught that the path to enlighten- ment requires repetition of God’s holy name. His teachings include BHAKTI , deity worship, JNANA YOGA and V EDANTA as understood through Swami V IVEKANANDA . Keshavadas was an accomplished composer who wrote and recorded over 6,000 songs. He often used music, storytelling, philosophy, and humor in his teachings. He spoke eight languages and lectured widely to audiences in the East and West. He also authored over 50 books includ- ing The Bhagavad Gita and the Bible, a work that explores the teachings of love and wisdom in Hinduism and Christianity. During the 1980s he organized construction of the Bhagavad-Gita Mandir (temple) near his Bangalore ashram. All 700 stanzas of the Bhagavad Gita are carved in black marble there, in English, Sanskrit, Hindi, and Kannada. On December 4, 1997, at the age of 63, Kes- havadas passed away while on a lecture circuit in Visakhapatnam.

Some have explained their frank depiction of myriad sexual positions as being tantric in origin, as TA N - TRISM is known to stress sexual ritual. One legend gives a more personal explanation of the erotic artwork. The mother of the king who built the temple had been seduced by the Moon god and became a social outcast.

They are usually sung in groups of people, accompanied by an accordionlike instrument called the harmo- nium. Percussive instruments are sometimes used as well. Kirtan singing may be the most common form of collective devotional worship in India. Both men and women participate. Singing alterna- tively slows down and speeds up until the singers are in a trance, ideally experiencing the presence of, or even union, with the divinity. Both kirtans and BHAJANS are songs of worship sung in devotion.

Klein, Jean (c. 1916–1998) Western teacher of yoga and advaita Vedanta Jean Klein was an important 20th-century teacher of non-dual V EDANTA , who focused on the direct experience of the Self rather than the gradual, progressive method of enlightenment. Klein was born around 1916 into a family that loved music, painting, and art. He describes the family as “harmonious.” His childhood was spent in Brno (Czechoslovakia), Prague, and Vienna. He studied music and medicine in Vienna and Berlin, where he explored the relationships among thought, feeling, and muscle function. He became a physician, and undertook the study of Eastern philosophies, particularly the works of Mohandas Karamchand G ANDHI , Lao Tse, Chuang Tsu, Tagore, Coomaraswamy, J. K RISHNAMURTI , and Sri Aurobindo. After reading Gandhi, he became a vegetarian. He also read Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, and the Western Sufi René Guénon. Guénon’s writing on cosmology and tra- dition proved a turning point in Klein’s life. What struck him was the distinction Guénon made between traditional and tradition—the principle transmitted from teacher to disciple through ini- tiation: “This awoke in me the feeling that it was actually humanly possible to become fully inte- grated and awake in the whole.” He left Germany in 1933 and spent World War II in France secretly helping thousands escape from Germany. After the war, he left Europe for India seeking an environment that would wel- come self-inquiry. There he met a Pandit, a profes- sor of S ANSKRIT in Bangalore, Atmananda Krishna Menon, who became his teacher and who initi- ated him into the wisdom of ADVAITA (non-dual) V EDANTA . He also deepened his long study of YOGA by spending several months with Krishnamacha- rya, the famous hatha yoga teacher of South India. Although Klein could do ASANAS (postures) quite well, he was not attracted to yoga of the physical body. He wanted to understand how the body can become more subtle, more energized, more expanded; he began to see that the real body is Klein, Jean 235 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 235 12/14/06 9:28:54 AM"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"energy and light, not the bone-muscle structure that we assume to be the body. As Klein taught asanas and yoga, he always gave the energy body priority, stressing that all postures could be done independently of the physical body. After he had lived intensely with this understanding, one day the teaching became a lively reality, a bright and integrated truth. Klein’s teaching sprang from his insight into the nature of being and existence. He is regarded as a prominent teacher of advaita in the 20th century and an embodiment of the non-dual awareness he taught. His teaching is “direct,” cutting through all experiences, states, and paths of purification that depend upon progressive or sequential methods. He encourages students to experience existence directly. According to Klein, the progressive way may produce many delight- ful experiences, but all these are support for the ego, which is thus kept alive in a more and more subtle way. Klein’s direct approach says that our real nature cannot be known or experienced as an object. When this is clearly understood there is a letting go, a giving up of trying to achieve, to become, to find, or to understand. This letting go is the beginning of real maturity and openness to our true nature. For 40 years, Dr. Klein responded to invita- tions from all over the world to share his knowl- edge. He lived in Europe and the United States and died in February 1998 in Santa Barbara, California. He is the author of several books in English and other languages. Klein created the nonprofit Jean Klein Foun- dation in 1989 to help in the process of dissemi- nating his teaching. Based in Santa Barbara, the foundation holds meetings that are open to the public and continues to publish newsletters. It has published Klein’s journal Listening and plans to publish several books and dialogues of Klein’s.

Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health See D ESAI , A MRIT . Kripalu Yoga Kripalu Yoga is a form of HATHA YOGA originally developed by Amrit D ESAI (b. 1932) in the United States. The Indian-born Desai had been teach- ing yoga in the United States through the 1960s. However, in 1970, a significant development occurred in his work. Immediately after a visit to his teacher, Swami K RIPALVANANDA (1913–81), and while engaged in his regular practice, he experi- enced a spontaneous flow of yoga postures. He attributed this occurrence to the intelligence of the life force, which performed the postures with- out willful direction. He studied his experience and discovered the means of leading others into the same experience. As he began to teach this technique to others, he named it in honor of his guru, Sri Kripalvananda. Kripalu Yoga begins with the eight aspects of Ashtanga Yoga derived from Patanjali’s Y OGA S UTRA . The postures ( ASANAS ) are learned in a three-step progress. One first learns the asanas consciously and practices them until some mastery of the positions is gained. In the second stage, as the practitioner holds each position, she or he with- draws attention from the outward world (in this case, the posture) and focuses attention inward on the accompanying body sensations. At this stage, one generally encounters a variety of psychologi- cal barriers and works to release all blockages on physical, mental, and spiritual levels. In the third stage, one learns to participate in “meditation in motion,” allowing the wisdom of the body to move itself into the postures apart from any con- scious willing. Though simply described in three stages, each stage requires a significant amount of both physical and psychological work. Desai began teaching his new variation on yoga in 1972 through the Kripalu Yoga Fellow- ship, in Somneytown, Pennsylvania, which he founded. The fellowship trained and commis- sioned many teachers of Kripalu Yoga. In 1994, after the discovery that Desai had had sexual relations with several of his students, the board of the Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health in Lenox, Massachusetts, the showcase center of the fellow- ship, asked him to leave. Subsequently, the fellow- ship became organized as an educational institute without a focus on one teacher. The Kripalu Center hosts a variety of pro- grams, including yoga retreats, healing arts train- ing, leadership instruction, and yoga teacher certification.

Kripalvananda, Swami Sri (1913–1981) Popular Gujarati yogi and inspiration for kriya yoga His Holiness Swami Sri Kripalvananda, whose teachings inspired the popular form of HATHA YOGA known as K RIPALU Y OGA , was born in 1913 in Gujarat, India. His childhood was marked by sev- eral attempts to commit suicide, but after his last attempt, he met his GURU , known affectionately as Dadaji, in a visionary experience.

The vision transformed his life and, after eight months, he took initiation into sannyas, renuncia- tion, from Dadaji and was guided by Dadaji for the rest of his life. Dadaji then disappeared until 1952, when Kripalvanandji saw him as a young man. In his later appearances he encouraged Kri- palvananda to develop and continue intense 10- hour-a-day practice of KUNDALINI meditation that he continued for the rest of his life. At Kayavarohan, Gujarat, Kripalvananda was inspired to build a temple to Lord Lakulish and to reestablish the town of Kayavarohan as a center of spiritual culture and learning. As his own practice matured, Kripalvananda became the guru of two brothers, S HANTI and A MRIT D ESAI (b. 1932), both of whom would later go to America and begin organizations teaching the type of kundalini and hatha yoga that inspired Kripalvananda. In 1977, Amrit Desai invited Kri- palvananda to go to America, where he would stay for more than three years. In those years he was a significant influence on the emerging community of KRIYA YOGA in the United States. He returned to India shortly before his death at the end of 1981.

Krishna is technically the black god, since the Sanskrit word krishna means “black.” However, he is generally depicted with blue skin. Krishna appears in the M AHABHARATA epic as a friend to the P ANDAVA brothers. In that epic Krishna is rarely referred to with divine epithet, or as a divinity. It is only in the B HAGAVAD G ITA , the famous text that recounts the teaching of Krishna to A RJUNA just before the battle, that the divinity of Krishna is clearly detailed. Some have suggested that the worship of Krishna in this con- text may constitute a form of euhemerism, or the deification of a famous warrior. A second role of Krishna is as the divine lover, dancing at midnight with the cowherd maidens ( GOPIS ), who are drawn to his beauty, his beauti- ful music, and the magic of his divine presence. According to tradition he eventually favors Radha among the gopis; the passionate love of Radha for her furtive, often unavailable lover becomes the paradigm for Krishna devotionalism. Finally, Krishna appears as a child and youth, mischie- vous, naughty, and beloved of every mother who lays eyes upon him. The god was born in Mathura, where his father, V ASUDEVA , was minister to the evil king Kamsa. Kamsa discovered that Vasudeva’s wife, D EVAKI , was to give birth to a son who would eventually kill him. Therefore, he kept Vasudeva and Devaki under guard and killed their first six children. The seventh child, B ALARAMA , was miraculously transferred to the womb of Vasudeva’s other wife, Rohini. When the eighth child, Krishna, was born, a profound slumber fell upon Vasudeva’s guards and the father was able secretly to take the child across the Y AMUNA River to B RINDAVAN and consign him to the cowherd Nanda and his wife, Y ASHODA , who became Krishna’s foster mother. As a child, Krishna was extremely mischie- vous, stealing milk and butter (one of his epithets is “butter thief”), overturning wagons, and felling trees with strength far beyond that of an ordinary child. Once Yashoda tied him to a huge mortar used for grinding things.

Once when Yashoda caught him eating mud, she forced him to open his mouth; within, she saw the entire universe. Krishna’s magic made her for- get this incident, lest she not be able to treat him as an ordinary child. In two stories of his childhood he outwits evil forces. Putana, a witch, was sent by the evil king Kamsa to kill the infant by suckling him with poi- sonous milk. Krishna was completely unharmed, but he sucked so ferociously at her breast that the demon’s innards were sucked out and she died. In a later incident the snake demon Kaliya poisoned the drinking water in the Yamuna River, threat- ening the lives of the cowherds and the cows. Krishna found the pool where Kaliya was hiding and danced a furious dance upon him until he was killed. In another tale the young Krishna asked peo- ple to worship the mountain Govardhana, rather than the great king of the gods Indra. Indra, learn- ing this, sent terrible rain storms to wash away the cowherds who had defied him.

As a young man, Krishna began to attract the interest of the cowherd women as he played his magical flute day and night. He would flirt with them and play tricks on them. Once when the cowherd girls were bathing he took all their clothes and put them up into a big tree. When the women left the water and begged him for their garments, he bent the tree down and let them retrieve their clothes. Particularly at night Krishna would work his divine magic. The women would yearn to see him and could not find him. They would begin to think of all his magical deeds and praise him. When they finally found him, they began to dance with him; he became many Krishnas, pairing with each woman as though she were the only one. This is referred to as the Rasalila dance and is the metaphor for the way that god is intimate with each soul while it is only one. Finally, in the sto- ries of later times (c. 10th century) one cowherd woman alone, named R ADHA , becomes Krishna’s favorite. Her passionate love for him, her yearn- ing when he does not appear at their assigned spot, and their loveplay are all celebrated in the passionate liturgy of Krishna worship, where the devotee sees himself or herself as Radha seeking passionate union with god. After the death of Kamsa, Krishna becomes an ally of the Pandavas. He assists them in every way fair and foul and helps them triumph; the B HAGA - VA D G ITA makes clear that this was divine aid. We are left here with the mystery of Krishna, a divinity who is mischievous and naughty as a child, naughty as a young man—playing games with the hearts of many women—and who in war does not hesitate to use stratagems that the SHASTRAS the authoritative texts, might find inap- propriate for a warrior. Krishna effects his LILA , his divine game, in ways that humans cannot grasp, except through complete devotion. Krishna must eventually die, as must all the other AVATARS of Vishnu. While in the forest doing YOGA then, he is accidentally pierced in the foot with a spear by a hunter who mistook his foot for a deer’s foot. He blesses the man who threw the spear that will take him to heaven. Many devotional Vaishnavite movements in India focus on worship of Krishna only. Most famous of these are the followers of Saint C HAI - TANYA of Bengal, whose Goswamis, or followers of Chaitanya’s tradition, moved to Brindavan to be closer to the place where Krishna lived. The followers of Chaitanya include Sri Swami Prabhu- pada B HAKTIVEDANTA , who traveled to the United States to found the Hare Krishna movement. As do many Krishnaites, they worship in ecstatic devotion, while chanting MANTRAS to their god. Further reading: W. G.

Krishna, Gopi (1903–1984) master of Kundalini Yoga Gopi Krishna was an influential teacher whose impact depended on conveying his own trans- formative KUNDALINI YOGA experiences. He was known for his clear exposition of the awakening of kundalini. However, he never had his own spir- itual teacher, was not initiated into any spiritual lineage, and did not himself train disciples. Gopi Krishna was born in Kashmir in 1903 as an only son. In his childhood, his father renounced the world to lead a religious life and left his wife to care for three children. Since he was the only son, K 240 Krishna, Gopi 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 240 12/14/06 9:28:55 AM"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"he bore responsibility for his family’s welfare. He did not attend university because he did not pass a major examination. In reaction to his father’s decision to leave the world, he vowed to live as a householder. And in shame over his failure at examination, he took on a practice of MEDITATION in order to refine his concentration. While employed by the Indian government, he practiced meditation for 17 years and devel- oped the ability to sit for hours in concentration without discomfort. In 1937, while meditating and imagining a lotus at the crown of the head, he felt a roar like a waterfall and felt a stream of liquid light entering the brain through the spinal cord. This was his first experience of the serpent power of kundalini, a power said to reside as a latent force at the base of the spine that can be awakened so that it travels through and opens the seven CHAKRAS (energy centers along the spine). His report of this episode, for which he was totally unprepared, described a vast circle of conscious- ness in which the body was but a point, bathed in light and in a state of happiness impossible to describe. Shortly after the initial experience, he experi- enced a continuous “luminous glow” around his head. He began to have a variety of psychological and physiological problems and even thought he was becoming mad. Although he read accounts of this phenomenon, he found no one who could help him through this difficult period. The mental and emotional destabilization lasted for several years. Aware that a fundamental change had taken place in him, he believed that his entire nervous system would be slowly reorganized and trans- formed. He viewed this energy, once activated, as an intelligent force over which one has little control. His autobiography records this experience and its aftermath in one of the most detailed accounts of the unleashing of a psychospiritual power and spiritual transformation. He describes the dif- ficulties and dangers of the spiritual path and the pressure that it can exert on the physical body. However unbalanced his experience, he main- tained in all of his subsequent writings that the awakening of kundalini is the means of spiritual evolution for humanity. Gopi Krishna was not a GURU in the classical sense of one who has disciples. He did not found a movement or a sect but remained a seeker who later became a teacher. He documented his expe- riences in a number of books that attempted to teach the reality of the kundalini experience and to help others who encounter this extraordinary phenomenon. He died on July 31, 1984. Further reading: Gopi Krishna, The Awakening of Kundalini (New York: E. P.

Krishnabai, Mother (1903–1989) teacher who embodied the love of service The child who later became known as Mother Krishnabai was born in 1903, although little else is known of her childhood. The first years of her life were turbulent. When she was 10 her father died. At age 13 she married K. Laxman Rao, who passed away seven years later, in 1926, leaving her a young widow. In 1928 she encountered Swami R AMDAS , who provided uplift from her sorrows. Krishnabai became a devoted disciple and attained self-real- ization by strictly following the swami’s teaching. As the foremost disciple and successor of Swami Ramdas, she embodied the love of service and provided for the spiritual and material needs of the poor. Under Swami Ramdas’s guidance she helped to establish Anandashram in Kerala, South India. She worked with her beloved teacher there, becoming a mother to all who went to the ash- ram. In 1963, upon the death of Swami Ramdas, she assumed leadership of Anandashram.

Krishnamurti, Jiddu (1895–1986) spiritual teacher of radical self-observation Chosen while still a child as the new messiah, or World Teacher, by the T HEOSOPHICAL S OCI - ETY , the Indian J. Krishnamurti acquired world fame as he traveled and lectured on the society’s universalist teachings. After a personal spiritual transformation, he rejected the society and its occultism and went on to teach his philosophy of free inquiry toward the goal of understanding the self. Born on May 12, 1895, in Madanapalle, near Madras (Chennai) in colonial India, Krishnamurti (the image of Krishna) grew up in an orthodox B RAHMIN family steeped in tradition, ritual, and a sacred view of the world. After the death of his mother when he was only 10 years old, he moved with his father and siblings to the compound of the Theosophical Society, a rapidly growing spiri- tual movement, in Adyar, near Madras. The Theosophical Society, founded in 1875 in New York City, began as an organization dedicated to a synthesis of science, religion, and philoso- phy with the credo “There is no religion higher than truth.” Theosophical teaching includes the exploration of clairvoyant powers for discov- ering the hidden mysteries of nature and the esoteric powers of humanity. The Theosophists drew freely from their understanding of Eastern thought, particularly Buddhist and Hindu cos- mologies, to form a worldview that included a complex cosmology, an esoteric psychology, and an evolutionary scheme that encompassed eons. Drawing upon many religious traditions and prophecies, the Theosophical Society at the time of Krishnamurti’s youth was actively looking for a messiah, a world teacher, who would destroy evil and restore righteousness. In his early teen years, Krishnamurti was chosen by the Theosophists as the young world teacher and appointed head of the Order of the Star in the East, an organization devoted to real- izing his teaching mission. For a number of years he traveled and addressed audiences, maturing in Jiddu Krishnamurti (1895–1986), philosopher and teacher of radical self-observation (Krishnamurti Foundation America) K 242 Krishnalila 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 242 12/14/06 9:28:55 AM"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"his understanding of the order, the Theosophical Society, and his role in each. Over many months in 1922–23, Krishnamurti experienced a profound transformation. Begun as MEDITATION , Krishnamurti’s “process” contained moments of great beauty and clarity offset by peri- ods of physical pain, even agony. He would fall unconscious, converse with nonphysical entities, and speak from several personas. Krishnamurti’s account is consistent with other reports of mys- tical non-dualist transformations. His personal- ity dissolved into communion with all that lay beyond him. In his words, “I was in everything, or rather everything was in me, inanimate and animate, the mountain, the work and all breath- ing things.” After “the process” was complete, he experi- enced a growing dissatisfaction with the author- ity structure of the Theosophical Society and its emphasis on occultism. At the death of his brother, which the occultists of the Theosophi- cal Society did not foresee, his dissatisfaction became overwhelming. He declared himself in revolt against Theosophy and against all forms of spiritual authority, advising every person, “Be a light unto yourselves.” He disbanded the Order of the Star in the East in 1929, declaring, “Truth is a pathless land.” From then until his death in 1986, Krish- namurti traveled around the world teaching his insights. He became a champion of freedom and inquiry and a relentless advocate of the discovery of truth without the aid of any organization, reli- gion, or belief system. His teaching emphasized the necessity of developing awareness of one’s conditioning and one’s bondage to thought, fear, and time. His goal was to make people “uncon- ditionally free” and, to this end, he invited those who listened to him to observe their inner selves, including their motives and the functions of thought. With each audience, Krishnamurti inquired into the basic nature of humanity and found that real self-transformation involves an instantaneous awareness of the psyche and its workings. Accompanied by simplicity and humil- ity, this awareness can open a person to the reality of oneself. The Krishnamurti Foundation of America was founded in 1969 to preserve and disseminate his teachings. Activities include the Oak Grove School, the Krishnamurti Archives, the Krish- namurti Study Center, the Krishnamurti Library, and Krishnamurti Publications of America. The Krishnamurti Foundation of England, begun in 1968, oversees the Brockwood Park School. The Krishnamurti Foundation of India sponsors the Rishi Valley School, the Krishnamurti Study Cen- tre in Varanasi, Vasanta College of Rajghat, and other centers. During his lifetime Krishnamurti created schools for children and young adults in India, the United States, England, and Switzerland. These alternative schools continue today in their mission to provide a new definition and practice of education, free of the conditioning and author- ity structures prevalent in modern educational institutions. In his later years, Krishnamurti joined the physicist David Bohm in an exploration of the human condition through a series of dialogues. Both men recognized the limitations of traditional didactic teaching and sought a way in which truth and insight might be discovered within individu- als and small groups. The dialogue process, prac- ticed today in all Krishnamurti Foundations in the United States, India, and England, encourages individual inquiry without didactic formalism and authority structures. Krishnamurti and Bohm predicted that the actual structure of the human brain could change as a result of increased aware- ness and open inquiry. Krishnamurti died on February 18, 1986, in Ojai, California, among his students. Further reading: S.

Krishnamurti, U. G. (1918– ) unorthodox teacher of philosophy of “no self ” U. G. Krishnamurti is an original teacher in the Hindu tradition, who believes that conscious thought is the enemy of true knowledge. Born into a B RAHMIN family on July 9, 1918, in Andhra Pradesh, India, U. G. Krishnamurti was exposed by his family to many forms of Hindu- ism as well as the philosophy of the T HEOSOPHI - CAL S OCIETY . His childhood home was visited by monks, SWAMIS , pundits, GURUS , and religious scholars, who engaged in constant conversations on philosophy, religion, occultism, and metaphys- ics. He studied classical yoga with Swami S IVANA - NDA of Rishikesh and visited Sri R AMANA M AHARSHI in Tiruvannamalai. At the University of Madras (Chennai), U. G. Krishnamurti studied philosophy and psychol- ogy. He married in his 20s and had four children. He became a public speaker and delivered ora- tions for the Theosophical Society, becoming acquainted with J. K RISHNAMURTI (no relation), the person chosen in 1914 by Theosophists as the “world teacher.” U. G. Krishnamurti’s teaching centers around a radical notion that so-called SELF - REALIZATION is actually the discovery that there is no self to discover. There is a “natural state” for humans that simply happens, without thought and with- out effort. Thought is an enemy because thought cannot touch anything living and cannot capture, contain, or express the quality of life. Further, religious and spiritual teachings that reduce the quality of life to thought and systems of thought are polluting to the spirit of humanity. Anything based on knowledge through thought is an illu- sion. Any moment of experience cannot be cap- tured or given expression. Once the moment is captured, it is made a part of the past. In this way, U. G. Krishnamurti challenges the way that society is organized, in its political ideologies, legal structures, and religious institutions. What is necessary for survival of the human organism are an intelligence of the body and awareness of the moment of existence. U. G. Krishnamurti continues to teach in Swit- zerland, India, and the United States. Further reading: Mahesh Bhatt, U. G. Krishnamurti—a Life (New Delhi: Penguin India, 2001); U. G.

Krishnananda, Swami (1922–2001) philosopher of advaita Vedanta Swami Krishnananda was a great scholar of San- skrit scripture, who shared his learning in many books and lectures. He served the Divine Life Society in Rishikesh as secretary for 40 years. Subbaraya, later named Swami Krishnananda, was born on April 25, 1922, the eldest of six siblings in an orthodox Madhva B RAHMIN family. Raised through the example of his father’s holi- K 244 Krishnamurti, U. G. 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 244 12/14/06 9:28:56 AM"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"ness and piety, Subbaraya learned to maintain his family’s religious tradition with earnestness. He became versed in S ANSKRIT as a young boy and was a passionate learner of scripture. Subbaraya attended school in Puttur, where he excelled in all subjects, rising to the top of his class. Aside from his usual studies, he spent time reading and memorizing Sanskrit scriptural texts. At age 16 he memorized the entire B HAGAVAD G ITA by heart, reciting it each day. Subbaraya’s self-study of major Hindu scrip- tures led him to an acceptance of ADVAITA (non- dual) philosophy. His growing interest pushed him toward a renunciation of the material world, even as he was pressured by his father and uncle to seek employment and earn money. Subbaraya accepted a government post at the Hospet Govern- ment Training School in Bellary District in 1943 but soon fell ill and returned home. Succumbing to his desire for the religious life, he traveled to Rishikesh in 1944 to join the Sivananda ashram. In 1946 Swami S IVANANDA initiated Subbaraya into SANNYAS (renunciation), giving him the name Swami Krishnananda. Swami Krishnananda was employed at the ashram as a letter writer and editor of books. Sivananda later gave him the job of handwriting and typing manuscripts. In 1948, at Sivananda’s request, Krishnananda began to write books on philosophy and religion. He accepted the task with great zeal and wrote his first book, The Real- ization of the Absolute, in a mere two weeks. He spent the remainder of his life writing commen- taries on Hindu scriptures and delivering lectures on Eastern and Western philosophy and religion. In 1957, Krishnananda became secretary of the ashram and focused his attention on managing finances. In 1961, he was nominated by Sivananda to the position of general secretary of the Divine Life Society. Krishnananda retained this position for the next 30 years until his death on November 23, 2001. Swami Krishnananda is recognized for his knowledge of scriptures, his balance of KARMA (action) and JNANA (learning) YOGA , and his ability to communicate complicated concepts to students. He was a regular lecturer, teaching three-month- long courses at the Yoga-Vedanta Forest Academy of the Divine Life Society. His literary skill was used in varying degrees throughout Sivananda’s organizations. He was made president of the Siva- nanda Literature Research Institute because of his understanding of all 300 of his guru’s works. He was later made president of the Sivananda Lit- erature Dissemination Committee, which worked on translating Sivananda’s books into the major Indian languages. Swami Krishnananda wrote over 40 books of his own, including works of poetry. His topics included yoga, MEDITATION , traditional scriptures, mysticism, and philosophy. Many of these books convey an essential message of peace, wisdom, and SELF - REALIZATION , which the Divine Life Soci- ety continues to spread.

Krishna Prem, Sri (1898–1965) Western-born Vaishnavite guru British-born Sri Krishna Prem was a prominent GURU in the orthodox Vaishnavite tradition. Ronald Nixon was born in Cheltenham, En gland, on May 10, 1898; served as a pilot in World War I while still a teenager; and later graduated in philosophy from King’s College, Cambridge. While at Cambridge, he studied The- osophy, Buddhism, and Pali and took a Buddhist initiation. In 1921, after graduation from Cambridge, he went to India to take a position as lecturer in En glish at Lucknow University and to continue his spiritual search. The vice-chancellor of Lucknow University, Dr. G. N. Chakravarti, was a Theoso- phist, who had known Madame B LAVATSKY and was a friend of Annie B ESANT , then president of the T HEO - SOPHICAL S OCIETY . During a party at the home of Dr. Chakravarti and his wife, Monica, Nixon observed Monica in a meditative and devotional state in front of an image of Lord K RISHNA . In 1924, she became his guru and gave him initiation into V AISHNAVISM (the worship of incarnations of V ISHNU ). In 1928, Monica took the vow of SANNYAS (called vairagya in the G AUDIYA Vaishnavite tradi- tion) and assumed the name Yashoda Ma. Soon after, Nixon took vairagi vows from her and was given the name Krishna Prem. They looked for a place to start a community and found a rural area near Almora; they founded the Uttar Brindaban Ashram and dedicated a temple to Radha and Krishna there in 1931. The ASHRAM began and has continued to be aligned with strict ortho- dox Vaishnavism, including total vegetarianism, thrice-daily PUJAS , and a sacramental attitude toward all of life. Yashoda Ma died in 1944, leaving Krishna Prem as her successor. He initiated two people before her death: her daughter, Moti, and an Englishman he had known at Cambridge. The ashram grew and eventually included other Indian disciples, some of whom built their own cottages near the temple. Krishna Prem traveled little, but in 1948 he visited Sri R AMANA M AHARSHI and Sri A UROBINDO and the M OTHER . At his death on November 14, 1965, leadership of the ashram passed to Sri Madhava A SHISH , another Englishman, who col- laborated with Krishna Prem on publications and edited some of his work posthumously.

Krita Yuga All of the Y UGAS , or ages, in the Indian tradition, refer to throws in an ancient game of dice. Krita (“the one that made it!”) is the best throw—a 4. The Krita Yuga, which like all ages has appeared an infinite number of times and will return an infinite number of times, is also called Satya Yuga, or the age of truth. It is 1,728,000 years long. In Krita Yuga the highest virtue is said to be MEDITA - TION . In this age, B RAHMA is god. Eternal DHARMA is said to have all its four feet in this age, while in the others it progressively has three, two, and one. In the Krita age there is no distinction between the best and worst of creatures. Their life, happiness, and attractiveness are all equal. They are also free of sorrow, completely good, and enjoy solitude, rather than crowds. They are devoted to MEDITA - TION , active in spiritual restraints and austerities, and act always without self-interest. They are always joyful and have no permanent homes, but live in the mountains or by the oceans.

Kriyananda, Swami (1926– ) kriya yoga guru Swami Kriyananda is the founder of the A NANDA MOVEMENT of religious and communal organiza- tions, designed to spread the teachings of KRIYA YOGA and the principles of cooperative living. James Donald Walters was born in Toleajen, Romania, to American parents. As a youth he was sent to boarding schools in Switzerland and England and later attended Haverford College, a Quaker school in Pennsylvania, and Brown University. He left school before completing his degree and settled in South Carolina. In South Carolina, he had his first serious contact with Hinduism, when he read the Bhaga- vad Gita followed by Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Y OGANANDA . At about the same time he became a vegetarian. In 1948, he moved across the continent to meet Yogananda and offer himself as a disciple. He quickly moved into a leadership position with Yogananda’s relatively small organi- zation, the S ELF -R EALIZATION F ELLOWSHIP (SRF), and within a year was lecturing on its behalf. His leadership role increased after Yogananda’s death, and in 1955 he was named the main minister at the center in Hollywood. It was at this time he took the vows of the renounced life and became known as Kriyananda. In 1960 he was selected as a member of SRF’s board of trustees and named its vice president. However, by this time he had become focused on exploring the communal aspects of Yogananda’s thought, and in 1962 he resigned all posts with SRF and decided to put his time into realizing the development of several small economically inde- pendent communities. He wrote several books underscoring the rationale for such communities, including Cooperative Communities: How to Start Them and Why (1968). His lectures from this time would later be compiled and published as Crises in Modern Thought (1972). In 1967 he purchased land in the foothills of the Sierra as a site for the first Ananda Coopera- tive Community. The next decade would be spent in building the community, making it a center for teaching the kriya yoga he had learned with Yoga- nanda, and writing. In 1983, Kriyananda abandoned his vows of SANNYAS (which included celibacy) and became a lay believer/teacher. He began using his birth name again and married in 1985. Members of the community accepted this change with relative ease. In 1990, he led in the establishment of a new religious community, the Ananda Church of Self- Realization, part of the A NANDA M OVEMENT . The progress of Ananda has been punctuated by several traumatic events. First, in 1976, a for- est fire swept through the Ananda Village in the Sierras, destroying almost all its structures and threatening the survival of the community. How- ever, it was rebuilt. After the incorporation of the church, Ananda began a lengthy litigation with SRF over usage of the term SELF - REALIZATION . SRF also sought to deny Ananda the use of a number of Yogananda’s books and images. Ananda won most of the issues being litigated, although the community faced a huge bill for more than a decade of legal work. When a former member successfully sued Ananda claiming sexual harass- ment, Ananda was thrown into bankruptcy, from which it is slowly recovering. Most recently, Walters has resumed his vows of sannyas and is once again known as Swami Kriyananda. In November 2003, he and several leaders in Ananda moved to Delhi, India, and opened an Ananda branch in India. He has contin- ued to turn out numerous books as well as music Kriyananda, Swami 247 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 247 12/14/06 9:28:56 AM"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"(his role as a composer is one of the less known aspects of his career).

The practice of kriya yoga involves concentrating the mind upon a particular object that transmutes energy and experience. Kriya yoga is said to obliterate the subliminal activators ( SAMSKARAS ) through asceticism ( TA PA S ), study ( svadhyaya ), and devotion to God. Kriya yoga is based on specific breathing pat- terns. Through PRANAYAMA (disciplined breath- ing) the devotee’s focus leaves ordinary reality as it begins to climb in order to merge with the divine. It is important that the practitioner leave thoughts of mundane reality behind because such thoughts interfere with the ability to focus concentration on the other-worldly. This abil- ity to turn inward to receive spiritual energy is believed to lead the disciple to God realiza- tion. As each CHAKRA (invisible energy wheel) is opened through MEDITATION , the KUNDALINI energy is released to travel from the base of the spine, where it is coiled in latency, through the glands of the body to release the energy of transformation. The culmination of the process occurs when the crown chakra is energized and opened to receive energy from the divine. The process of kriya yoga transmutes the life force or energy that connects the physical body and the subtle anatomy described in the Hindu scriptures. In the last century, B ABAJI , L AHIRI Mayasaya, Sri Y UKESWAR , and Paramahansa Y OGANANDA have been responsible for a renewed interest in kriya yoga.

Kriya Yoga Centers The Kriya Yoga Centers are a set of related ashrams founded by Swami Hariharananda Giri (1907–2002), a god-brother to Swami Paramah- ansa Y OGANANDA . Both swamis learned KRIYA YOGA under the tutelage of Sri Y UKTESWAR (1855–1936), who made his home in Puri, Orissa, and who built an ASHRAM (religious community) there in 1906. Yukteswar passed his lineage to Yogananda, who left India and took the concepts of kriya yoga to the United States. In India, the lineage passed first to Sreemat Swami Satyananda and then in 1970 to Swami Hariharananda Giri. Hariharananda was chosen from among the members and disciples who had remained close to the ashram through the years. Born Rabindranath Bhattacharya in Habibpur, West Bengal, on May 27, 1907, Hariharananda took initiation in the path of JNANA yoga from Sri Bijaykrishna Chattopadhyaya. In 1932, he met Sri Yukteswar, who initiated him into kriya yoga and gave him charge of the ashram in Puri. In 1935, Swami Yogananda gave him a second initiation into kriya yoga. In 1938 he renounced the world and spent 12 years in seclusion in Puri. In 1949, he had a vision of the eternal yogi B ABAJI , who prophesied that he would spread the message of kriya yoga to the world. In 1951, Yogananda K 248 kriya yoga 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 248 12/14/06 9:28:57 AM"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"empowered him to give initiation to others. In 1959, he took formal monastic vows from the Shankaracharya of Puri and was given the name Hariharananda Giri. After assuming leadership, Hariharananda pro- moted the work of the ashram throughout India, creating affiliations with other ashrams. Believing that the kriya path should be shared with other peoples around the world, he proceeded to make formal visits to promote knowledge of kriya yoga as the clearest path to enlightenment around the world. By 1974, Hariharananda had made the deci- sion to go west, initially with plans to develop ashrams in Switzerland. He continued to found ashrams and centers throughout Europe. His decision to start an organization in New York City introduced the work to the United States, much as Yogananda’s mission had evolved into the S ELF - R EALIZATION F ELLOWSHIP . The United States headquarters of the Kriya Yoga Centers is located in Homestead, Florida. The international headquarters is in Orissa, India. The center publishes a periodical, Soul Culture: A Journal of Kriya Yoga.

Kriya Yoga Tantra Society The Kriya Yoga Tantra Society is one of the many tantric movements (see TANTRISM ) that entered the West from their spiritual homeland in India in the later decades of the 20th century. The society was founded by Andre O. Rathel, more commonly known by his spiritual name, Sunyata Saraswati. The American tantric groups have developed through several independent sources. Sunyata was a student of the esoteric sciences, tantra, and the martial arts. During his travels he went to India, where he studied with Satyananda Saraswati, the most significant tantric teacher of the 20th century and the founder of the Bihar School of Yoga (now the International Yoga Fellowship) in Bengal. After completing his course of tantra and MEDITATION he returned to the United States and founded Beyond/Beyond in Los Angeles, Califor- nia, which eventually evolved into the Kriya Yoga Tantra Society. Sunyata availed himself of a number of teach- ers and teachings in order to be more fully informed about a variety of esoteric topics. He made an independent evaluation of different tan- tric teachers and studied with several Taoist mas- ters in Hong Kong. From his studies he selected tantra as the most powerful of all paths to libera- tion and enlightenment. His central and primary path is the system called KRIYA YOGA , originally popularized by Paramahansa Y OGANANDA (1893– 1952), which was thought to be the original tan- tra of the legendary B ABAJI , who is believed to live, after many centuries, in the H IMALAYAS . Although Yogananda occasionally taught from the perspective of tantra, he did not stress left- hand tantra, the system that Sunyata adopted. According to the teachings of Sunyata, tantra promotes intense sexual energy through touch and yogic practices. The intense energy that is developed unleashes the KUNDALINI energy, a latent energy believed to be resting at the base of the spine. Once released, this power travels the spine, opening each CHAKRA (seven invisible wheels of energy along the spine) to the top of the head, when a person reaches moksha (spiritual libera- tion) or enlightenment. Sunyata travels widely offering seminars in his method of tantric enlightenment. Retreats are offered by the society in relatively secluded areas in order to preserve the sacredness of the teach- ings and the privacy of the attendees. Headquar- ters are in San Francisco, California. The society publishes the periodical Jyoti.

K’s, Five See S IKHISM . Kshatriya The Kshatriyas are the warrior/kingly class in the ancient fourfold class system of India. They are second in the hierarchy beneath the B RAHMINS . Their duty was to protect and rule. They were always allied with Brahmins in their role as kings and overlords, but they vied for control of the top of the social hierarchy. In the sixth century B . C . E . the heterodox movements of Buddhism and J AIN - ISM , which opposed Brahminical orthodoxy, were founded by men of Kshatriya lineage, respectively, Siddhartha Gautama (later, B UDDHA ) and Vardha- mana (later, M AHAVIRA ). As do Brahmins, Kshatriyas receive the SACRED THREAD , making them “twice-born.” Up to the GUPTA era (c. 600 C . E .) they learned S ANSKRIT and to some degree the scriptures. The U PANISHADS give examples of Kshatriya kings who teach Brah- mins the highest wisdom. Kshatriyas play a significant role in Indian lit- erature, along with the Brahmins. Both the R AMA - YA N A and M AHABHARATA are essentially Kshatriya epics dealing with issues of kingly succession. They also, of course, highlight the two Kshatriya heroes R AMA and K RISHNA , both recognized as ava- tars of Lord V ISHNU .

How- ever, he did not develop a large cult following and perhaps was overshadowed by the goddess L AKSHMI , whose attributes and realm of power were similar. There are different stories about Kubera’s birth and upbringing. Generally he is said to have ruled over Lanka (Sri Lanka) until the demon Ravana gained the power to steal some of his magical belongings and exile him. Both Kubera and Rav- ana are seen as descendents of the mind-born son of B RAHMA , Pulastya. Kubera apparently took up residence in the north; he is seen as the guardian of the northern direction, while I NDRA guards the east, Y AMA the south, and V ARUNA the west. In all these stories he is always heralded as the lord of gold and riches. Further reading: Cornelia Dimmitt and J. A.

Kumar, Guru Sushil (1926–1994) Jain teacher Guru Sushil Kumar was a teacher of Jain tradition and of interreligious understanding. He broke with Jain convention by traveling abroad in pur- suit of his mission, and he founded the Interna- tional Jain Mission ( see J AINISM ). Sushil Kumar was born on June 15, 1926, into a Hindu Brahmin family in the small village of Sikhopur in Hariyana, India. The village was later renamed Sushalgarh in his honor. When he was a very young boy, a deceased Jain YOGI and enlight- ened master, Sri Roop Chandji Maharaj, appeared K 250 K’s, Five 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 250 12/14/06 9:28:57 AM"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"to him in a vision and told the young Sushil to become a monk. At age seven, he left his family and village to live with a Jain monk, Sri Chotelal Maharaj, who became his guru. In 1941, at age 15, Sushil took initiation ( DIKSHA ) and became a monk in the S THANAKVASI sect of Jainism. Sushil pursued an academic career in classical Indian and yogic philosophies, while experiencing directly the topics he was studying. His abilities to teach and share his experiences attracted disciples, who recognized him as a source of wisdom, truth, and understanding. He actively promoted peace and harmony throughout India and worked to establish a sense of universal brotherhood among the country’s conflicting religious traditions. In 1975 he began a controversial international tour, which broke with the Jain tradition’s require- ment that monks travel only by foot. He broke the ancient restraint against traveling by plane in order to share the Lord M AHAVIRA ’s message of nonvio- lence, peace, and oneness of all living beings. His teaching of the Arhum Yoga system involves mastery of the inner self through watchfulness and direct perception. Arhum yoga includes the eight limbs of P ATANJALI ’s yoga system, sound vibration, healing, awakening of the KUNDALINI , energy, holistic health, and the teachings of Jain- ism. The main text he used was the Matrika Yidya of the Namokar Mantra, a foremost mantra in the Jain tradition. Sushil presided over a number of world reli- gion conferences and was director and president of many organizations devoted to intercultural and interreligious cooperation, world peace, uni- versal brotherhood, animal and environmental protection, and nonviolence. He was a founding member of the V ISHWA H INDU P ARISHAD . Sushil motivated the Sikh leader Tara Singh to participate in dialogue with the Indian govern- ment to solve the animosities that were threaten- ing the state of Punjab. He also founded many spiritual organizations, including the World Fellowship of Religions in 1950, Vishwa Ahimsa Sangh in 1957, International Jain Mission in 1978, Arhat Sangh in 1979, and the World Jain Congress in 1981, and World Center of Nonviolence. He died on April 22, 1994. Sushil’s main ashram is Siddhachalam, in Blairstown, New Jersey, established in 1983, the first Jain pilgrimage site ( tirtha ) established out- side India. Siddhachalam is a residential commu- nity for monks, nuns, and laymen and laywomen, as well as a retreat center. It serves as headquarters for the International Jain Mission, the World Fel- lowship of Religions, and the World Jain Con- gress. The ashram is also a wildlife sanctuary. kumbhaka See PRANAYAMA . Kumbhakarna Kumbhakarna (He with karna, ears [as big as], kumbha, pots) is a rakshasa, a demon, the brother of Ravana ( see DEMONIC BEINGS ). He plays a part in the R AMAYANA story and he is burned yearly in effigy during the Ramlila celebration, when the victory of Lord R AMA over the evil demons is remembered. The story goes that Kumbhakarna was a very powerful demon, and naturally strong. Other demons, rakshasas, acquired their powers as the result of austerities and boons, but he alone had the natural power to kill any god, man, or being. Once Kumbakarna was besting I NDRA , the king of the gods himself, in battle. Indra, along with other gods, RISHIS , and various beings went to B RAHMA to ask for aid. Brahma cursed Kumbhakarna at that moment, to sleep forever. Ravana, his brother, pleaded with Brahma to soften his curse and Brahma then cursed him to sleep for six months at a time, after which he would voraciously eat for one day, and then would go back to sleep again. This curse was meant to hold him in control so that he would not conquer all the worlds. In the R AMAYANA , when the rakshasas have begun their war with R AMA , Lakshmana, and the monkeys, there is a rather humorous scene that Kumbhakarna 251 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 251 12/14/06 9:28:57 AM"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"takes place when Ravana tries forcibly to wake Kumbhakarna to fight. They beat him and scrape him in every way; they have elephants drag him; they beat a thousand drums; and so on, but Kumbhakarna continues to snore. Finally, hit with trees and doused by thousands of pitchers of water, Kumbharakarna awakes. This done, he is asked to fight and agrees, but first he must be fed vast wagon loads of food, which he takes whole into his voracious mouth. His endless hunger sated, he goes into battle. After wreaking havoc, he eventually is slain by Lord Rama himself. Further reading: S. P.

Kumbha Mela The Kumbha Mela (pot festival) is held once every three years, moving in rotation among four river- side sites in India: Prayag (A LLAHABAD ), H ARIDVAR , Ujjaini, and Nasik. The first two of these loca- tions are in Uttar Pradesh, Ujjaini is in Madhya Pradesh, and Nasik is in Maharashtra. The Kumbha Mela may have originated in great antiquity when various seeds were taken to river banks, dipped into the water, and then sown for a bountiful harvest. One myth of the festival’s origin begins with a pot of the nectar of immortality; it was carried away by Jayanta, the son of I NDRA , with the gods and demons in hot pursuit. As he carried the pot for 12 divine days (12 human years) a little was dropped in each of the four festival locations. Hence the name Pot Festival. The Kumbha Mela festival at Allahabad (Prayag), held every 12th year and called the Maha (great) Kumbha Mela, is the largest festival in India and perhaps in the world. According to astrologers, the Maha Kumbha Mela takes place when the planet Jupiter enters Aquarius and the Sun enters Aries. Millions of people assemble together at this sacred site for ceremonial proces- sions, devotional singing, religious discourses, and other special activities for the religious. Monks and holy men and women from every Hindu sect converge together at this site to participate in this sacred and festive gathering.

She is the embodiment of the GODDESS . When the practioner has learned to control the breath in its channels ( NADIS ) in the proper way, the serpent is made to turn her head upward and begin the ascent up the spine, piercing as she goes the energy centers or CHAKRAS in their various locations along the spine. This piercing activates energies of the body to create occult powers and spiritual awakening. When the kundalini goes beyond the body to a place 12 fin- gers above the head called SAHASRARA , or the place of the thousand lotuses, it joins in erotic embrace Lord S HIVA , engendering complete enlightenment and liberation in this world.

He exper- imented with several types of yoga for 17 years before achieving enlightenment. After his experi- ence with the awakening of KUNDALINI energy, he became a prolific writer, speaker, and teacher of spiritual kundalini yoga. Kundalini energy is believed to be a well- spring of spiritual energy that is coiled at the base of the spine. Seven invisible wheels of energy ( CHAKRAS ) along the spine are the sites of powers that must be accessed to allow enlightenment to occur. Teachers of yoga, such as Gopi Krishna, frequently speak of opening these chakras with special breathing techniques so that the life force ( prana ) can be utilized to transform consciousness into a state of enlight- enment ( samadhi ). Gopi Krishna, with a wealth of knowledge about yoga, wrote 17 books about various aspects of the awakening of kundalini. In 1970, an Ameri- can, Gene Kietter, realized the significance of what Gopi Krishna had learned and founded the Kundalini Research Foundation in New York in 1971 in order to promote his work. The founda- tion, now headquartered in Darien, Connecticut, seeks to promote the scientific investigation of enlightenment, inspiration, genius, and the evolu- tion of consciousness.

Kurma Avatar The Kurma Avatar or tortoise AVATA R (incarna- tion) of V ISHNU plays a small role in the myth of the churning of the M ILK O CEAN , which is widely repeated in Sanskrit epics, the PURANAS , and story. There, the story goes that the fate of the gods took a bad turn when the king of the gods, I NDRA , was cursed by the sage D URVASAS for slighting him. The gods asked Vishnu his advice on how to restore their good fortunes. Vishnu suggested that they churn the Milk Ocean, from which they might obtain the nectar of immortality. They were advised to do this in concert with their enemies the ASURAS or antigods (demons), since the task was monumentally difficult. When they stirred the Milk Ocean, they used the divine serpent Vasuki as the churning stick. Vishnu offered him- self as a huge tortoise ( kurma ) upon which to rest the churning stick.

The Kurus were a great clan, including both the P ANDAVAS and the K AURAVAS , the main contenders in that war. Both groups were descended from an ancient progenitor named Kuru. The place-name also appears in the first line of the B HAGAVAD G ITA , where it takes on a metaphori- cal significance.

He was a disciple of the legendary B ABAJI , an honored teacher of KRIYA YOGA , and a pioneer in women’s education in India. Born as Shyamacharan Lahiri to Gourmohan and Muktakeshi Lahiri on September 30, 1828, in the village of Ghurani in the Punjab, Lahiri Mahasaya was raised in a pious family of devout followers of Lord S HIVA . Gourmohan Lahiri was a recognized pundit and scholar of King Krishnana- gar’s court. In early childhood, Shyamacharan’s mother would find him smeared in ashes and sit- ting in MEDITATION with his eyes closed. The most significant of these events took place when both mother and son were completely absorbed in the worship of Lord Shiva in the temple. Muktakeshi opened her eyes upon hearing “mother” from an unknown voice. Standing before her was a monk draped in a saffron cloth with locked and matted hair. The monk was the immortal yogi, Babaji. He told her that he had initiated her son for the pur- pose of liberating both saints and householders from worldly suffering using simple techniques of SELF - REALIZATION . He assured her that her son would remain in the world and would be a highly respected being committed to the God-realization of others. In 1832, a flood destroyed the family home and killed his mother. Shyamacharan moved with his father and sister first to Calcutta and then to B ENARES (Varanasi), a city holy to Lord Shiva. As a boy, he was humble, quiet, calm, and detached. He attended an English school and studied S AN - SKRIT , Hindi, Urdu, Farsi, and English. At age 12 he entered Sanskrit University in Benares. In 1848 he completed a degree in English, with significant study of Indian philosophy and literature, as well as Western philosophy. He studied the V EDAS with the noted Maharashtrian Sanskrit scholar Pundit Nagabhatta. He later continued Sanskrit study under the tutelege of Pundit Devanarayan Gho- sal Vidya Vachaspathi from Bengal. Gourmohan was proud of his son’s achievement, but was also concerned that his quiet nature would lead him to asceticism, so he arranged for a marriage. The wedding took place in 1846; Shyamacharan was 18, and Kashimoni was 10, as was common prac- tice of that time. During their 47-year marriage, she remained completely loyal and supportive of her husband’s goal of self-realization. They lived a simple, impoverished life in the early years of L 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 255 12/14/06 9:28:58 AM"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"their marriage. As Kashimoni grew older, she became an advocate of the education of women at a time when it was unpopular. Her husband taught her to read. One day, Kashimoni had a profound vision and saw her husband to be none other than an incarnation of Lord Shiva himself. From this point onward, her commitment to God was intensified and her support for her husband’s work increased. From 1851 to 1888, he worked as a clerk in public works and tutored children of kings and merchants. Some of these students would later take YOGA initiation from him. In 1888, he opened a Bengali school, of which he remained secretary throughout his life. He later established a school exclusively for women, an unprecedented action for the time. On November 27, 1861, B ABAJI called on him. Leaving his wife in Kashi (or Benares) he set out on a journey to Ranikhet, not know- ing why. There he met Babaji, who claimed to have been waiting for him for quite some time. With just an extension of his hand onto Shyamacharan’s head, an electromagnetic force passed through his body, and slowly he started to remember his past life as an ascetic. He now fully recognized Babaji and the place where they were. With their reunion, Shyamacharan’s path was clearly defined, and thus began his life as Sri Lahiri Baba, also called Yogiraj. He went on to initiate many students, including his wife, in the lost practice of kriya yoga. This technique integrates the use of mantras and meditation to endow calmness and control on the body and mind. In his lifetime, Lahiri Baba did not author any books, but his teachings, when imparted, inspired many books by his disciples. He died on September 26, 1895.

Lakshmana See R AMAYANA . Lakshmi Lakshmi is the wife of V ISHNU and the GODDESS of wealth and happiness. She also is associated with beauty. Lakshmi sometimes goes by the name of Sri, though in very early times Sri seems to have had an independent identity and was only later conflated with her. Laksmi is most often depicted seated on a lotus. She is golden or white in complexion. She has four arms; in two hands she holds lotuses and with an upraised hand and downward pointing hand she gives gestures that indicate well-being and prosperity. She is commonly depicted in her iconography being bathed by two celestial elephants holding a pot of water. When she stands beside V ISHNU , her husband, she is gener- ally shown with only two hands. Lakshmi is an extremely popular goddess.

Lakshmanjoo (1907–1991) teacher of Kashmiri Shaivism Rajanaka Lakshmana, known as Lakshmanjoo, was a popular and widely respected scholar and yoga master in the tradition of K ASHMIRI S HAIVISM . He was the last living representative of the great lineage of teachers of Kashmir Shaivism, and the only remaining repository of its oral teachings. Born in Srinagar, Kashmir, on May 9, 1907, Lakshmana was raised by his father, Sri Narayan- das Raina, and his mother, Shrimati Aranyamali, both of whom were devotees and disciples of Swami Ram Joo. Sri Narayandas was a well-known K 256 Lakshmana 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 256 12/14/06 9:28:58 AM"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"builder of houseboats in Srinagar who had similar aspirations for his son. Yet, in early childhood, the boy exhibited actions of a spiritual nature and appeared to be on the path of becoming a yogi. At the age of three he made a clay Shiva for his worship. He spent long hours in MEDITATION , which caused him to act oddly. Out of concern for his well-being, his parents approached the family guru, Swami Ram Joo, who assumed care for the boy’s spiritual education. Lakshmana learned the discipline of Shaivism first under the guidance of Swami Ram, and then, when the latter died, under Swami Mahtab Kak. His father’s illness forced him to look after the family business while still a teenager. He ended his formal education but continued to practice YOGA and study under Mahtab Kak. During this time he began to learn the Shaiva Sastras. Lakshmana endured great struggles with his family as his spirituality developed. At the age of 13, he refused his parents’ request for an arranged marriage. When he experienced SELF - REALIZATION for the first time at the age of 20, he became uninterested in his family’s business and felt a strong urge to practice his SADHANA (spiritual search) in solitude. He left home and traveled to Sadha-malyun Ashram in Handawara, Kash- mir. His parents searched frantically for him and eventually found him at the ashram. His father convinced him to return home only after promis- ing to build an ashram for him. Four months later he moved into an ashram located on the slopes of a mountain opposite Srinagar. Lakshmanjoo continued his studies of the Shaivite Sastras for the next seven years under the guidance of the scholar Maheshuvar Nath Razdan. During this time he accepted the daughter of Sri Jai Lal Sopori, Sharika Devi, as a student and taught her the practice of Shaivite YOGA . After she attained self-realization under his guidance, the ashram attracted other devotees. During the 1930s, Lakshmanjoo traveled throughout India, making the acquaintance of Mohandas Karamchand G ANDHI in Sevagram, Sri A UROBINDO at Pondicherry, and R AMANA M AHARSHI at Tiruvannamalai. In 1957, Lakshmanjoo commissioned a new ashram, Ishvara Ashrama, in the village of Ishaber, where his public teachings attracted a large num- ber of devotees. Disciples began to call him Swami Ishvara Svarupa, a name given to him by Sharika Devi. Lakshmanjoo taught the Shaivite tantras (see TANTRISM ) and other texts of the tradition to his disciples and to scholars from India and Europe. He gave Sunday talks on Shaivite yoga and received other spiritual teachers and scholars. As the last in an unbroken lineage of masters of an “oral tradition,” he dedicated his life to the sacred teachings of Kashmiri Shaivism. He also estab- lished the Ishwara Ashram Trust and, in 1982, the Universal Shaivite Trust, which served as the foundation for the Universal Shaivite Fellowship. Lakshmanjoo embodied the full yogic tradi- tion, on both the practice side and the theoretical side. During his life he experienced all the trans- formative disciplines of the Shaivite tradition—he was a jnani (realized sage). The knowledge of Kashmir Shaivism was tra- ditionally passed along by oral communication or other unseen means, directly from master to dis- ciple. Some material was written from the eighth century, but the texts were often intentionally obscure in an effort to prevent misunderstanding and misuse. The texts dealt with yogic experi- ences that are extremely individual and difficult to describe in words, and the practices involved are emotional. A living master, founded in the oral tradition, was always needed for guidance. To forestall the loss of these oral traditions, Lakshmanjoo published works in Sanskrit, Hindi, and English. He was universally recognized for his scholarship as well as his perfection in Shaivite yoga. He received an honorary doctoral degree in 1965 from the Varanaseya Sanskrit University for his contribution to Sanskrit and to tantra. He is best known for reviving Kashmiri Shaivism as a vital philosophy. His influence on the scholarship of Shaivism extended into Europe and the United Lakshmanjoo 257 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 257 12/14/06 9:28:58 AM"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"States.

It is located at the crest of the forehead. A place of peace, calm, and con- tentment, the lalata chakra takes the YOGI to the verge of the highest consciousness, giving him or her every supranormal power. The associated deity is S HIVA himself or, in certain systems, Shiva and his consort in erotic embrace. The S HAKTI , or energy, of this chakra is the highest Shakti, or goddess herself. This chakra has eight bluish white petals. Further reading: Harish Johari, Chakras: Energy Centers of Transformation (Rochester, Vt.: Destiny Books, 2000); John G.

Her songs are beloved among Kashmiris to this day. Her philosophical standpoint is in alignment with the tantric tradi- tions of Kashmiri S HAIVISM . Lalleshvari was born to the family of a Kash- miri B RAHMIN pandit in the village of Pandrenthan, four miles south of Srinagar. According to legend, she married the son she had borne in a previous life in the same village. In that life, when it was time for the 11-day purification ceremony after the son was born, Lalla (her given name) asked the priest, “What relation is this child to me?” The priest, amazed at the question, answered that the child was her son. The mother answered that this was not the case. She said that she would soon die and be born as a female horse with certain obvious markings that the priest would know. If he were to find this foal, he would learn who her son really was. That very moment the woman died. The priest hurried to the place where he was told the horse would be. He indeed found her, but when the foal told him she would soon be reborn as a puppy, the priest gave up the search. Lalla underwent six births in the animal world before she was finally reborn as a girl, who grew up to become the wife of the very son she had borne. When the same priest arrived to perform the wedding ceremony, Lalla confided in him the full story. Lalla thus became the daughter-in-law of her former husband, who had remarried, and she went to live with the family. She was badly mis- treated there, and after 12 years she left to become a disciple of the Shaivite SIDDHA Sri Kantha, the family priest she had known in her previous life. He lived in the village of Pampur and was a direct disciple of one of the founders of K ASHMIRI S HAIVISM , Vasugupta. Lalleshvari became a wandering yogini, going about naked, despite the ridicule and criticism she received. As the yogic scriptures state, she took praise and blame equally, not being swayed by either. She went about the Kashmir countryside and towns singing and dancing in mystical ecstasy K 258 lalata chakra 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 258 12/14/06 9:28:58 AM"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"and died, it is said, at an advanced age in Brijbi- hara, some miles southeast of Srinagar.

It gives greatest attention to the social obligations of B RAHMINS , whose supremacy in the social order is assumed, but it also outlines the obligations of rulers and other castes. It was the first of many systematizations of Hindu social law. The book begins with the history of the world and the creation by the divine being of the social order, with the Brahmins at the top. It then outlines the elements of V EDIC education that are required in the BRAHMACHARYA or student stage of life. It gives an idealized description of the householder stage of life, dealing with mar- riage, children, ceremonies for ancestors, virtues such as generosity and merit, and a listing of the permitted occupations for a twice-born person, a person of the three top castes. Among other topics are the acceptance of food from various people, the types of foods that can or cannot be eaten, and things that will pollute a Brahmin by contact. It also discusses the forest dweller’s ( VANAPRASTHA ’s) duties and behavior that would be taken up when the householder reached that stage of life. Two chapters deal extensively with the proper conduct of kings. There is a chapter on women that has become notorious for its call for their complete submission to men, and other sections on issues of inheritance and kingly justice. The book outlines the four- CASTE system and discusses the various mixed of castes. It has a chapter on restitution for various crimes; a lower-caste person is to be punished more severely than an upper-caste person. Finally it discusses issues of transmigration and KARMA .

The lingam always stands on a round base, which is representative of the YONI or vagina of the GODDESS . The origin story for this cult object is well known. Shiva in his guise as a mad ascetic, naked, smeared with human ashes, and dishev- eled, appeared in the Pine Forest (deodar for- est) where sages had retired with their wives to meditate. Mischievous and powerful, he began to brandish his erect penis before the women. Because of his divine power, the women were enthralled. However, the rishis were appalled and cursed the god so that he would lose his penis. Instead of falling, Shiva’s penis took off at lightning speed and fearsome energy and began rocketing around the universe causing endless destruction. The frightened rishis went to the gods to see how they could save the universe from destruction. The gods called upon the devi or goddess to offer her yoni as a safe place for the Shiva lingam to rest; thus it is that every Shiva lingam rests on a representation of the vagina of the goddess.

Lokenath Divine Life Mission Lokenath Divine Life Mission is an outgrowth of the work of Swami Shuddhananda (b. 1949), who has become a holy figure serving the poor of Calcutta (Kolkata), much as his late Roman Catholic coun- terpart Mother Teresa. His fellowship carries out its social and religious service in the areas where there are poverty and sickness. He has played a major role in developing schools and medical facilities, as well as economic activity, to provide nourishment, homes, and education for the underprivileged. The mission offers courses to transform stress into a positive power that produces success, peace, and harmony. The mission also sponsors programs to foster women’s empowerment and sustainable rural development in India. The fellowship is named for Baba Lokenath (1730–1890), who reportedly lived for 160 years as an embodiment of love, compassion, and humility. He taught his disciples that he would guide and help them forever, even after his death. The Lokenath Fellowship calls upon this promise and assumes that the enlightened sage watches over the social service organization devoted to his work in life. As a young man, Shuddhananda emerged from school and university as a professor in business at Hyderabad University. Concerned about the reli- gious and social service needs of underprivileged people he eventually left the academic arena and sought refuge in the Himalaya Mountains. He remained there several years searching his soul about how to help others. As a very young man he had had visions of the 19th-century rishi and saint Baba Lokenath. The memories of the visions never left him. After his pilgrimage in the Himalayas he founded a social service and religious center where he could nur- ture those in need. The design of his mission and the scope of his services, from medicine to social support, are reminiscent of the work of Swami S HIVANANDA S ARASWATI of Rishikish, the founder of the Divine Life Society. During the 1990s Swami Shuddhananda trav- eled to the United States to share his spirituality and to talk about the way he has designed his social service mission. A small number of disciples have joined to learn from him and help with his charitable work in India. The Fellowship in the United States is located in Louisiana. The Interna- tional Mission has headquarters in Calcutta. Further reading: Anne Cushman and Jerry Jones, From Here to Nirvana (New York: Riverhead Books, 1998). Long, Barry (1926–2003) Australian teacher of realization Barry Long was a spiritual teacher from Australia whose realization of immortality in 1965 trans- formed his life and advanced him to realization of a higher consciousness. Born in Sydney, Australia, in 1926, Long pur- sued a career in newspaper editing and politics. At the age of 31 he experienced a death of self and a dawning of a new sense of existence. The event sparked in him a lifelong quest for truth and self-knowledge. In the 1970s he traveled to London to secure publication of his experiences. There he continued writing and began meeting regularly with small groups of people interested in his teachings. In the 1980s he started holding meetings and meditation classes with larger audi- ences. His first widely circulated book, The Ori- gins of Man and the Universe, published in 1984, increased his public recognition. The Barry Long Foundation was established as an educational charity in England in 1985. Later that year, he founded the Barry Long Centre on Long, Barry 261 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 261 12/14/06 9:28:59 AM"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"the Gold Coast of Queensland. In England, North America, Australia, and New Zealand he taught seminars in his increasingly popular Course in Being. In 1993 Long began teaching a 16-day event called the Master Session, which took place annu- ally in New South Wales. His teachings emphasize the living of truth and the realization that no dual- ity exists between one’s self and the greater power. Long’s seminars introduce the stillness of being and the attainment of an inner place from which people can live their daily lives. The Barry Long Foundation headquartered in Australia does not have formal membership but continues to publish and distribute Long’s written works through its publication branch, Barry Long Books. Long died of prostate cancer on December 6, 2003.

Lozowick, Lee (1943– ) Western Baul teacher Lee Lozowick is an American teacher of the YOGA practices and syncretic Buddhist-Hindu philoso- phy of the B AUL S ECT of Bengal. He is a prolific poet and writer, whose practice strongly empha- sizes music—he and his followers have performed around the world. Born on November 18, 1943, in Brooklyn, New York, to Russian Jewish parents, Lozowick describes his early life as “completely ordinary.” His grandfather had been a tzaddik, or religious teacher, and his father, Louis, a successful artist. In 1970, while living in New Jersey, Lozowick became a teacher of Silva Mind Control and stud- ied the human potential movement in depth. In 1975, after reading the works of A DI D A S AMRAJ (known at the time as Bubba Free John), which he recognized as true, he became enlightened, or as he puts it, “woke up.” He describes the process as completely impersonal and not the result of any training or discipline. In 1977, Lozowick went to India and met Yogi R AMSURATKUMAR , who was living at the ashram of R AMANA M AHARSHI in Tiruvannamalai, South India. Lozowick called the yogi his “father.” Lozowick relates that since 1975 he has been teaching in the Western Baul tradition. The Bauls of Bengal are a 500-year-old sect of ecstatic sing- ers, love poets, and wandering minstrels who sprang from the folk tradition of rural Bengal. The Bauls blend tantric Buddhism and devotional Hinduism with music, dance, and yoga of sexual energy and breath, to form a path to God-realiza- tion through the body. Lozowick has adapted this tradition to serve spiritual seekers in the West. Lozowick’s teachings emphasize the practice of guru yoga, which he himself practiced for 25 years when his own guru was alive and continues to practice since his death. Lozowick functions as both guru and disciple. He has published over 1,000 poems to his master, Yogi Ramsuratkumar. After awakening, Lozowick formed a small community called Hohm in New Jersey and began to teach spiritual devotees. In 1980, the com- munity moved to Arizona, where both the Hohm Sahaj Mandir (temple) and Hohm Community are located. Lozowick also founded two ashrams, in France and India. Hohm Press has issued a number of publications on spiritual topics, natu- ral health, Eastern religion, poetry, and parenting. Lozowick himself has written 18 books. Lozowick is known for the poetry and music he has produced in the past 20 years. He is the lead singer in Sri, a blues band composed of members of his community that has produced nine albums and performs yearly tours to large audiences throughout Europe and the United States. His community also has a theater company, a gospel choir, a children’s school, a publishing company, and several published authors. He is a passionate advocate for children and teaches prac- K 262 Lozowick, Lee 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 262 12/14/06 9:28:59 AM"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"tices for conscious parenting. For Lee Lozowick and his students, spiritual maturity is expressed in and through all aspects of life, and service to the divine is expressed through service of humanity.

Lust, Benedict (1872–1945) founder of naturopathy Benedict Lust was a pioneer in what has come to be called holistic medicine and a facilitator of the dissemination of YOGA in the United States. Lust was born in Michelbach, Baden, Germany. As a youth, he became ill and was cured by Fr. Sebastian Kneipp, a famous advocate of the water cure, a popular form of healing in the 19th cen- tury. He eventually traveled to the United States as Kneipp’s official representative and in the late 1890s organized the water cure movement, espe- cially among the many first generation German Americans. Meanwhile, Lust studied osteopathy and vari- ous schools of healing that eschewed the use of drugs and surgery. By 1900, Lust was looking toward a new synthesis of nonintrusive healing arts, which he termed naturopathy (a name he actually purchased from a colleague). In 1919, by which time Lust had launched his long-term battle to have the government recognize naturopathy, Lust met Sri Y OGENDRA , a yogi who had traveled to New York from Bombay (Mumbai). Yogendra was a pioneer in reviving HATHA YOGA as a discipline for body and mind in India and had gone to the United States to con- duct a set of scientific tests with the Life Exten- sion Institute in New York. Lust quickly saw the value that hatha yoga might have in his repertoire of healing tools. In 1924, Yogendra returned to Bombay. The restrictive, discriminatory immigration laws that went into effect at the time prevented him from making any return visits. Thus, Lust, through his naturopathy, was to become the major dis- seminating force for yoga in the next generation. Only after World War II did Asian teachers arrive in the United States once more to help popularize hatha yoga. Lust died in 1945. Subsequently yoga has been deemphasized by naturopaths, and Lust’s role in introducing yoga in America largely for- gotten. The Benedict Lust Publication Company still offers books on naturopathy, health, and healing.

In 1984 she founded the Devi Mandir temple in California and began spreading her teachings through worldwide tours and music recordings. Shree Maa was born in Assam in northeastern India around 1950. Although no records exist for her name and date of birth, she reportedly was born in the year a great earthquake shook the region. She is from a family, that included businessmen as well as advanced yogis and is a descendant of the 18th-century Bengali poet-saint and K ALI devotee Ramprasad Sen. She received her early education from her grandmother, whose attentiveness to worship in daily activities made a great impression upon her. She spent much of her childhood in meditation at the local temple and in the family shrine room. In her early teens, Shree Maa spent many hours in solitude and worship, both at home and in the nearby caves of the Himalayas. She knew as a child that the 19th-century priest of Kali, Sri R AMAKRISHNA , would be her personal GURU . In high school and college she continued to live introspectively and to worship in seclusion, show- ing little interest in family and social gatherings. After completing college she left home and trav- eled to K AMAKHYA , the famous pilgrimage site in the foothills of the H IMALAYAS . She spent the next eight years wandering in the area living the life of an ascetic. Villagers always found her in deep meditation. She spoke very little and ate only basil leaves and sandal water. Devotees claimed that she reached SAMADHI , the highest state of conscious- ness, and gave her the name Shree Maa, Respected Holy Mother. Breaking her solitude in the late 1970s, Shree Maa began worshipping in temples and sing- ing publicly, exposure that drew an increasing audience of devotees. In 1980, at a temple in Bakreswar, West Bengal, Shree Maa met Swami Satyananda Saraswati, an American-born trav- eler who had been studying under a number of gurus in India since the 1960s. The two traveled together throughout India, performing religious rituals wherever they were invited. In the early 1980s, Shree Maa received divine instruction from Sri Ramakrishna to move to America and teach the meaning of DHARMA , the path of righteousness.

Madhva (c. 1197 to 1276 C . E .) Vedanta philosopher Madhva was a brilliant, prolific scholar of V EDANTA who developed his own DVAITA or dual- ist philosophy. Madhva was born near Udipi in Karnataka in a village called Rajapitha, which may be the mod- ern Kalyanapura. He was born into an orthodox Vaishnavite B RAHMIN family. He became the dis- ciple of Acutyapreksha, a great teacher. Madhva studied the writings of S HANKARA , the great non-dual ( ADVAITA ) philosopher, but concluded by rejecting his teachings. In fact, he eventually wrote tracts opposing 21 important philosophers in order to establish his own phi- losophy of dvaita or dualist V EDANTA . He made a circuit of the south of India, going first to Trivan- drum and staying in R AMESHVARAM , the famous Vaishnavite holy city in Tamil Nadu. As he spoke, he would argue against the various existing philo- sophical schools. He later traveled in North India, living in such places as H ARIDVAR and Badarika. He is said to have converted many followers of Shan- kara in his travels. Eventually, he even converted his own GURU . Madhva produced a massive corpus of work including commentaries on all the 13 orthodox Vedic Upanishads, the Vedanta Sutra, and the Bhagavad Gita. In these works he relentlessly argued for the idea that God and the human self or soul were completely distinct from each other, and that the world also was completely distinct from God. His profound dualism was a challenge to the non-dualist thinkers who preceded and fol- lowed him, who represent by far the largest school of Vedanta. He argued that only the grace of God, in the form of K RISHNA , could save a human being from the endless round of birth and rebirth, and only BHAKTI , or devotion to the divinity, could res- cue humans from the abyss of successive rebirth.

It was situated at the mouth of the Palar River, 32 miles south of Madras (Chennai). The river long ago changed course. A granite hill about 100 feet high and a half a mile in length, and a smaller granite outcropping farther south, provided the site and the raw mate- rial for the sculptures. Each work is carved out of solid stone, without the use of any brick or mor- tar, and without assembly of individual pieces. The technique was also used at the Kailasanatha temple at E LLORA T EMPLE contemporaneously. The most dramatic carving, “Descent of the G ANGES ” (also known as A RJUNA ’ S Penance), covers an entire cliff 30 feet high and 60 feet wide. It shows the Ganges’s descending from heaven, flanked on both sides by NAGAS and NAGINIS . Deities, human beings, and animals all face the fissure in the rock where the Gan- ges descends in attitudes of adoration. A small shrine immediately to the left has a standing S HIVA image, before which bows Bhagiratha, who was responsible for the Ganges’s descent.

Mahabharata The Mahabharata (MBh), is one of the two great Indian epics (the other is the R AMAYANA ). It tells the story of the descendents of B HARATA , the leg- endary leader of the early Indian tribes. It is the world’s largest epic, containing at least 100,000 verses. It is often said in India that there is noth- ing that is not in the MBh and that which is not in the MBh is to be found nowhere. The story is said to have been dictated to the god G ANESHA by the sage V YA S A . Vyasa is the teller of the tale for our own era, but it is considered to have existed long before. From time to time Vyasa himself plays an important role in the epic. The epic recounts a dynastic struggle that took place near Delhi in northern India. The eldest son in the dynasty of the Kurus is Pandu, whose wife, Kunti, has five sons (considered Pandu’s sons, although each was fathered by a different god): Y UDHISHTHIRA , A RJUNA , B HIMA , Nakula, and Sahadeva. Collectively they are known as the P ANDAVAS . Because of a curse on Pandu that he will die if he has sexual intercourse with either of his wives (Kunti and Madri), Pandu is forced to give up his claim to the throne in favor of his blind brother, Dhritarashtra. Dhritarashtra has 100 sons, the oldest of whom is D URYODHANA . They are known collectively as the K AURAVAS . Dhritarashtra becomes regent until Pandu’s sons are of age, when one of them will rightfully assume the throne. Dhritarashtra is weak-willed and cannot resist his son Duryodhana’s attempts to usurp power. The plotting of Duryodhana and his Kauravas against the Pandavas forms the cen- tral dynamic in this intriguing story. When their plot to murder the five Pandava brothers fails, they fleece them at dice and drive them into exile. Finally, events culminate in open warfare between the two camps. The Pandavas are forced to fight against not only their evil cousins and uncles, but their venerable guru D RONA and their grand-uncle B HISHMA . In fact, part of the epic’s greatness is that the story is not pure black and white, but instead shows shades of gray on both sides. The god K RISHNA serves as the noncombatant charioteer of the brave Pandava, Arjuna. As the two pull up to look at the opposing armies before the war begins, Krishna recites the celebrated B HAGAVAD G ITA , a profound poem that summarizes Hindu philosophy. On the battlefield of K URUK - SHETRA a terrible carnage ensues, as the Pandavas eventually triumph and gain the kingdom.

Mahashivaratri The 14th day of the dark half of every lunar month (when the Moon is waning) is called Shivaratri (Shiva night). The Shivaratri of the month of Magha (February–March) is designated as Mahashivaratri (Great Shiva night) and is cel- ebrated with a festival. Several stories in the Skanda, Lingam, and Padma Puranas describe this festival, and the power associated with it. Once, it is said a hunter unknowingly fasted, watched over, and bathed a Shiva LINGAM all night, not knowing it was the Mahashivaratri time. For this simple deed he was rewarded by being taken directly to the abode of Shiva. Mahashivaratri is the one major Hindu cel- ebration that is not accompanied by revelry and gaiety. It is a solemn event that emphasizes restraint; devotees make vows such as forgive- ness, truth telling, and noninjury to beings, which must be honored for the full 24 hours. Fasting and staying awake all night to worship Shiva are also important aspects of this observance. One spends the night reciting the MANTRA of S HIVA — om namah shivaya —and praying for forgiveness. If the rites are performed faithfully one is rewarded with worldly success and the heavenly realm of Shiva. The festival and its vows probably originated around the fifth century C . E . In mythological terms the Mahashivaratri observance is often attributed to an episode that occurred on that day: when Shiva manifested himself as the fiery lingam ( jyotir lingam), B RAHMA set off on his swan vehicle to find the lingam’s top, and Vishnu set out in the form of a boar to root for its bottom. Neither of the two divinities was successful, thus proving that Shiva was supreme. In another story, Mahashivaratri was the day when Shiva, in order to save the world from destruction, drank the ter- rible poison that emerged when the M ILK O CEAN was churned by the gods and demons to produce the nectar of immortality.

Occasionally, they are from commen- taries on the Upanishads or other sources that express Upanishadic philosophy. They are sub- jected to extensive exposition and exegesis in the different schools of V EDANTA . Most commonly, only four mahavakyas are counted. These four statements are from the Y AJUR , S AMA , R IG , and A THARVA V EDAS in order. Some Vedic systems cite five, six, or even seven mahavakyas. mahavakyas 269 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 269 12/14/06 9:29:01 AM"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"The first of the basic four is from B RIHADA - RANYAKA U PANISHAD I. 4. 10: “Aham brahmasmi” (I [ aham ] am [ asmi ] the ultimate reality [the brahman ]). In other words, the individual self is identical to the ultimate reality of the brah- man. From the C HANDOGYA U PANISHAD VI. 8. 7 is the second phrase, “Tat tvam asi” that [ tat ] (is what) you [ tvam ] are [ asi ]. That refers to the brahman, while you refers to the AT M A N , the indi- vidual soul or self within every human being. In Vedanta the atman as ultimate self and the brah- man are seen to be one. This particular phrase is used in succession eight times in chapter 6 of the Chandogya Upanishad, and once each in sections 8 through 16, when Aruni, the father, is teaching his son the truth of the Atman, the Ultimate Self. The third mahavakya is “ayam atma brahma” (This [ ayam ] self [ atma ] is brahma. ) This means that the individual self is the Ultimate Reality, the All, the brahman. This phrase is found verbatim in M ANDUKYA U PANISHAD I. 2 and is the logical conclusion of statements made by Y AJNAVALKYA to two different questioners in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, II.4. 1; II.4.2 and II. 5.1. The fourth phrase is taken from A ITAREYA U PANISHAD , III.3.13: “prajnanam brahma.” The Ultimate Reality is wis- dom (or consciousness [ prajnanam ]). Another mahavakya from the Upanishads that is sometimes cited is “sarvam khalu idam brahma” (All indeed is that [60]) (C HANDOGYA U PANISHAD III.14.1 and Maitri Upanishad IV.6 2). Other mahavakyas commonly cited are from the commentaries of specific Vedanta philosophers such as S HANKARA or from still other sources. The word can be used generically to refer to the “Great Sayings” of any particular person, for example, S AI B ABA OF SHIRDI . Further reading: Jan Gonda, Notes on Brahman (Utre- cht: J. L.

Mahavira (c. 599–527 B . C . E .) Jain Arhat (omniscient being) Mahavira (great spiritual hero) is considered by Jains to be the last of the great disseminators of their faith in this half-era ( see J AINISM ). His life is celebrated in legends and festivals and is consid- ered a model for all Jains to imitate. He was born in 599 in Kundagrama, a large city near the modern city of Patna. His father, Siddhartha, belonged to the Jnatri clan, and his mother, Trishala, was the sister of the king of the area. The texts say they were followers of the earlier Jain T IRTHANKARA and teacher P ARSHVANATH . They named their child Vardhamana, “he who brings prosperity.” The S HVETAMBARA Jains believe that Mahavira was originally conceived by a Brahmin couple, Rishabhadatta and Devananda, and that the embryo was transferred into Trishala’s womb magi- cally. D IGAMBARA Jains do not accept this story. Before Mahavira’s birth Trishala had a series of auspicious dreams. Of the two major Jain sects, the S HVETAMBARAS say there were 14 dreams; the D IGAMBARAS say 16. In these dreams she saw (1) a white elephant, (2) a white bull, (3) a lion, (4) the Goddess Sri, (5) garlands of mandara flowers, (6) the full Moon, (7) the rising Sun, (8) a large and beautiful flag, (9) a vase of fine metal, (10) a lake full of lotuses, (11) an ocean of milk, (12) a celes- tial house in the sky, (13) a huge heap of gems, and (14) a blazing fire. Digambaras add (15) a lofty throne and (16) a pair of fish cavorting in a lake. Jains today recall and reenact these dreams when they celebrate the five auspicious moments of Mahavira’s life. It is said that Vardhamana remained very quiet inside the womb, exhibiting the Jain virtue of AHIMSA or noninjury. He only moved when by his powers he learned that his mother worried he was not alive. His birth was accompanied by many marvels as all beings celebrated the birth of the Tirthankara, the karmically special unique teacher, of this half-era. Not much is known of his childhood.

The Shvetambaras and Digam- baras disagree about what occurred once Mahavira reached a marriageable age. The Shvetambaras say that he fulfilled his duties as a householder, married a princess called Yashoda, and fathered a daughter called Priyadarshana. They say that he did not become a mendicant until his parents died. The Digambaras believe that Mahavira never married. They stress the notion that he had an aversion to worldly matters from an early age. When Mahavira was 30 years of age some gods went to him and urged him to renounce the world. A great ceremony took place when he embarked on his renunciation in a large park under an ashoka tree. According to the Digam- baras he removed all his clothes and pulled out all his hair in five bunches (as is the norm for Jain monks and nuns even today), becoming a naked ascetic. The Shvetambaras accept most of these details, but they believe he wore a small loincloth given to him by I NDRA , king of the gods. They say that he wore this cloth for 13 months, when out of com- plete disregard for such things he let it fall from him and proceeded as a naked mendicant. Mahavira wandered for 12 years, abstain- ing for long periods from water or food or both, ignoring all bodily pains or pleasures, not caring whether he was in the burning sunshine or the pouring rain. (Digambaras, however, believe he observed a vow of silence and solitude for these 12 years.)

Unfortunately, they report, Gosala eventually broke away and declared himself a jina or spiritual victor, cursing Mahavira when the lat- ter contradicted his claim. After an amazingly difficult and extended period of austerity, in which Mahavira showed no concern for any bodily insult or trial, he ascended to kevalajnana enlightenment—an infi- nite supreme knowledge and intuition. He then became the 24th and final Tirthankara of the cur- rent half-era. When he became enlightened and omniscient, the gods built him a vast assembly hall, where he sat quietly and uttered a divine sound that carried the essence of the Jain teaching. The Digambaras believe that the message was heard by all beings of every sort—heavenly beings, hell beings, humans, animals, and gods—all of whom gathered there in amazement; they also believe that Mahavira no longer ate, drank, slept, or aged, as a sign of his pure state. Shvetambaras believe that only the gods and a select few disciples heard his teach- ing. A Jain community began to form around him from that moment, though he made no effort to create it. After his enlightenment, Mahavira lived for 30 years as an omniscient being, traveling from place to place. At the age of 72, after undergoing a series of ever more rigorous fasts, he took his death. He passed from this world, his soul heading toward the top of the universe, where it remains eternally in unlimited consciousness and bliss. Historians believe that a Jain community of monks, nuns, and lay people emerged during Mahavira’s lifetime. Nuns always outnumbered monks in the community by a significant margin.

He founded an ashram to teach his syncretic system of twilight YOGA . Lawrence Amos Miles was born on April 29, 1911, in London, England. As a child, he was interested in spiritual questions and the pagan way of life, and as a young man he had a series of unique experiences that forecast his devotion to the inner life. In his early 20s Miles met Aleister Crowley (1875–1947), who suggested that he study the I Ching with Asian adepts. Miles went to India in 1953 and was initiated into SANNYAS (renuncia- tion) by Sadguru Lokanath, a teacher in the Adi- nath branch of the Nath Sampradaya School ( see N AT H Y OGIS ). This tantric order ( see TANTRISM ) is unorthodox in its practices, which include wan- dering and nudity. During his 30 years as a renun- ciant in India, Miles studied with other GURUS and was initiated into two other schools, the Kaula and the Sahajiya, both of which are “left-handed” tantric sects, meaning that they use the impurities of life as a means of SELF - REALIZATION . He also went to Bhutan, where he was initiated into Tibetan Buddhism; to Malaysia, where he became a Tao- ist priest; and to Sri Lanka, where he became a Theravadin monk. In 1975, he founded an ashram in Gujarat and began to teach a spiritual system called K 272 mahayuga 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 272 12/14/06 9:29:01 AM"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"twilight yoga, which included elements of the I Ching, Tibetan Buddhism, Zen Buddhism, and S HAIVISM .

He died at his ashram near the Vatrak River in the state of Gujarat on August 30, 1991.

Mahesh Yogi, Maharishi (b. 1911 or 1917) founder of Transcendental Meditation The Maharishi Mahesh Yogi played an important role in spreading the theory and practice of MEDI - TATION in the West. During the height of the West- ern “counterculture,” he acquired a large degree of fame and notoriety. Little is known about the Maharishi’s early life. Mahesh is his family name, and Maharishi in Sanskrit means “great sage or saint.” His date of birth has been variously given as either October 18, 1911, or January 12, 1917. Acquaintances in India claim that he is a native of Uttarkashi, a small town in the H IMALAYAS , and the son of a local income tax collector. According to his official biography, he received a degree in physics from Allahabad University in 1942 and then worked in a factory before studying S ANSKRIT and Indian philosophy. According to his biography, the Maharishi studied ADVAITA (non-dual) V EDANTA for 13 years under Swami Brahmananda Saraswati, Jagadguru and Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math, Himalayas (1870–1953). Upon the death of Brahmananda, he withdrew to a cave near Uttarkashi for two years. On a visit to South India in 1955, he gave his first talks and became a popular lecturer on the wisdom of Hinduism. In 1958 at a lecture in Madras (Chennai), the Maharishi spoke of his vision for the “spiritual regeneration of all mankind,” which received a five- minute ovation. The next evening he announced the formation of the Spiritual Regeneration move- ment, dedicated to the accomplishment of that goal. Soon after, he began the first of more than 12 world tours. He first left India to settle in London, where he established the International Meditation Society. He taught primarily out of a small apart- ment in London’s Knightsbridge section, as well as private homes and hotels. He arrived in the United States in 1959 teach- ing a technique called T RANSCENDENTAL M EDITATION (T.M.), a practice that draws from Vedic science and employs a MANTRA , or chant, that is given to each student in an initiatory ritual. Each person’s mantra is meant to saturate the mind and allow a peaceful state of mind, absent of thought. Initiates are encouraged to practice at least a half-hour in the morning and a half-hour in the evening. T.M. is well suited to life in the secular, technological West, as the practice does not require devotion or faith and claims a scientific rather than religious basis. In the 1960s the Beatles were his most cel- ebrated followers. In addition to the Spiritual Regeneration move- ment founded in 1958, the Maharishi formed the Students International Meditation Society and the International Meditation Society in the 1960s. In 1971, Maharishi International University was founded by the Maharishi in Iowa to train teach- ers of T.M. The Maharishi returned to India in the late 1970s and moved to the Netherlands in 1990. His organization includes ashrams, clinics, schools, universities, and Vedic study centers. His teach- ings have stimulated a broad array of interest in Vedic literature. With over 5 million initiates, T.M. has expanded the reach of traditional yoga and Vedic philosophy.

Malaysia The earliest Hindu state to appear on the Malay Peninsula was Kamalanka, which emerged dur- ing the seventh century C . E . It appears to have developed out of the earlier kingdom of Lang- La-Tsiu, a dependency of the Cambodian king- dom of Funan. Eventually the Malay Peninsula became part of the Hindu kingdoms of Srivijaya (Sumatra) and Majapahit (Java). Hinduism as well as Buddhism were practiced throughout the peninsula, which became in 1957 the Fed- eration of Malaya. Malaysia was formed in 1963 when the former British colonies of Singapore and Sabah and Sarawak (on Borneo) joined the federation. Malaysia became a British colony during the 19th century; from the start, the colony accepted Hindu immigrants. Immigration from India con- tinued until World War II, with peak numbers entering Malaysia during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The movement of laborers to Malaysia constituted one of the largest Indian out-migrations in history. Unlike in earlier peri- ods (the era of Hindu expansion), emigrants were primarily from the lower castes, recruited to work in the sugar and rubber plantations, or in the fishing, forestry, and mining industries. Most migrants were from the state of Madras and were culturally Tamil, although significant num- bers were Telugu and Gujarati. S IKHS from the Punjab served in the military and police forces. The Tamil financier caste introduced worship of the deity Murugan, or K ARTTIKEYA son of S HIVA , who became the principal deity recognized in Malaysia. Today South Asians compose 8 percent of the population of the Malay Peninsula. Most Hindus do not practice orthodox Hinduism, but rather Tamil folk religion. Recently, Brahminical practices have become more popular, a process called Sanskritization.

Mandukya Upanishad The Mandukya is a short U PANISHAD (12 small stanzas) in the Atharva Veda, one of the most important for the ADVAITA (non-dual) V EDANTA of S HANKARA . Shankara’s guru, G AUDAPADA , wrote a commentary on the Mandukya Upanishad that became important in that tradition. In its first stanza the Upanishad establishes the supremacy of the syllable om, equating it to the ultimate BRAHMAN . Stanzas 3 through 7 outline the four STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS . Stanzas 9 through 12 establish that the four parts of om (esoteri- cally understood as a, u, m, and a fourth, which is beyond parts) are identical to the four states of consciousness, thus establishing om as the ATMAN or self.

Its widest meaning, how- ever, is “auspicious.” Along with its opposite, amangala, the term is constantly heard on a daily basis in Indian culture. A number of factors can contribute to mak- ing something auspicious in India. It may be an astrological issue—the stars and conjunctions of planets can indicate that a particular day, month, or year will be mangala or amangala. Certain individuals are by definition mangala, such as GURUS , saints, and other holy men. Additionally, certain events can be described as auspicious, for instance, the arrival of an unexpected guest. Places, including rivers, mountains, and shrines, also can be seen as mangala, or auspicious, and mangala 275 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 275 12/14/06 9:29:02 AM"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"yield benefits in both spiritual and worldly terms if they are visited. A wide variety of places, times, locations, or objects can be described as mangala. In Jain tradi- tion the ashtamangala or eight auspicious things are taken out for special occasions. They include a mirror and a pot full of water. In fact, the poten- tial for auspicious or inauspicious occurrences is practically unlimited on a day-to-day basis in Indian tradition.

Manikkavacakar (c. ninth century) Tamil poet-saint Manikkavacakar is often considered the Tamil people’s most revered Shaivite poet-saint, even though he is not included in the traditional grouping of 63 saints. His works, Tirukkovaiyar and T IRUVACAKAM , form the eighth book of the Tamil Shaivite canonical work T IRUMURAI . There is hardly a Tamil Shaivite who does not know a line from these two poems, which express devotion to Lord S HIVA with great beauty and fervor. Manikkavacakar was born in a Tamil Brahmin family in Tiruvatavur, a village on the Vaikai River, which also runs through the city of Madurai, and thus he has the proper name of Tirvatavur (He Who Belongs to the Sacred Village of Tiruvatavu- ras). But he is best known, Manikkavacakar (he whose utterances [ vacaka ] are like rubies [ manik- kam ]). His father was an adviser to the Pandya king. The son followed in his father’s footsteps and became chief minister to the Pandya monarch Arimarttanar. The story goes that Manikkavacakar was sent by the monarch to a port city with a huge sum of money to buy horses. There Manikkavacakar, who was inclined to renounce the world, met his GURU , who was in fact a form of S HIVA himself. There he took teaching from the guru and asked to be taken as a devotee. He surrendered to his guru all the treasure entrusted to him by the king. When the king found out, he imprisoned Manikkavacakar. Forced to stand in the hot sun so that he would agree to return the money, the saint prayed to Shiva, and a herd of beautiful horses was deliv- ered to him to give to the king. Unfortunately, the horses were jackals who had been magically transformed and reverted to their former nature during the night. The king again tormented Manikkavacakar in the hot sun. Eventually, when Shiva revealed himself to the king, Manikkavacakar was released. He was ordered by Shiva to go to three shrines to teach and to defeat the Buddhists in debate. One of these shrines was the famous Shiva shrine of C HIDAMBARAM . It was there that most of the hymns that formed the Tiruvacakam were first sung (and probably written by his followers). It is said that the Buddhists there heard of the saint and sent someone to debate him. Manikkavacakar completely vanquished the Buddhists in debate, invoking S ARASVATI to strike them dumb. The Bud- dhists then all became devotees of Shiva. Eventu- ally, Shiva himself wrote all the poet’s works, and the saint disappeared into the icon of Shiva in Chidambaram. Further reading: G. U.

It is situated on the spine at the level of the navel. This chakra is associated with the drive for power and accomplishment. Arrogance and vanity are the emotions that mani- fest from it. Its element is fire ( see PANCHA MAHAB - K 276 Manikkavacakar 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 276 12/14/06 9:29:02 AM"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"HUTAS ). Its deity is R UDRA .

Mantras vary in size from one short syllable to a long chant, such as found in the “mantras” of the R IG V EDA . Etymologically mantra comes from the man, “think,” and tra, “instru- ment,” making a mantra literally an “instrument of thought,” or more truly an “instrument of con- sciousness.” In the V EDAS the mantras were understood to be of superhuman origin, eternal and uncreated, and were received and recited by seers and reciters in order to call to divine powers. They were used for the removal of sins, diseases, and misfortune; the conquest of enemies; and innumerable other purposes. In post-Vedic Hinduism the word mantra acquired a philosophical meaning. It was said to be derived from man (think) and tra (protect); a mantra then is that which conditions or pro- tects consciousness and helps lead to liberation. All the old Vedic usages remained throughout Indian tradition, but the use of mantras to purify consciousness, identify with the divinity, and lead one toward liberation was always highly valued. Mantras are used in India for building tem- ples, for installing icons, and for worshipping them. Those who enter various orders are often given initiation mantras. Any Indian tradition has its mula, or basic mantra. Recitation of this mantra in japa or repetitive utterance is efficacious for all purposes. The Shaivite traditions use the mantra om namah shivaya for this purpose. The Jains have what is called the mantra of five salutations, which is used for giving blessings and for asking for good fortune. Since Buddhism grew up on Indian soil, mantras are part of every sect of Bud- dhism, although their usage and interpretation may vary from those of the various Hindu sects. The bija mantra, or seed mantra, is used most often in rituals. It is a one-syllable mantra, almost always ending with an m sound, which embodies the full power of a divinity. For instance, gam is the bija mantra for G ANESHA and is always used in chanting to him. All Hindu sects have slightly different philoso- phies of mantra, and all sects have long litanies of names of their divinities that can be recited for any purpose, including liberation. There is the famous V ISHNU sahasranama, for instance, the Thousand Names of Vishnu, that V AISHNAVITES faithfully recited for all purposes. In Hindu TANTRA it is common to understand the mula mantra, the basic mantra, as being the ultimate form of the divinity, more powerful and efficacious than either the yantra (the esoteric graphic form) or the image of the divinity itself. When one does a tantric mantra, one literally becomes the divinity, as the mantra is the divin- ity. Finally, according to tantra belief, by chant- ing the mula mantra or the litany of mantras to the divinity one can realize the ajapa mantra, or mantra that constantly recites itself. That is, the mantra begins to repeat itself in one’s conscious- ness without further external utterance, thus totally transforming the adept. In the S HAKTA forms of tantra the Goddess mantras are called VIDYAS (wisdom), and the term mantra is reserved for utterances that relate to the male divinities only. Behind the power and significance of mantra in India is the understanding that the universe itself is constituted of nothing but sound. The world is from nada BRAHMAN or ultimate sound. A mantra then is not a mere utterance, but must be understood to be intimately connected to the mantra 277 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 277 12/14/06 9:29:02 AM"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"substance of the universe itself, and hence yields power when recited.

Manu Manu is the name of the first man in each of the designated ages or MANVANTARAS in Indian tradi- tion, a progenitor somewhat akin to the West- ern biblical Adam. There have been an infinite number of ages in the past, as there will be in the future. Therefore the Manus are infinite in number. According to TIME calculations in Hindu tra- ditions, there are 14 MANVANTARAS in each eon or KALPA , which constitutes a day in the life of B RAHMA or 4,320,000,000 years. The first Manu of our kalpa was Svayambhuva Manu, who Indian tradition says composed the L AW S OF M ANU , the famous text on social law. In all there have already been seven Manus in the current kalpa, each one leading off his designated age, includ- ing the Manu who began the age we live in today, who is known as Vaivasvata. There will be seven more Manus in the remaining ages until our kalpa is ended. Further reading: Cornelia Dimmitt and J. A. B. van Buitenen.

It was understood that smallpox was both caused and cured by this goddess. There were those who understood the disease to be in some way a blessing of the goddess upon them, with the white pustules seen as auspicious markings. However, the worship of Mariyamman was almost always intended to ward off the dis- ease or to alleviate its effects. Because smallpox has been eliminated, Mariyamman is propitiated K 278 Manu 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 278 12/14/06 9:29:03 AM"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"in the case of chickenpox and other diseases today.

Maruts The Maruts were originally the storm and wind gods of the R IG V EDA . They accompanied I NDRA , king of the gods, who holds a lightning bolt. In various references they are said to be 27, 49, or 180 in number. They throw thunderbolts, churn up wind, and cause the Earth to quake with their fury. In the Puranas the Maruts are instead seen as the sons of Kashyapa and Diti. Having no child, Diti asked her RISHI husband for a boon. She wanted a child who could defeat Indra. Her husband said this could happen if she carried the son in her womb for 100 years while remain- ing completely pious and pure. At the 99th year, she is said to have faltered and Indra, anxiously observing, split the embryo into seven parts to become the seven Maruts. The name Marut was given to them by Indra when he told them not to cry ( rut ). Further reading: Cornelia Dimmitt and J. A.

Mata, Sri Daya (1914– ) prominent American Hindu leader Sri Daya Mata is the American-born third presi- dent of the S ELF -R EALIZATION F ELLOWSHIP (SRF). Faye Wright was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, and grew up in an environment of the Church of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons). As an elementary school student she first learned about India and quickly developed an emotional attachment that stayed with her as she grew up. Her reading of the B HAGAVAD G ITA as a teenager set her on a quest for God that only began to be satisfied in 1931 when she attended a lecture given by Paramahansa Y OGANANDA in her hometown. Wright saw in Yogananda a person with a relationship to the divine that she wanted for herself; she resolved to follow him. Because of an illness that kept her out of school she was able to attend some of his classes, her face bandaged. During one class Yogananda approached her and announced that she would be healed within a week. His prophecy materialized. Two weeks later, with the permission of her parents, she entered Yogananda’s ashram in Los Angeles. Wright became one of Yogananda’s closest associates in his Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF). She took vows of renunciation and was given a new name, Daya Mata. At the time of Yogananda’s death, she was placed in charge of the movement’s headquarters at Mount Washing- ton, California, and James Lynn (Swami Rajasi Janakananda) was placed in charge of the SRF organization. Lynn died three years later. In 1955, Daya Mata succeeded Lynn as the third president of Self-Realization Fellowship, a position she has retained for decades. She has been very active as president, oversee- ing a growing international organization, meeting frequent speaking engagements, and authoring several books. On March 5, 2005, she celebrated her 50th anniversary as the leader of SRF.

Most famous are the four maths estab- lished by the great V EDANTA teacher S HANKARA (circa eighth century): B ADRINATH in far northern India, D VARAKA (Dwarka) in Gujarat, Shringeri in Karnataka, and Puri in Orissa. Monks from the Dashanami order following Shankara’s teachings now live at these locations. The abbot of each of these maths is referred to as the Shankaracharya (while Shankara himself is referred to as the Adis- hankaracharya, or first Shankaracharya). Further reading: Austin B.

Matsya avatar The Matsya (fish) AVATA R of V ISHNU is said to have preserved the world from a cataclysmic flood in a previous cycle of time. According to the story, the M ANU (primordial man) of that era was a great king. He came upon a tiny fish as he was washing himself in the morning. The fish, speaking in a human voice, beseeched the king to save him. He promised to reward Manu by saving him in turn from an impending flood. Manu agreed. He first put the fish in a bowl of water, but the fish grew very quickly and outgrew it. Then Manu put the fish in a pitcher, but it became too big for it overnight. Manu suc- cessively put it into a well, pond, and then the G ANGES , but it outgrew them all. Finally, he put it in the ocean, where it became very huge. Once in the ocean the fish instructed Manu that after certain cataclysms a flood would wipe out all of the beings on Earth. The fish instructed Manu to build a huge boat, put the world’s creatures in it, and tie a rope to it in preparation for that time. When the flood arrived, Manu attached the rope to the fish’s horn and the fish took him to the northern mountain, where he attached the boat to a tree. Thus were all creatures rescued by the Matsya incarnation of V ISHNU . Further reading: Cornelia Dimmitt and J. A.

Mauritius The British acquired the island nation of Mauri- tius in the Indian Ocean from the French in 1814 as part of the Treaty of Paris. Sugar production on the island flourished under the British, who imported large numbers of African slaves to work on plantations. Prior to 1835, almost 70 percent of the population of Mauritius was of African descent. After the abolition of slavery, British officials began in 1835 to employ indentured ser- vants from India to fill the labor shortage on the K 280 Matagiri 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 280 12/14/06 9:29:03 AM"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"island. Since that time, the migration of Indians to the island has steadily increased. Indians of all faiths now constitute about 68 percent of the total population. Most Hindus in Mauritius were from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in northern India and Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh in southern India. Many migrated to escape the drought and poverty that had ravaged regions of India during much of the mid-19th century. Others were enticed by the prospects of owning land. Large numbers of migrants from India continued to enter Mauritius until 1922, when contracts of indentured servi- tude were discontinued. From their first days in Mauritius, Hindus were much more organized and had greater politi- cal leverage than their compatriots in other colo- nies with sizable Indian populations. Conditions for the indentured laborers were deplorable, but Hindus did not face severe persecution because of their religion. Throughout their residence in Mauritius, Hindus established temples, gained recognition of their religious festivals as public holidays, and maintained frequent contact with the Indian homeland. When M OHANDAS K ARAM - CHAND G ANDHI visited Mauritius in the early 20th century he was impressed by the social justice and activism of the Hindu population on the island. Overall, Hinduism has enjoyed success and lon- gevity there. The earliest temples were constructed in the mid-1880s on the sugar estates by traders and indentured laborers. They were dedicated to Annam and K ARTTIKEYAN , or Murugan. At present there are over 250 Hindu temples on Mauritius. Temples serve as centers for many traditional Hindu festivals. M AHASHIVARATRI , S HIVA ’ S Great Night, is one of the largest. The annual celebra- tion is designated a national holiday for those of North Indian descent. The festival involves a nine-day ceremony of fasting that concludes with a night-long worship service to Shiva. Other popular festivals in Mauritius include Thai Pusam, a celebration of the South Indian God Murugan. The festival is recognized officially as a Tamil holiday, but Hindus of all origins join the celebration of the deity. D IVALI , the festival of lights, is another popular festival proclaimed as a national holiday, in which both Hindus and non-Hindus celebrate. During the height of Divali observances, Hindu temples and Christian churches are lit with many earthen lamps to sym- bolize dispelling the darkness of ignorance. The festival of Divali represents religious solidarity across ethnic barriers. Hindus in Mauritius have established strong traditions of both V AISHNAVISM and S HAIVISM . Addi- tionally, reform movements such as A RYA S AMAJ have increased in popularity over recent years. In 2000, a celebration of the 125th anniversary of Arya Samaj drew over 15,000 people to more than 165 fire rituals. Other organizations that have made their home in Mauritius over the decades include the I NTERNATIONAL S OCIETY FOR K RISHNA C ON - SCIOUSNESS , the V EDANTA R AMAKRISHNA S OCIETIES M AT H AND M ISSION , the Chinmayananda Mis- sion, and the Swami Lakshmanacharya Vishwa Santi Foundation. In 1983, Swami Krishnananda converted an infirmary established in 1888 in Calebassus into an ASHRAM and A YURVEDIC health care center that houses over 200 poor and needy residents. Hindus in Mauritius still frequent pilgrimage centers in India, even as several sites have been established on the island for pilgrimages. One such destination is Spiritual Park, established in 1999 by Satguru Sivaya S UBRAMUNIYASWAMI , to house worship, music, education, and other activ- ities. The park features three eight-foot statues of G ANESHA , Dakshinamurti, and Lord Murugan (K ARTTIKEYAN ), hand-carved in M AHABALIPURAM , India. Hinduism remains the dominant religion of Mauritius. A 2000 census estimated that there are over 500,000 Hindus on the island, making up to 44 percent of the total population. See also D IASPORA .

In the V EDAS the term referred to the magic or power of the divinity. The term is still used in this sense in theistic branches of Hinduism to refer to the delusive and enthralling power of the personal divinity. In S HANKARA ’ S ADVAITA V EDANTA the term devel- oped a specialized meaning of “illusion,” spe- cifically, the illusory nature of the world of phenomena. It is an alternative term for avidya or ignorance—that is, ignorance of the unitary character of the ultimate reality. Maya in this con- text is the veil of illusion over the BRAHMAN or the highest reality. It neither exists nor nonexists, but is something that cannot be defined. Maya, the world as we sense it and know it, is thought to disappear as a fog does when the light of knowl- edge of the singular nature of the ultimate reality moves forward in consciousness. In the S HAKTA traditions of GODDESS worship, the goddess as supreme divinity is sometimes called Maya or Mahamaya. In this case the word has no negative connotations, but simply refers to the goddess’s supreme magic and power.

Ma Yoga Shakti International Mission (est. 1979) The Ma Yoga Shakti International Mission, with ashrams and centers in India, the United King- dom, and the United States, is dedicated to the spread of YOGA in the West. It offers instruction in a variety of yoga paths. Ma Yoga Shakti (no birth name available) was born April 6, 1927, and raised in the holy city of B ENARES (Varanasi), India. She spent her youth fas- cinated by high ideals and devoted herself to the quest of finding solutions to life’s mysteries. She obtained an M.A. in political science and became principal of an all-women’s college in Bihar, India. In 1956 she founded the Annie Besant Lodge of the T HEOSOPHICAL S OCIETY in Chapra. In 1965, she took vows of SANNYAS , renouncing the worldly life, and became a paramadesa SANNYASI , or one who becomes a monastic without being initiated by another SANNYASI . She does not acknowledge any one GURU or Hindu lineage. She took the name Ma Yoga Shakti Saraswati. In 1969 she was given the name Shakti Sant Shiromani by several monas- tic orders of India at the K UMBHA M ELA . She was given the title Maha Mandleshwar in 1974 by the Niranjani Akhara, one of India’s largest orders of monks. In 1979, following her intention to spread yoga to the West, she established the Ma Yoga Shakti International Mission, with ashrams in South Ozone Park, New York, and Palm Bay, Flor- ida. Other ashrams are active in London and in five cities in India. Following the teaching of Ma Yoga Shakti, the mission emphasizes four forms of yoga— HATHA , raja, KARMA , and BHAKTI —and instructs students to pursue the yogic path that is most accessible to their inclinations and abili- ties. The mission publishes books by Ma Yoga Shakti in English and Hindi and offers a monthly periodical, Yoga Shakti Mission Newsletter. Each of the movement’s ashrams offers retreats, devo- tional services, yoga and MEDITATION classes, and workshops.

The V EDAS show B RAHMINS and others eating beef as well as an assortment of other meats. With the rise of the notion of AHIMSA (nonharm), first introduced by the Jains ( see J AINISM ) and Buddhists, meat-eating became less sanctioned. In the Manu Smriti or Manavadharma Shastra (L AW S OF M ANU ) (c. 400 B . C . E .), a transitional stage can be seen; meat, including beef, that is killed as part of a Vedic ritual is allowed for Brahmins. However, non–ritually killed meat was not to be eaten by them. Eventually orthodox Brahmins adopted a Jain-like scrupulous VEGETARIANISM that became a cultural ideal of the faith. However, many sectors of society in India still eat meat and fish. The most common meat eaten in India by Hindus is chicken, followed by lamb and goat. Water buffalo meat is also sometimes eaten. Only the lowest sectors of Hindu society eat pork or beef. Pork is raised by Dalit (untouchable) communities as a regular food source. Dalits also eat beef, taken as carrion. Under British rule, tensions arose between Muslims and Hindus over the issue of beef. Mus- lims do not eat pork but do eat beef. Tensions have persisted into postindependence India. Par- ticular offense can be taken if Muslims cook beef on a Hindu holiday, or in an area where Hindus can smell the process. Some cities, such as Delhi, have simply banned the slaughter of cows entirely. McDonalds, Wimpy’s, and other international hamburger outlets have been open in India for a long time, but they never serve beef, usually sub- stituting the meat of water buffalo.

The Jains may very well have been the first to practice meditation. Their tradition does not preserve a great deal of information about the early practice; there is no mention of PRANAYAMA or breath control, but dharana (focus), as known to the P ATANJALI Yoga tradition, was apparently included. Jain tradition has four types of dhyana: artad- hyana (focus on things unpleasant or sorrow- ful), raudradhyana (focus on cruel and perverse things), dharmyadhyana (virtuous concentration), and shukladhyana (pure concentration). Most literature on the SIDDHA (perfected beings) and T IRTHANKARAS (most exalted personages) refers to the shukladhyana state, which involves intense concentration. In the Hindu tradition, the term dhyana first appears in the Upanishads, in a handful of places, used as a rather generic term. By the time of the epics (c. seventh century B . C . E . to third century C . E .), dhyana was a well-established practice. Most later Hindu Y OGA traditions derive from raja yoga or Patanjali Yoga, where dhyana is a refined medi- tative practice that is taken up after one has mas- tered pranayama, or breath control, and dharana, “mental focus.” It is a deeper concentration of the mind, eventually leading to the SAMADHI state, which involves highly concentrated focus on the highest reality (or realities). meditation 283 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 283 12/14/06 9:29:04 AM"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"In other yogic traditions, those practicing dhy- ana focus on a MANTRA (recited word or phrase); a YANTRA , or sacred diagram; or an ISHTA DEVATA , or chosen divinity.

Meenakshi Temple, Madurai The Meenakshi Sundareshvarar Temple at Madu- rai, dedicated to the goddess Meenakshi (M INAKSHI ) and to S HIVA as the beautiful lord (Sundaresh- varar), is one of the largest in India. The original temple was built by Kulasekara Pandyan, a king, sometime in the first millennium C . E ., but it fell into ruins. The current structure was laid out by Viswanath Nayakar, a later monarch of Madurai, in the 16th century and was completed by Tirum- alai Nayakar in the 17th century. The original site was dedicated exclusively to the goddess Minakshi, whose presence in the area is very ancient. The current temple also contains, in addition to the inner sanctum with Minakshi’s image, a LINGAM (phallus) for Shiva worship, as well as a striking, huge N ATARAJA (Shiva as Lord of Dance) in one of its larger halls. Most notable are the 120-foot towers at each of the four entrance- ways.

Meera, Mother (1960– ) embodiment of the Divine Mother Mother Meera is considered by her followers as an AVATA R of the Divine Mother. She is a silent teacher, primarily offering DARSHAN (eyegazing) to visitors to help them achieve health and happiness. Born Kamala Reddy on December 26, 1960, Mother Meera was raised in the village of Chan- drapalle in southern India. Her parents were not religious and raised her under no particular tradition. She was described as an unusual child, who often spoke of mysterious lights that visited her. She would later reveal that she received much of her love and spiritual guidance from visions. At the age of six she experienced her first SAMADHI , higher state of consciousness. Her uncle recognized the child’s gift and invited her to stay with him in Pondicherry. In 1974 she visited S RI A UROBINDO ’s ashram, attracting considerable attention there, and soon began giving DARSHAN , her own blessings to others. Her presence in Pondicherry attracted many and her popularity grew. Devotees throughout the world consider Mother Meera an avatar of the Divine Mother, who has previously incarnated in other forms, such as K ALI and the Virgin Mary. The appearance of the Mother is believed to offer people of the world healing, protection, and transformation in a time of crisis. Mother Meera has stated that the world is now in crisis and that her role is to give the transformative light of Paramatman, the Supreme Self, to everyone around the world. The light that she speaks of is the Supreme Being, which is an untapped energy permeating the world. Mother Meera believes that the ignition of supreme energy will give health, joy, and happiness to anyone who is open to it. In 1982, Mother Meera married a German by the name of Herbert and relocated to Schaumburg, Germany. Thousands have met with her there and receive her darshan. Her teaching is not through words, but through silence. She greets all devotees who arrive for her blessing with an intense gaze. Looking into their eyes, she encounters every corner of their being in order to determine what help she can give. Mother Meera meets with hundreds of visitors each year and offers regular darshan. She requires no devotion and is open to all individuals regard- less of their religion. She continues to draw the interest of devotees from around the world.

Born Merwan Sheriar Irani to Persian parents on February 25, 1894, in Poona, India, Meher Baba (compassionate father) was exposed to a number of faiths early in life. His father, Sheriar Irani, was a devout Zoroastrian. Merwan went to a Christian high school in Poona and later attended Deccan College. According to Meher Baba, five perfect masters exist in the world at all times. These masters can summon an avatar when needed to assist the world. Although they appear to be five different individuals, they are actually Satgurus, who are in the unity of the one God. They “bring down” the avatar so that the world can escape MAYA , the cage of illusion, and experience reality. While in college, in 1913, Irani met the first perfect mas- ter, Hazrat Babajan, an Islamic woman saint who kissed him on the forehead and showed him inde- scribable bliss, which continued for about nine months. In 1914, Babajan gave him instant God- realization and made him aware of his spiritual calling and destiny. Another perfect master, Upasni Maharaj, a Hindu who resided in Sakori, gave Merwan gnosis or divine knowledge over the course of seven years. Through these experiences he gained spiritual perfection. In 1921 his spiritual mis- sion began when his first close disciples gathered around him. His disciples gave him the name Meher Baba. After years of teaching disciples, Meher Baba founded a colony near Ahmednagar, called Mehe- rabad. The colony included a school, hospital, dispensary, and shelter for the poor. From its inception, Meherabad did not recognize caste distinctions in training its students or serving the needy. Another important part of the work begun by Meher Baba is work with the masts, the advanced souls or “God-intoxicated” individuals who live perpetually in awareness of the highest realm of consciousness. He sought out masts and took care of their physical needs, which the masts themselves often ignored. He also washed the feet of and fed lepers and the destitute of India. From July 10, 1925, Meher Baba observed silence, communicating with others and giving discourses only through dictation on an alphabet board. Much later, he abandoned the alphabet board and communicated through hand gestures unique to him. He asserted that he was the Ancient One who had returned to redeem humankind from its bondage to ignorance and to show to all their true Meher Baba (1894–1969), God-realized master from western India, said to be the avatar of the current age who bridged Hinduism and Sufism (Courtesy Avatar Meher Baba Trust) K 286 Meher Baba 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 286 12/14/06 9:29:04 AM"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"Self, which is God. He was acknowledged by his followers to be the avatar of the age. In 1959, when he was 65 years old, Meher Baba established the Avatar Meher Baba Trust to provide for disciples who were dependent on him and to care for his tomb and property. The trust oversees charitable activities in India and the United States and has created a development plan for Meherabad, the site of Meher Baba’s tomb. Meher Baba traveled to the United States six times between 1931 and 1958. His center in the West is located at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. He left his body on July 31, 1969.

Meru, Mount In ancient Indian cosmology Mount Meru is a golden mountain, supporting the heavens, located at the center of the known universe. Its location is at the center of the continent of Jambudvipa (the island of the rose-apple tree). The part of Jambud- vipa south of the mountain is called Bharatavarsha, which is identified with historical India. B RAHMA , S HIVA , and V ISHNU are understood to reside on the summit of Mount Meru, accompanied by sages praising the gods, apsarases (celestial dancers), and GANDHARVAS (celestial musicians). The pole star is seen to shine directly over the summit of Meru. The G ANGES falls from heaven to the peak of Meru, where it is channeled to the four regions below. There are numerous mythological stories associated with this mountain. One says that Mount Meru and the god of the wind (V AY U ) were good friends. However, the mischievous sage Narada approached Vayu and instigated him to humble the mountain. Vayu blew with full force for one full year, but Meru did not yield. However, after a year Meru relaxed for a while, and taking advantage of this opportunity, Vayu increased in intensity. The top of the mountain was broken off and it fell into the sea. Thus was the island of Sri Lanka born. Further reading: Cornelia Dimitt and J.

Metamorphosis League for Monastic Studies (est. 1987) The Metamorphosis League for Monastic Studies was founded by Kailasa Chandra Das (born Mark Goodwin) in 1987, in response to disputes within the I NTERNATIONAL S OCIETY FOR K RISHNA C ON - SCIOUSNESS (ISKCON) between the leadership and some other disciples who had been trained and initiated by the founder, Swami A. C. Prabhupada B HAKTIVEDANTA . The stated goal of the league is to help define norms for a valid devotional Vaish- navite organization. These norms suggest that a GURU , teacher; YOGI , or spiritual guide must be a self-realized Vaishnavite, that is, a devotee of V ISHNU who has traveled the spiritual path to enlightenment and God. This person also must have realized the supreme personality of the god- head, K RISHNA . Those who seek help from the league are advised to leave any guru who attracts disciples by charisma only. The charismatic personality, the league believes, may not always follow spiritual rules and may succumb to the illusion of power and self-aggrandizement, which would mislead disciples on the path to SELF - REALIZATION . On the other hand, there is a danger that an institutional guru, with a following of disciples who have Metamorphosis League for Monastic Studies 287 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 287 12/14/06 9:29:05 AM"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"accepted him in a leadership role, might succumb to empty ritualism, devoid of spirituality. A genu- ine guru, according to this view, is modeled on the prototype of Bhaktivedanta Swami Pradhupada, who was said to derive his authority from God and to live his life in the purity of spirit. The league upholds the paradigm of Prad- hupada and advises that devotees be very care- ful about proclaiming allegiance to a guru who does not have a direct lineage to the godhead. The league follows the beliefs and principles of Prabhupada. Members must abide by all rules, including VEGETARIANISM , repetition of the Hare Krishna mantra, and abstinence from intoxicating substances. Members are also required to refrain from associating with members of ISKCON and consorting with “fake gurus” who are merely charismatic or who receive their status from a group that does not promote the truth as the league sees it. The league is headquartered in Bea- verton, Oregon. Milk Ocean Between cosmic eras, Lord V ISHNU is said to lie asleep on a couch made of the great snake Adishe- sha, who in turns floats upon a primordial ocean of milk. This ocean appears in another well-known Hindu myth: the churning of the M ILK O CEAN by the gods and the ASURAS (the antigods). The story goes that the irascible sage Durvasas once obtained a beautiful garland from a woman. Seeing Indra, king of the gods, go by on his white elephant Airavata, the sage offered the garland to him. I NDRA placed the garland on the head of his elephant, who immediately took it with his trunk and tossed it on the ground. Durvasas was outraged at this insult. He cursed Indra with the loss of his power to the asu- ras, who then triumphed over the gods. The gods went to Lord Vishnu to ask his help. Vishnu sug- gested that they go to the Milk Ocean along with the demons to churn out the powerful elixir of immortality ( amrita ). The demons agreed to this cooperative task, which could be accomplished if they all worked together. At Vishnu’s command, they gathered some herbs to throw into the ocean; took Mount Man- dara, which props up Mount Meru, as a churning stick; and used Vishnu himself, incarnated as a tortoise, as the base for churning. They used the divine serpent Vasuki as the churning rope and began to churn. In some versions of the story, the first thing to emerge from the churning ocean was a poison that could consume all the worlds. The gods begged S HIVA to control it, and he drank it up in one gulp. His wife, P ARVATI , fearing for his life, grabbed his throat so the poison would not enter his stomach; the burn on his throat can be seen in his iconogra- phy as a dark blue marking. Fortunately, the next things to emerge from the Milk Ocean were more salubrious: Surabhi, the wish-fulfilling cow, came forth, followed by Sri, the goddess of prosperity and fortune ( see L AKSHMI ); Dhanavantari, the phy- sician of the gods; the Kaustubha gem that always adorns Vishnu’s chest; and other wondrous things and beings, until finally, the nectar of immortality was churned out. Knowing that the demons would want to seize the nectar, Vishnu took the form of the enchant- ress M OHINI , and, while the demons were mesmer- ized with her beauty, she served the nectar to the gods alone. As only the gods were now immortal, when the demons attacked them they were easily routed; the world was once again in the hands of the gods.

The Mimamsa S UTRAS of Jaimini (c. third century C . E .) is the first extant text of the tradition. Mimamsa in its earliest form (Purva [early] Mimamsa) preserves a strict Vedic tradition; it sees the Vedas as eternal, divine texts that should guide all life and action. According to early Mimamsa one must do one’s ritual duties and worldly duties precisely according to the Vedas. The Mimamsa texts, therefore, aim to clarify the precise meaning of each Vedic injunction, so that devotees can reach the heavenly realm after death. The Mimamsakas argue very strongly that even the U PANISHADS , valued by so many for their phi- losophy, should be read only to learn any require- ments for action that they may contain. Mimamsa cannot be said to be theistic or ori- ented toward gods in a true sense; the gods are at the beck and call of humans thanks to the power of the Vedic MANTRAS . Gods exist, but the Vedas supersede all. The soul or self is understood to exist in Mimamsa, as in all six orthodox Brah- minical systems. Early Mimamsa preserved the ancient Vedic understanding of the afterlife: after death, a person went to a heavenly realm somewhat like the earthly one, where one remained in a happy state, being fed by one’s family. There is no overt mention of reincarnation in the Vedic mantras themselves, with the exception of the late I SHA U PANISHAD , which is appended to the mantras of the Y AJUR V EDA . Salvation itself in Mimamsa put the soul in an inert state, liberated from the bonds of earthly existence through proper per- formance of Vedic duty. As Mimamsa developed and changed around the seventh century with the commentary of Shabaraswamin, it accepted the notion of karma and rebirth. In this respect it converged, as did YOGA , with the other V EDANTIC schools. Two lines of teachers, drawing upon Prabha- kara and Kumarila (eighth and ninth centuries), refined the doctrine further, using careful philo- sophical analysis of perception, causation, and the like, for the purposes of this school. This precise investigation was replicated in the commentary on the Upanishads that developed into V EDANTA . Because it was seen as an extension of the earlier Mimamsic investigative method, Vedanta is often called Uttara Mimamsa, or “later Mimamsa.” Further reading: Francis X.

Her shrine is the site of one of India’s most spectacular temples, the Meenakshi Sundareshvarar Temple. Her name ( mina, fish; aksha, eye) is understood to mean “she whose eyes are the shape of lovely fishes,” the translation of her original Tamil name, Ankayalkanni. There is little question that Minakshi was the overseer of Madurai from very ancient times. However, as the Brahminical influence entered Tamil Nadu she was assimilated into the larger Brahminical culture as the wife of S HIVA . The story goes that Minakshi’s father and mother performed a special ritual to get a son. Instead of a son, a girl child emerged from the fire with three breasts. The parents were told to treat her as a prince would be treated and have her assume rulership. She was a powerful warrior and defeated all beings in all the directions. One day, however, she contended with S HIVA himself; upon seeing him, she fell in love. As this happened, she suddenly became bashful and timid (no doubt a patriarchal addition to the story!) and lost her third breast. She and Shiva were ceremoniously married, and he then became the king of Madurai and she the queen; the temple is now dedicated to both deities.

It is is marked by 10 days of pageantry and celebration; a huge temple chariot bearing the festival images of Minakshi and Shiva is paraded around. Because of her status in Madurai, a great many businesses there, from tire companies to restaurants, are named after the goddess.

Mirabai (c. 1450–1547) mystic poet and devotee of Krishna Mirabai is one of the great mystic poets of India. A princess of the Rajput warrior clan in the Indian state of Rajasthan, she married a great prince of the famous town of Udaipur but was so devoted to Lord K RISHNA that she could not play the role of a proper wife. She eventually became the disciple of Raidas, a low-caste Hindu who was himself later worshipped as a saint. Mirabai was persecuted by her husband and his family; it is said that they even gave her poison to drink, which failed to kill her. Finally Krishna appeared to her and told her to abandon family life and go to B RINDAVAN , his most sacred shrine. After spending some time there she settled at last in Gujarat in Dvaraka, where she died. Legend has it that she disappeared into the icon of Krishna in order to avoid a delegation from Rajasthan that was pleading for her to return. Mirabai’s works, written in the Hindi dialect Braj, show a passionate all-consuming devotion to Lord Krishna as the divine lover. As was the case with so many Vaishnavite ( see V AISHNAVISM ) saints, her songs often depict the agony of sepa- ration from God (Lord Krishna), who only rarely visits in mystical union. The mode of Mirabai very much resembles that of St. John of the Cross in his famous “Dark Night” (Noche Oscura). Mira’s songs are known all over India but are sung particularly in Rajasthan.

Mishra, Ramamurti (1923–1993) (Swami Brahmananda Saraswati) teacher of raja yoga Ramamurti Mishra was an Indian-born yogi who founded the A NANDA A SHRAM in Monroe, New York. He wrote many books on Y OGA and A YURVEDA and he commented upon many S AN - SKRIT texts. Ramamurti Mishra was born in Benares (Vara- nasi), India, on March 6, 1923, into a reli- gious Brahmin family. His mother was a spiritual teacher with many disciples and his father was a high court judge and practitioner of astrology. From an early age, Ramamurti was immersed in the study of Sanskrit, MEDITATION , and YOGA . At the age of six, he became ill and apparently died—for 36 hours, no vital signs of life, includ- ing respiration, were detected. As his father was about to light the fire for his cremation, the child sat upright and declared that he was alive. Rama- murti always considered this date, March 6, was his real birthday. At a young age he left home to pursue the study of Sanskrit and medicine.

The ASH - RAM continues to function as a year-round retreat for spiritual practice. In 1966, Mishra resigned from his medical career to devote himself to spiritual discipline and the teaching of raja yoga, with a focus on the question, Who am I? Convinced that the cause of suffering is not in the body or the mind, but rather in ignorance of the true Self, he began to teach and explore the path to discovery of the “I AM” consciousness that he believed to be eternal and ever present. In 1984 he was initiated into the vow of san- nyas (renunciation) by Swami Gangeshvarananda and was given the name Brahmananda Saraswati.

Mother, The (Mirra Richard) (1878–1973) revered utopian yoga teacher French-born Mirra Alfassa was a revered teacher of YOGA in a modern context and of utopian social thought. The title Mother was given to her by her associate, the great Indian sage Sri A UROBINDO . It indicated that she was considered a form of the GODDESS . Mirra Alfassa was born to an Egyptian mother and Turkish father in Paris on February 21, 1878. Though she lived in a strictly atheistic household, young Mirra began to have spiritual and occult experiences as a young girl. She would often fall into a silent trance for minutes at a time. As she grew older she had experiences of distance sight and astral projection. As a young woman she took full advantage of the cultural excitement of Paris at the turn of the 20th century. Her first husband, with whom she had her only child, was an artist associated with the burgeoning modern art scene. At the age of 28 Mirra went to Algeria to study occultism under a little-known teacher, Max Theon, and his wife, Alma, but decided in the end that Theon was not a pure master. She felt that he was ego driven and self-centered. On a 1914 trip to India with her second husband, the diplomat Paul Richard, she met Sri Aurobindo, who had recently taken refuge in Pondicherry.

She did not, however, join Sri Aurobindo at that time, but went with her husband to Japan. After leaving Japan and spending some time in Europe, Mirra Richard abandoned married life and joined Sri Aurobindo as his spiritual partner in 1916. At first there were questions about her status at his ASHRAM from people close to Sri Aurobindo, but he quelled them by declaring that his consciousness and the Mother’s con- sciousness were one; it was he who gave her the important spiritual title, Mother. In his book On the Mother he explained her spiritual role in the new world. The yoga that she and Sri Aurobindo practiced was worldly. Rather than the isolated transcen- dence of the renunciant in a cave, it was a trans- formative yoga aimed at changing all of reality in its wake. They wanted to bring to earth the divine superconsciousness, termed the supramental, by Aurobindo, which would, they thought, alter the nature of reality itself. The Integral Yoga, or complete yoga, of Sri Aurobindo and Mother was designed to orient its devotees yogically toward a life in the world that would progressively become divine. In 1926 Sri Aurobindo went into seclusion in the ashram and left Mother in charge of day-to- day affairs. He declared that he had reached the Overmind in his yogic work and needed seclu- sion to work with the powerful forces in order to expand this into a supramental manifestation. Mother from then on managed all ashram affairs, designed the movement’s educational programs, and provided inspiration to the burgeoning group of followers who began to attend more regularly. Sri Aurobindo died in 1950 without complet- ing his spiritual project. He declared that it was the Mother herself who would succeed in bringing about the supramental manifestation that would begin the transformation of all life, all matter, and all the cosmos toward perfect consciousness and bliss. In 1956 Mother announced that she had succeeded in bringing down the supramental and proceeded from that day to prepare the world for the power of a new consciousness that she felt would now inevitably manifest. Mother had already, in the early 1950s, envi- sioned a utopian ground where all nations could join to manifest the unity on Earth that she felt would accompany the new consciousness. This early vision of an international center for edu- cation gradually changed into the idea of a city to be built in South India under her auspices. In 1968 she broke ground for this city—A URO - VILLE —which was to be a guide for the new earthly transformation. People from around the world flocked to the city to begin the new spiri- tual experiment. Mother died in 1973 at the age of 95 and was buried in a tomb beside her beloved spiritual partner, Sri Aurobindo. She left a legacy of prac- tice and commitment that few women spiritual teachers in the 20th century could match. Her writings were not vast as her mentor’s were, but her words and wisdom were dutifully recorded by her student Satprem, who transformed them into a many-volume series, The Mother’s Agenda.

Mother India (1927) Mother India was a controversial book, written in 1927 by Katherine Mayo, an American medical missionary and journalist, that condemned Hin- duism as a cause of India’s suffering. The book was inspired by Mayo’s encounters with Indian women and customs during her travels to the country in 1925 and 1926. It raised consciousness of important gender and caste issues that needed to be addressed; however, it Mother India 293 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 293 12/14/06 9:29:06 AM"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"also served as an indictment against Indian society and Hinduism in general. Mayo claimed that Hindu customs were dan- gerous not only to India but to the entire world. She believed the customs weakened the human “stock” with poverty, disease, and physical and mental frailties. Historians have interpreted the book as a racist tract that emerged from the age of British and American imperialism. The book negatively influenced popular Western percep- tions of India for decades and hindered support and sympathy for Indian independence around the world. The main thesis of Mother India was an asser- tion that Hindu practices made Indians weak, incapable of self-rule, and unable to become eco- nomically self-sufficient. A primary indictment concerned the roles of women. Mayo charged that the Hindu religion enslaved women, forced them to be sexually subservient to men, and demanded that they follow social patterns that produced impoverishment and ignorance. Mayo cites factors such as child marriage, lack of edu- cation, the burdens of having many children, child widowhood, prostitution, and epidemics of venereal disease as significant problems for women in India. Some American feminists during the 1970s revered Mayo as a pioneer who created awareness of the plight of Indian woman. Indian critics, by contrast, dispute Mother India ’s representa- tion of all Indian women as weak, passive, and incapable of resistance. Mayo made no mention of the Indian women’s movement or of efforts by the Indian National Congress to support women’s rights. While depicting Indian women as helpless victims, the book lauds the British imperialists as a civilizing force, saving India from the customs of a decadent religion. The book prompted outrage and criticism from Indian nationalists. Mohandas Karamchand G ANDHI referred to it as a “gutter inspector’s report,” and it received further condemnation from Indian women’s organizations. In Britain, however, Mother India received enthusiastic reviews. Indignant Hindus in America rebutted the publication with many books and pamphlets; they tried to turn the tables by condemning American society as rampant with crime, political scandal, and marital infidelity. The book did succeed in raising awareness of some issues and fostering British reforms in India, such as the Child Marriage Act of 1929. Ironi- cally, Mother India also contributed to an alliance between Indian nationalists and women’s move- ments, which organized to refute and neutralize Mayo’s indictments. The alliance helped to pass the Sarada Act, a law enforcing a minimal age for marriage. Mother India continues to influence Western perceptions of Hinduism and India. Its whole- sale rejection of Hindu beliefs and practices and its depiction of a sexually deviant culture have influenced popular media to represent India as exotic, forbidden, and dangerous. Yet, Mother India remains inspirational to others who use its thesis to promote heightened awareness for reform in India.

Muktananda, Swami (1908–1982) Shaivite guru Swami Muktananda was an influential teacher who formulated the Siddha Yoga philosophy and helped spread it around the world. Muktananda (his birth name was Krishna) was born on May 16, 1908, into a prosperous farming family. His father was the headman of a village near Mangalore in Karnataka state. His mother, deeply pious, had prayed for the birth of a son, and from his earliest years she provided him with a strong religious foundation. While still in his teens he had several encounters with the wandering spiritual adept, Bhagawan N ITYANANDA , who would later become his GURU . At the age of 15 Krishna decided to dedicate his life to attaining a direct experience of God and adopted one of the traditional Indian paths to that experience, that of a wandering SADHU , mendicant. In the early 1920s, shortly after his travels began, Krishna went to Hubli in northern Kar- nataka, to the ASHRAM of Siddharudha Swami, a renowned V IRASHAIVA yogi. In Siddharudha’s ashram, he studied V EDANTA , took vows of san- nyas (renunciation), and received the name Muk- tananda (the bliss of freedom). In 1930, a year after Siddharudha’s passing, Swami Muktananda began an extended period of wandering. Muktananda once said that he walked across India three times. He traveled mostly on foot, carrying only a water bowl and staff as he moved from one teacher to the next. During this time he studied all of the major texts of the Hindu scrip- tural canon; he became adept at HATHA YOGA and A YURVEDIC medicine, and he met scores of holy beings. He became a renowned teacher in his own right, and still he kept searching. In his spiritual autobiography, Play of Con- sciousness, Muktananda calls August 15, 1947, Swami Muktananda (1908–1982), Shaivite teacher, scholar, and founder of Siddha Yoga Dham (© SYDA Foundation) Muktananda, Swami 295 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 295 12/14/06 9:29:06 AM"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"“the most auspicious of all auspicious days”, it was the day that Bhagawan Nityananda, by then living in Ganeshpuri, gave him shaktipata DIKSHA , spiritual initiation. This was followed by nine years of intense meditation under Nityananda’s direction, until the guru declared that Muk- tananda was “one with BRAHMAN . ” In 1956 Bhaga- wan Nityananda installed Muktananda in a tiny ashram just down the road from his own. That spot, where Swami Muktananda’s tomb and shrine now stand, remains the heart of what has become an international center for spiritual learning and the Siddha Yoga “mother” ashram, Gurudev Sid- dha Peeth. Shortly before Nityananda’s death in 1961, he made Swami Muktananda his spiritual successor. After his guru’s passing, Muktananda began for- malizing Nityananda’s teachings, which he called the Siddha Yoga path. Siddha Yoga is the way of an enlightened, or SIDDHA , master; the practice is to follow the master’s guidance and teachings with the aid of the master’s enlivening grace. For all siddha yogis, the path begins as it did for Muktananda, with shaktipata diksha, spiritual ini- tiation. The goal is permanent dwelling in a real- ization of the divinity that exists within and as everything. Muktananda’s emblematic teaching, one that he repeated again and again through- out the two decades of his teaching mission, is “Meditate on your own Self. Worship your Self. Respect your Self. God lives within you as you.” By the capitalized s of Self, he emphasized that he was referring not to one’s individual ego but to an expanded identification of the Self with supreme consciousness. Baba Muktananda, as he became known, trav- eled throughout India and completed three world tours, initiating and guiding students of Siddha Yoga meditation. He created the Siddha Yoga Shaktipat Intensive as the ideal environment for spiritual awakening. He founded ashrams around the world, established the SYDA Foundation to manage the Siddha Yoga mission, and created the canon of Siddha Yoga philosophy through his own writings and his synthesis of the teachings of V EDANTA , K ASHMIRI S HAIVISM , and the writings of the BHAKTI poet-saints. In 1982, Muktananda named his disciple Swami C HIDVILASANANDA to carry the Siddha Yoga lineage forward. The ceremony that announced and enacted this transmission was held publicly in Gurudev Siddha Peeth in May 1982. On Octo- ber 2, 1982, on the full Moon night of Sharad- purnima, Baba Muktananda left his body (took mahasamadhi ). “Baba Muktananda’s shakti [energy] is sat [being],” Guru Chidvilasananda has said. “It was experienced strongly in the past; it is powerfully with us now; and it will continue to be so in the future. His shakti awakens an ever-new life in all those it touches.” Through his teachings, his ash- rams, and the exemplary story of his own spiri- tual life related in Play of Consciousness, people continue to receive transmission of energy and spiritual awakening, which are the basis of his spiritual mission. One of the first American disciples to receive shaktipat from Muktananda was Albert Rudolph (1928–73), who became Swami R UDRANANDA , a teacher of Shaivism in the United States. Later, Franklin Jones became a disciple of Muktananda and returned to the United States to become a spiritual teacher called Bubba Free John (now A DI D A S AMRAJ ).

Murugan See K ARTTIKEYA . myths of creation The Hindu myths of creation are many and varied. The V EDAS , the most ancient scriptures, include several striking creation hymns. One hymn sees creation as emerging from a divine person, the PURUSHA , who is sacrificed in order for time to begin; creation results directly from his body and being. Another account, in the R IG V EDA , suggests that no one knows what existed before this world; only the one in the highest heaven knows, and perhaps not even he! Still another hymn speaks of a Golden Embryo that precedes all creation, out of which everything emerges. The U PANISHADS , part of the Vedas, contain numerous cosmogonic (creation) stories. Several of them relate that the world was emitted from the supreme Self or ATMAN , which pervaded all reality. Others speak of reality’s emerging from the one BRAHMAN , or ultimate all. Still others speak of the creation’s beginning with P RAJAPATI , a male creator god or principle. In the Puranas, written from about 400 C . E . to 1000 C . E ., the god B RAHMA is usually said to be responsible for creation. He is depicted emerging from a lotus in the navel of V ISHNU , who is sleep- ing on the primordial M ILK O CEAN between eras. However, worshippers of either Vishnu or S HIVA often credited their chosen god with creating the entire universe. Further reading: Cornelia Dimmitt and J. A.

He arrived at the house of Y AMA , the god of death, but was not greeted as a proper guest. When Yama returned, he offered Nachik- etas three boons because he had neglected him. Nachiketas asked to return to his father, to be restored to life, and to learn the secret of death— or rather deathlessness. Yama tried to dissuade Nachiketas from the third request, but the wise young man persisted.

The goals are to alter consciousness, strengthen the body, and help bring about the transformation needed for libera- tion from the cycle of births. In HATHA YOGA , prana is forced through these channels to aid in raising the KUNDALINI at the base of the spine. The most commonly known nadi is the sushumna nadi, which travels up the spinal cord. The ida and pingala nadis are depicted as widely rippling waves that intersect at each CHAKRA (psychic center), exactly mirroring each other as they ascend around sushumna.

On Nagapanchami, images of mythological serpents such as Vasuki are worshipped and given milk, considered a favored food of snakes (of course, Indian villagers often offer milk to live cobras on a daily basis). Figures of snakes may be drawn on walls with cow dung or on boards with red powder to be worshipped. Also, people go to abandoned termite hills and other places were snakes live to make offerings. Snake charm- ers may be invited to perform on this day, and in certain areas there are huge processions of men (and some women) who handle cobras in fulfill- ment of vows.

Its basic meaning is “serpent” or “snake,” usually the cobra. N AGAPANCHAMI , for instance, is a snake festival celebrated on panchami, the fifth day of the lunar month of Shravana. The nagakal in South India are “snake stones,” stone images of cobras placed under PIPAL (ashvattha) or neem trees. They are commonly worshipped by women who desire to have offspring. The snake or naga plays a very important role in Indian folk religion. Villagers make shrines of abandoned termite hills, where snakes take up residence, give them offerings, and feed them milk. In southwestern India people have a naga shrine or grove in the corner of a garden. Most often the snakes are seen as protective, but they also connote immortality and fertility. A divine, semidivine, or demonic naga is associated with all the foremost personages and divinities in the Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu tradi- tions. The B UDDHA was said to have been guarded once by a semidivine serpent. The Jain T IRTHAN - KARA (saint) P ARSHVANATH is depicted in his ico- nography protected by a huge multiheaded cobra being, or naga. S HIVA , too, has a naga or serpent around his neck as a necklace. V ISHNU reclines on the divine serpent Ananta or A DISHESHA on the primordial M ILK O CEAN . The huge serpent Vasuki was used as a churning rope when the gods and demons churned the Milk Ocean to get the nectar of immortality. K RISHNA , when he was young, van- quished the evil serpent Kaliya. The term naga also denotes a category of semidivine creatures, the top half human and the bottom half snake, who guard precious gems and ores underground, similar to dragons in some Western mythology, but without their ferocity. Occasionally, these nagas can take fully human form; famous personages such as Nagarjuna are said to be their descendants. Myths usually place the half-human nagas under the Earth, but they may also live under water or in mountain caves. They are beauti- ful and opulently attired. Their human heads are overarched by cobra hoods emerging out from the back of the neck. They have great wisdom and superhuman powers and indulge in pleasures that are the envy of the human world. These demigods play an important role in Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu traditions and are frequently encountered in the mythology of all three religions.

Following the example of Shiva, Naga sadhus smear their entire bodies with ashes from cremation grounds and wear dreadlocks. As does Shiva, they smoke great quantities of hashish, par- ticularly when singing praises to that god. The Nagas are also known as ascetic warriors. Though most Indian holy men are known as peaceful seekers of truth and higher conscious- ness, Nagas have been known to be extremely militant.

It is derived from the word namas (from the root nam, to bow) and te (to you). Thus it is understood as “obei- sance,” “homage,” or “salutation.” It is said to mean “I honor the god that is within you.” If one wishes to be slightly more formal, one says “Namaskar,” with essentially the same meaning. The statement “Namaste” is accompanied, usually, by a gesture placing the palms of the hands together in front of one.

Nammalvar (c. 880–930 C . E .) Tamil Vaishnavite poet-saint Nammalvar, “Our Own Alvar,” was the 11th and greatest of the 12 A LVA R S , the poet-saints, of Tamil V AISHNAVISM . He composed four works, of which the 1,100-verse Tiruvaymoli is most influential. Also celebrated are Tiruviruttam and Periyatiru- vantati. According to legend Nammalvar was born in a Vellala family (technically S HUDRA or ser- vant class) to his father, Kariyar, and mother, Utaiyanankaiyar, in Kurugur (Tirunagari) in the Tirunelveli District of Tamil Nadu. The pair had prayed for a child at a temple at Tirukkurungudi and were told there that the child would be a part of V ISHNU himself. Vishnu sent his minister Vishvaksena (theologically a part of Vishnu) to be incarnated as the child. Maran (the later Nammalvar) was born only 43 days after K RISHNA himself passed from the world. As a baby, he is said never to have cried or drunk milk, but to have been possessed of a beatific, divine smile. After 11 days the parents took this divine child and placed him in the creche of a tamarind tree. The child, in a deep trance, opened neither mouth nor eyes for 16 years. As Nammalvar was in this trance, the 10th of the Alvars, Mathurakavi, was traveling in the north of India. One night he saw a vision of blazing light in the south, which told him that a saint had been born there. He managed to find the young person seated in MEDITATION , looking impervious to the outside world. To see whether he could distract Nammalvar he dropped a stone on the ground and Nammalvar opened his eyes. Mathurakavi tested him with a difficult riddle; when he answered insightfully the older saint bowed down and accepted Nammalvar as his mas- ter. At this moment the transcendent vision over- whelmed Nammalvar and he began to pour forth his devotional songs in a continuous stream.

His father, Mehta Kalu, was a land surveyor and small farmer of the Khatri caste of the Bedi tribe. In his early life Nanak showed great devotion to God and was often enveloped in spiritual medi- tation while watching over cattle. From age five he began to utter mysterious sayings; at seven, when taken to a teacher to learn to read, he would lapse into silence. Myths of miracles have been associ- ated with his childhood. In response to such signs of withdrawal the local community suggested to his parents that he be married. His wife, Sulakhani, a Khatri of the Chona subcaste, eventually gave birth to two sons, Lakhmi Das and Siri Chand. Nanak studied reading and writing in the local dialect, traditional scripture in S ANSKRIT , and poetry in Persian. Throughout his life he had many mystical experiences; one story recounts how he went to the river to bathe and was vis- ited by “messengers of God” who took him to a divine court and fed him nectar. For three days he remained missing, and upon his return he declared that there are no Hindus or Muslims, that all people are equal. His inner experiences gave him equanimity. He taught love, equality, justice, selfless service, and the worship of God. His teaching renounced religious hypocrisy. Guru Nanak was considered to be a leader in the BHAKTI (path of devotion) movement but was also active in calling for reform of Indian social and religious customs that he saw as unjust. He was outspoken against caste oppression, discrimi- nation, and injustice and committed to awakening the consciousness of people. Guru Nanak criticized what he considered the empty rituals and sacrifices of Hinduism in his time. Working in the villages near his own he founded and developed the S IKH tradition, which integrated Buddhist, Hindu, and Islamic ideals of the virtuous life and enlightenment. According to Nanak, the process of realization involves the grace of both God and GURU . the spiritual mas- ter. The Sikh tradition maintains that the goal of all human beings is to achieve self-perfection in their lifetime and to help others do the same. Sikh philosophy states that self-transformation occurs through guru, guru’s grace, guru’s will, devotion, discernment, and detachment. He composed the Adi Granth, the sacred text later revered by Sikhs as the last guru. Today the Adi Granth is the only guru honored among traditional Sikhs. Guru Nanak died on September 7, 1539.

Though he is often taken to be the son of B RAHMA , there are varying accounts of his birth and exploits. In some con- texts he is seen very positively: he is considered the inventor of the vina or Indian lute, and the one who revealed the D HARMASHASTRAS , or tracts on law. In other contexts he is seen as something of a troublemaker. It is Narada who informed Kamsa, the king who desired to kill K RISHNA , about Krish- na’s impending birth. Narada is also said to have cursed his own father, Brahma, to be worshipped by very few, to repay him for a curse that Brahma had placed on him.

Narasimha avatar Narasimha is the man-lion AVATA R of V ISHNU . His story has many versions, all relating to the demon H IRANYAKASHIPU . The latter had undergone severe austerities to make himself superior to the gods and nearly invincible. B RAHMA had given him the boons that he could not be killed by man or beast, at night or during the day, outdoors or indoors. The gods beseeched Vishnu to intervene and put an end to the demon’s depredations in the worlds. Vishnu took up the man-lion form (neither man nor beast) and confronted Hiranyakashipu at the threshold of his palace (neither indoors nor outdoors) at twilight (neither day nor night). Thus he was able to kill Hiranyakashipu. The common iconographic depiction of Narasimha shows a sitting creature with a man’s body and a lion’s head, ripping into the supine demon lying on his knees.

Writing in English, he created works that are gentle evocations of small-town Indian life, the life of everyday Hindus. Rasipuram Krishnaswami Ayyar Narayanas- wami, better known by his pseudonym, R. K. Narayan, was born in the Prasawalkam section of Madras (Chennai) on October 10, 1906, and died May 13, 2001, at the age of 94. His father, R. V. Krishnaswami Iyer, moved the family to Mysore, where he became a schoolteacher and later headmaster of Maharajah’s Collegiate High School. R. K. was not an outstanding student but managed to receive his bachelor of arts degree at the University of Mysore in 1923. Once he had graduated his natural path was to take a govern- ment job, but R. K. had already decided that he wanted to be a writer. R. K.’s first published works appeared in maga- zines and in the newspaper Hindu. He eventually worked for that paper’s Sunday edition. In 1934 he married for love, an unconventional move very much in line with his writing. His wife, Rajam, gave him one daughter, Hema, before she tragi- cally passed away of typhoid in 1939, leaving him with a three-year-old daughter. Most of R. K. Narayan’s novels take place in the imaginary South Indian village of Malgudi, portrayed with brilliance and charm. He gives English readers who do not know his country a glimpse into the foibles and joys of the simple life and everyday piety of Hindu culture in India. He Narayan, R.

There is always a breezy, easy quality to Nara- yan’s work. It is not fraught with high philosophy or complex themes, but rather blessed with an accessibility that takes great skill to produce. His extraordinary productivity included many short stories and articles as well as his novels. On request, Narayan wrote popular versions of both the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. In the late 1980s R. K. Narayan was elected to India’s upper house of parliament, the Rajya Sabha. He was also honored with many literary awards, including India’s Sahitya Akademi Award (for The Guide ), the Royal Society of Literature’s Christopher Benson Award, and Indian’s second highest literary award, the Padma Vibhushan, in 2000. He also made the short list for the Nobel Prize in literature. He died in 2001 after his own daughter’s sad early demise, still working on another novel. Narayan was a great figure in world literature, whose own personal humility and desire to avoid pretense may have made him less widely known than he deserved. Further reading: A. L. McLeod, ed., R.

Narayana See V ISHNU . Narayanananda, Swami (1902–1968) pioneer Hindu teacher in Scandinavia Swami Narayanananda established V EDANTA cen- ters throughout Europe and North America. He was born in Coorg, a village in the state of Karnataka, in southern India. A bright boy, from an early age he showed a marked tendency to spiritual matters. He never married and at the age of 27 took the vows of the renounced life ( san- nyas ) and began searching for a GURU . His pilgrim- age around India eventually took him to the Belur Math of the V EDANTA /R AMAKRISHNA M AT H AND M ISSION , where he met Swami Shivananda, who became his teacher. Several years later, he was instructed by his guru to spend time alone in the Himalayas to strengthen his spiritual practice. In February 1933 he had a deep spiritual experience, which he described as merging into the formless aspect of God, that is, nirvikalpa samadhi. He remained in seclusion until the partition of India in 1947. The violence of the period con- vinced him to dedicate his life to helping people; he left his retreat and began to accept disciples. In 1955, as a step toward building a more formal fol- lowing, his devotees established a printing press and began to publish Narayananda’s writings. It would be another 12 years, however, before the swami would consent to incorporating an organi- zation, the Narayanananda Universal Yoga Trust. The first ASHRAM was opened in Denmark in 1967. The first ashram in the United States was opened in Chicago in the early 1970s. Initially, the leaders of the rapidly expanding movement were all monks who had trained with Narayanananda in India, but in the course of the 1970s a number of Westerners took vows of san- nyas and took on leadership roles. As in India, the monks live a life of celibacy and follow a spiritual discipline that includes twice-daily MEDITATION sessions with the community and the practice of HATHA YOGA . Narayanananda died in 1988. His movement continues from its international headquarters in Gylling, Denmark, and the ashram in Chicago.

In his cosmic dance he creates, sustains, and even- tually destroys the universe. When Shiva’s dance is seen as symbolizing only the end of time, it is called the Tandava dance. Nataraja is depicted in a pose from the BHARATA NATYAM dance, with his left leg raised and his right leg resting on a dwarflike being representing igno- rance and delusion, sometimes called Apasmara (forgetfulness [of the truth of the divine]). He has four arms. In his upper right hand he holds the “shake-drum” ( damaru ) that can be sounded with one hand, a tethered ball striking either end of a small two-sided drum. His lower right hand is formed into the ABHAYA MUDRA , a gesture that removes fear. His upper left hand holds the flame that symbolizes the end of creation. His lower left hand points toward his upraised left foot. Around his head and in the circular frame to which he is attached is a halo of flames that show his divine energy. Among Shiva’s many celebrated dances: he danced in the sky with V ISHNU ; once he danced in the cremation ground to please K ALI , his female counterpart; once he danced as a beggar for P ARVATI ’ S hand; once he danced a mad, erotic dance in the deodar forest for the wives of the RISHIS there; and he danced after the destruction of D AKSHA ’ S sacrifice. The great shrine at C HIDAM - BARAMI in South India is perhaps the most famous one depicting Shiva’s Nataraja form. There is also an awe-inspiring 20-foot-high Nataraja in black stone in the Meenakshi Temple at Madurai. Further reading: Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, The Dance of Siva: Essays on Indian Art and Culture.

Nathdwara Literally, “the doorway to the Lord,” Nathdwara is a sacred town near Udaipur in the Indian state of Rajasthan; it is the principal seat of the cult of Sri Sri N AT H J I and of the V ALLABHA sect. The town itself is sometimes called Sri Nathji. Sri Sri Nathji is a form of K RISHNA . His image was taken to Nathdwara from Mathura in 1669 to prevent its destruction by the armies of the iconoclastic Mughal Muslim king Aurangzeb. The chief temple of Nathdwara enshrines the image of Krishna taken in 1669, which holds Govardhana Mountain, recalling the myth in which Krishna protected the cowherds of B RINDAVAN from storms caused by I NDRA , king of the gods, by holding up this mountain as an umbrella.

E . as a confederation of devotees of Shaivite ( see S HAIVISM ) and SIDDHA practices. The sect honors a legendary group of nine exemplars, called the nine Naths, or “lords,” who give the sect its name. The nine exemplars are listed with a wide variety of names, but they usually include Matsyendranath and G ORAKHNATH (with somewhat varying forms). These quasi-histori- cal Naths are considered the original sources for the various Nath lineages. The forerunners of the Nath Yogis were probably the various radical Shaivite groups that arose in the early centuries of the Common Era. The Nath Yogis were outsiders and very unconventional. They often adopted outrageous practices such as eating offal and public curs- ing, in order to emphasize their lack of fealty to any convention. They were extreme ascetics, practicing under the umbrella of TANTRISM , which sought above all to emphasize the dark and nega- tive aspects of existence as the source of spiritual power and transformation. However, the Naths abstained from the sexual practices generally asso- ciated with tantrism, as they generally avoided women entirely. Alchemy was an important element of Nath Yogi practice. Usually, this included not only changing base metals into gold via mercury, but also changing the body by the use of oxides of mercury to create an immortal body. This esoteric practice is combined with HATHA YOGA and the effort to raise the KUNDALINI at the base of the spine to effect complete spiritual transformation.

Natya Shastra Natya Shastra, “the authoritative scripture [ shas- tra ] regarding drama [ natya ],” is often considered the “fifth V EDA .” It was composed by the teacher Bharata around the second century C . E . Made up of over 5,000 verses, it delineates the art form of dance-drama of its time. The revived B HARATA N AT YA M dance-drama form of modern India still follows the guidelines of this text. The Natya Shastra claims that drama was created by the creator god B RAHMA himself. The text outlines every aspect of the drama, includ- ing the dress of the actors, the music, the stage, and the construction of the theater building. Indian drama has always relied greatly on dance; thus the steps, rhythms, and hand gestures or MUDRAS are carefully detailed. The text also sug- gests the most common themes that the drama can present, such as the battle between the gods and demons and the adventures of the individual gods. From a philosophical standpoint the two most important chapters are those that outline the principles of aesthetics in dramatic presen- tations. They present the distinctive theory of RASAS , the emotional “essences” that are commu- nicated via the drama.

Navaratri The Navaratri (Navaratra) or Nine Nights festival is celebrated for nine days in the lunar month of Ashvin (September–October). It is a pan-Indian festival that takes different forms in different regions. In most Hindi-speaking areas of North India Navaratri is celebrated as Rama Lila (the mysteri- ous divine magic of Lord Rama), a commemo- ration of the R AMAYANA epic. Each day features readings from the medieval Hindi T ULSIDAS Rama- yana; in most places plays are presented depicting K 308 Nath Yogis 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 308 12/14/06 9:29:09 AM"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"scenes from the Ramayana story, sometimes on a grand scale. The largest of the Rama Lila plays is staged across the river from the holy city B ENARES (Varanasi), where the kings have established an immense field as a stage for the Ramayana story. Actors go from station to station on different days as the story develops. On Vijayadashami, the day after Navaratri, effigies of Rama’s ene- mies—the demon king R AVANA , his son Megha- nada, and his brother K UMBHAKARNA —are burned to celebrate the victory of Rama over the demons or Rakshasas. In Bihar, Bengal, and Assam Navaratri is cel- ebrated as a D URGA festival. The festival begins by awakening Durga, who is asleep, and continues by manufacturing a temporary image of her that is enlivened for the purpose of the festival. P UJAS or worship services are performed for Durga on the last three days of the festival. On Vijaya- dashmi the image of Durga is taken in a great procession to be immersed and left in a tank, a river, or the ocean. In South India S ARASVATI , goddess of learning and the arts, is worshipped on the seventh day of the festival and Durga on the eighth day. On the ninth day there is a worship of instruments and implements of livelihood, which are taken out to be honored with mantras and small offerings. Further reading: Diana L.

Nayanmars A Nayanmar or Nayanar is a “leader” or “master.” In the Tamil devotional tradition the Nayanmars were poet-saints who spread the message of devotion to S HIVA throughout Tamil Nadu. Tra- dition makes them 63 in number, but some of the names are probably legendary figures. The real Nayanars lived from roughly the sixth to the eighth century C . E . They sang the praise and love of Shiva at numerous holy places, shrines, and temples throughout the region, opposing the Jains, Buddhists, and V AISHNAVITES in their efforts to advance everyone to the grace of their Lord Shiva. They apparently participated in India’s first known popular devotional move- ment, as all their verses are sung in Tamil, the spoken language of the local people, and not in S ANSKRIT . The last of the Nayanars, S UNDARAR , was granted a revelation by Lord Shiva himself at Tiru- varur, of the lives of the 62 saints who preceded him. His work is the first to give the entire list, to which his own name was later added. Nambi Andar Nambi (c. 1000 C . E .) is said to have com- piled the songs of all of the Nayanars, adding to them the works of several other famous poet- saints, including M ANIKKAVACAKAR , to form the basis of the T IRUMURAI , the basic Tamil Shaivite sacred canon. It consists of 12 books, 11 of them assembled by Nambi. Included in Tirumurai is Nambi Andar Nam- bi’s own account of the “holy labors” of the 63 saints, as well as his own story and verses. The 12th and final book is S EKKILAR ’s P ERIYA P URANAM (c. 1200 C . E .); its more than 4,000 verses summa- rize and add to the earlier Nayanar compendiums and include the works of some other Shaivite saints. The three best-known and most prolific of the Nayanars are A PPAR , S AMBANTHAR , and Sun- darar. Their hymns make up the T EVARAM , which serves as the primary liturgical scripture for Tamil Shaivites. These songs are strongly oriented toward particular sacred places, shrines, and temples that were visited by the three peripatetic saints as they pursued their PILGRIMAGE in order to sing Shiva. In Shaivite temples in Tamil Nadu today the Tevaram songs are sung in ritual wor- ship, along with Sanskrit MANTRAS . Most Nayanars were men, but a few were women. The most famous of the women saints is the first on the list of 63, Karaikal Ammaiyar.

Neem Karoli Baba (c. 1900–1973) bhakti yoga teacher Neem Karoli Baba, popularly known as Maha- raji, is one of the most influential GURUS from India to encounter the West. Although he never visited America or wrote any books, he graced the lives of many devotees during the 1960s and 1970s. Baba R AM D ASS was particularly inspired by Maharaji and Ram Dass’s works were among the first to introduce Eastern wisdom on a large scale to the West, particularly through portrayals of experiences with Neem Karoli. Neem Karoli was born Lakshmi Narayan Sharma to a B RAHMIN family in Akbarpur in Uttar Pradesh, India. In his childhood he was described as detached from desires of the mate- rial world. When he was 11 his family arranged a marriage with a girl from another Brahmin family. After the wedding, the groom left home and wandered the country as an ascetic for sev- eral years. His father, Sri Durga Prasad Sharma, eventually found him in the village of Neem Karoli (hence his name) and demanded that his son return home. The young man complied and spent the remainder of his life in dual roles as householder and saint. Neem Karoli always considered the world as his larger family and stated that the key to attain- ing salvation is to love all, serve all, and feed all. Devotees who were close to him describe the GURU as one who radiated love. He based his teachings on a form of BHAKTI YOGA , emphasizing service and unconditional devotion to God. His techniques have been described as both subtle and literal, and his teachings varied from individual to indi- vidual. His advice was determined by the needs of the student, even though he always asserted that one’s focus in life should be toward the welfare of others. Neem Karoli established two ashrams, at Kainchi in Uttachal and at B RINDAVAN in Uttar Pradesh. Over 100 temples have also been founded in his name. American devotees, includ- ing Ram Dass, gathered together in 1977 to form a common place of worship in honor of Neem Karoli. The group proposed the construction of a statue representing H ANUMAN , a deity most revered by Neem Karoli. The statue was com- missioned in India and completed in 1978. It found its permanent home in Taos, New Mexico. Devotees formed the Neem Karoli Baba Ashram around the Hanuman figure and have since held annual celebrations in September, marking the mahasamadhi (death) of Neem Karoli Baba on September 11, 1973.

Unlike the 23rd Tirthankara in our time, P ARSHVA - NATH , and the 24th, M AHAVIRA , both historical fig- ures, Neminatha is not a historical figure. Neminatha is said to have had his previous incarnation in the celestial abode. He was born to the king Shauripura and his wife, Shiva Devi. His birth was accompanied by many auspicious signs, including the appropriate auspicious markings on his body to indicate his special status. He never undertook the householder life. At the death of own parents he resolved to take up the path of a Jain renunciant, to the acclaim of the gods. He dis- tributed his vast worldly wealth to the indigent. As Neminatha ascended his royal palanquin for the last time to go to his place of renunciation, all beings hailed him and shouted their praises and encouragement. He arrived at a park named Revika and there removed all his garlands and ornaments and tonsured himself in the fashion of Jain monks by removing all his hair in five hand- fuls. At that time he took the vow of taking food only once every third day until he entered the order of the wandering monks. For 54 days Neminatha lived completely ignoring his body in every way. On the 55th day on top of Mount Ajjinta, after reducing his food to once every fourth day, he attained to supreme knowledge and the status of a kevalin, having unobstructed wisdom. He attained, afterward, the status of a Tirthankara, a crosser of the ford, and omniscience, knowledge of all that occurred in the world at all times. At this time he had a community of 18,000 monks, 40,000 nuns, 169,000 laymen, and 369,000 laywomen. With him were 400 monks who had achieved the highest wisdom short of being per- fected and many other monks whose knowledge was developing. They say that Neminatha lived for 300 years as a bachelor, 54 days as a monk, and 700 years as an omniscient being. Thereupon, taking food once every month he fasted until he left his body and achieved NIRVANA . More than 84,000 years has elapsed since this event.

Many festivals and holy days occur on these days in contemporary India. The following are some of the full moon celebrations: (1) Chaitra (or Chitra) Purnima is celebrated to recognize Chitragupta, assistant to the god of death Y AMA . It is thought that if he is honored while people are alive he may be more lenient with them after death. (2) The full moon of the month of Ashvina (September–October) is a day for worshipping L AKSHMI for wealth. A vow is taken on that day to stay awake all night. (3) The full moon in the month of Shravana (July–August) is the time when certain B RAHMINS change their sacred threads. In the celebration of R AKSHABANDHAN sisters generally put a thread wristlet on brothers for good luck.

Nimbarka (c. 12th century) Vedanta philosopher Nimbarka was a philosopher of the V EDANTA , who founded a sect of V AISHNAVISM centered in Mathura, North India, that focused on R ADHA and K RISHNA . Nimbarka was born in Andhra Pradesh; his name has been traced by some to the village Nimba or Nimbapura in the Bellary District. One myth explains his name more colorfully: once a wandering mendicant visited Nimbarka, who offered him food. Because the Sun had already set, the ascetic refused, saying that he had vowed not to eat after the Sun had set. Thereupon the philosopher took the last rays of the Sun ( arka ) and put them up in a neem tree (nimba tree) until food could be prepared and the ascetic could eat. Formally, Nimbarka’s Vedantic philosophy is called dvaitavaita, “both dualist and non-dualist,” which makes it quite similar (but not identical) to the philosophy of R AMANUJA and his V ISHISHTAD - VAITA , “non-dualism via differencing.” Dvaitad- vaita, as does non-dualism, understands that all is the divinity. All souls and all matter are the stuff of the divine. In this sense there is non-duality between the selves, between materiality and the ultimate. At the same time no individual soul (let alone matter) can ever be as supreme or sublime as the divine, so in that sense there is duality (a difference) between the divinity and the world. Unlike S HANKARA ’ S V EDANTA , Nimbarka saw the world as real and not an illusion. Less scholarship has been done on Nimbarka’s philosophy than on several of the other major Vedanta philosophers. Eight major works in S AN - SKRIT are attributed to him but only three are available in published form: Vedanta-parijata-sau- rabha, his commentary on the Vedanta Sutra; a work called Dasasloki, which has only 10 verses; and Krishna-stava-raja, a devotional work. Several subcommentaries have been written on his work on the Vedanta Sutra. Nimbarka’s system took Krishna to be god, while the devotee took the role of Krishna’s con- sort, Radha, in adoring him and serving him. Nimbarka is perhaps best known to modern India through the Vaishnavite sect named after him, the Nimbarki sect, which is also referred to as the Sanakadi or Hamsa sect of Vaishnavites, centered in Mathura.

Nirankari movement (est. 1851) The Nirankari movement developed within the larger Sikh community as an effort to revive a faltering S IKHISM . The founder, Baba Dyal (1783– 1855), denounced new rites and rituals being introduced into Sikhism at the time, which he said were an indication that Sikhism was being absorbed into the more dominant Hinduism. The movement gained its name from his emphasis on Nirankar, or God the formless one. In 1851, Baba Dyal formally organized his small following as the Nirankari Darbar. He was succeeded four years later by his son, Baba Dar- K 312 Nimbarka 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 312 12/14/06 9:29:10 AM"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"bara Singh. Among the emphases of the move- ment was abstinence from alcohol. The movement remained small but received a boost in the 1930s from Boota Singh (1883– 1944), who sought to revitalize it. He began to preach against all regulations based upon external habits and appearances, including all rules about what one wears, eats, or drinks (including the prohibition of alcohol). Boota Singh received initiation from the S ANT M AT lineage that looks back to Jaimal Singh (1838–1903). He not only passed the lineage to the present leader of the movement but also added the practice of jnana, the giving of knowledge by the GURU (or his representative) to each member of the movement. The giving of knowledge is a confidential aspect of the Nirankari faith, and members agree not to divulge its nature. Members also agree not to discriminate against people in respect to caste, sex, color, religion, or worldly status; not to criticize anyone because of his or her diet or dress; and to make no renunciation of the world. Boota died in 1944, and he passed leadership of his small following within the larger Nirankari movement to Avtar Singh (1899–1969). The lat- ter saw the partition of India and the movement of many Hindus from what is now Pakistan back into Indian territory. Operating from Delhi, he began to gather a following especially among the newly migrating Sikhs. In 1947 he formally organized the Nirankari Sant Mission, which held its first annual meeting (Samagam) the next year. The growth was such that Avtar Singh’s following constituted the main body of Nirankaris. In 1969, Avtar Singh was succeeded by Gur- bachan Singh (1930–80), who would oversee significant growth of the movement outside India through the British Commonwealth and the United States. A major stimulant for growth was Gurbachan Singh’s world tour the year before he became the head of the movement. Once in his leadership role, he formed a foreign section to stimulate further growth around the world. In 1971, he traveled to North America and organized the work in the United States and Canada. He also authored Avtar Bani, which serves as a holy book for the Nirankaris. Gurbachan Singh asserted his belief that Nirankaris were Sikhs, in spite of their separate organization. Many Sikhs disputed these claims; against the tense background of Sikh demands for independence from India, intra-Sikh violence occasionally erupted. In 1980, Gurbachan Singh was assassinated. He was succeeded by Hardev Singh Ji Maharaj (b. 1954), who continues as head of the movement, now known as the Nirankari Sant Samagam of the Nirankari Universal Brother- hood Mission. Assisting Hardev Singh Ji Maharaj are seven men chosen by him and known as the Seven Stars. Further reading: J. S.

The term probably originated within Buddhism. It literally means a “blowing out”—of the fires of worldly existence. In the early Buddhist context this implied the recogni- tion that nothing is permanent and that there is no permanent self, but only a shifting combina- tion of aspects that constitute themselves so as to make us believe in a permanent “self” or soul. nirvana 313 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 313 12/14/06 9:29:10 AM"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"Early Buddhists tried not to describe this state elaborately as it is beyond human conception. The Jain tradition also adopted the word to refer to the blissful, powerful, superconscious state of liberation from birth and rebirth.

Nisargadatta Maharaj (1897–1981) advaita teacher Maharaj Nisargadatta was a Bombay (Mum- bai) merchant and householder, whose ADVAITA V EDANTA teachings and JNANA YOGA practices drew him a large following. His conversations, recorded by disciples and translated into English, ensured that his ideas would continue to spread after his death. Born in Bombay in March 1897, Maruti (his birth name) was raised on a small family farm near Kandalgaon in Maharashtra. As a boy he became familiar with spiritual topics by listen- ing to his parents discuss the spiritual life with a B RAHMIN friend, Vishnu Haribha Gore. When his father died in 1915, Maruti and his elder brother became responsible for supporting the family. They left home to seek employment in Bombay. Here, Maruti opened a shop selling bidis, hand- made cigarettes. He became prosperous in the trade and established several more shops across Bombay. In 1924, Maruti married Sumatibai, and they later became the parents of a son and three daughters. At age 34, Maruti began to seek answers to universal questions. His friend took him to Sri Siddharameshwar Maharaj, a teacher in Bombay in the Navnath Sampradaya, who gave Maruti a MANTRA and instructions on MEDITATION . Maruti quickly developed a practice, giving attention to nothing else than the sense of “I am.” Soon, Maruti began to have visions and to experience trance states. Between 1933 and 1936, he experienced SELF - REALIZATION and reported that he lived in full awareness of the transcendent reality. He named himself Nisargadatta (One Given True Being). After Sri Siddharameshwar’s death in 1936, Nisargadatta left his family and business to live the renounced life of a SADHU , a wandering monk who owns nothing and begs for food, in the H IMA - LAYAS . His journey was short-lived, after a fellow disciple convinced him that his spiritual inten- tions would be more fruitful at home. Returning to Bombay he found his business in shambles. He reestablished one bidi shop, which sustained him and his family. Nisargadatta spent the remain- der of his life tending his business and devoting himself to a strict discipline of daily observances and veneration of his GURU . He meditated and dis- cussed his master’s teachings with all who visited his bidi shop and did not visit saints or temples. As he began to speak to others, larger and larger groups of inquirers and students went to his shop to learn from his eloquence and wisdom. Nisargadatta’s teachings are based on jnana yoga and advaita Vedanta, a non-dualistic phi- losophy. His teachings emphasize the individual’s direct experience with the eternal in the here and now. His typical recommendation to new students was to practice with discipline and follow the same instruction provided to him, which fostered SELF - REALIZATION . Nisargadatta encouraged seek- ers to draw attention to “I am.” In doing so, he asserted that the practitioner’s mind would soon gain self-realization in thought and feeling. Nisar- gadatta died in Bombay on September 8, 1981. Ramesh S. Balsekar became one of Nisarga- datta’s closest disciples.

As more Westerners encountered Maharaj they furthered his teachings by translat- ing his conversations into English, publishing them throughout North America and Europe. After Nisargadatta Maharaj’s death, Balsekar continued his guru’s teachings and established the ADVAITA Fellowship in 1987. Since that time he has made annual visits to America and has become esteemed as a teacher of advaita Vedanta. The fellowship has its headquarters in Bombay (Mum- bai), India, and in Redondo Beach, California. Further reading: Ramesh S. Balsekar and Sudhakar S.

Nityananda, Swami Bhagawan (c. 1900– 1961) Shaivite siddha yogi Swami Bhagawan Nityananda was an inspiring teacher of siddha yoga MEDITATION , who attracted thousands of followers and disciples. The early years of Bhagawan Nityananda are shrouded in mystery of the sort that often charac- terizes the life of a saint from village India. From interviews with people who knew him in his early years, it appears that he was born near the turn of the 20th century in the town of Qualandi in Kerala state, South India, to parents who worked as servants in the house of a lawyer, Ishwara Iyer. His childhood name was Ram. Even as a child Ram lived in an exalted state. Swami M UKTANANDA , Nityananda’s successor, wrote of his GURU , “Beyond a shadow of a doubt he was a born SIDDHA [a person who is spiritually perfected]. Even though he was a self-born siddha still he had to have a guru. . . . It is the spiritual law—one has to have a guru.” Nityananda consid- ered his teacher to be Ishwara Iyer, who was not only his patron but also a devout B RAHMIN and a proficient YOGI . It was he who gave Nityananda his name. The story is that after spending a number of years in the H IMALAYAS , Nityananda returned to Qualandi to see Iyer, who was ill and praying for him to return. When Iyer saw the young yogi, he Swami Bhagawan Nityananda (c. 1900–1961), renowned devotee of Lord Shiva and siddha yogi (Kashi Church, Sebastian, Florida) Nityananda, Swami Bhagawan 315 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 315 12/14/06 9:29:10 AM"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"said, “Ah, my Nityananda has come!” From that point forward, he was known by that name, which means “eternal bliss.” Nityananda began manifesting miraculous powers while still in his teens, and he was a wandering SADHU (mendicant) before he was 20. There are accounts from Kerala and Karnataka states of the “sky-clad” (naked) yogi who traveled only on foot and ate only what was handed to him. In his presence, people had profound expe- riences of meditation and healing, both physical and spiritual. In the 1920s Nityananda built the Kanhangad Ashram around some jungle caves near the town of Kanhangad in Kerala, which is maintained to this day. By the 1930s, however, he left the region, again on foot. In 1936, Nityananda arrived in Ganeshpuri, the Maharashtrian village that was to be his home for the rest of his life. On the day he arrived, the caretaker of the local S HIVA temple built him a hut, and within a few years that kutir was enlarged to become Vaikuntha Ashram, the very spot where Bhagawan Nityananda’s SAMA - DHI shrine stands today. Bhagawan Nityananda is recognized in Ganesh- puri not only for his spiritual power but also for the material help he provided to the local people, who at that time were often living at a subsistence level. He distributed the offerings given to him, providing for the villagers food and clothing and establishing a local school and hospital and the Balbhojan (children’s food) Center, which still functions in Ganeshpuri. In the last two decades of his life, thousands of pilgrims traveled to Ganeshpuri for Nityananda’s blessings and the experience of his DARSHAN . Swami Muktananda writes, “In his presence, everyone meditated spontaneously.” Nityananda’s hallmark teaching is “The heart is the hub of all sacred places. Go there and roam.” Shortly before Nityananda took mahasamadhi (died) on August 8, 1961, he passed on the guru’s gaddi, the seat of power of his spiritual lineage, to Swami Muktananda, just as, years later, Swami Muktananda would pass it on to his disciple, Gurumayi C HIDVILASANANDA , who has been car- rying forward what is now known as the Siddha Yoga mission since 1982.

Nivedita, Sister (Margaret Noble) (1867– 1911) supporter of women’s education in India Sister Nivedita, an Irish-born convert to V EDANTA , became a social activist and supporter of women’s education in India. Margaret Noble was born on October 28, 1867, to Samuel Noble and Mary Hamilton in Dunganon, Northern Ireland, in county Tyrone. Before Margaret was a year old, Samuel moved to Manchester, England, where he enrolled as a theological student of the Wesleyan church. The young baby was left with her maternal grandmother in Northern Ireland, where she enjoyed a happy childhood while her father stud- ied and became ordained. At four years of age, she returned to live with her father, unhappy to leave her grandmother’s home. With her sister, she attended Halifax College, run by the Congregationalist Church. She learned personal sacrifice from the headmistress of Hali- fax, a member of the Plymouth Brethren. After her father was appointed minister of a church, she liked to listen to him preach and to imitate his expressions. Margaret was a thoughtful girl who asked many questions. She had learned about the char- acter of a nation from her paternal grandfather in his fight for home rule for Ireland. At age 18, in 1884, she received a post as teacher and became K 316 Nivedita, Sister 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 316 12/14/06 9:29:11 AM"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"engaged in the movement to foster child-centered learning in schools. In 1885, she opened the Ruskin School in Wimbledon, for adults as well as children who wished to study modern educa- tional methods. She was a cofounder of the Con- gress of Modern Pedagogy, centered on the child’s experience of school. She also served as a welfare worker, while championing the underprivileged by writing pamphlets in London. After Swami V IVEKANANDA ’s famous appear- ance at the W ORLD P ARLIAMENT OF R ELIGIONS in Chicago in 1893, he stayed for three months in London; in 1885, Margaret met him and declared herself his disciple, calling him “Mas- ter.” Through Vivekananda, she found a religion whose elements could be discussed scientifically and whose goal was expressed in terms of spiri- tual freedom rather than, as she thought, sin- defined slavery. While the swami was in England she followed his teaching assiduously, attending lectures four times a week. When Vivekananda left England in November 1895, Margaret began to study the swami’s philosophical ideas in prep- aration for meeting him again, declaring herself a “monk.” In 1898 Margaret traveled to India to start her new life of service to education and women. In March of that year, she was initiated by Vive- kananda and given the name Nivedita (she who had been dedicated). He asked her to live in an orthodox Hindu way. She opened a school for Indian girls in 1898 in a single room of her house in a poor section of Calcutta (Kolkata). While a plague raged in Calcutta, she nursed the sick and dying. She lectured on K ALI , goddess of destruc- tion and plagues, to audiences of thousands. She met and worked with Sri R AMAKRISHNA ’s widow, Sri S ARADA D EVI (1853–1920), who was revered by the Ramakrishna monks as the embodiment of the Holy Mother. In 1902 she left the Ramakrishna Order, after Vivekananda’s death, because her political activi- ties for Indian independence were declared incom- patible with her status as a Hindu renunciant ( brahmacharini ). The remainder of her life was spent in India working on behalf of Indian women. She died on October 13, 1911, in Calcutta.

Nyaya-Vaisheshika Nyaya and Vaisheshika represent two of the six “orthodox” systems of Indian philosophy. Ortho- dox here simply entails an acceptance of the V EDAS as an ultimate authority. In practice, even this requirement is observed only nominally in the case of one system, the S AMKHYA . For many centuries these two schools have been integrated in a single philosophical system. However, certain of their distinctive and separate features are worth noting. Vaisheshika, from the term vishesha (distinc- tion), is usually thought of as the earlier of the two systems. There is strong evidence that this system began to take shape as early as 400 B . C . E ., though the earliest extant texts are probably a little later. The 10 chapters of the Vaisheshika Sutra, by the sage Kanada, date around the sec- ond century C . E . They teach that salvation can be obtained only by “real knowledge” of things, as outlined in this SUTRA . Nyaya-Vaisheshika 317 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 317 12/14/06 9:29:11 AM"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"Vaisheshika admits of six philosophical cat- egories, with a seventh controversial category added later. The six original categories are (1) substance, which consists of nine eternal realities that compose the foundation of the universe; sub- stance is divided into (a) “atoms” of each of the five main elements or MAHABHUTAS and (b) time, ether, space, and soul; (2) attribute, of which there are 24; (3) karma, action or motion; (4) samanya, “generality,” that which characterizes all the members of a given class; (5) vishesha or particularity, which distinguishes one member of a class from another; and (6) samavaya, “rela- tion,” or combination, that is, the relationship that exists between substance and its qualities. A seventh category, “non-existence” ( abhava ), was added later to deal with certain philosophical dif- ficulties of the system. Most important in the system of Vaisheshika is the understanding of the atomic nature of all the elements. This philosophy was originally realist and nontheistic in orientation. Only later was the notion of God imputed to it. Nyaya was founded by Gautama (or Gotama) (c. 100 C . E .), who composed the Nyaya Sutra. Other famous philosophers of the Nyaya school are Vatsyayana and Gangesha. Nyaya can be loosely translated as “logic” or “argumentation,” which is indeed the central thrust of the Nyaya tradition. Because it also had a strong realist bias, it was easily merged with the earlier Vaisheshika school. Whereas the focus of Vaisheshika was the nature of things and how to categorize them, the focus of Nyaya is on the method of argument, syl- logism, and the reliable means for knowing. The syllogisms that Nyaya constructed were similar, but not identical to those of Aristotle. Whatever the similarities, Nyaya developed a rigorous philo- sophical basis that makes it quite comparable to Western analytical philosophy. The school of Navya Nyaya, or New Nyaya, that emerged in eastern India around the 14th century was particularly sophisticated philosophi- cally. Nyaya developed proofs of the existence of God (which are not found in the Vaisheshika), which compare quite well to those developed in Christian theology. Though Nyaya-Vaisheshika has very few adherents today, it developed philo- sophical tools that all the other Hindu traditions used. They were particularly useful in refuting the heterodox Jains and Buddhists.

Omkarananda, Swami (1930–2000) Vedanta teacher Swami Omkarananda was a V EDANTA teacher who founded the first Hindu ASHRAM in Switzerland. As a 16-year-old in South India the person later known as Swami Omkarananda suddenly left his home and traveled north to R ISHIKISH in the foothills of the H IMALAYAS . There, the next year, he was initiated into the renounced life ( sannyas ) by Swami Sivananda Saraswati. He remained at Rishikish for study and in 1954 was awarded a degree by the Yoga Vedanta Forest University. In the following years he met and studied with several other prominent Indian teachers, but from 1962 to 1965 he entered a period of retreat. In 1965, at the request of several Swiss intel- lectuals, he traveled to Switzerland to teach. He made a second visit in 1966; at that time he founded the Omkarananda International Ashram at Winterthur, Switzerland (near Zürich), the first permanent Hindu ashram in the country. The ash- ram grew and purchased a number of houses in Winterthur, identified by being painted blue. By 1975, tension had developed in the town between the members of the ashram and their neighbors. As the tension increased, some mem- bers of the ashram bombed the home of a member of the government of the canton of Zürich. The perpetrators were arrested, and the swami was also taken into custody and charged with complicity. He pleaded innocent but was con- victed. After seven years in jail, he was released but banished from Switzerland. He settled in Austria, near the Swiss border, and resumed his teaching work. His followers initiated actions to have his conviction overturned and to restore his reputation, but he died in 2000 before that could be achieved. In spite of the setback caused by the events of 1975, the ashram in Winterthur continues to operate, as does its sister branch in Rishikesh. Omkarananda wrote a number of books, many of which have been placed online at the Internet site posted by the ashram. Further reading: Omkarananda Ashram Himalayas. Avail- able online.

They are mamsa (meat, usually beef), matsya (fish), madya (wine), mudra (parched grain), and mai- thuna (sexual intercourse.) These five elements are meant to involve the participants (there may be one or more pairs in a tantric ritual circle) in forbidden actions that aid in realizing the divin- ity of mundane existence. By taking “forbidden” elements, they are confronted with the fact that even those things beyond the pale in human terms partake in the truth of the divinity, usually charac- terized as the goddess. Beef is forbidden to all caste Hindus. It is highly polluting, and eating it is condemned by society. Fish is also not taken by most B RAHMINS and is believed to have aphrodisiac qualities. Parched grain also is known to stimulate sexual appetite and therefore is not considered desirable. Alcohol is probably the foremost of Brahmini- cal prohibitions. In the D HARMASHASTRA of M ANU drinking liquor is equated with killing a Brahmin. Sexuality outside marriage is looked upon as a negative thing. The female sexual partner in tant- ric sexuality is preferably of very low caste and not the male partner’s wife.

J. Brill, 1979). Pancharatra The Pancharatra ( pancha, five; ratra, nights) sect was one of the early traditions that developed into V AISHNAVISM , the worship of V ISHNU . It probably dates to the last centuries before the Common Era. The name may derive from the S HATAPATHA B RAHMANA XIII.6, where the god Narayana, the primordial and all-encompassing divinity, per- forms a special “five nights” sacrifice in order to transcend and encompass all beings. In later Vaishnavism Narayana became the name of the highest divinity; he was said to transcend B RAHMA , S HIVA , and even V ISHNU .

V ASUDEVA , or K RISHNA , is the highest changeless god; Sankarshana is the Lord over all life; Pradyumna predominates over mind; and Aniruddha presides over ego. From Anirud- dha derives B RAHMA , who then creates the physical universe. From Vasudeva on down, each of the phases or forms of the godhead derives from the previous form. The doctrine in certain ways is reminiscent of the Christian trinity, whereby the one god takes on different aspects. The Pancharatra doctrines were elaborated in several important texts. The Bhaktisutras of Shandilya were central. The Pancharatra AGAMAS specified the temple cult, iconography, and ritual; they are no longer extant. Important extant Pan- charatra texts are the Sasvatasamhita Ahirbudh- nya Samhita and the Ishvara Samhita, which deal primarily with worship rituals. Vedic sacrificial worship, the earliest known phase of Hinduism, did not involve permanent structures (temples) or icons. Those features emerged only after a long process of development, and both the Shaivite and Vaishnavite traditions had to develop texts to explain and justify these innovations in Vedic terms. The Pancharatras were the primary agents that performed this task for Vaishnavism. Further reading: S. N.

Pandavas The five Pandava brothers, among whom A RJUNA and Y UDHISHTHIRA are best known, are central characters in the great Indian epic the M AHAB - HARATA . Their name is a patronymic derived from their father’s name, Pandu. Through Pandu they descend from the ancient king Kuru and the more ancient progenitor B HARATA . Although they are considered Pandu’s sons, they were not his natural sons, since a curse had been placed upon their father that he would die if he had sex with a woman. Their mother, Kunti (also known as Pritha, an aunt of K RISHNA ), used boons she had previously received to bear children with several of the gods. Kunti bore Y UDHISHTHIRA , the eldest, by the god D HARMA ; B HIMA by the wind god; and A RJUNA by I NDRA . Kunti gave her remaining boons to Madri, Pandu’s junior wife; the latter bore the youngest and least famous Pandavas, Nakula and Sahadeva, by the divine celestial twins, the A SHVINS . The five Pandavas shared a secret brother, Karna, who was born to Kunti by the Sun god, before her marriage to Pandu. Karna had been put into a reed basket and left to float away on a river. After Pandu died while attempting inter- course with Madri, his brother Dhritarashtra, though blind, became regent. Pandu’s sons were still considered the legitimate heirs, but Dhri- tarashtra’s 100 sons, known as the K AURAVAS (descendants of Kuru—as were the Pandavas) and led by the eldest son, D URYODHANA , began plotting to destroy their cousins, the five Pan- davas. Duryodhana, for instance, tried to poison Bhima but failed. The story of the epic revolves around the struggle for the kingdom between the Pandavas and their cousins. The conflict culminates in the great Bharata war, in which the Pandavas are triumphant, but with frightening losses.

An accumulation of papa over a lifetime causes a rebirth into a status that accords with the sin. The various types of papa, or sins, are detailed in the texts on proper conduct or DHARMA . M ANU ’ S D HARMASHASTRA , for example, has long lists of sins and transgressions. In the Indian context, however, there is no universal notion of sin. Instead, sin is determined by one’s social place and rank. A B RAHMIN committing a crime, for instance, will not be punished in any way as strictly as a S HUDRA (person of the servant class) would be for the same crime. On the other hand, a Brahmin who would use alcohol or eat beef would be seen to be committing a much greater sin than a Shu- dra who did. Further reading: Wendy Doniger and Brian K.

Paramananda, Swami (1884–1940) pioneer teacher of Vedanta in the United States Swami Paramananda was a leading teacher of Vedanta in the United States. He founded the A NANDA A SHRAMA AND V EDANTA C ENTRE , which carried on his teachings, including his respect for women as spiritual leaders. Born on February 5, 1884, to an affluent East Bengali family in the village of Banaripara in what is now Bangladesh, Suresh Chandra Guhu Thakurta, the person who would later become Swami Paramananda, was cherished by his par- ents, Brahmamoyee and Ananda Mohan. His mother died when Suresh was only nine years old. When his father’s second wife died, Suresh turned to an inner search. He began to read in his father’s library and was introduced to the spirituality of Sri R AMAKRISHNA . He visited the R AMAKRISHNA M AT H AND M ISSION at Belur Math near Calcutta (Kolkata) and studied the life of the Bengali saint. In 1900, only four years after the death of Ramak- rishna, Suresh ran away from home and joined the monastery. In 1902 he was initiated into the renounced life of sannyas by Swami V IVEKANANDA , student of Sri Ramakrishna and founder of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission. Paramananda then spent four years in Madras (Chennai) with Swami Ramakrishnananda. While there he received a vision of a mission to the West. In 1906 he accompanied Swami A BHEDANANDA to New York and served as his assistant at the V EDANTA S OCIETY . He succeeded Abhedananda as director of the New York Vedanta Center and later founded Vedanta centers in Boston and Washing- ton, D.C. While in New York, he became close to Sister Devamata (Laura Franklin Glenn) (1867– 1942), who in the 1920s published his biography. He traveled widely and was a popular and sensi- tive spokesman for the message of V EDANTA . As was his teacher Vivekananda, he was com- mitted to including women in the spiritual life. His first disciple, Sister Devamata, was given considerable responsibility for giving talks and spiritual guidance when he was away. Her talks were published along with those of Paramananda. Some of the Boston students regarded her, rather than the SWAMI , as their spiritual teacher. Another of his students, Sister Daya (Georgina Jones Wal- ton) (1882–1955), as did Sister Devamata, gave talks and spiritual guidance when Paramananda was not in town. Beginning in 1915, Paramananda began to lecture and teach in Los Angeles, dividing his time between that city and Boston. In 1923 he opened the Ananda Ashrama at La Crescenta, California, and in 1929 opened a second ashram at Cohasset, Massachusetts. Swami Paramananda died on June 21, 1940, at his Cohasset, Massachusetts, center. During his life, his three centers, in Boston, La Crescenta, and Paramananda, Swami 323 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 323 12/14/06 9:29:12 AM"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"Cohasset, were closely associated with the larger Vedanta Society in the United States, although organizationally independent. Since his death, the leadership of the ASHRAM has been held by women: Sister Devamata, Srimata Gayatri Devi, and Sister Sudha. The three centers, distrusting the attitude of some swamis toward women, refused to accept the new swamis sent by the Ramakrishna Math to lead their community. They applied to the Rama- krishna Math to be allowed to operate as a sister- hood, but no such permission was granted. In 1953 the Sarada Math, an order of women nuns, was founded in India, finally allowing women in the Ramakrishna-Vedanta tradition to take vows of renunciation. When the Paramananda com- munity still refused to accept new male swamis as leaders, the parent order severed relations. The Cohasset center and Ananda Ashrama continue to conduct daily shrine worship, give public services and classes, and publish Para- mananda’s books.

Parashurama avatar Parashurama was an incarnation of V ISHNU who fought the warrior class, who had tried to lord it over the Brahmins. It is said that Parasurama has wielded his fierce axe 22 times in different eras to destroy all the warriors on Earth—however, a few always managed to escape. Parashurama is also associated with the founding of the areas demar- cated by the Indian state of Kerala. The story goes that A RJUNA , hero of the M AHABHARATA , seized a cow from Jamadagni, the father of Parashurama. When the son returned to his father’s hermitage, he became furious and went out after the great hero. In a dreadful and bloody battle he eventually beheaded Arjuna. The sons of Arjuna, bent on revenge, went to the hermitage and killed Jamadagni. The furious Parasurama determined to extirpate the war- rior race once and for all. This is when he first launched his 22 campaigns. In another story, Parasurama’s mother went to fetch water and became enamored of a king bath- ing there. So enthralled was she that she forgot to return to do her requisite sacrifices. When she finally returned, Jamadagni ordered his sons to kill their mother. When they refused, he ordered Para- shurama to kill both his brothers and his mother. Knowing the power of his father, he did as ordered and received a boon in return. His wish, ironically, was that his brothers and mother be restored to life and that he forget all that had occurred. His father agreed. Other versions of this matricidal story are found in Indian folk tradition. Further reading: Cornelia Dimmitt and J. A.

There are indications that Parsvanath, too, was a historical figure, who preached an early version of the Jain doctrine of strict worldly renunciation and very strict noninjury to crea- tures as the only means to liberation from birth and rebirth. The Kalpa Sutra of B HADRABAHU (c. 500 C . E .) of the S HVETAMBARA Jains tells the story of the life of Parshvanath. It is said that he lived as a house- holder for 30 years, as a monk for 83 nights, and as an omniscient being for a little less than 70 years, for a total of 100 years. In his previous life Parshvanath was a divinity in heaven (in the Jain tradition one cannot reach liberation as a divinity, but only as a human). When that life ended he descended into the womb of Vama Devi, the wife of a king of the warrior caste, in the city of B ENARES (Varanasi). It is said that on the night he was born the world was bright with the ascending and descending of gods and goddesses with sounds of beings inquiring what grand event was taking place. Possessed of immense knowledge and faith, at the age of 30 Parshva took up the life of a renun- ciant, giving away his massive princely wealth to indigents. Outside the city in a park under an Ashoka tree he took off his finery and pulled out his hair in five handfuls (the custom when one becomes a Jain monk). He began vows of severe fasting and joined the community of homeless monks. For 83 days, they say, he gave up the care of his body completely and bore every hardship as though it were not hardship. He adopted all the circumspect practices of the monk—careful movement, measured speech, guarded desires, restraint of his mind and physical activities—so as to leave the ego behind completely. During these 83 days he reached omniscience and pro- ceeded to terminate the bonds of KARMA . Eight major followers joined him and he created a community of 350 monks, which grew and grew as his perfection affected more and more people. After 70 years as an omniscient being, he adopted the vow of taking food without water once a month on Mount Sammeta and became perfected (a SIDDHA ) and liberated, his soul going to the top of the universe to dwell in effulgence forever.

Parvati/Uma In Hindu mythology Parvati (she who belongs to the mountains) is the daughter of H IMAVAT and Mena, and the wife of the ascetic god S HIVA . She is considered the REINCARNATION of Shiva’s first wife, S AT I . She also goes by the name Uma. The first textual mention of Parvati/Uma is in the K ENA U PANISHAD (c. 600 B . C . E .). Many scholars believe that Parvati was a mountain goddess of the indigenous, non-Aryan people of India who was absorbed into the Brahminical tradition. Parvati is born, according to most stories, to lure Shiva away from asceticism so that he will produce a son. The gods are desperate for this to happen, since only a son of Shiva can kill the oth- erwise invincible demon Taraka. However, Shiva ignores all of Parvati’s seductions. The gods send the god of love to make Shiva lustful, but Shiva opens his third eye and destroys him. Parvati then sets out on a quest to gain Shiva’s love by doing austerities of her own. She does the most difficult austerities, such as standing on one leg for many years, and gains great merit. The gods, noticing the tremendous power that Parvati is accruing, ask Shiva to grant her wish to marry him. Shiva, impressed by Parvati’s devotion and steadfastness, agrees to marry her. The mar- riage is often described, depicted, and enacted in Indian literature and tradition. All the gods take part in the wedding party. The stories all include a humorous interlude when Shiva’s mother-in-law, Mena, is outraged at his ascetic appearance—he is smeared with ashes from the cremation ground, and wears a garland made of a serpent and other disreputable items. Shiva and Parvati go to live in Mount K AILASA . Some folklore shows Parvati as dissatisfied with living in a mountain cave instead of a proper house. Nevertheless, the lovemaking of Shiva and Parvati is so intense that it shakes the cosmos. One story recounts that Shiva’s amorous enthrall- ment with Parvati turns all the animals, insects, and plants in the pleasure grove where they make love female. A hapless king who enters the grove also turns into a woman, although he wins a partial remission of this condition. (He is only required to be female half of any month.) As fate would have it, just as Shiva is about to impregnate Parvati, the gods interrupt them and his semen flies off, leaping from one container to another till it finds a safe place only in the G ANGES River, which thus becomes the mother of Shiva’s son, K ARTIKKEYA . G ANESHA , a second son, is born in a similarly unconventional way: Parvati rubs her arms, covered with sweet powder, before her bath; takes the residue; and forms a child of it. Parvati then has the child guard her bath (sometimes bedchamber). Unknowingly, Shiva encounters the child and thinks it an intruder. He cuts its head off. When Parvati emerges she chastises Shiva K 326 Parvati/Uma 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 326 12/14/06 9:29:13 AM"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"and has him find another head immediately. In a rush he gets a newly severed elephant head, and thus the younger son Ganesha has the head of an elephant. Parvati is often said to play dice with Shiva, and she always wins. She argues with him about his constant smoking of marijuana (a staple of Shaivite mendicants). Some stories connect Par- vati with K ALI , saying that she was originally dark in color but because of Shiva’s teasing she changed to a light color. In other stories, Parvati is actually the left half of Shiva in his form as A RDHANARISH - VARA . As with other female divinities, Parvati is sometimes conflated with the great goddess or creator and protector of all the universe; she gains supremacy in some mythological contexts.

E .) author of Yoga Sutra In Indian tradition two books are ascribed to Patanjali: the Mahabhashya (the primary com- mentary to the grammar of Panini) and the com- mentary on the Y OGA S UTRA . Western scholarship, however, dates the first work to around 200 B . C . E ., and the Yoga Sutra to around 200 C . E ., making it impossible for the two Patanjalis to be the same. Tradition has it that Patanjali was an incarna- tion of the divine serpent A DISHESHA , upon whom V ISHNU reclines between ages on the M ILK O CEAN . Patanjali’s name, it is said, is from this serpent, which in very tiny form fell ( pat ) onto the palm ( anjali ) of either Panini himself or his mother, Gonika, or fell from her womb ( anjali ) (the word anjali has many meanings). Patanjali is sometimes also referred to as Gonikaputra (son of Gonika). Iconographically, Patanjali is depicted with the lower body of a snake and a canopy of five serpent heads over his head. He is shown offering anjali MUDRA with his palms joined. This clearly refers to the second element of his name.

Periya Puranam The Tamil Periya Puranam of S EKKILAR forms the 12th and final book of the T IRUMURAI , the Tamil Shaivite sacred canon. Periya Puranam means “Great Purana, ” or great ancient story. It com- prises over 4,200 stanzas. Composed in the 12th century, the book tells the stories of the 63 N AYANMARS or Shaivite saints. These stories were originally recorded by the eighth-century poet S UNDARAR in the Tondartokai, or “compendium of the lives of the saints.” At royal order the list of saints was expanded in the 10th century by Nambi Andar Nambi. Sekkilar, a minister of the Chola empire, provides the most complete compendium in his Periya Puranam. It is said that he was inspired to create the work to wean the Chola king Anapaya Chola away from reading the highly erotic but heretical Jain text Jivaka Cintamani. Sekkilar is said to have recited this work at the Shaivite sacred shrine of C HID - AMBARAM . The book has 13 chapters. The longest story is about Sambanthar (1256 quatrains), followed by Periya Puranam 327 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 327 12/14/06 9:29:13 AM"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"the account of Appar (429 verses).

Many pilgrims visit shrines, rivers, sacred mountains, and sacred groves to obtain spiritual benefits; others go to achieve the worldly benefits that can also accrue from visiting a holy place. Women commonly vow to visit the shrine of a certain saint or god in order to have a child, especially a son. Some may visit a shrine and shave their heads there in order to win success at an exam or important business deal. All sects in Hinduism do pilgrimage. S HAIVITES , S HAKTAS , and V AISHNAVITES alike have myriad important sites. Vaishnavites target the many places where R AMA or K RISHNA visited or lived, as well as the many temples where other forms of V ISHNU are enshrined. Mathura, B RINDAVAN , and D VARAKA are particularly important for the devotees of Krishna, while A YODHYA is visited as the birthplace of Rama.

Perhaps the most significant pilgrimage site for Hindus is Benares. The primary aim of pil- grims in Benares is to bathe in the holy Ganges, which is said to confer heaven upon those who bathe in her. People nearing the end of their lives often go there, so that their ashes can be thrown into the river, and they can reach liberation from birth and rebirth.

This lush tree can grow to a huge size with a large canopy. It has large, rather thin leaves that make a rustling sound in a breeze, which tradition compares to the sound of the lute or veena. No one is allowed to cut down, remove branches, or tear off leaves from a pipal tree. Some associate the pipal tree particularly with V ISHNU , who is said to have been born under one. Often a pipal tree is officially “married” to a margosa tree when they are planted together. A solemn ceremony mimicking an actual mar- riage ceremony is performed, often before an entire village. Sometimes the tree is also invested with the sacred thread, as a B RAHMIN is. The tree plays a role in certain brahminical rituals, and sometimes in marriage ceremonies. Branches of pipal wood were used in the V EDIC fire ritual. It was under a pipal tree that the B UDDHA reached his enlightenment. Many legends, myths, and stories in Indian literature refer to events and occurrences that take place under this, the most sacred of Indian trees.

Pollution often entails substances related to birth, death, blood, bodily processes, and leftover food. The concepts of purity and pollution are cen- tral to the notion of caste in India. People whose traditional occupations put them in contact with leather, dead animals, toilets and sewers, and sweeping (leftover substances) are usually con- sidered outcastes or UNTOUCHABLES (Dalit). At the other social extreme are B RAHMINS , who never have contact with such substances and, ide- ally, deal only with learning, books, or temple rituals. They are considered pure. Middle castes, which sometimes have contact with polluting substances in their traditional work, have an intermediate purity status.

As new ideas of purity began to develop, Brahmins became the strictest vegetarians, even eschewing eggs in most regions of India. When they became the measure of purity, those who did eat meat were given lower status. Because of their purity, Brahmins may offer cooked food to anyone; thus, they are often hired as cooks in restaurants. Conversely, Brahmins can accept food from and eat together with only a very limited group of people, their own subcaste of Brahmins. Commensality—eating food together—is a sign of an equal level of purity. People who by tradition have different levels of purity traditionally would not eat in the same place or from the same source. Furthermore, any food that has been eaten by anyone else is highly polluting, unless that person is one’s infant child or husband; beef is always considered the most impure and reviled of foods. In villages, different castes still draw water from different wells. In social contexts feet are considered the most polluting body part and must never touch some- one else. However, people do touch the feet of a mother, father, elder brother, GURU , or god out of honor, respect, or worship. Any association with blood or death is considered polluting. Further reading: G.

Pongal Pongal is an important festival in the Tamil region, celebrated in the Tamil month of Tai (Janu- ary–February). Technically, the month starts when the Sun enters the sign of Capricorn. Pongal is a celebration of the harvest, which in Tamil Nadu occurs when the rainy season ends in December. The word Pongal is from the Tamil root pongu, which means to boil. During the festival, a pot is filled with rice, ghee, milk, and sugar or jaggery (palm sugar) and is heated to boiling. The pot is supposed to boil over to show the abundance of the harvest. The day before Pongal old imple- ments and clothing are discarded to be replaced by new ones. On this day cows and other cattle are directly worshipped and are allowed to run free. Bullfights are staged, and young men chase wild bulls, in a somewhat gentler version of the running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain. Further reading: M.

Pongala Pongala, which means “prosperity,” is a 10-day festival celebrated at the Attukal Amma Temple in Tiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) in Kerala. It begins in the month of Kumbham (February– March). The main festival ritual, the boiling of rice in a pot, is connected to the Sunday ritual to the Sun in ancient Dravidian culture, and to the Tamil New Year celebration of Pongal, which has a similar name because the basic ritual is the same. The Pongala ritual has become the largest gather- ing of women for festival purposes in the world. A high point of the festival is the recitation of the song of Kannaki, found in classical form in the ancient Tamil text Cilappatikaram. In this version, a boy is sacrificed and Kannaki tears off a breast to destroy the city of Madurai. On the ninth day, when the boy is sacrificed and Kannaki tears off her breast, the Pongala ritual fire is lit in the temple. All the women who are gathered simultaneously light their fires to cook rice. The overflow of the rice pot (or, in the case of B RAH - K 330 Pongal 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 330 12/14/06 9:29:14 AM"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"MINS , the near overflow) indicates that the woman has received the grace of the goddess. No men are directly involved. As part of the festival young boys ritually (and painlessly) pierce their skin with silver needles, to honor the goddess Attukal Amma. Unmar- ried girls under the age of 12 offer plates of rice, coconut, areca nut, and flowers to the goddess, to ensure that they remain healthy and protected.

Poonja, Sri Harilal (Poonjaji, Papaji) (1910–1997) teacher of enlightenment Sri Harilal Poonja was a prominent spiritual teacher in Lucknow who had a number of influ- ential students. Born on October 13, 1910, in an area of the Punjab now a part of Pakistan, H. W. L. Poonja was part of a family of devotees. His mother was a devoted follower of the Lord K RISHNA , and his maternal uncle was Swami R AMA T IRTHA , a cel- ebrated saint. At age eight, the boy had his first transcendental experience, became a devotee of Lord Krishna, and began a MANTRA practice day and night. At age 20, he entered into an arranged mar- riage and later had two children. He served in the army for less than two years, leaving to pursue his spiritual quest. While living in his father’s house with his wife and children, he received a vision of Bhagavan Sri R AMANA M AHARSHI , an enlightened master, who directed him to Ramana’s ashram in Tiruvannamalai in southern India. During the partition of India, Poonjaji moved his family from the Punjab to Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, where he worked as a salesman and min- ing manager. He later became a revered teacher in Lucknow, giving daily satsangs (teachings). His home and a nearby community building have been visited by hundreds of spiritual seekers and students. The main characteristic of his teaching was his capacity to awaken seekers to their true Self in his presence. The American teachers of enlightenment G ANGAJI and Andrew C OHEN are two of his best-known students. In 1993, the Avadhuta Foundation was set up to further the teachings of Poonjaji and to archive and distribute audiotapes and videotapes of meet- ings with him. He died in Lucknow on September 6, 1997. Further reading: David Godman, Nothing Ever Happened: Biography of H. W. L. Poonja, 3 vols.

Prahlada Prahlada, son of the demon H IRANYAKASHIPU , whom V ISHNU slew in his “man-lion” incarnation (N ARASIMHA ), is known as one of the great devo- tees of Vishnu. The story goes that Prahlada would admit, upon being questioned by his demonic father in his father’s court, that he was a devotee of Vishnu, his father’s sworn enemy. At one point, Hiranyakashipu became enraged and ordered his courtiers to kill his “traitorous” son. But God protected Prahlada, who was not harmed by the many weapons thrown at him. Further enraged, Hiranyakashipu commanded serpents to fall upon his disobedient son. The serpents too could not harm him. Then Prahlada was made to endure the crush- ing feet of celestial elephants and again was unharmed. Hiranyakashipu then sent ferocious fire upon his son, to no effect, followed by equally inefficacious poison and a fiery magical female being. Summoned to the court to explain how he had survived these ordeals, Prahlada claimed no work of magic but only the blessing of Lord Vishnu. His father resumed his efforts, having the son thrown from the top of the palace and having an enchanter put a deadly spell on him; neither attempt succeeded. Prahlada was tossed to the bottom of the ocean and covered with rocks; he did not die. Somehow after all this the father and son were reconciled, though the son con- tinued to testify that he had Vishnu “within his heart.” When Vishnu eventually killed his father, Prahlada became the head of the demons.

In the period of the B RAHMANAS his status rose even higher, as he was ritually identified with the cosmic P URUSHA , the source of all reality. In the Rig Veda, the cosmic Purusha allowed himself to be dismembered to create all reality. This story was ritually reenacted each year in the AGNICHAYANA —the ritual building of the fire altar—but in the ritual Prajapati’s name is substi- tuted for Purusha’s. Prajapati retained his aggran- dized status in the U PANISHADS , but in later Hindu mythology he reverts to the status of “lord of all born beings.” In some cases, B RAHMA , the creator god, takes on his role.

It is seen as an eternal reality that always existed and always will exist. That is to say, phenomenal reality is not a created entity but is an eternal real that always was and always will be. Prakriti is seen as an unconscious force that creates and dissolves universes; when a universe is dissolved, prakriti becomes an inert unmanifest reality, which will once again come forward to produce a new creation. The task of Samkhya and most yogas is to learn how to dissociate the intel- K 332 Prahlada 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 332 12/14/06 9:29:14 AM"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"lect, the highest discriminatory faculty, as much as possible from the whirl of prakriti, phenomenal existence. This task requires the devotee to develop an immunity of sorts to the pulls and pushes of mani- fest reality. Meditative practice and other yogic practices are designed to firm up the discrimina- tive faculty against the pull of the fluctuations of reality. A yogi learns not to be influenced by either the good or the bad that comes her or his way, but to remain calm and steady in the face of all phenomena. When the highest discrimination ( viveka ) is awakened in the intellect, then the dormant consciousness or PURUSHA becomes fully aware that it is not of the stuff of prakriti or nature but is a conscious eternal entity of its own sort. Then occurs release from prakriti and the cycles of birth and rebirth, though one may remain in a bodily state afterward. Further reading: Knut A.

From its earliest days Indian philosophy sought to delimit the grounds upon which valid argument could be made. Different philosophical schools varied widely as to which grounds they accepted, but they all had from one to six or more explicit pramanas. Examples of pramanas are pratyaksha, or direct perception; ANUMANA , or inference; and SHRUTI , or scripture. The C HARVAKAS , the Indian materialists, believed that only direct perception or pratyaksha was valid and there is no point in trying to draw any conclusions by analogy or any other way. The M IMAMSA school, on the other hand, saw shruti or the Vedic scripture to be the most important pra- mana. N YAYA -V AISHESHIKA , the most philosophical school, strongly relied on inference, or anumana. Further reading: S. N. Dasgupta, The History of Indian Philosophy (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1971–75); R. I. Inagalalli, Sabda Pramana, an Epistemological Analysis (Delhi: Sri Satguru, 1988). prana Prana is the vital air or life’s breath. According to older yogic theory there are five breaths or pranas. The breathing breath is called prana; the breath that goes downward out the anus is called apana (but sometimes apana is used to refer to the “out-breath” in contrast to the “in-breath” of prana ); the digestive breath is called samana; the breath that is diffused throughout the whole body is called vyana; and the breath that goes up the throat and enters into the head is called udana. These five breaths, or pranas, resemble the humors of earlier Western medicine.

Each must be controlled so that the three fill equal durations of time. One must gradually develop the ability to prolong all three.

Prana Yoga Ashram (est. 1975) Prana Yoga Ashram is one of several centers founded by Swami Vignanananda (Who Has the Bliss of Wisdom), who represents the lineage of Swami S HIVANANDA of Rishikesh. Swami Vignanananda (previously known as Swami Sivalingam), a devotee of Swami S HIVANAN DA Saraswati, was born in Thinnanore, Trichy Dis- trict, in Tamil Nadu on June 14, 1932. He stud- ied with Shivananda at his Yoga Vedanta Forest Academy on the banks of the G ANGES River in Rishikesh, beginning his spiritual journey there with four years of intense study of HATHA YOGA , from 1959 to 1963. Upon leaving the academy, he began mission work outside India to disseminate the teaching and practice of Sivananda. In 1963, he left on a mission to Asia, establishing Sivananda Yoga Cen- ters in Japan and Hong Kong. After teaching in Japan for 10 years, he entered the United States in 1973 and founded the Prana Yoga Foundation in 1974, the Prana Yoga Ashram in Berkeley in 1975, the Prana Yoga Center in 1976, and the Ayodhy- anagar Retreat in 1977. During 1975 he traveled to Canada and established his work there. In all, he established nine centers in North America. Vignanananda has passed on the synthesis of yoga teachings he learned at the academy. His teaching centers on HATHA YOGA with its postures (asanas) and the practice of PRANAYAMA (regulation of breathing patterns). Through a prescribed pattern of breathing and bodily postures, prana or spiritual energy is generated and dispersed throughout the nervous system. The effect is cleansing, healing, and energizing to the entire body. The ashrams publish the periodical Prana Yoga Life through their headquarters in Berkeley, California.

In theistic Hinduism the grace of God can free one from the bonds of KARMA , the cycle of birth and rebirth. Also, grace can give one blessings in life. Grace can be conferred by visible means in a number of ways. Most commonly food or flow- ers will be offered to the divinity in a temple or shrine; once the deity has partaken of and blessed the offering, it is distributed to devotees and called prasada. Another very common way of receiving grace is from the arati lamp or PUJA lamp that is waved before the divinity. One can put one’s hands over the flame and then touch one’s head and/or face to receive the blessing of the divinity. Things given to a person by a guru or other religious per- sonage also can confer grace. In fact, any object placed before an icon in order to be blessed may be given prasada, or grace.

PROUT (est. 1959) PROUT is an acronym for PROgressive Utilization Theory, a socioeconomic philosophy developed by Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar (1923–90), better known to the world as Sri Sri A NANDAMURTI , the founder of the A NANDA M ARGA Y OGA S OCIETY . Sarkar saw PROUT as an alternative to both capitalism and communism, the major economic systems of the 20th century. Sarkar suggested that both capitalism and communism had failed to address the mental and spiritual needs of humankind. He called for a balance between more abstract concerns, such as economic growth, social development, and environmental sustainability, and individual and collective human interests. Sarkar assumed that humanity is heading toward the experience of a higher consciousness as part of the essence of the race’s evolution. Mate- rial and intellectual gains lose their significance unless accompanied by spiritual progress. He advocated a decentralized economy with decision making in the hands of local people. The democ- ratization of economic power implied that there would be strict limits on the individual accumula- tion of wealth. Alongside the decentralization of economic life, Sarkar saw the need for a world governance system, including a global bill of rights, consti- tution, and common penal code. Such a world government would institute many of the values he advocated, such as guaranteed necessities of life for all people, moral and principled leaders dedicated to the service of society, individual freedom, cultural diversity, and equal rights for women. The PROUT system has gained some support from a few intellectuals, but has yet to find imple- mentation on a large scale.

A puja minimally entails an offering and some MANTRAS . It can take place at any site where worship can occur, either of a divinity, a GURU , or SWAMI , a being, a person (such as a wife, husband, brother, or sister), or spirit. It can take place in a home or a temple, or at a tree, river, or any other place understood to be sacred. Incense, fruit, flowers, leaves, water, and sweets are the most common offerings in the puja. Also, common is the arati or waving of a lighted lamp. The most elaborate puja, the temple puja before the icon, includes the following elements accompanied by the appropriate mantras (usually in S ANSKRIT ): invitation to the deity, offering of a seat to the divinity; greeting of the divinity; wash- ing of the feet of the divinity; rinsing of its mouth and hands; offering of water or a honey mixture; pouring of water upon it; putting of clothing upon it (if it has not been already clothed for the day); giving of perfume, flowers, incense, lamps, or food; prostration; and taking of leave. In temples the iconic image of the divinity is always treated as a person of royalty would be treated. Therefore, a puja will be done in early morning accompanied by songs to awaken the deity. The deity is then bathed, dressed, and fed, and then more fully worshipped. Pujas go on throughout the day to the deity, as local traditions require. In the Jain tradition temple puja is actively done only among the S HVETAMBARAS , but it can take on a different aspect. When the puja is done to the main image of the temple, a T IRTHANKARA or ARHAT (saint), no grace can be expected in exchange, as the Tirthankara is a released being only and not a god. Shvetambara Jains do other pujas to subsidiary gods and goddesses and spiri- tual personages other than the arhats, which can confer desired results.

These stories supply a rich backdrop to Hinduism, and, together with the epics, the R AMA - YANA and M AHABHARATA , form the mythological infrastructure of the culture. Jains have their own puranic literature, but it dwells on the lives of the great teachers, the T IRTHANKARAS and other holy personages who have broken the bonds of karma, rather than on the gods. There are 18 traditional puranas in Hindu- ism, all written in S ANSKRIT . Though their names could be taken to indicate a sectarian focus (as, for example, the Shiva Purana), most often they contain both S HAIVITE and Vaishnavite stories.

Included in the category of purana are very important local stories, usually in Sanskrit, but sometimes in local languages. In particular, the Tamil language of South India contains many sto- ries like this. These sthala puranas, or puranas of “place,” tell the origin stories of the vast number of local divinities who populate the Indian landscape. An example of this would be the Tiruvilayadal Puranam, written in Tamil in the 16th century, which tells the story of M INAKSHI from the Brah- minical point of view, showing how she became subordinated to S HIVA , who became her husband.

Pururavas and Urvashi See APSARAS . purusha The term purusha has two meanings. In the ancient R IG V EDA , X. 90, the Purusha (usually spelled in English with a capital P ) is the divine being who existed before time and was sacrificed to create both the transcendent and the material realms. The major Vedic ritual, the AGNICHAYANA , was seen as a reenactment of this primordial cre- ation, and Purusha was seen as being sacrificed once again to mirror the myth. In that context the Purusha began to be called P RAJAPATI . The second sense of the word purusha is found in the S AMKHYA and YOGA traditions, where puru- sha is the individual self. In the early understand- ing the purushas were infinite in number and all eternally distinct from one another. In the later understanding, affected by V EDANTIC thinking, the purushas merged with the ultimate self, or ATMAN , when they achieved liberation. In current yoga, the term purusha is just another term for atman or “worldly self.” Further reading: S. N. Dasgupta, History of Indian Phi- losophy, 5 vols.

B HADRABAHU (c. 300 B . C . E .) is said to be the last Jain teacher to know all 14 of these texts by heart. Brief descriptions of the Purvas appear in later literature. They must have included cosmol- ogy, speculations on the karmic substance that holds a soul in transmigration, polemics, astrology, astronomy, and disquisitions on esoteric powers and YOGA s.

She is usually presented as the primary consort of K RISHNA ; their passionate love has served as a spiritual model and inspiration in Indian culture. Radha appears in association with Krishna in textual fragments dated as early as the third cen- tury C . E ., although she is not mentioned by name in the authoritative Vishnu Purana (c. fifth century C . E .) or in the equally important B HAGAVATA P URANA (10th century C . E .). By the 12th century, however, her role as Krishna’s consort was assured, as in the magnificent G ITAGOVINDA of Jayadeva. The more Krishna became associated in the devotional literature with a divine “sweetness,” the more his sweet, poignant love of the cowherd woman Radha and her reciprocal love became the guide for devotees to the god everywhere in India. As the Gitagovinda describes Radha’s shifting moods of love, anticipation, pique, disappoint- ment, and eventual union, the writer evokes a passion that seems to extend to the elements of nature, the trees, the wind, and the Moon. Radha is love incarnate. Theologically, the Gitagovinda presents Radha as an energy, a S HAKTI (the Hladini Shakti), of Krishna himself. In the Bengali Vaishnavite tradi- tion, which eventually extended its influence to B RINDAVAN and beyond, one has the sense that Krishna too cannot exist without the love of his counterpart. The devotee becomes, in effect, essential to God. Sometimes the tradition goes so far as to say (in devotional hyperbole) that it is better to worship the devotee than God himself. Occasionally, in the Vaishnavite tradition, Radha is actually portrayed as Krishna’s wife and partner. This attempt to sanitize their relation- ship distorts it: the power of their attraction is theologically understood to reside in her unavail- ability: she is married to someone else. Krishna and Radha are eternal paramours and not spouses. It should not go unsaid that Radha is not just a cowherd woman, but the goddess herself. Some elements of the great GODDESS (Mahadevi) can be found in her literary image. Further reading: Edward C.

Radha, Swami Shivananda (1911–1995) kundalini yoga teacher The German-born Swami Shivananda Radha helped to spread KUNDALINI YOGA and other Indian teachings in Canada. She founded the Yasodhara Ashram Society in British Columbia, an important spiritual center. Sylvia Hellman was born in Berlin, Germany. Before World War II, she established a success- ful career as a dancer and writer. She and her husband helped the persecuted escape Nazi Ger- many during the war. Her husband eventually lost his life in this cause. After the war Hellman remarried, but misfortune struck again when her second husband had a sudden stroke and died in 1949. Distraught over her losses, Hellman relocated to Montreal, Quebec, in 1951 with the intention of starting a new life. It was dur- ing this period of mourning that Hellman began questioning the meaning of life and pursuing a spiritual practice. In 1954, while at the S ELF - R EALIZATION F ELLOWSHIP , founded by Parama- hansa Y OGANANDA , she experienced a vision of Swami S HIVANANDA S ARASWATI . Feeling compelled by this vision, she traveled to R ISHIKESH , India, in 1955 to meet and study with the swami. After only a few months, Swami Shivananda gave her MANTRA initiation and gave her the name Swami Shivananda Radha. From that moment forward, she devoted herself completely to studying Indian wisdom and introducing what she had learned to the West. While in Rishikesh, she encountered the eternal yogi B ABAJI , the famous guru in Yogananda’s line of KRIYA YOGA gurus, and received an intense experience of light and expanded consciousness. After six months in Rishikesh, Swami Radha returned to Canada at the request of her guru. In 1956 she formed the Shivananda Ashram in Vancouver, British Columbia, which was later to become the Yasodhara Ashram in Kootenay Bay, British Columbia. The ashram has served as a major center in the West for the teaching of KUNDALINI practices and has remained inde- pendent of the various branches of Shivananda’s Divine Life Society. Swami Radha’s teachings rely on practical techniques that make spirituality accessible to modern everyday life. Kundalini and other forms of yogic practice are used to direct individuals toward holistic development and independence. Radha taught what she learned from encounters with Babaji; her methods used visualized healing and divine energy. She often merged yogic teach- ings with Western psychology and symbolism, effecting an understanding between the Eastern and Western mind. The Yasodhara Ashram Society publishes an internationally recognized yoga magazine called Ascent, which Swami Radha instituted in 1969. Timeless Books publishing company was estab- lished by Radha in 1978. Located today in Spo- kane, Washington, Timeless Books publishes works on kundalini, MEDITATION , mantras, and dream analysis. In 1992, Swami Radha oversaw the comple- tion of the Temple of Divine Light Dedicated to All Religions located in Kootenay Bay. She also founded the Association for the Development of Human Potential, dedicated to helping individu- als achieve their spiritual path. Over 100 members have joined the Yasodhara Ashram Society with affiliated centers called Radha houses located throughout Europe and North America. The centers serve as a continuing resource for Swami Radha’s teachings.

Radhakrishnan, Sarvepalli (1888–1975) philosopher and political figure Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was one of the great phi- losophers and thinkers of modern India. He wrote prolifically and held distinguished academic posi- tions in both the East and the West. As was the case for many of his compatriots, he participated in the movement for India’s independence and held several distinguished positions in the new government of independent India, including the post of president of India. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was born on Sep- tember 5, 1888, at Tiruttani, near Madras (Chen- nai), in South India. His early years were spent there and in Tirupati, both famous as pilgrimage centers. As was the custom, he married young, at the age of 16; he and his wife, Sivakamuamma, had five daughters and one son. He graduated with a master’s degree in arts from Madras Chris- tian College in 1908. In partial fulfillment of his M.A. degree, Radhakrishnan wrote a thesis, The Ethics of the Vedanta and Its Metaphysical Presup- positions, which was a reply to the charge that the Vedanta system had no room for ethics. This thesis was immediately published as a book, when he was still only 20 years old. In 1909, Radhakrishnan took a position in the Department of Philosophy at the Madras Presi- dency College. In 1918, he was appointed profes- sor of philosophy in the University of Mysore. Three years later, he was appointed to the most important philosophy chair in India, King George V Chair of Mental and Moral Science in the Uni- versity of Calcutta (Kolkata). Radhakrishnan represented the University of Calcutta at the Congress of the Universities of the British Empire in June 1926 and the International Congress of Philosophy at Harvard University. In 1929, he took a post at Manchester College, Oxford, and from 1936 to 1939 served as Spald- ing Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics at Oxford. In 1939, he was elected fellow of the Brit- ish Academy. From 1939 to 1948, he was the vice chancellor of Banaras Hindu University. S. Radhakrishnan later held distinguished positions in government. He was the leader of the Indian delegation to UNESCO during 1946–52 and served as ambassador to the Soviet Union in 1949–52. He was the vice president of India from 1952 to 1962 and the president of the General Conference of UNESCO from 1952 to 1954. He held the office of the chancellor at the University of Delhi from 1953 to 1962. From May 1962 to May 1967, he was the president of India. Sarve- palli Radhakrishnan passed away on April 17, 1975. In India, September 5 (his birthday) is cel- ebrated as Teacher’s Day in his honor. Radhakrishnan devoted his life to making India’s philosophical and religious riches known to the world. As had the great ACHARYAS of V EDANTA before him, he translated and commented on the U PANISHADS , V EDANTA S UTRA , and B HAGAVAD G ITA ; all of those works remain in print. Radhakrishnan, by training, was the rare phi- losopher who could genuinely appreciate and compare Eastern and Western philosophy. In nearly every book he wrote he included detailed comparisons of various philosophical views, with the understanding that all spiritual paths have cer- tain commonalities at their core. Part of his mis- sion was to assess and evaluate both traditions on their own terms. He always remained, however, a true student of the Vedanta and saw the limits of approaches that do not at some point transcend the rational. As did his compatriot M OHANDAS K ARAMCHAND G ANDHI , Radhakrishnan believed in an India that was spiritually aware and grounded in its ancient Radhakrishnan, Sarvepalli 343 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 343 12/14/06 9:29:16 AM"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"spirituality, but not bound by inherited social conventions destructive of freedom and justice. As others did, he criticized Indian traditions such as the caste system and customs that degraded women, and he fought to establish a pluralistic and democratic society that would fulfill the high- est ideals of Indian tradition.

Radhasoami Movement (est. 1861) The Radhasoami Movement began in Agra, India, in the 1860s with the teachings of Swami Shiv Dayal Singh. He himself reflected a variety of Hindu influences, including devotion to K ABIR , S IKHISM , N AT H Y OGA , and the Vaishnavite tradi- tion. Each of these emphasized the importance of sacred words and the guidance of a spiritual master in transforming the self. Singh became known as Soamiji Maharaj, because he was believed to be the incarnation of the Supreme Being Radhasoami Dayal (or Merci- ful Radhasoami). In 1861, Shiv Dayal Singh began holding satsangs (gatherings) in Agra, preaching Radhasoami as the true name of God. Although Singh himself was greatly influenced by Guru N ANAK , the founding teacher of Sikhism, the Rad- hasoami movement is not to be understood as an offshoot of Sikhism. It is often considered hereti- cal by orthodox Sikhs because it does not adhere to the Adi Granth, the Sikh scripture, as the only guru. Orthodox Hindus treat the movement with suspicion because of its disregard of caste. The Radhasoami tradition blends progres- sive leadership with esoteric beliefs and spiritual practices, a contradiction that gives this move- ment a unique personality. Radhasoamis practice a type of yogic meditation known as surat-shabd (spirit-sound), which they believe is based on scientific principles alone, not faith. The experi- ence of shabd, or sound current, is an internally heard vibration from God that allows for spiritual evolution. The movement accepts a hierarchy of leadership with one major teacher in charge at all times; a Sant Sat Guru is considered to be a human being who has taken birth from the high- est spiritual plane and has reached an exalted state by practice of surat-sabd yoga. A Sadguru is next in this structure, having received understanding from the Sant Sat Guru and practice of surat-sabd yoga. A Satsangi is a follower who learns the practice of surat-sabd yoga under the direction of a Sadguru. Singh’s students were mostly members of the urban merchant caste community, both house- holders and ascetics. After his death in 1878, there were many splits in the movement due to the lack of a clearly established method for selecting a successor. The succeeding masters gave birth to over 20 Radhasoami lineages, most of which have disappeared. Today the most famous branches include Radhasoami Agra, Radhasoami Dayal Bagh, and Radhasoami Beas. Radhasoami Agra occupies the original site at Soami Bagh in Agra, where a memorial shrine for the founder, Soamiji Maharaj, has been in construction since 1904. Soamiji Maharaj’s fourth successor, Babuji Maharaj, died in 1949, leaving the community to await the coming of the sixth Sant Sat Guru. A spacious residential colony and institution are administered by the movement’s Central Administrative Council, which was origi- nally established in 1902 by Maharaj Saheb (sec- ond successor). The Dayal Bagh branch was founded by Kamta Prasad Sinha at Ghazipur in 1907. In 1913 Sinha’s successor, Anand Swarup, moved the organiza- K 344 Radhasoami Movement 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 344 12/14/06 9:29:16 AM"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"tion’s headquarters to Agra, directly across from Soami Bagh. The two communities have remained separate, each maintaining a large residential col- ony, shops, post office, and bank. Satsangs (gath- erings) are held every evening, drawing crowds in the hundreds. The Beas branch was created in 1892 under Baba Jaimal Singh and is located in Punjab. Fur- ther splits in this group have produced the Ruhani Satsang founded by Kirpal S INGH , known as Kirpal Light Satsang; the movement became popular in the United States under the leadership of Kirpal’s successor, Thakar Singh. The colony at Beas is a utopian city unto itself and draws thousands of attendees annually. Satsangs of this group gather near the Beas River and in Delhi and Bombay with thousands of people in attendance. The movement at large claims over 1 million initiates in South Asia and tens of thousands more throughout the rest of the world. See also S ANT M AT MOVEMENT .

It proclaimed the sovereignty of the king and invoked the fealty of his subjects. A number of S OMA offerings were made that could take as long as two years to com- plete. The king would take symbolic steps in four directions to assure sovereignty everywhere. He would ride a chariot about and shoot at a mock- up of a rival, to show his kingly prowess. The rite ended with a throw of the dice; the winning throw would assure the king’s good luck in the future. A losing throw would make him cautious in his rule.

Rajneesh, Bhagwan Sri (1931–1990) guru who taught a syncretic path to enlightenment Sri Bhagwan Rajneesh was a controversial guru whose syncretic teachings and antinomian phi- losophy attracted a wide following in India and the United States. Legal problems eventually led to expulsion from the United States. Born Rajneesh Chandra Mohan on December 11, 1931, in Kuchwara, a small village in central India, Rajneesh was the eldest of 12 children. His parents, Swami Devateerth Bharti and Ma Amrit Saraswati, practiced J AINISM , and Rajneesh remained a strict vegetarian throughout his life in consonance with Jain teachings. Interested since childhood in philosophical questions and the matter of death, he developed critical skills and studied philosophy at Jabalrur University. After receiving a master’s degree in philosophy he taught for several years at Madhya State University. In 1966, Rajneesh received enlightenment and began to travel throughout India instructing students and gaining a following. From 1969 to 1974 he taught at Mount A BU in Rajasthan. In 1974 he opened the Rajneesh Ashram in Poona. Here many Americans and other Western devo- tees attended his satsangs (gatherings) and lived in residence. Some have estimated that 50,000 sought enlightenment with him in Poona. In 1981, he fled Poona because of tax evasion Rajneesh, Bhagwan Sri 345 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 345 12/14/06 9:29:17 AM"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"charges and opened an ASHRAM on the 65,000- acre Big Muddy Ranch near Antelope, Oregon, in the United States, which he named Rajneesh- puram. Trouble dogged the ashram, including charges of poisoning, arms stockpiling, and antinomian sexual practices among top aides, although not by Rajneesh himself. The ashram was closed and Rajneesh sought sanctuary in North Carolina but was arrested there for visa violations. He was given a suspended sentence and a fine on condition that he leave the United States. He returned to Poona, where his health continued to fail. Here he abandoned the name of Rajneesh and adopted Osho, a name derived from the expression oceanic experience coined by William James. He died in Poona on January 19, 1990. Rajneesh was well versed in the scriptures and teachings of many world religions. He created a syncretic spiritual path that combined elements of Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Taoism, Chris- tianity, Greek philosophy, humanistic psychology, and modern forms of therapy and meditation. Basically he taught the non-dualism of ADVAITA Hinduism, believing that all reality is one in essence. Consistently with advaita, he taught that souls experience REINCARNATION until they receive enlightenment and the realization of the God that is within each person. He was known as the “sex guru” because he espoused open sex and freedom from inhibitions. He initiated his disciplines into “neo- sannyas ” that did not require the total renunciation of tra- ditional Hindu sannyas. Men were given the title Swami and women were called Ma. He favored dismantling the nuclear family and wanted it replaced with alternate forms of community and methods of child care. Prior to 1985, disciples wore red robes and a mala (necklace) of 108 beads with a picture of Rajneesh attached. The movement at its peak claimed about 200,000 members and 600 centers around the world. It was targeted by anticult groups as an evil organization bent on mind control. Before his death, Osho appointed a group of 21 individuals to administer the meditation resort in Poona and the organization. They now operate 20 meditation centers worldwide and publish the On Line Osho Times newsletter. The current organization, Osho International, sponsors a number of Web sites and local communities.

Rakshabandhan (Rakhibandhan) The Raksabandhan festival, which takes place on the full Moon of the lunar month of Shravana (July–August), is one of the most popular in India. On this day sisters tie an amulet of red or yellow threads on their brother’s wrists to guard them for the year. If they are more learned, they may utter a well-known S ANSKRIT MANTRA . The brothers then offer them presents. The observance is said to have originated after I NDRA , king of the gods, was defeated in battle by the asuras, or antigods. It is said that he was able to regain his sovereignty when his wife, Shaci, put an amulet on his hand after performing some austerities. Further reading: Stanley A. Freed and Ruth S.

Rama’s full story is told in the R AMAYANA epic. In that famous epic, the gods ask Vishnu to incarnate in the world as a man, in order to kill the demon Ravana, who was tormenting all the worlds. Ravana has a boon that he cannot be killed by any god or demon, but, in his arrogance, he never imagines he can be killed by a human. Thus the avatar of Rama is arranged. Rama is born to Dasharatha, king of A YODHYA , and his wife, Kaushalya. In his youth Rama is sent to the sage Vishvamitra’s hermitage to help defend it from beings who are trying to disrupt the sacred Vedic rites. There he slays the female being Tataka who was tormenting the sages. He receives certain celestial weapons and is obliged to kill the demons Marica and Subahu. Rama later wins a contest to bend the bow of S HIVA ; as his prize he wins the hand of S ITA , daughter of the king of V IDEHA . In Ayodhya another wife of Dasharatha, Kaikeyi, plots to have her son, Bharata, put on the throne in place of Rama. As a result Rama is forced into exile for 14 years.

Making friends with a group of monkeys, including the faithful H ANUMAN , Rama carries out his divine duty in defeating Ravana and winning back his wife. When he doubts her faithfulness, Sita passes a trial by fire. She is taken back, and the rule of Rama begins in all its perfection. Some versions of the Ramayana, such as the Kambaramayanam in Tamil, end at this point. In other versions the story continues. New questions are raised concerning Sita’s faithful- ness, and Rama has his brother Lakshmana take her to the forest. He does not realize that she is pregnant with twins. Rama’s sons Kusha and Lava are born in the forest ASHRAM of Valmiki. Eventu- ally, they end up in a war with Rama’s troops and defeat them. At this point Rama realizes he has sons and wants Sita to return to live with him. She goes before him and in disgust at her two rejections asks the Earth to swallow her up. Rama continues his just rule and dies, as all avatars must, being human forms of the divinity. Rama is worshipped throughout India and celebrated in regional folklore and high culture alike. Sita is always included, and Hanuman and Lakshmana are rarely omitted in any iconographic or pictorial presentation. Further reading: Ashok K.

Ramacharaka, Yogi (1862–1932) yoga popularizer The American-born Yogi Ramacharaka was a popular author in the New Thought movement in the United States. He later became the first major popularizer of Hindu thought in America. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, to William and Emma Atkinson, William Walker Atkinson was an important and influential figure in the early days of the New Thought movement, which included a number of religious organizations devoted to the application of metaphysical principles to healing. He married Margaret Foster Black of Beverley, New Jersey, in 1889 and they had two children. He pursued a business career from 1882 onward, and in 1894 he was admitted as an attorney to the Pennsylvania Bar. The pressures of his profession caused a complete physical and mental breakdown and financial disaster. He sought healing, and in the late 1880s, he discovered New Thought, through which he attained health, mental vigor, and prosperity. By the early 1890s Chicago had become a major center for New Thought, mainly through the work of Emma Curtis Hopkins, and Atkinson decided to move there, where he became an active promoter of the movement as an editor and author. In 1889 Atkinson’s article “A Mental Science Catechism” appeared in Charles Fillmore’s new periodical, Modern Thought. In 1900, he became editor of Suggestion, a New Thought periodical, and he continued to write for and edit another periodical, New Thought. He founded a Psychic Club and the Atkinson School of Mental Science and became a prominent metaphysical writer, publishing ten books on psychic, occult, and New Thought topics between 1901 and 1911. His Mental Science included lessons in personal mag- netism, psychic influence, thought-force, concen- tration, will-power, and practical Mental Science.

He met a pupil of the late Yogi Ramacharaka, Baba B HARATI , who had become acquainted with Atkinson’s writ- ings. Atkinson and Bharati shared similar ideas. They collaborated, and with Bharati providing the material and Atkinson the writing talent, they wrote a series of books, which they attributed to Yogi Ramacharaka as a measure of their respect. Begin- ning in 1903, Atkinson eventually wrote 13 books under this pseudonym. All the titles were published by the Yogi Publication Society in Chicago; they reached a wider audience than Atkinson’s New Thought works ever had. All of his books on yoga are still in print; their continued popularity is a credit to both Baba Bharati and Atkinson. Under the name Yogi Ramacharaka, Atkinson became the first popularizer of Hindu thought and practice in the United States. He also continued his career as an attorney, being admitted to the Illinois Bar in 1903, and he continued to write well-received books on New Thought. In 1916 he began writing articles for Elizabeth Towne’s magazine The Nautilus, and from 1916 to 1919 he edited the journal Advanced Thought. For a time he was honorary president of the International New Thought Alliance. William Walker Atkinson died on November 22, 1932, in California.

Sri Ramakrishna was born on February 18, 1836, as Gadadhar Chattopadhyay to a poor Bengali B RAHMIN family. He had his first spiritual experience at the age of six or seven and entered into trancelike states throughout his childhood. He neglected his studies, preferring to spend his time in solitary MEDITATION , singing, and perform- ing of Hindu stories. For much of his life he served as priest at the K ALI Temple at Dakshinesh- war near Calcutta, living a life of renunciation, but he stopped performing priestly functions when the “divine madness” took over his con- scious awareness.

He remained devoted to the goddess Kali throughout his life, and he was also initiated into tantric practice ( see TANTRISM ). His teacher Tota Puri taught him ADVAITA V EDANTA and the practice of absorption in the formless, which he quickly achieved. His whole life was an uninterrupted contemplation and union with God. His life and teaching appeal to seekers in all religions, as he taught that the revelation of God can take place at all times and that God-realization is not the monopoly of any one religion or faith. He took up various disciplines associated with other religions, specifically Christianity and Islam, and taught that all paths lead to the same God-realization. His message of the harmony of religions was based on unity in diversity and a fellowship of religions based on their common goal of God-conscious- ness. Sri Ramakrishna died on August 16, 1886. His famous disciple Swami Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math and Mission at Belur Math, near Calcutta (Kolkata) to propa- gate the teachings of his guru. Sarada Devi, his widow, also began to assert the leadership role that Ramakrishna had specified for her, and she became known as the mother of the movement that Ramakrishna inspired. These missions offer spiritual, medical, and educational services to the people of India. Outside India, in 18 countries on five continents, the same organization is known as the Vedanta Society and is headed by swamis initiated and trained at Belur Math.

Ramana Maharshi (1879–1950) advaita Vedanta teacher and mystic Ramana Maharshi was a GURU of international renown from southern India who taught the non- dual philosophy of ADVAITA V EDANTA . Ramana was born on December 30, 1879, as Venkataraman Ayyar at Tiruchuli near Madurai Ramana Maharshi (1879–1950), widely recognized teacher, mystic, and foremost exemplar of advaita (non- dual) consciousness (Courtesy Sri Ramanashramam, Tiruvan- namalai, Tamil Nadu) K 350 Ramakrishna Math and Mission 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 350 12/14/06 9:29:18 AM"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"in the state of Tamil Nadu. He was the son of Shundaram Ayyar, a scribe and country lawyer. The family was religious, giving ritual offerings to the family deity and visiting temples. As a child, Ramana was largely uninterested in school; throughout his life he showed a marked inclina- tion toward introspection and self-analysis. In 1896, at age 17 he entered an altered state of consciousness that had a profound effect on him. He experienced what he understood to be his own death and return to life. Without any training by a teacher or any personal discipline, he attained a profound experience of the true Self and real- ized that the body dies but consciousness is not touched by death. He saw the real “I” as immortal consciousness, as a powerful living truth experi- enced directly. Thereafter, all attention was drawn to this “I” or Self and he remained conscious of his identity with the absolute at all times. All fear of death was permanently extinguished. Ramana ran away from home to the holy mountain Arunachala near Tiruvannamalai. He spent 10 years in silent Self-absorption at the temple there, at the foot of the mountain, and in various caves on the mountain. Throughout these years he remained silent and maintained disciplines of spiritual purification and nonattach- ment. Against the pleas of his family, he refused to return home. His absorption in higher conscious- ness was so deep that he neglected care of his body and was at times famished and chewed by insects. Disciples began to gather around him to take care of his physical needs and to gain aware- ness of his non-dual state of consciousness. His disciples gave him sacred books, and he became conversant with the religious traditions of South India. When Ramana broke his silence, he responded to questions about Self-consciousness. His teach- ing was given largely through conversations with guests who visited him on the mountain, where his ASHRAM began to develop. His advice to those who sought SELF - REALIZATION was to direct them to the question “Who am I?”—a self-inquiry that he insisted be used tirelessly as each student discov- ered deeper and deeper levels of awareness. The aim of this inquiry was for each person to find an awareness of non-duality, in which the oneness of the Self and cosmos could be perceived. He taught that a person who is not attached to the results of action can live in the world as an actor who plays a role in a drama but is immune to emotional dis- turbance, because the person realizes that action is only play acting on the stage of life. Ramana remained at Arunachala for the dura- tion of his life, welcoming visitors from East and West, while becoming a living example of non- dual consciousness. He died there of cancer on April 14, 1950, sitting in a lotus position. The Ramanashramam exists today as a sanctu- ary that houses Ramana’s grave, his cave residence, and accommodation for many visitors.

Rama Navami Rama Navami is a special day of worship of Lord R AMA . It takes place on the ninth day of the bright half of the lunar month Chaitra (April–May), considered the birthday of Lord R AMA ; he was born at noon. All devotees of Rama must perform this worship, and others may do it optionally. It is accompanied by a vow of fasting beginning the previous night. If one performs the veneration properly, one is said to have one’s sins destroyed and may even acquire MOKSHA or release from birth and rebirth. Rama Navami is a popular observance. After a night of fasting, the following day the devotee Rama Navami 351 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 351 12/14/06 9:29:18 AM"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"performs worship before an image of Rama and makes a fire offering for Rama in a small specially created shrine; the celebration continues with a japa, or repetition of the MANTRA to Rama, the sec- ond night. Once the observance is complete the image is given to a learned B RAHMIN . Only the most orthodox perform the full ritual these days. It is, however, observed en masse in places significant for Rama such as A YODHYA and Rameshvaram. Further reading: C. J.

Ramanuja (Ramanujacharya) (1077– 1157 C . E .) (dated by his tradition from 1017 to 1137) philosopher of Vedanta Ramanuja was the founder of the philosophical school known as Vishistadvaita or “special non- dualism.” Ramanuja was born in the city of K ANCHI - PURAM near present-day Chennai (Madras). His father was a Vedic B RAHMIN who was known as a brilliant student of the S ANSKRIT scriptures. His first GURU , Yadava Prakasha, had a system that was not to the liking of this student genius. It soon became clear that he would develop his own system, which would challenge that of his teacher. Ramanuja’s guru is said to have arranged to have him killed, while luring him on a PILGRIMAGE to the holy city of B ENARES (Varanasi) on the G ANGES . Ramanuja was miraculously saved and eventually his guru bowed to his feet and accepted Ramunuja himself as his teacher. Ramanuja’s system of V EDANTA combines the view of a unitary divinity found in the U PANISHADS with the theism of later Hinduism. For Ramanuja the divinity is endowed with innumerable auspi- cious attributes, as opposed to the view of S HAN - KARA , who saw the ultimate reality or BRAHMAN as completely beyond characteristics or char- acterization. Where as Shankara’s brahman was an inert, transcendental reality upon which the world was lain as a false conception, Ramanuja’s brahman was the Lord V ISNHU , who was the soul to the universe, which was seen as his body. Along with many philosophic works in San- skrit, Ramanuja wrote incisive Sanskrit commen- taries on the B RAHMA S UTRAS and the B HAGAVAD G ITA in his effort to refute the earlier and well-accepted school of Shankara. In his work, he validated the mystical vision of the Vaishnavite saints of Tamil Nadu, the A LVARS , whose Tamil songs were later collected as the main text for Tamil Vaishnavites, the Nalayiradivyaprabandham. The movement in India that follows the teach- ings of Ramanuja and the Alvars is known as Sri Vaishnavism. It is a tradition of temple worship, in which both Tamil and Sanskrit scriptures are recited in the temples. The most important site for this tradition is the temple to Lord Ranganatha (Vishnu) at Shrirangam in Tamil Nadu. There is a secondary shrine in the smaller community of Sri Vaishnavites at Melkote in Karnataka.

Rama Tirtha, Swami (1873–1906) devotee of Krishna and Vedanta philosophy In his brief life, Swami Rama Tirtha managed to spread the teaching of Vedanta philosophy and spirituality in India and around the world. Gossain Tirtha Rama was born at Murari- wala, a village in the district of Gujranwala in K 352 Ramanuja 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 352 12/14/06 9:29:18 AM"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"the Punjab, to a family of Gosain B RAHMINS , distant descendants of the famous author of the R AMAYANA , Gosain T ULSIDAS . When he was only a few days old his mother died and young Rama was reared by his father, his aunt, and his elder brother, Gossain Gurudas. Throughout his child- hood he demonstrated unusual intelligence, a contemplative nature, and a love of solitude. He listened to recitations of scripture and discussed spiritual topics with religious teachers. At age 10, Rama was put under the care of his father’s friend Bhakta Dhana Rama, a teacher who taught sim- plicity and purity to the young Rama. A good student, Rama demonstrated a love of mathematics and achieved high marks at the undergraduate and master’s levels. After complet- ing college, he served as professor of mathematics at Forman Christian College in Lahore and, for a short time, reader at Lahore Oriental College. He began to read the B HAGAVAD G ITA and became an ardent devotee ( bhakta ) of Lord K RISHNA . He could read Persian, English, Hindi, Urdu, and S ANSKRIT literature. He studied V EDANTA with Sri Madhava Tirtha of the Dwaraka Math. His meeting with the famous Swami V IVEKANANDA in Lahore was decisive in turning Rama toward the vow of SANNYAS (renunciation) and wearing of the ochre robe. In 1900, he went to Brahmapuri, on the banks of the G ANGES near R ISHIKESH in the foothills of the Himalayas, to become a forest dweller with his wife, his two children, and a few others. Because of ill health, his wife soon left the forest with one of the children. In the forest, he real- ized the all-inclusive bliss of SATCHITANANDA , or SELF - REALIZATION . Then he returned to the plains to teach Vedanta. He traveled to Japan, America, and Egypt and spent a year and a half in San Francisco, where he founded the Hermetic Broth- erhood, dedicated to the study of Vedanta. In St. Louis, he spoke at the Religious League of the St. Louis Exhibition. Hailed as a torch of divine knowledge, he lectured in Christian churches all over the United States. On his return to India, he continued to teach in the plains, but his health grew worse. He returned to the Himalayas and took residence at Vasishtha Ashram, where he died at age 33 on the banks of the Ganges River on October 17, 1906. Considered a saint of modern India, Swami Rama taught the oneness and all-pervasive nature of God. He began as a devotee of BHAKTI YOGA , devoted to the image of Krishna, but he became more and more an ascetic and mystic who expe- rienced the non-dual nature of reality consistent with Vedanta. Under the guidance of a direct disciple of Swami Rama, Sri R. S. Narayana Swami, the Rama Tirtha Publication League was established in Lucknow; it has published most of Swami Rama’s writings in several volumes.

It was composed originally in S ANSKRIT in an epic of about 25,000 verses. The author, V ALMIKI , is called the “first poet” of India and the Rama- yana is considered the first long poem composed by humans (as opposed to the V EDAS , which are much older and are considered to be eternal and uncreated). The S ANSKRIT Ramayana dates to 600 to 400 B . C . E . Told in seven chapters, the story is in brief as follows: the gods ask V ISHNU to take a human incarnation in order to fight the demon king R AVA N A , who gained powers by extreme aus- terities and cannot be defeated by a god. Vishnu agrees to incarnate as R AMA . Rama is born to King Dasharatha and his wife, Kaushalya. Dasharatha Ramayana 353 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 353 12/14/06 9:29:18 AM"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"has three other sons: Bharata, Lakshmana, and Shatrughna. While Dasharatha is joyfully preparing to retire from the world and leave the kingdom to his virtuous oldest son Rama, a second wife of his, Kaikeyi, demands, as the fulfillment of a boon he had given her, that her own son, Bharata, be raised to the throne and that Rama be exiled in the forest for 14 years. Dasharatha, true to his word, must grant her wish, but he dies soon after of a broken heart. Rama, the most obedient of sons, accepts his father’s request with equanimity and prepares to go to the forest. Lakshmana, his younger brother, will go with him. Sita, his wife, is asked to stay behind, as travel in the forest will involve great travail, but she argues strongly that she wants to be at her husband’s side. Rama relents and allows her to go with him. As they enter the forest, they are found by Bharata. Bharata insists he has no desire for the kingdom and asks that Rama give him his sandals to put on the throne during his absence, as a sign that it is Rama who is king. Wandering in the forest, Rama and Lakshmana meet Shurpanakha, sister of the demon king Ravana. She becomes smitten with Rama and changes her horrific form into that of a beautiful maiden. Rama sees through Shurpanakha’s guise, but to play a joke on his brother he tells her that while he himself is married, Lakshmana is not. When she approaches Lakshmana with passion, Lakshmana enters into the joke by sending her back to Rama, saying he is unworthy of her. Shur- panakha then returns to Rama and jealously tries to kill Sita. At this Lakshmana cuts off her nose and ears. Eventually, Surpanakha persuades her brother Ravana to try to steal Sita away from Rama. Ravana has the demon Maricha take the form of a golden deer. When Rama chases after the deer, by means of ruses Ravana carries off Sita in his flying chariot and takes her to his island kingdom of Lanka. In a frantic search for Sita, Rama and Lak- shmana befriend the monkey Sugriva and his friends, including the virtuous and faithful H ANUMAN . Hanuman is sent to Lanka to recon- noiter. He finds Sita but is caught by the demon Rakshasas. They put a cloth on his tail and set it afire, but he escapes and burns Lanka by jump- ing from building to building with his tail in flames. Hanuman returns to Rama, and they make a plan to defeat Ravana and his demon hordes and get Sita back. They are successful and Sita returns, but Rama and others question her fidelity. She offers to undergo a trial by fire, passes the test, and joins Rama on the throne. The last and final chapter, omitted in some vernacular versions, tells of the origin of the rakshasas, the demon hordes, and the history of Ravana. It also tells of Hanuman’s childhood and other diverse tales. Sita’s faithfulness, however, is once more questioned. Sita is forced to flee to the forest while preg- nant with Rama’s two sons. She goes to live at the ashram of none other than Valmiki himself, the author of the R AMAYANA story. Some years later, while Rama is conducting an ashva medha ( HORSE SACRIFICE ), Valmiki arrives with his two disciples, Kusha and Lava, the sons of Rama. They recite the Ramayana story for Rama and he learns of their existence. He calls Sita back to court, where she admonishes him and asks the Earth to swallow her up rather than that she return to a husband who has wronged her. The Ramayana story is an ocean from which a vast array of stories, myths, plays, and celebrations have emerged in Sanskrit and every vernacular. It is one of the central narratives of Indian culture; every region of the country has a variety of sites for pilgrimage and visitation that are connected to its characters—Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, and the others. Celebrated versions of the Ramayana have been written in nearly every Indian language, including the Islamic-associated Urdu.

Numerous Sanskrit versions of the story have also been com- posed, including the Adhyatma Ramayana and Yogavasishtha Ramayana. Tales in Sanskrit about the Rama dynasty both before and after the events in the Rama- yana have proliferated, such as Raghuvamsha and Uttararamacharita. The Jains as well tell stories of Rama, Ravana, and other characters from the Ramayana in Sanskrit and other lan- guages. Every year in northern India the Ram Lila festival is celebrated, culminating in a grand burning of the effigies of Ravana, his son, and his brother. The Ramayana story also traveled widely out- side India. Thai and Indonesian versions are still popular. Further reading: S. P.

Ram Chandra, Sri Maharaj (1899–1983) teacher of raja yoga The boy who became Sri Ram Chandra later in life was born in Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh state on April 30, 1899, into a B RAHMIN fam- ily. Following in the footsteps of his scholarly father he began his education with a particular interest in philosophy, literature, and geography. Reports indicated that he was not an outstand- ing scholar but could hold his own intellectu- ally. He joined the judicial services, married, and raised children. On July 3, 1922, he sought out Guru Sri Ram Chandra of Fategarh, who preserved and followed an ancient form of yoga called Pranahuti (divine transmission), which the younger Ram Chandra perceived to be superior to the newer methods. He himself had been practicing a form of PRANAYAMA or breathing technique for the previous seven years, but he abandoned this and adopted the spiritual practices of his new guru, who died in 1931. Sri Ram Chandra felt that he had absorbed the teachings from his spiritual leader and was quali- fied to carry on his inspiration. He believed that he and his guru had spiritually merged. In 1932, he received a powerful transmission of spiritual energy from his guru. In 1944, he had a vision of white light that revealed Lord K RISHNA ’s true nature. He knew that his mission was to carry on the work of his master. Sri Ram Chandra founded the Sri Ram Chan- dra Mission in 1945 in honor of his guru and in 1976 built an ashram in Shahjahanpur. Through- out these years he taught raja yoga and gave spiri- tual guidance to many. Sri Ram Chandra Maharaj died on April 19, 1983, after many years of service to raja yoga. The lineage is preserved through his disciple Sri Par- thasarathi Rajagopalachari of Madras (Chennai), who assumed the mantle at his bedside and is now the president of Sri Ram Chandra Mission. He is affectionately known as “Chariji.” Ram Chandra, Sri Maharaj 355 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 355 12/14/06 9:29:19 AM"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"Further reading: Sri Ram Chandra, Complete Works of Ram Chandra, Vol. 1 (Pacific Grove, Calif.: Sri Ram Chandra Mission, 1989); ———, Down Memory Lane, Vol. 1 (Shahjahanpur: Sri Ram Chandra Mission, 1993); ———, Truth Eternal (Shahjahanpur: Sri Ram Chandra Mission, 1986). Ram Das See S IKHISM . Ramdas, Swami (1884–1963) devotee of Ram and founder of Ananda Ashram The child Vittal Rao was born in 1884 at Hosdrug, in the South Indian state of Kerala, to a devout couple, Sri Balakrishna Rao and Srimata Lalita Bai. As a child, he exhibited an extraordinary luster in his eyes and considerable wit. Largely unin- terested in formal schooling, he completed high school but did not pursue higher education. With his marriage in 1908 he became a householder, and he remained so until age 36. As a young hus- band and father, he vacillated between periods of employment as a spinning master in a cotton mill and periods of unemployment and idleness. In 1920, in response to a number of trials and challenges in his worldly life, he began to inquire into the meaning of life and to chant the name of God, R AM . An intense spiritual transforma- tion occurred: he realized the futility of worldly pursuits and the higher need for everlasting peace and happiness. He became convinced that God alone can give eternal peace and happiness. He decided on a life of self-surrender, as attachments to family, friends, and business dropped away. At that time, his father gave him the Ram MANTRA , Om Sri Ram Jai Ram Jai Jai Ram, to recite, and his detachment from worldly pursuits increased as the mantra took a place in his life. He then renounced the life of the world and became a wandering mendicant, a SADHU . He began his life of pilgrimage in December 1922, vowing to accept everything that happened as proceeding from the will of Ram alone. At Srirangam, he bathed in the C AUVERY R IVER and offered up his old white clothes to the river. He donned the ochre robes of a SANNYASI and took the name Ramdas. He never referred to himself in the first person again. In 1922, he met the sage of Arunachala moun- tain, R AMANA M AHARSHI , and spent 20 days near Ramana in a cave there, chanting his mantra. He emerged from the cave and saw a strange light with a landscape completely changed: everything was Ram. In 1931, after his years of traveling in faith, his devotees established Anandashram for him in Kanhangad, Kerala, where he lived with Mother K RISHNABAI , a realized saint of South India. Together they worked to improve the living con- ditions of the local people, founded a children’s school, established a medical clinic, and formed a cooperative for weavers. They toured India together and conducted a world tour in 1954–55, with the purpose of sharing a message of universal love and service. Swami Ramdas died on August 2, 1963. Ramdas wrote many books, all currently in print.

He drew wide public attention to yoga and Hindu spirituality and has continued his teachings since.

Richard grew up on the New Hampshire estate of his father. A student of psychology, Alpert received a B.A. degree in 1952 from Tufts University, an M.A. from Wesleyan University in 1954, and a Ph.D. in 1957 from Stanford University. From 1958 to 1963, Alpert taught and conducted research at the Department of Social Relations and the Graduate School of Education at Har- vard University. In 1961, he first took psilocy- bin with his Harvard colleague Timothy Leary (1920–96) and became an integral part in the Harvard Psilocybin Project. With Leary and Ralph Metzner, he wrote The Psychedelic Experi- ence, a recapitulation of the Tibetan Book of the Dead intended to be a manual for establishing an appropriate setting for experiencing psychedelic drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, mescaline, and dimethyltryptamine (DMT). While at Harvard, Alpert began research into human consciousness and, with Timothy Leary, Aldous Huxley, Allen Ginsberg, and others, conducted research into LSD and other psyche- delics. Because of the controversial nature of this research, Alpert and Leary were dismissed from their teaching positions at Harvard in 1963. Alpert continued his collaboration with Leary on psychedelics. He became involved with attempts to realize a utopia as presented in Island by Aldous Huxley, and the Glass Bead Game by Hermann Hesse. He participated in utopian orga- nizations, including the Zihuatanejo Project and the International Foundation for Internal Free- dom. During the mid-1960s he lived for a while at the Millbrook estate in New York, a center for psychedelic religion, together with Leary and Swami Abhayananda (Bill Haines). In 1967, he traveled to India, where he met Baba H ARI D ASS (b. 1923) and N EEM K AROLI B ABA (d. 1973), both noted gurus who provided dis- ciplined study on a spiritual path. They became role models for him and he replaced his attraction for drugs with a higher spiritual calling induced through MEDITATION and yoga. Neem Karoli Baba, also called Maharaji, gave Alpert his spiritual name Ram Dass (servant of God) and taught him raja yoga, a form of yoga that utilizes meditation as the primary means of moving from mundane reality to the invisible supersensible world of higher consciousness ( SAMADHI ). Ram Dass says that Neem Karoli allowed him for the first time to see his life in spiritual terms. Overall, he spent nearly two years with Neem Karoli before Neem Karoli’s death in 1973. His Miracle of Love is a collection of stories about Neem Karoli, from the homely to the miraculous.

Upon returning to the United States, Ram Dass wrote his most famous book, Be Here Now (1971), which suggested that one can live only in the present moment. The past has vanished into his- tory and the future is not yet here. In order to be fully present in one’s life, Ram Dass advocated the simple proposition of residing in and being aware of the present moment and position in the world. Ram Dass believes that all people are on a spiritual path to enlightenment. Each has individual needs, including GURUS (teachers) of different kinds; some gurus may not be in the physical body, but meditation allows one access to the invisible world and communication with those gurus who no longer have a physical body. His book offered an alternative to psychedelics in his emphasis on gurus and spiritual pathways to guide one out of immersion in the drug culture. Be Here Now pro- pelled Ram Dass into a role as a major teacher of the New Age counterculture and remains in print to the present time. In the 1970s, Ram Dass took on a vigorous schedule of speaking, teaching, and traveling from his base in New Hampshire. Various orga- nizations emerged around his many interests. For example, he and Bo Lozoff developed the Prison Ashram Library, which distributed literature to prison populations. It particularly taught lessons in meditation for inmates who wanted to live a life of service while incarcerated. This service has grown to include halfway houses and mental health programs. In the mid-1970s, Ram Dass had become involved with several female gurus—Hilda Charl- ton (d. 1988) and Joya Santana (now known as Ma J AYA S AT I B HAGAVATI of the Kashi Ashram). His interaction with them led to a spiritual crisis that he discussed in a famous Yoga Journal article, “Egg on My Beard.” He assumed a low profile for a brief period but soon reemerged as a major writer and speaker. Before the decade was out, he had produced three important books: The Only Dance There Is (1976), Grist for the Mill (1977), and Jour- ney of Awakening (1978). Ram Dass instituted the Hanuman Temple in Taos, New Mexico, to implement worship of H ANUMAN , the god of service, and to honor his guru, Neem Karoli Baba. In pursuit of the goals of KARMA YOGA , Ram Dass initiated several organizations devoted to service and community development. In 1974, he organized the H ANUMAN F OUNDATION inspired by the devoted servant of the Hindu god R AM in the R AMAYANA , which is the organizing vehicle for Ram Dass’s lectures and workshops and admin- isters many social projects, including the Prison Ashram Project, designed to help inmates grow spiritually during incarceration, and the Liv- ing Dying Project, designed to foster conscious dying. He is cofounder, with Larry Brilliant (b. 1946), and board member of the Seva Foundation, an international organization dedicated to relieving suffering in the world ( seva means “service” in S ANSKRIT ). Seva sponsors diverse activities, includ- ing programs in India and Nepal to erase curable blindness, Guatemalan programs to restore the agricultural life of impoverished villagers, and programs in the United States to call attention to the issues of homelessness and environmental degradation. On February 19, 1997, Ram Dass suffered a massive cerebral hemorrhagic stroke in his left brain. The stroke left him with extensive right side paralysis, expressive aphasia, and a number of recurring and threatening health problems. Since this event he has returned to a limited schedule of appearances and talks. He lives in San Anselmo, California, and Hawaii. Mickey Lemle’s documentary Ram Dass: Fierce Grace documents the biography of Ram Dass through friends’ and family members’ reminis- cences and archival footage of his days of commu- nal living. It shows the physical and psychological effects of the stroke and the spiritual lessons he has learned from his disability.

Rameshvaram Rameshvaram is an island off the coast of Tamil Nadu whose name, “Rama the god,” indicates its sacred status. It is told in the R AMAYANA that Lord R AMA , wishing to purify himself after kill- ing his enemy, the demon king R AVANA , stopped at Rameshvaram. He sent H ANUMAN , the monkey god, to B ENARES (Varanasi) to get a S HIVA L INGAM for him to worship. While Hanuman was gone, Rama’s wife, S ITA made a lingam out of sand and began to worship it. When Hanuman returned, Rama ordered him to get rid of the sand lingam and install his own. Hanuman could not dislodge the lingam created by Sita. The second lingam then was set up beside the first so that both could be worshipped. Rameshvaram is one of the most visited PIL - GRIMAGE sites in India and is accepted in Hindu- ism as one of the four major sites in India to visit (along with B ADRINATH , Puri, and D WARAKA ). The main temple on the island is dedicated to Shiva and is said to have been established by Rama himself. Historically, the present temple bears the architecture of the seventh through 13th centuries. There are a number of sacred places on the island associated with Rama, including the spot from which Rama allegedly shot his bow to destroy the bridge to Lanka after the war.

Ramsuratkumar, Yogi (1918–2001) enlightened yogi from South India The revered South Indian beggar saint Yogi Ramsu- ratkumar attracted a large following through his ascetic piety and God-intoxication. Ramsurat Kunwar was born on December 1, 1918, in a small village on the G ANGES River five miles from B ENARES (Varanasi) in Uttar Pradesh. The son of a devout rural B RAHMIN family, he was a natural mystic and brilliant student, who gradu- ated from Ewing Christian College in A LLAHABAD with a B.A. in English literature in 1939. Pres- sured by his family to assume the responsibilities of family life, he was married in 1938. For some years he taught high school English in Bihar state, but he was consumed by a passionate longing for the divine that finally compelled him to make, in 1947, the first of many trips to South India to search for his GURU . Yogi Ramsuratkumar said he had three “spiri- tual fathers” who initiated him into the spiritual path: Sri A UROBINDO , R AMANA M AHARSHI , and Swami (Papa) R AMDAS . After the deaths of the first two, Ramsurat returned to Swami Ramdas at Anandash- ram in 1952. At that time Ramdas initiated him Ramsuratkumar, Yogi 359 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 359 12/14/06 9:29:19 AM"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"into the MANTRA , Om Sri Ram Jai Ram Jai Jai Ram; after a week of repeating the mantra, Ramsurat was permanently cast into a state of God-intoxica- tion. Referring to this permanent annihilation of his personal identity in the divine, he often said, “In 1952 Ramdas killed this beggar; this beggar is no more.” Swami Ramdas sent Ramsurat Kunwar away from Anandashram, telling him, “You cannot live in the ashram. . . . Remember, under a big tree, another big tree cannot grow. Go and beg.” A divine madness similar to that of Sri C HAITANYA had taken over Ramsurat Kunwar, and at the cost of great personal anguish, he was compelled to enter the life of a wandering mendicant beggar. For seven years (1952–59) he traveled throughout India, finally arriving in 1959 at the foot of holy Mount Arunachala in Tiruvannamalai, where he lived for the remainder of his life. Ramsurat would often visit Ramanashram, the ashram of Ramana Maharshi. One of Ramana Maharshi’s senior disciples, T. K. Sundaresan Iyer, recognized the divine state of the unusual 40-year-old beggar and gave him the name Yogi Ramsuratkumar. For many years Yogi Ramsurat- kumar was a “hidden saint,” living on the streets of Tiruvannamalai and subsisting entirely on the food and clothing that were given to him by local people who recognized his radiance and sanctity. The sublime countenance of the beggar yogi, his spontaneous outbursts—ecstatic song, chanting of the name of God, and blessing of all who were drawn to him—began to capture the hearts of seekers. By 1980 he had become widely recog- nized by countless numbers of people, including the American spiritual teacher Lee L OZOWICK , who became an ardent disciple. In 1994 the Yogi Ramsuratkumar Ashram at Tiruvannamalai was built by his devotees. Dressed in the ragged shawls and stained dhotis of a beg- gar, with nothing but a country palm fan and coconut bowl, Yogi Ramsuratkumar gave DARSHAN twice a day in the temple of his ashram from 1994 through 2001. He did not teach by linear dis- course, but through transmission of divine pres- ence, instructing his disciples to repeat the name of God, using his name, Yogi Ramsuratkumar, as a mantra to invoke divine blessings. His vision of the unity of all life was often given in his words “My Father alone exists! There is nothing else, nobody else—past, present, future—here, there, everywhere, anywhere! Today, darshan, chanting, Vedic rituals, and celebrations are regularly observed at the Yogi Ramsuratkumar Ashram. The mahasamadhi (tomb) of Yogi Ramsuratkumar is housed there. Farther south, a temple complex dedicated to Yogi Ramsuratkumar is situated near the ocean at Kanya Kumari in the small village of Kanimadam. Completed in 1993, this temple conducts daily BHAJANS , worship, and Vedic rituals. Lee Lozowick has established ashrams in the United States, France, and India where the name of Yogi Ramsuratkumar is chanted. Yogi Ramsuratkumar died on February 20, 2001.

Literally, rasa is the taste, savor, or essence of something. In aesthetics rasa is the essential sentiment embedded in a work of art that evokes a corresponding emotion in the reader, listener, or viewer. Works of art are often classified according to their predominant rasa. The literature variously lists eight to 11 of them. The most common listed are 10: shringara (love), hasya (mirth), karuna (pity), raudra (anger), vira (heroism), bhayanaka (fear), bibhatsa (disgust), and adbhuta (won- der); some add shanta (tranquillity) and vatsalya (parental fondness).

Krishna stood at the center of the circle and multiplied himself so that he could dance individually with each of them. Devotees of Krishna understand this dance as a metaphor for the relationship between God and the individual soul. God is complete and isolated unto himself, while also residing inti- mately at the center of everyone’s soul. Further reading: Graham M.

Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh (RSS) (est. 1925) The Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh (National Volunteer Corps) was for decades the most impor- tant organization advocating cultural and political H INDU NATIONALISM . It still wields influence and has been involved in a number of violent disputes with ethnic or religious minorities. The RSS was first formed in 1925, but the movement has its origins in the ideology of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, who was convicted of murder- ing several British officials at the turn of the 20th century. Tilak had been influenced by the reform- ist goals of the reformer Rammohun R OY , but not by the liberal means that Roy championed. The RSS was formed as a cultural and social organization, whose goal was to transform India from a secular state into a Hindu nation. Some call it “Hindu fundamentalist,” but in actuality the ideology of Hindutva, or Hinduness, only relates to certain aspects of Hinduism. For example, while the RSS extols many of the achievements of the Indian past, its doctrines are not based on the four V EDAS , the most ancient Hindu sacred texts. The RSS has argued that India fell under British rule because it lacked discipline and aggressive- ness. It promotes a hypernationalistic, militaristic agenda seeking the expulsion of Muslims and the establishment of Hindu supremacy in India. RSS rejects the pluralism found in traditional Hinduism. Instead, it has a goal of creating a sin- gle Hindu doctrine for India. It also wants to elim- inate Islam and opposes Buddhism and J AINISM . It opposes preferences that the Indian government has extended to the lower CASTES ; some of its sup- port can be attributed to a reaction by higher-caste Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh 361 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 361 12/14/06 9:29:20 AM"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"Hindus to the government’s equalization policy. In fact, its supporters generally are from the upper castes. While they criticize the distortions of the caste system (which they blame on Muslim influ- ence), critics believe they really want to return to a time when caste was rigidly enforced. RSS members conduct daily drills of martial arts wearing khaki uniforms, mimicking the Ital- ian and German fascists they have long admired. Their disciplined members are often the first to arrive at the site of natural disasters, a practice that earns them support. The women’s wing of the RSS is the Rashtriya Sevika Samiti; its structure is not unlike the male sections. The political wing of the RSS is the B HARATIYA J ANATA P ARTY . It was founded in 1951 on a plat- form of an undivided India and aimed to unify all Hindus under a single doctrine, whereas in the past Hindus have tolerated a wide diversity of thought, and has rejected what it sees as European influences on modern Hindu thought and prac- tice. At first it also rejected industrialization, but that orientation was eventually discarded. During the 1940s M. S. Golwalker transformed the RSS into the most powerful of all the national- ist movements in India. Their influence expanded over time through missionary work. In February 1983 the RSS was implicated with nationalists and local police in Assam in a massacre of Muslim immigrants. The rioters also killed local Hindus who coexisted with the Moslems. The RSS was also involved, along with the S HIV S ENA movement and Bharatiya Janata Party, in the controversy that arose around the Babri Masjid Mosque in the Uttar Pradesh city of A YODHYA . This mosque was built in 1528 on a site that is believed to be the birthplace of R AMA , the AVATA R of V ISHNU . As early as the 1940s RSS members managed to erect an image of Rama in the mosque. Later the government sealed off the mosque to try to dampen the dispute. In the 1980s, the RSS started to protest the very existence of the Babri Mosque. Lal Krishnan Advani, a leader of the V ISHVA H INDU P ARISHAD (another nationalist group) led the pro- tests; he was recently indicted for his role in the affair. The RSS protesters eventually attacked and destroyed the mosque in 1992. Nationwide com- munal riots resulted, in which 3,000 people were killed.

Rati In Indian mythology Rati, Desire, is the wife of the god of love K AMADEVA . Some stories say that she was created from the sweat of the RISHI D AKSHA , S HIVA ’s future father-in-law. Other stories make her the daughter of B RAHMA , who killed herself when Brahma, ashamed of his own lust, killed himself. Both were revived by Vishnu and she then was given to Kamadeva, the god of love, in marriage. Rati’s most celebrated achievement was to persuade Shiva to revive her husband, after he had burned him to ashes with his third eye. In the best known version of this story, Shiva restores Kamadeva to life but makes him invisible. In other versions, Rati tries to revive her husband by feats of asceticism but is stopped by the rishi N ARADA , who forces her to serve as a demon’s housemaid, K 362 Rati 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 362 12/14/06 9:29:20 AM"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"under the name Mayavati.

Rawat, Prem (Guru Maharaj Ji) (1957– ) head of Divine Light Mission and creator of Elan Vital Prem Rawat, or Guru Maharaj Ji, is a teacher in the Sant Mat tradition who won a large follow- ing in the United States in the 1960s and early 1970s. Prem Rawat was born on December 10, 1957, near Dehra Dun in Uttaranchal state, India, the youngest son of Sri Han Maharaj Ji, an established spiritual teacher. Prem received formal education at St. Joseph’s Academy, but his spiritual direction was from his father. At age three, he began speak- ing to audiences about inner peace. When his father died in 1966 he became spiritual leader of the Divine Light Mission (DLM), a foundation Sri Han had established in the 1930s. Under his leadership the mission continued to teach his father’s main techniques, derived from the S ANT M AT tradition. The tradition teaches that knowledge, as the energy and source of life, is obtained through four forms of MEDITATION , each of which focuses attention on inner life. Maharaj Ji presented the teaching as a cultiva- tion of inner peace through maintaining silence, watching the process of breathing, and focusing the senses inward. Devotees who take initiation into DLM are said to “gain knowledge” and are called “premies.” Many members of the counterculture in the United States were impressed by Maharaj Ji’s mes- sage of peace during his tours in the later 1960s, when he was still a teenager. In 1971, after his visits to Los Angeles and Boulder, Colorado, the United States DLM was established in Denver, Colorado. By 1972 the movement spread across the country. Ashrams were established in major cities and the publications Divine Times and It is Divine distributed. In 1973 the DLM rented the Houston Astro- dome for a gathering of peace coinciding with the birthday of Sri Han. The event failed to generate large attendance and became a financial loss. Pro- grams and ASHRAMS were soon closed in order to pay off debt and many premies began to leave the movement. In 1974 Guru Maharaj Ji married a Western premie named Marolyn Johnson, a mar- riage that created conflict between Maharaj Ji and his mother. The fracture caused further troubles for the DLM when his mother returned to India and reestablished the DLM under her eldest son’s name. In the late 1970s the DLM reorganized and moved its headquarters to Miami, Florida. Maha- raj Ji distanced himself from the religious asso- ciation to make his teachings more universal. In the 1980s he encouraged followers to leave the monastic life and to regard him simply as a humanitarian leader. By 1983, he had ordered all Western ashrams to close. In the mid-1980s, the DLM was renamed the Elan Vital and discarded all religious affilia- tion. Guru Maharaj Ji changed his name to Prem Rawat, believing that the divinity ascribed to him obstructed his message. Elan Vital became a much smaller organization. He increased his speaking engagements and produced video and sound recordings to spread his ideas. Elan Vital, now headquartered in Agoura Hills, California, retains its status as a charitable organi- zation, organizing events for Prem Rawat, raising funds, producing and distributing tapes of his messages, and archiving the history of his work.

Souls are believed to cycle through human or animal lives until they are liberated and merge with a higher reality. On rare occasions the tradition refers to reincarnation into a plant or stationary object. The concept appears to have emerged in late Vedic times. Some argue that the idea was present in the Vedic tradition from the beginning, but little evidence can be found in any of the Vedic collec- tions of MANTRAS , and only very occasional refer- ences are found in the B RAHMANAS , the explanatory portions of the Vedic collections. By the time of the U PANISHADS the notion of reincarnation seems to have become centrally important. Some sects in ancient times appear to have believed that every soul must travel through a fixed number of births; one text puts the num- ber at 8,400,000. The Ajivika sect believed that these births were all inevitable and could not be escaped; one could reach liberation only after they were all completed. Many early sects adopted extreme ascetic practices, avoiding any taint of worldly passion, in order not to add to the accumulation of KARMA that had occurred from previous lives. Later Hin- duism, as well as Buddhism and J AINISM , made the notion of reincarnation central to spiritual and religious practice, enshrining the notions of karma and SAMSARA (the round of birth and rebirth) in Indian culture and practice. In these traditions, reincarnation results from one’s actions in one’s previous life, one’s karma. In the process of time one might endure a huge number of highly undesirable births; samsara, or worldly existence, was thus a trap one tried to escape. Such escape of rebirth has been the primary obsession of all practice in nearly all Indian tradi- tions (except Islam) up to the present day. M OK - SHA or NIRVANA , the liberation or release from this cycle, became the highest goal in all the major traditions. Release could occur in several ways. One path was severe, world-denying asceticism; even today there are such practitioners hidden away in mountain caves. Meditative yoga was seen as another way, which allowed one’s mind or consciousness to remove itself from attach- ment to worldly life and thereby pave the way to liberation. Alternatively, a focus upon God could earn the grace of the divinity and God could help break the bonds of karma. Traditionally it has been said in Hinduism, too, that a true GURU can literally strip away one’s karma, and thus devotion to gurus has become a strong feature of Hinduism. Further reading: C. F.

According to tradition it was compiled by V YA S A . It is usually dated from 1500 to 1000 B . C . E ., but since it is an anthology, some of its more than 1,000 hymns might well be older. The great majority of the hymns are from five to 20 lines in length; very few exceed 50 lines in length. The Rig Veda contains hymns of praise to a pantheon of divinities. It also includes some cos- mogonic hymns—hymns that tell of the creation of the universe—that are extremely important for the development of later Hinduism. By far the greatest number of the hymns of the Rig Veda are devoted to I NDRA , king of the gods, a deity connected with the storms and rain who holds a thunderbolt, and A GNI , the god of fire. The rest of the hymns are devoted to an array of gods, most prominently M ITRA , V ARUNA , S AVITRI , S OMA , and the A SHVINS . Less frequently mentioned in Rig Veda are the gods who became most important in the later Hindu pantheon, V ISHNU and R UDRA (one of whose epithets was S HIVA , the benign). A num- ber of goddesses are mentioned, most frequently U SHAS , goddess of the dawn. A DITI (she without limit) is a goddess who is said to be the mother of the gods. The Rig Veda, as are the other Vedas, is under- stood to be “composed by no man” ( apaurasheya ). It was considered to be an eternal text that is rediscovered during each new cosmic era. Com- monly, the Rig Veda is divided into eight cycles, or mandalas, but in it is also traditionally learned in 10 books. The RISHIS , poet-sages, are said to be respon- sible for “seeing” or hearing the verses in their divine form and recording them. Each Rig Vedic hymn has a rishi ’s name attached and some full books or partial books are said to have been received by a single rishi. Prominent among the rishis are Vishvamitra, Atri, Bharadvaja, Vasishtha, Kashyapa, Jamadagni, and Gautama. Many of the other rishis are descendants of these major rishis . Book III of the Rig Veda, for instance, is said to be received by Vishvamitra and his descen- dants. Nearly all the hymns of book VI are said to be from Bharadvaja. All the hymns of book VII are from Vasishtha. Most of book IV is said to have been received by the rishi Vamadeva, the son of the rishi Gotama. All of book II is said to have been received by the rishi Gritsmada. There were apparently some women who received Vedic hymns, including Apala of the Atri family; Gho- sha, grand-daughter of Dirghatamas; Romasha; and Shashvati. The great majority of rishis were Brahmins and Kshatriyas, the two highest castes, but some verses were received by others. Scholars believe books I and X were recorded later than the others. Book X contains several cosmogonic hymns such as the PURUSHA Sukta, the Hymn of the Divine Man (Rig Veda X. 90), which highlight the theme of cosmic unity. The hymns were very influential in later Indian thought. Most hymns of the Rig Veda, however, are not philo- sophical; rather, they are directed toward various divinities as part of a ritual cult, which is explic- itly detailed in the B RAHMANAS . There are very few hymns of the Rig Veda that do not involve refer- ence to some ritual. The Rig Veda, as the other Vedas, was passed down from mouth to ear for millennia. It was for- bidden to write them, as they were the exclusive preserve of those authorized and qualified to use them properly. Much as in a shamanistic tradition, the Vedas were shared only among initiates who learned from a Vedic GURU . The earliest written texts appeared around the 15th century C . E . Further reading: S.

He was followed by 23 others, the last of whom was M AHAVIRA . Rishabha’s life was marked by four auspicious events, which all took place when the Moon was in conjunction with the same star: he entered the womb after a previous life in a heavenly realm, he was born into the world, he left the life of a house- holder, and he attained infinite knowledge. In the land of Kosala, he entered the womb of Marudevi, wife of Nabhi, a member of a warrior class family on the fourth day in the dark half of the month of Ashadha (June–July). His mother, as was customary for those who would bear a future ARHAT , an enlightened being, had had 14 auspi- cious dreams, such as seeing a white elephant and an ox. In the eighth day of the dark half of the month of Chaitra (March–April), he was born. Gods, goddesses, animal divinities, and others descended to greet this great birth and showered down jewels, gold, and silver. Rishabha lived as a prince and as a monarch for thousands of years. Even as a monarch he was known for his many virtues and for his great teachings of the various arts. In his kingly life his children included the famed B HARATA and B AHUBALI . In the month of Chaitra (March–April), he gave away all his wealth, mounted his kingly palanquin for the last time, and went to his place of renunciation to become a monk. He sat under a sacred tree; took off all his clothes, finery, and ornaments; and pulled out all his hair in five tufts, as was the custom for one who was to become a Jain monk. For 1,000 years Rishabha ignored his body in every way, enduring every hardship without complaint or acknowledgment. He would walk very slowly, talk very quietly, and move about very lightly so as not to harm any being visible or invis- ible. He saw offal and gold as the same and would accept only that which had not been prepared specially for him. Rishabha spent 1,000 years contemplating himself and doing penance in right conduct on the road to liberation. Finally, taking water only once every four days, he sat under a tree and reached the ultimate insight of full knowledge. Thereupon he became a spiritual victor, a jina, and became omniscient. At this time the gods and all other beings went to listen to him preach the Jain doctrine in an awesome and beautiful pavilion they built. It is said that the Tirthankara Rishabha had 84 disciples who were very close to him and another 84 who assisted him. He had a total of 84,000 monks and 300,000 nuns. He remained seating in a lotus position, omniscient, for 100,000 years. Finally he met his death and his soul ascended to the top of the universe to exist there in eternal effulgence and bliss.

The original rishis were those who saw or called forth the eternal verses of the V EDAS . The Vedas were not seen as writ- ten by anyone; the rishis were conduits for them. Most of the Vedic MANTRAS include the name of the rishi who recorded them. Seven of these ancient rishis are seen as the starting points for the orthodox B RAHMIN lineages: Kashyapa, Atri, K 366 Rishabha 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 366 12/14/06 9:29:21 AM"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"Vasishtha, Vishvamitra, Gautama, Jamadagni, and Bharadvaja. In the later epics and Puranas, or mythical lore, rishis inhabited ASHRAMS or retreat places in the wilderness, where they performed their aus- terities. These rishis were sages, not necessarily connected with the transmission of the Vedas. Some of them were composers or compilers of the epics, such as the rishi V ALMIKI who compiled the R AMAYANA , and the rishi V YA S A who gave us the M AHABHARATA . The rishis encountered in this later literature often are known for the frighten- ing curses they imposed upon those who had not treated them with due deference and respect. Rishi today is an honorific term, for instance, in the case of M AHARISHI (great rishi ) Mahesh Yogi, who founded the T RANSCENDENTAL M EDITATION movement. Few such people today are considered comparable to the great rishis of the past. See also SAPTA RISHI .

Rishkesh lies in northern Uttar Pradesh in the foothills of the H IMALAYAS , on the G ANGES . At the Triveni Ghat, the steps down to the Ganges, many offerings are made and ablutions done, for the Ganges is the purest of rivers, and at Rishikesh its water is very cold and fast. At sunset there is a custom there of setting little lamps adrift on the Ganges in worship to Ganga Devi, the river GOD - DESS . Rishikesh is filled at all times with swamis, SADHUS , mendicants, and peregrinating pilgrims who seek this holy shrine for purification and devotion. Rishikesh is not far from H ARIDVAR and is a waystation for pilgrims going farther up the Himalayas to B ADRINATH .

It was understood that the Vedic rituals were necessary to maintain the cosmic order. In fact the greatest of the ancient Vedic rituals, the AGNICHAYANA , or fire ritual, was seen to re-create the entire cosmic order each year. The concept of rita is most important as a precursor to the notion of DHARMA , although the latter was extended into social law and social organization as well.

He was raised in Patna, a center of Muslim learn- ing, and was influenced by Islamic teachings against images. Later, in Calcutta (Kolkata), he was exposed to Christianity. A scholar, he knew Bengali, S ANSKRIT , and other Indian languages, as well as Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. With his liberal education, he was inclined to reject the traditional orthodoxy of Hinduism and to accept the common aspects of different faiths, including Buddhism, J AINISM , Hinduism, and Christianity. Although he read many of the world’s scrip- tures in their original languages, he sought a way to free his own tradition, Hinduism, from superstition and prejudice. He claimed that the unifying doctrines he sought were contained in the U PANISHADS . With this renewed appreciation of the teachings of the Upanishads, he advocated that Indians learn their own tradition as well as science, philosophy, and modern perspectives. He adamantly rejected image worship, burning of widows ( SATI ), and the power that the Brahminic priesthood had over the populace. These practices he considered superstitious, prejudiced, and con- trary to rationality. Once he became acquainted with Unitarianism through missionaries in India, he allied his movement with the principles of Uni- tarian philosophy. Known for his work toward the abolition of sati, the immolation of widows on their husbands’s funeral pyre; the disadvantages of polygamy; and challenges to the authority of the Hindu priest- hood, Roy became a voice of tolerance and a con- tinuing influence on traditional Indian practices. The first president of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, called Roy a “pioneer of modern India,” and Swami V IVEKANANDA extolled Roy’s love, which extended to Muslims as well as Hindus.

Rudrananda, Swami (1928–1973) American teacher of Shaivism and Siddha Yoga Swami Rudrananda, a Brooklyn-born disciple of the Shaivite GURU N ITYANANDA , was a popular spiritual teacher in the United States. Born Albert Rudolph in Brooklyn, New York, Swami Rudrananda grew up in the Depression era without a father. He relates that as a child he dem- onstrated psychic gifts and could go into trance and tell fortunes. At the age of six he saw two Tibetan lamas materialize and prophesy that the spiritual gifts they were implanting in him would be realized at age 31. As a young adult, he owned and operated an Oriental art shop in New York City. In 1958 at age 30, Albert traveled to India to find a spiritual teacher. There he met his guru, Swami N ITYANANDA , at Ganeshpuri, near Bombay (Mumbai). The meeting with Nityananda was to change the course of his life. Nityananda was a mahasiddha, always in a state of bliss and trance, who did not write or found any organization. His teachings were his direct transmission of spiritual force, and his utterances given in a profoundly immersed state were recorded by his pupils. Nityananda transmitted the creative life force or S HAKTI directly to disciples. Through this trans- mission or shaktipat, the power of kundalini was aroused in the disciple, who could experience an identity with the divine. Albert had many extraordinary experiences with Nityananda, who even after his death appeared to Rudi and transmitted Shakti to him. However, it was Swami M UKTANANDA , one of the primary dis- ciples of Nityananda, who initiated him into SAN - NYAS in 1966 and gave him the name Rudrananda (affectionately shortened to Rudi ). Rudi was Muk- tananda’s first Western disciple, and it was Rudi who took Muktananda to the United States. In 1971 Rudi broke with Muktananda, who wanted him to turn over his ASHRAMS and students. Rudi’s practice, as was that of Nityananda and Muktananda, was in essence Shaivite, although he did not focus on the philosophical aspects. Instead he was concerned to extract the content from the container. His entire teaching was centered on providing spiritual nourishment to his students, to insist that they develop a real practice so that they could create their own internal spiritual mechanism and connection to higher spiritual forces. Rudi was known for assuming his student’s KARMA or spiritual tension, a negative energy that prohibits spiritual growth. This appropriation of others’ karma he called spiritual cannibalism (the title of his autobiography). Rudi was said to have removed cancer from one disciple by taking on that person’s karma. In 1973 Rudi died in the crash of a small plane, en route to a lecture. Rudi taught from his own center in New York City and opened his first ashram in the United States in Big Indian, New York.

Hindus do venerate and respect cows, but they do not regularly worship them; nor do they consider them in the category of icons or sacred objects. Bulls do have some sanctity, as a bull is the iconic vehicle of Lord S HIVA . The weight of academic evidence shows that in V EDIC times (c. 1500–800 B . C . E .) bulls and barren cows were sacrificed by B RAHMINS , who then ate the animals. Other Indians also regularly ate beef. It was the Jains, and to some extent the Buddhists, who impressed Indian tradition with the notion of AHIMSA , the avoidance of harm to any being. Only gradually did society, led by the orthodox Brahmins, embrace VEGETARIANISM as the ideal diet and abandon the eating of meat almost completely. The only Hindus who still regularly eat beef are the Dalit ( UNTOUCHABLE ) carrion gatherers. As ahimsa became the ideal the cow began to assume an iconic role and could not be killed. Since ancient times cow’s milk has been a food staple; cow’s milk and clarified butter are still used in ritual worship.

A late Atharva Vedic hymn (c. 300 B . C . E .) does treat the cow as holy, proclaiming it the universe itself—the Sun, the Moon, the rain. The imagery recalls the first verses of the B RIHADARANYAKA U PA - NISHAD , which gives sacred, cosmological meaning to the HORSE SACRIFICE as an object of MEDITATION . No one knows exactly how the cow gained its special status in India, but it is believed that the development of ahimsa combined with the near- totemic status of the cow made the animal inviola- ble. Cows are often allowed to wander the streets to forage. Extreme consequences occur when a cow is struck by a vehicle (the driver might be physically attacked), so cows are scrupulously given the right of way on the somewhat anarchic Indian roadways. Even ownerless bulls are given similar deference. India, because of its monsoon climate, pos- sesses no pastureland to compare with that of North America, Europe, Argentina, or Australia. As a result, the raising of beef is not economi- cal (although many ecologists claim that feeding grain directly to people is more efficient anywhere than converting it to beef). Therefore, the preser- vation of all cows for the dairy industry (and for their dung) has local economic logic. When cattle die they are considered carrion and may be taken away and eaten by Dalits (untouchables), who may be desperately poor, lack other food sources and process the skin for leather.

It consists of three strands before mar- riage and six or more thereafter. This thread can be worn by any of the three upper castes ( jatis ), B RAHMIN (priestly), K SHATRIYA (warrior), or V AISHYA (merchant). In practice, Brahmins (the priestly caste) commonly wear the thread, while Kshatriya (warriors) and Vaishya (merchants) wear it less often. For Brahmins the investiture of the thread traditionally marks the beginning of the “student life” and is a very important ceremony. It is usu- ally done at a young age (eight–12 years) and is considered a “second birth.” Further reading: Klaus K.

Such people are regarded as good, pure, and religiously devoted. The terms sadhu and SANNYASI (more rarely their feminine forms sadhvi and sannyasini ) are gener- ally used interchangeably for wandering mendi- cants. The name SWAMI is also sometimes used. Customs and characteristics vary greatly among sadhus and depend upon the sect to which they belong. They may be devoted to any divinity or to the BRAHMAN , the ultimate reality. Celibacy is universally required. Sadhus who worship Lord S HIVA may freely partake of hashish and marijuana to inspire their devotional chanting; for all others such drugs are strictly forbidden. Sadhus are very often devoted to a particular GURU (almost always a man) and follow his dictates strictly. The sadhu or wandering mendicant is a very familiar feature of the Indian landscape and a distinctive aspect of Hinduism. While they are typically welcomed, there has always been some skepticism about their authenticity as well.

Sahadeva See P ANDAVAS . Sahaja Yoga Center (est. 1970s) Sahaja Yoga was founded by Sri Mataji Nirmala Devi (b. March 21, 1923), an Indian girl born to a Christian family in Chindawara, India. Her parents, Prasad and Cornelia Salve, were direct descendants of a royal household in India. She is said to have been born with complete self-real- ization and to have known from childhood that she had a spiritual mission to help humankind. Early in her life, she displayed great wisdom, intelligence, and an understanding of the human nervous system and it energetic components. Her parents were active in the Indian inde- pendence movement. Her father was a renowned scholar, a close associate of M OHANDAS K ARAM - CHAND G ANDHI , who served on the Assembly of Free India; he helped to draft India’s Constitu- tion. As a child, Nirmala lived with her parents in Gandhi’s ashram and served as a youth leader in the independence movement. Gandhi rec- ognized her spiritual gifts and often engaged with her in conversation about the principle of Sahaja Yoga (the union with the divine innate in all people). Both agreed that fundamental- ism and religious competition were obstacles to SELF - REALIZATION . Nirmala studied medicine and psychology at the Christian Medical College in Lahore, Pakistan. In the late 1940s she married C. P. Srivastava, a member of the Indian Civil Service and later a diplomat. They had two daughters. In May 1970, Nirmala had a transformative experience.

Sahasrara chakra is the meeting place of the divine feminine in the form of the kundalini with paramashiva, or highest S HIVA . Here the full inte- gration of the transcendent and the earthly takes place, and the yogi can experience all of reality as divinity. The deity of this chakra is paramashiva. The S HAKTI is mahashakti, or the highest form of the GODDESS . The 1,000 petals are said to be of every color.

Sai Baba of Shirdi (c. 1856–1918) revered ascetic Sai Baba was a highly charismatic ascetic and teacher of the early 20th century, whose influence carries to the present. The early life of this Indian holy man is almost completely unknown. It is believed that he was born to a B RAHMIN family in a village in Hyderabad state, India, but the particulars of his family and lineage have not been discovered. He left home when he was eight to follow a Muslim teacher. When this teacher died, he associated with a Hindu guru named Venkusa. At age 16 he appeared in Shirdi, a village in Maharashtra state, where he kept to himself, remained silent except in response to questions, and begged for food. After he had for some years appeared in public in Shirdi, people reported miracles and spontaneous ecstasy in his presence. He report- edly visited people in their dreams and healed the sick. In 1908 he began to be worshipped as a god. Sai Baba’s teaching emphasized devotion to a guru. He advocated VEGETARIANISM , taken from Hinduism, but also used Muslim MANTRAS and prayers. He advised all to remain in the faith in which they were born but to attend the festivals of other religions. Sai Baba’s grave in Shirdi is a shrine and place of pilgrimage.

Saiva Siddhanta Saiva Siddhanta is a form of S HAIVISM practiced in Tamil-speaking regions, particularly Tamil Nadu and northern Sri Lanka. It is based on the 28 Shaivite AGAMAS , authoritative texts that interpret and extend Vedic knowledge, and on the teachings of the 63 N AYANMARS , the Tamil Shaivite saints. Other authorities include M ANIKKAVACAKAR , who wrote the beloved T IRUVACAKAM (Sacred utter- ances) (c. 10th century), and Meykanda, with his Sivajnanabodham (Awareness of the knowledge of Siva) (c. 13th century).

One can realize one’s Shiva nature at the core of one’s soul, but souls are eternally separate from one another and separate from Shiva. In this sense Saiva Siddhanta is a completely dualistic system. Pashu is the individual self that strives to realize its “Shiva nature.” Pasha are the bonds of KARMA that hold one. Knowing one’s Shiva nature confers liberation from birth and rebirth. Shiva can be realized only by worship, knowledge, and the aid of a GURU . Saiva Siddhanta is characterized by its abject devotion and the sense of helplessness of the indi- vidual self in the face of a supreme that it can only understand, but with which it can never merge. Grace plays an important role in Saiva Siddhanta. There is an element of the system that speaks of Shiva/S HAKTI , or the divine masculine/divine femi- nine, which constitutes the totality of Shiva; this differs from the similar tantric idea, in which there is a complete identity between the level of the soul and the ultimate.

Saiva Siddhanta Church (est. 1957) Founded in 1957 in San Francisco, California, by Satguru S UBRAMUNIYASWAMI (1927–2001), the Saiva Siddhanta Church promotes temple worship and propagates the teachings of S HAIVITE Hindu- ism through a temple/school complex. The church serves Shaivism worldwide by initiating monks, publishing the writings of Sub- ramuniyaswami and other Shaivite teachers, lead- ing pilgrimages to holy sites of Shaivism, and promoting the study of Hinduism among Hindus and non-Hindus. Since 1957, centers have been established throughout the world. The Sri Subra- muniya Ashram in Alaveddy, Sri Lanka, begun in 1949 by Subramuniyaswami, serves the needs of the Shaivite community near Jaffna. In the first years of the church in San Fran- cisco, monastics lived in apartments near the church on Sacramento Street and were self-sup- porting. Later, as the church grew, monks were able to live lives of cloistered study. At their inception, the temple and school in San Francisco offered Hindu education through classes taught by Subramuniyaswami. The church transcribed and printed the lectures and sermons of their leader and disseminated these in a series of lessons, called the San Marga Master Course. As part of its mission to promote contemporary understanding of Shaivism’s scriptures and teach- ings, the church also established the Himalayan Academy, its publishing house. Today the SAN - NYASIS (renunciants) of the church design, typeset, and illustrate the publications of the Himalayan Academy in Kapaa, Hawaii. Temple worship is fundamental to Shaivite practice and has been central in the history of the church. Worshippers are encouraged to develop devotion ( BHAKTI ) to the congregation in each family’s shrine room, and in daily life. In addi- tion to the Ganesha Temple, dedicated in 1957 in San Francisco, California, Subramuniyaswami founded Kadavul Hindu Temple at Kauai Aad- heenam on the island of Kauai on March 12, 1973. A number of images of deities from the Shaivite tradition are in the temples, and PUJA is celebrated several times each day. All major Shaivite festival days are observed through the year. Publications include a partial translation in American English of Saint Tiruvalluvar’s Tiru- kural, a book on Lord G ANESHA , a progressive four-part series of premonastic and monastic vows concluding with the vow of SANNYAS (total renun- ciation), and a catechism and creed for Shaivite Hindus, which are Lessons One and Two of the San Marga Master Course.

As of 1980, two Dharmasalas, formally organized groups of church families, were in exis- tence—one in Flushing, New York, and the other in San Francisco, California. Following the pat- terns of the American church structure, members of the Dharmasala work together to strengthen their lives through education, religious obser- vance, shared culture, and economic cooperation. Their organization is overseen by a senior group of elders and a council on ministries. A core group of church members formed in Alaveddy, Sri Lanka, the site of Subramuniyas- wami’s first ASHRAM . The ashram serves the Sri Lankan community through its children’s school of religion, English classes, courses in Shaivite culture, and a full-fledged religious and cultural center for adults. At present, the church has mem- bers in many countries, including England, Mau- ritius, Canada, Sri Lanka, Thailand, India, South Africa, and Australia. The entire church member- ship now is made up of approximately 70 percent born Shaivites and 30 percent converts.

In some systems it is accompanied by a trance, whereby the yogi is completely detached from any external stimuli. Samadhi is a technical term in the yoga of P ATA N - JALI , describing the next stage for the adept after concentration skills ( dharana ) have been developed and deep involvement in MEDITATION ( DHYANA ) has been achieved. There are two levels of samadhi: samprajnata samadhi, in which the yogi is still aware of a degree of worldly differentiation, and asampra- jnata samadhi, in which there is a full realization of the self, or PURUSHA , and its consciousness, and there is no involvement in worldly differentiation. Samprajnata samadhi is said to retain the “seeds” of awareness of the external world of differentia- tion, while aprajnata samadhi is said to be “seed- less”: it no longer engenders thoughts tied to the external world. Neither of these states can be pre- cisely described, because both take consciousness beyond language into indescribable realms. Samprajnata samadhi is seen by Patanjali to have four steps. At the savitarka step the adept can look directly into the essence of real things, but only at the gross level. This step is still bound by conventional understandings, such as that time is divided into past, present, and future. The second step is nirvitarka. At this point, conventional understandings, verbal and logical associations, cease. One transcends the cognitive or perceptive act itself, and one’s consciousness meets directly with true reality. However, this meeting is still at a gross and not a subtle level. At the third or savichara level consciousness is able to go beyond the surface of reality to its sub- tle level. One is still, however, bound by a certain residue of time and space (not as a felt experience, but as categories). Experience at this subtle level engenders the fourth step in this type of sama- dhi, the nirvichara level, in which consciousness descends into the very essence of the real world, no longer mediated by “concept.” Beyond the fourth stage of samprajnata samadhi is true asampranjata samadhi, in which concept is lost completely; there is a direct realization of the consciousness power of the self, with no limita- tion. This is sometimes also called dharma-megha- samadhi. Here one becomes completely aware that the self and its power of consciousness are not the samadhi 377 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 377 12/14/06 9:29:23 AM"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"body. All “knowledge” and all “consciousness” merge into an undifferentiated awareness that is absorbed in being itself. This does not mean that the person cannot and does not exist and act in the world as before. It merely implies that that person’s awareness is no longer in any way affected or per- turbed by that worldly reality. The yogi is then in the “isolated state” ( kaivalya ) and functions on a level beyond ordinary categories.

Sama Veda Sama Veda, or “V EDA of the sung chants,” is one of the three original Vedas that form the founda- tion of Hindu tradition (a fourth Veda was added sometime later). Most of its hymns are devoted to the god S OMA . This god was invoked in many Vedic rituals and was particularly honored by the preparation of a psychedelic substance that took the same name as the god: Soma. The honoring of the god and the preparation of the drug were the particular realm of the Sama Vedic priests. Any public Vedic ritual required the recitation of passages from the Sama Veda. Many public rites also required the consumption of the Soma drug. The priests of the Sama Veda were known for their sonorous chanting, which is considered the origin of Indian music.

Tamil Shaivite poet-saint Sambanthar (he connected to God through divine wisdom) is among the trio of most prominent Tamil S HAIVITE saints whose hymns appear in the central liturgical and literary text of the Tamil Shaivas, the T EVARAM . Born to a B RAHMIN family in Cirkali, Tamil Nadu, near the famous Shaivite shrine of C HID - AMBARAM , Sambanthar was a child prodigy; it was said that he began composing hymns in praise of S HIVA when he was just a child. He is said to have mastered Vedic learning at age three and received by a miracle the ability to compose sacred poetry from Shiva himself. While still quite young Sambanthar com- pleted four great pilgrimages to shrines of the Tamil region, accompanied by other devotees. A minstrel who accompanied him on these jour- neys set his hymns to music—or, most likely, simply recorded the melodies that the young saint spontaneously sang; they are still sung by devotees today. Sambanthar’s hymns frequently condemn the Buddhists and Jains ( see J AINISM ). He is said to have converted the Pandyan king of Madurai from J AINISM to Shaivism. Many miracles are associated with his life. Legend says that when his parents, at last, arranged his marriage, Shiva appeared as a great blaze of light and invited the saint to merge with him. The wedding party and bride joined the saint in final union with God, before his marriage could be finalized. Further reading: A. Kandiah, Mystic Love in the Tevaram (Colombo: A.

It is traditionally believed to have origi- nated with the sage K APILA (c. 500 B . C . E .); its most authoritative text is the Samkhya Karika of Ishvarakrishna (c. 200 C . E .). Today the system has few adherents, and many of its ideas are preserved in YOGA traditions, including modern-day HATHA YOGA . (The word samkhya means “enumerate,” a reference to the precise categories within the philosophy.) Samkhya was dualist: the everyday world of matter and the world of the soul or self were con- sidered to be two completely separate and distinct realms. Early Samkhya was nontheistic; it did not include any divine being or god. In Samkhya PRAKRITI —nature or the manifest universe—was understood to be eternal. It had always existed and would always exist, though it might from time to time contract into an unmani- fest form, awaiting the next manifestation. The selves or souls, which were also eternal but shared nothing in common with nature, were called PURUSHAS . There was an infinite number of them, and they were all separate and distinct from one another. Each self or soul contained an inexplicable magnetism, which drew prakriti to collect or aggregate around it and give it life, a body, and birth. KARMA , the actions committed in the previ- ous birth, would determine each new aggregation. In spiritual terms, this was seen as a constantly renewed trap for the self; the purpose of Samkhya was to show a way to escape the trap. With the right state of mind, one could move one’s point of view above the whirl of nature so that one’s consciousness could focus on the soul itself and not be distracted by the pull of phenom- ena. The earthly realm of elements was considered to be characterized by inertia ( tamas ); the organs of action such as hands and feet were seen to con- stitute a realm of self-binding action ( rajas ); but the senses, mind, and intellect pointed toward the realm of purity ( SATTVA ). These three aspects of nature, the GUNAS , were experienced only in com- bination, with one or another mode predominat- ing at any one moment. M EDITATION could help one rise above the gunas or intertwined characteristics of nature. Intellect, or higher mind ( BUDDHI ), was the pur- est aspect of the human being and so was used as an instrument for the transcendence of matter. But even mind needed to be left behind for total release. Release occurred when the soul was freed from the body into its own self-reflective con- sciousness. Yoga soon emerged as the practical way to realize the ideals of Samkhya. P ATANJALI ’s Y OGA S UTRA showed the practices that could be used and delineated the various stages of the process. By the first century C . E . the system was practically combined into one, and called Samkhya-Yoga. Further reading: S. N.

By extension it is often used to designate the world, where birth and rebirth are the human des- tiny. The term is also used in J AINISM , Buddhism, and S IKHISM . The negative evaluation of samsara, so preva- lent in Hindu belief, began to color the ancient V EDIC tradition only in the era of U PANISHADS , some of which begin to show attitudes that would directly lead to the development of world-deny- ing philosophies. The Vedic MANTRAS themselves are life-affirming and envision a peaceful, joyful heaven as the result of merit in one’s life.

Reincarnation appears in the Upanishads, the small texts that were appended to the prose portions (B RAHMANAS ) of the Vedas, along with the first evidence of the sense of entrapment in a web of endless births. The Buddhist and Jain traditions also focus on KARMA and the hopeless trap of the world.

Every samskara requires a B RAHMIN priest to preside and includes prayers, oblations, offerings, and a fire ritual. Rituals are performed to encourage impreg- nation and to obtain a male child. A special rite is performed at birth. The annaprashana is usually performed at the sixth month after birth to mark the feeding of the first solid food. The investiture of the SACRED THREAD , the upanayana ceremony, is performed for twice-born (high- caste) Hindu males when they are between ages eight and 12. Perhaps the two most important samskaras for Hindus are the wedding ceremony and the sraddha, or death ceremony. The sraddha can be performed only by a male child. It ensures that a soul does not remain as a ghost but goes on either to liberation or to its next birth. A yearly ritual is performed to feed the deceased, in particular Brahmins, lest they fall from heaven. This ancient ritual of feeding the ancestor seems to conflict with the belief that nearly everyone is reincar- nated, and that few proceed directly to heaven. Further reading: R. B.

The word Hindu, after all, was not indigenous to the culture, but was coined by ancient Persians (based on their pronuncia- tion of Sindhu, the Indus River). Indian spiritual traditions had typically described themselves as “the DHARMA .” Dharma admits of many English translations; it refers to an essential set of rules and prescriptions that make up a given religious path. Those who coined the term sanatana dharma wanted to emphasize the Indian sense that their “way” was an eternal one that had had no begin- ning in time. Because of the universality of certain Hindu notions, and the acceptance of a wide diversity of spiritual paths within the Hindu fold, the term sanatana dharma sometimes is taken to mean the ancient truth behind all religions (not just those of India), the truth that all seek in their own unique ways. In that sense, the santana dharma is not merely the religions practiced by the inhabitants of India who look upon the V EDAS as the supreme wisdom, but the “way” of all who seek the highest truth, whatever their religion.

The rules or vows vary in the different traditions, but until modern times, sannyasis were expected to shun worldly occupations, living only through alms or in a monastic environment. The vows for sannyasi s all entail dietary restrictions that limit the number and size of meals, avoidance of women, prohibition on use of alcohol, and a focus on the divine at all times. Sannyasi is the fourth stage of life or ASHRAMA FOR B RAHMIN males, the point at which they ideally throw down all conventional life and take up a life of wandering as they focus on God or BRAHMAN .

Sanskrit (Samskritam) Sanskrit ( sam, complete; krita, done, i.e., that which is done completely, the perfected, the refined) is the ancient liturgical or ritual language of India. In the Sanskrit language itself the lan- guage is called Samskritam. Sanskrit is the oldest extant Indo-European language. It is linguistically related to such Euro- pean languages as English, French, and German and such Asian languages as Persian. The earli- est evidence for Sanskrit is in the ancient Indian texts, the V EDAS , the earliest of which, the R IG V EDA , dates from approximately 1500 B . C . E . The Vedas were received as divine revelation by seers called RISHIS , who recorded them. The Sanskrit of the Vedas is noticeably different from its classical form, as defined authoritatively by the grammar- ian Panini around 450 B . C . E . After Panini, virtually no changes were accepted into the language. Today Sanskrit is still spoken by pandits (scholars) and those learned An ochre-robed wandering sannyasi in Benares (Varanasi) (Constance A.

There are several Sanskrit universities today in India, where all classes are conducted in that language. There are a few mil- lion Indians who can truly speak Sanskrit today in a population of over a billion or more; none of them speaks Sanskrit only. There are many theories regarding the Sanskrit language; the different philosophical schools and sects in India have developed their own view- points. Most of them believe that the Vedas them- selves are eternal and always existed; therefore, Sanskrit itself is similarly eternal, rather than an arbitrary language created by humans; it is the “language of the gods” ( devavani ). When J AINISM and Buddhism began to develop scriptures and liturgies that departed from the Vedic ritual tradition, they made use of the Prakrits, the regional vernacular languages that had begun to develop out of Sanskrit. In that era (c. 800 to 0 B . C . E .), Sanskrit was still the spoken language of the educated classes and the language of Vedic high culture. By the turn of the millennium, how- ever, even Buddhists and Jains began to write their works in Sanskrit, an indication that the cultural force of developing Hinduism had overwhelmed these heterodox traditions at least in that respect. Sanskrit, thus, is the cultural link language of India. It has been used as the language of high culture for nearly 3,000 years. The body of extant writing in the language is vast. The Vedas, which are basically collections of MANTRAS , are accompanied by the B RAHMANAS , the A RANYAKAS , and the classical U PANISHADS . Hundreds of later texts called “Upanishads” exist independently of the Vedas. The Sanskrit epics, the R AMAYANA and the M AHABHARATA , were written somewhat later. The Ramayana is itself about 40,000 verses in length and the Mahabharata over 100,000 verses. Included alongside the epics are the 18 Puranas that tell the tales of the divinities. There are also 18 minor Puranas and hundreds of Sthala- puranas or local works that tell the tales of local divinities. Other prolific genres emerged over the long history of Sanskrit. There are hundreds of plays, longer poems, and other classical literary forms. There are works on aesthetics, erotics, medicine, philosophy and theology, and logic; there are devotional hymns, dictionaries, works on astron- omy and astrology, works on mathematics, ritual, law, architecture, TANTRISM , history, music, sculp- ture, and painting. Additionally, there is much panegyric literature and many inscriptions. Every one of these Sanskrit genres has examples in the Jain tradition as well. All told, there are hundreds of thousands of texts and manuscripts, most of which have not been studied for centuries and are not edited, let alone translated. Sanskrit is written in the D EVANAGARI script, which is made up of 48 to 51 letters, depending on the precise system. The script appears to have been devised during the Gupta era (fourth to sixth centuries C . E .). Most Indian languages rely on Sanskrit-derived vocabulary. Even in a Dravidian language such as Telegu, more than 50 percent of the vocabulary is derived from Sanskrit. At about the time of the arrival of the Muslims in India in the 13th century, Sanskrit learning began to decline. The vital and central role that Sanskrit had played in Indian culture for 3,000 years began to fade, and the vernacular languages began to develop as literary alternatives. (In South India, Tamil has long had a developed literature, still extant, dating to before the Common Era.) Even then Sanskrit did not die out. Many texts continued to be written in the language through the 18th century; in fact, many works are still composed in Sanskrit. On Indian television and radio one can hear Sanskrit newscasts and bulle- tins. There also are a few Sanskrit newspapers. Further reading: K. C.

Sant Mat The Sant Mat (View of the Saints) was a het- erogeneous group of travelling poet-saints dat- ing from the 14th to 17th centuries who had a profound impact on the religion of northern and central India. These poets included K ABIR , Surdas, T UKARAM , and Ravidas. Their most important characteristics were a desire for social reform and a criticism of ritualism and caste. They stressed that the pursuit of spirituality was not limited to religion. The search for truth could be guided by any authentic experience of the One, however defined. These teachers often ignored religious bound- aries and mingled easily with Muslim Sufis. The Sant spirit was carried forward in the Sikh tradi- tion by G URU N ANAK , who had gone on pilgrim- age and on the Hajj to show that the true God belonged to no particular religion. The Kabir tra- dition, in particular, has survived to the present, although it does not have the creative vigor and openness it once had; it seems to have become another sect of Hinduism.

Sant Mat movement (est. 1861) The Sant Mat movement, also known as the R ADHASOAMI MOVEMENT , emerged in the middle of the 19th century in the Punjab, as one of several movements that sought to revitalize the Sikh community after its government was defeated and replaced by the British. The new movement was introduced by Shiv Dayal Singh (1818–78), generally known as Soami Ji, and was distinctive because its leader was a living master, a person serving as an initiating GURU (a structure previ- ously foreign to S IKHISM ). The new guru aimed to teach his followers surat shabd (sound current) yoga, as a technique to overcome kal, the negative forces that rule this world, and contact the divine. God had created the world by his word; therefore, through the repetition of MANTRAS ( japa yoga ), humans could establish contact with God. Soami Ji’s teachings resonated with devotion to the name of God ( bhakti nam ), which had always been important in the Sikh tradition. Shiv Dayal Singh introduced surat shabd yoga in 1861 at Agra, Uttar Pradesh, in northern India. He initiated some 4,000 people and then passed leadership to Rai Salig Ram (1829–98). At the same time, he also sent Jaimal Singh (1838–1903) to spread the movement in the Punjab. The relocation of Jaimal Singh to Beas in the Punjab divided the movement; the Beas center became the larger of the two. Jaimal Singh’s successor, Sawan Singh (1858–1948), built the Beas branch into the largest of what by then had become several segments of the original move- ment. He initiated over 125,000 people. However, his career was eclipsed by that of one of the 20th- century Beas leaders, Charan Singh (1916–90), Sant Mat movement 383 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 383 12/14/06 9:29:25 AM"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"who was said to have initiated over a million disciples. Throughout the 20th century, the Sant Mat movement emerged into both an important minority movement in India and a global move- ment with centers throughout the West. At the same time, it splintered into a variety of separate groups, each of which professed to have the true lineage from Soami Ji. More often than not, when a lineage holder died, several claimants to suc- cessorship emerged and vied for the allegiance of his following. In some cases, those who did not receive the official sanction as the successor have been able to win large followings. Such was the case for Kirpal Singh (1896–1974), founder of the Ruhani Satsang. The Indian-based Sant Mat groups all teach largely the same doctrine. In the West, some of the more prominent Sant Mat teachers have been Darshan Singh (1921–89), Rajinder Singh, and Thakur Singh (b. 1929). The American scholar David Christopher Lane has catalogued the dozens of Sant Mat gurus and the move- ments they led. Some of the most interesting developments in the Sant Mat tradition have been created by non-Indian leaders who have assumed the role of living master and have built independent movements. For example, Master Ching Hai Wu Shang Shih, one of the very few women leaders in Sant Mat, learned the teachings from Thakur Singh. She has moved on to build a Chinese Sant Mat organization and changed the name of surat shabd yoga to the Quan Yin Method of Sound and Light Meditation, in order to present the teaching to a Buddhist Chinese-speaking audi- ence; as her work has grown, it has expanded to include people from a variety of backgrounds and languages. In the United States, a Westernized Sant Mat group called E CKANKAR (ECK) was started by Paul Twitchell (1909–70), a former student of Kirpal Singh. Twitchell ignored Kirpal Singh’s lineage and proclaimed himself the 971st ECK Master, the recipient of a previously unknown tradition said to reach back into prehistory. Eckankar, Twitch- ell’s organization, has spawned several groups. A somewhat similar group is the Movement for Spiritual Inner Awareness, formed by John-Roger Hinkins. “JR,” as he is affectionately known, mixed elements of Christianity and Western eso- tericism with the Sant Mat teachings, resulting in a new eclectic perspective. Indian religions have been carried into Africa in a similar manner by immigrants throughout the 20th century. A new branch of Sant Mat emerged in Uganda in 1957. It was founded by Dr. Jozzewaffe Kaggwa Kaguwa Kaggalanda Mugonza, more popularly known as simply Bambi Baaba. While he traveled to India and met with various Sant Mat teachers, he claims an entirely indepen- dent revelation of the teachings in a direct man- ner. In the 1970s, under the government of Idi Amin, he was charged with introducing a foreign religion in the country and forcing his members into a VEGETARIAN and alcohol-free diet. Another interesting Sant Mat teacher in the West is Guru Maharaj Ji (P REM R AWAT ) (b. 1957), who entered the United States in the early 1970s while still a teenager. His organization, originally called Divine Light Mission, now is identified as Elan Vital. He sees his teachings as independent of cultures, religion, beliefs, and lifestyles. Though adopting a secular overlay, he continues to pres- ent the Sant Mat teachings and to offer people initiation into the secret knowledge revealed only to initiates.

They are worshipped in both India and Nepal and have their own iconog- raphy. Their names only appear in the post-Vedic period. Six of the seven are considered wives of Hindu gods, as reflected in their names: Brah- mani, Maheshvari, Kaumari, Vaishnavi, Varahi, and Indrani are married, respectively, to B RAHMA , S HIVA , Kumara (K ARTTIKEYA ), V ISHNU , V ARAHA , and I NDRA .

They are considered to be the progenitors of the orthodox B RAHMIN lineages ( GOTRAS ). They are usually listed as Kashyapa, Atri, Bharadvaja, Vishvamitra, Gotama, Jamadagni, and Vasishtha. (There is another tradition that lists the chief rishis as Marici, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Kratu, Bhrisu, and Vasishtha; in that tradition, they are not necessarily the source for the Brahminical lineages.) Those in the first list are frequently encoun- tered in the epics and P URANAS , the Indian mytho- logical literature. In the month of Bhadrapada (August–September) the seven rishis are honored on the fifth day of the bright half of the month, when the Moon is waxing. The ritual in their honor can be performed by anyone. Worship is offered to images of the seven, and celibacy and a vegetarian diet are observed for the celebration. The images of the rishis (often fashioned by hand) are offered to Brahmins alongside seven pots. This observance guarantees happiness, progeny, and freedom from sin and other difficulties. The second list of rishis are usually worshipped in the seven days that begin on the first day of the bright half of the month of Chaitra (March–April), the New Year’s month. Fruits, flowers, and cow’s milk are offered to the saptarshi. A single meal is to be taken, only after sundown.

Sarada Devi, Sri (1853–1920) incarnation of Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi, wife of the Kali priest Sri R AMA - KRISHNA , was a very popular teacher in her own right, considered to be an incarnation of Holy Mother. She became an important activist in help- ing the poor and in advancing educational oppor- tunities for women. Sarada Devi was born in the rural village of Jayrambati, west of Kamarpurkur in Bengal, on December 22, 1853. The eldest of seven children of Ram Chandra Mukhopadhyay and Shyamasun- dari Devi, Sarada was raised in a poor B RAHMIN household where she assisted her parents in household duties, worked in the fields, and cared for her younger siblings. She was described as a gentle, humble, hardworking, and diligent child. When time permitted, she attended school and learned to read and write. At the age of five, Sarada married Sri R AMA - KRISHNA , a Bengali priest of goddess K ALI who was 17 years her senior. By that time, Sri Ramakrishna had experienced his first vision of the divine mother, the goddess K ALI , and was living in an ecstatic state of communication with the divine. His mother, concerned with his strange behavior, sought to restore him to worldly life by finding Sarada Devi, Sri 385 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 385 12/14/06 9:29:25 AM"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"him a suitable spouse. She found Sarada Devi in a neighboring village. After the marriage, Sarada Devi returned to her family and Sri Ramakrishna continued his spiritual practice and priestly duties at Dakshineswar Temple near Calcutta (Kolkata). At the age of 18, hearing rumors that her husband was suffering from mental illness, she went to him at the temple. Finding him deeply engaged in spiritual disciplines, she became his first disciple and began her own spiritual journey under his direction and care. He instructed her in the spiritual life as well as the importance of household duties and their role in the meditative life. Ramakrishna considered her an embodied representative of the Divine Mother. From this time forward, Sarada Devi became known as the Holy Mother and spent the rest of her life shar- ing the wisdom and insight of Sri Ramakrishna’s teachings to all who went to her. Sri Ramakrishna died in 1886, leaving the 33-year old Sarada Devi as the lineage holder of the Ramakrishna Order. In addition to teach- ing and caring for her disciples, she guided the activities of the Ramakrishna Organizations, spending most of her time in service to rural communities in Bengal and the disciples of the Ramakrishna Order in Calcutta. Serving the poor and disadvantaged women of Bengal, she became committed to advancing the education of women to promote women’s independence and social awareness. From 1886 until her death, Sarada Devi touched the lives of hundreds of devotees through her simple and pure devotion to the spiritual life. As Holy Mother, she never turned away anyone in need. She valued equality and did not discrimi- nate among disciples by caste, religion, gender, or nationality. Her unconditional compassion inspired a new spiritual movement. The core of her teaching, as of Ramakrishna’s, was the rec- ognition of the divine in everything. She died in Calcutta on July 21, 1920, 34 years after the death of her husband. The Sri Sarada Math, the world’s largest inde- pendent women’s monastic order, was estab- lished in 1954 as the women’s complement to the V EDANTA S OCIETIES R AMAKRISHNA M AT H AND M ISSION , to perpetuate the teachings of Sri Ramakrishna, Sri Sarada Devi, and Swami V IVEKANANDA . The math is located on the bank of the G ANGES River near Dak- shineswar Temple, where Sri Ramakrishna served as priest. Sri Sarada Math has nuns in residence in centers throughout the world.

Sarasvati The Sarasvati was one of the great rivers of R IG V EDIC times and was worshipped as a divine god- dess in the V EDAS . A handful of verses in the Vedas also associate her with the stream of the dead, which is crossed by all who die. The river Sarasvati dried up in ancient times. However, it is said still to be flowing invisibly, joining the G ANGES and Y AMUNA at Prayag (A LLA - HABAD ), one of the sites of the K UMBHA M ELA festival. In a stray verse or two of R IG V EDA , Sarasvati is seen as the goddess of knowledge—all the arts and sciences; this later becomes the primary identification of the name. She is iconographically represented as holding a vina or lute in her hands. She is the wife of B RAHMA . Her vehicle is the swan or peacock.

Satchidananda, Swami (1914–2002) founder of Integral Yoga Institutes and Yogaville Swami Satchidanada was a great popularizer of yoga both within India and around the world. His interfaith emphasis and his organizational efforts, especially in the United States, continue to bear fruit. Ramaswamy was born on December 22, 1914, to a devout family in Chettipalam, near Coim- batore in Tamil Nadu state. His father, Sri Kalya- nasunderam, was the village’s unofficial headman and his mother, Sri Velammai, entertained the vis- iting poets, musicians, philosophers, and astrolo- gers who frequented the family home. As a youth, Ramaswamy met SADHUS and SANNYASIS (holy men and penitents) in his own home, as he pursued skills in agriculture, mechanics, electronics, and cinematography. At age 28, he began a full-time spiritual quest that included meeting R AMANA Maharshi and Sri A UROBINDO . He became a disciple of Swami S IVANANDA of R ISHIKESH and took SANNYAS initia- tion from him in 1949. He taught as a professor of HATHA and raja YOGA at Sivananda’s Vedanta Forest Academy in Rishikesh and made extensive lecture tours throughout the world. He spread the teachings and the organization of Sivananda’s Divine Life Society in many parts of Asia, particu- larly Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, and the Philippines. In 1958 he completed a pilgrimage to Mount K AILASH in Tibet. In 1966, Satchidananda made his first global tour, sponsored by an American devotee. The intended two-day visit to New York extended to five months as he was surrounded by hundreds of students, eager for his teachings and guidance. The Integral Yoga Institutes were founded under his direction, and today there are Integral Yoga Institutes and Centers throughout the world. In 1976, he became a U.S. citizen. Satchidananda has been named patron and adviser to various organizations around the world, including the European Union of National Yoga Federations, the International Association of Yoga Teachers, Unity in Yoga, and the Temple of Understanding. He received many honors for his service, including: the Martin Buber Award for Outstanding Service to Humanity, the Juliet Hol- lister Interfaith Award, the B’nai Brith Anti-Defa- mation League’s Humanitarian Award, the Albert Schweitzer Humanitarian Award, and the U Thant Satchidananda, Swami 387 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 387 12/14/06 9:29:25 AM"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"Peace Award. He was also the recipient of several honorary doctorates and honorary titles. Satchidananda’s teaching centers around the principle “Truth Is One, Paths Are Many.” He sponsored many interfaith symposia, retreats, and worship services around the world. In 1986, he created a center dedicated to the light of all faiths and to world peace, called the Light of Truth Uni- versal Shrine (LOTUS), located at Satchidananda Ashram at Yogaville in Virginia. Yogaville serves as the international headquarters of the Integral Yoga Institutes and Centers. He died on August 19, 2002, in his native Tamil Nadu, South India.

In Vedanta, words can convey only a conven- tional description of the brahman or ultimate reality, which is beyond any characterizing or characteris- tics. Nevertheless, the combination of sat (Being as an ultimate category), chit (unlimited conscious- ness), and ananda (unlimited bliss) is often used to describe the ultimate. Those who achieve the highest level in YOGA , who realize oneness with the ultimate, are believed to be capable of knowing these categories beyond the words. Therefore, many realized SWAMIS use this appellation for themselves. The use of these terms to identify the supreme BRAHMAN began in the U PANISHADS (c. 600 B . C . E .); it became a common practice as later Vedanta developed.

(Ahmedabad: Gurjar Prakashan, 1989). Sati Sati is the first wife of S HIVA , later reincarnated as P ARVATI or Uma. She is the daughter of the sage D AKSHA , himself the son of B RAHMA . Brahma was concerned that the human universe would not come about if Shiva did not take a wife, so he com- pelled Daksha to produce a daughter, Sati, who was a form of the Great Goddess. He arranged to have her marry Shiva. To seduce Shiva, who was devoted to asceticism and did not want to marry, Sati practiced austerities and won his attention. They were quickly married with Brahma serving as the marriage priest. Daksha was not happy to have Shiva as his son-in-law. He held a great Vedic sacrifice and pointedly did not invite his daughter and son- in-law. When Sati complained to her father, he upbraided her. There are two versions of the suc- ceeding events. In one, she immolated herself in a fire. The later Hindu practice of a widow’s immo- lating herself on her husband’s funeral pyre took on the name of sati (suttee). In the second version, Daksha had been under a curse, that if he were to show disrespect to his daughter, she would die; when he upbraided her she simply fell to the ground dead. Shiva rushed to the site of the sacrifice, killed Daksha, and destroyed the entire ritual sacrifice ground. Both Daksha and the sacrifice were later restored in some versions—but not Sati. Shiva lifted Sati’s body and mournfully began to carry it about India. Since a dead body is considered highly polluting, Lord V ISHNU followed Shiva, gradu- ally cutting off pieces of Sati as they went along. Everywhere a piece of her fell, a shrine was estab- lished to the Great Goddess. These are variously said to number 54, 108, or some other number. sati (suttee) widow self-immolation Sati, the practice of burning widows on their hus- bands’ funeral pyres (as had happened with the goddess Sati), developed in post-Vedic India, as the rights of women, especially widows, greatly K 388 sat-chit-ananda 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 388 12/14/06 9:29:26 AM"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"deteriorated. Widows were almost considered to be dead. They had to shave their heads and dress in white with no decoration. They were consid- ered inauspicious and were often confined to the home. Because of the practice of marriage outside one’s clan in North India, spouses generally were from distant villages. As all marriages were patrilocal, a woman whose husband had died would find herself living with unrelated in-laws, who often did not look upon her kindly. If the woman had several children and particularly a son, she might draw comfort and status from them, but if she were newly married with no chil- dren, she looked forward to a life of ascetic denial and loneliness as remarriage was strictly forbid- den. As a result, many women succumbed to the social pressure of self-immolation on the fires of their husbands; it is documented that many oth- ers were coerced to do so. As an added incentive, in certain regions, the woman who became a sati was deified. In the 19th century the British colonial admin- istrators outlawed sati. Independent India also outlawed the practice, and it largely fell into dis- use after independence. However, the debate over the practice never completely ceased. With the modern Hindu revival some have argued that this traditional practice should be encouraged; this idea has spurred furious opposition from secular- ists and women’s groups.

Satya Sai Baba (1926– ) popular spiritual teacher and miracle worker Satya Sai Baba was born Satyanarayana Raju in the village of Puttaparthi, Andra Pradesh, to a pious K SHATRIYA family on November 23, 1926. At the age of 14 he quit school and disclosed to his parents that he was in fact the incarnation of S AI B ABA OF S HIRDI , the revered South Indian saint of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He left his family and stayed in the house of a B RAHMIN neighbor during adolescence; there he began to receive devotees. In 1950, the first ashram dedicated to the work of Satya Sai Baba was established near Put- taparthi. Later, other ashrams were established near Bangalore and Ootakamund. Satya Sai Baba is well known for his miracu- lous healings and materializations, and some claim that he has even raised the dead. He is known for materializing in his right hand objects such as rings, lockets, amulets, and fruits out of season. Devotees report that his photos in their homes in different parts of the world are repeat- edly covered with holy ash, vibhuti, even when he is not nearby. Satya Sai Baba has built several schools, universities, and one modern hospital in India. He is responsible for a number of social work programs: colleges for both boys and girls, educational courses on spirituality, community building projects, welfare programs for the poor, and clean water projects for South Indian communities. Claiming to be a full incarnation of K ALKI , ava- tar of the K ALI Y UGA , Sai Baba says that his task is to behave in a human way so that humankind can Satya Sai Baba 389 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 389 12/14/06 9:29:26 AM"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"feel kinship with him, yet to rise to superhuman heights to protect the virtuous and destroy evil. Quoting Lord K RISHNA ’s words in the B HAGAVAD G ITA , Sai Baba says that whenever disharmony overwhelms the world, the Lord will incarnate in human form to establish peace and to reeducate the human community. Sai Baba’s influence is considerable; active devotees and centers organized around his work and message exist throughout the world. His per- sonal conduct, however, has been the subject of numerous charges, including sexual misconduct and fraud. His international headquarters are in Puttaparthi, Andra Pradesh, India.

Satyavan See S AVITRI . Satya Yuga See K RITA Y UGA . Savitri mythic princess The story of Savitri and Satyavan, told in the Mahabharata, is one of the most poignant in Indian literature. The beautiful maiden Savitri falls in love with a hermit’s son, Satyavan, and marries him. Savitri learns from his father that unbeknown to Satyavan the boy has only one year to live. Savitri forebears from telling Satya- van, in order to preserve their precious days of happiness. The pair live in great delight as the bride tries to forget the curse that threatens their love. As the final day approaches Savitri furiously engages in prayers and penances to stave off the inevitable. On the final day she follows her husband closely into the woods where he has gone to fetch wood. Her husband soon collapses as the frightening figure of Y AMA , god of death, appears before them with a noose in his hand. Yama removes Satyavan’s soul and heads toward his domain, with Savitri in desperate pur- suit. Yama asks her to turn back, but she insists that she will follow him even to the underworld. Seeing her great devotion, Yama grants her any boon but that of having her husband restored to life. She takes this boon but insists on following farther. She gains two more similar boons but will not relent. Finally, Yama offers her a boon with- out exception and she asks that her husband be restored to life. The boon is granted and Satyavan returns to life. S RI A UROBINDO wrote an elegant and enchant- ing epic poem celebrating this story, in which he outlines his conception of Integral Yoga and the power of the M OTHER to effect the complete supra- mental transformation of the universe.

Several gods in the R IG V EDA seem to be associ- ated with the Sun, probably indicating that the Sun had different names at different times of the day or seasons of the year, or for different purposes. Savitri was often used in conjunction with S URYA , and the two may have been inter- changeable. Savitri is used in the famous G AYATRI M ANTRA , recited every morning by B RAHMINS and others. In the Rig Veda, Savitri is connected with several important rites.

Scandinavia The Scandinavian countries were preponderantly Christian until the middle of the 20th century; the Lutheran Church had been the established religion for centuries. While a spectrum of Christian sects appeared during the 19th century, the first break in the Christian consensus appears to have occurred early in the 20th century with the spread of T HEOS - OPHY to Scandinavia and the subsequent formation of several esoteric groups such as the Martinus Institute, founded in Denmark in the 1940s. Hinduism was introduced into Scandinavia in 1967 as a result of the teachings of Swami N ARAYANANANDA (1902–88), a YOGA teacher from Bengal. He had been discovered by some Danes who were traveling in India and they created the first ashram for his work in Gylling, Denmark. In 1969 they erected a house for Swami Naraya- nananda, who made his first trip to Europe in 1971. He regularly visited Europe throughout the rest of his life, and the Narayanananda Universal Yoga Ashrams spread to the other Scandinavian countries. As a youth, a Dane later known as Swami Janakananda (b. 1939) began practicing YOGA and MEDITATION . Then in 1968 he met Swami Satyananda Saraswati (b. 1923), founder of the I NTERNATIONAL Y OGA F ELLOWSHIP MOVEMENT , and went to India to study at the Bihar School of Yoga. He became a SWAMI , was given his spiritual name, and returned to his homeland two years later to found the Scandinavian Yoga and Medi- tation School in Copenhagen. Shortly thereafter he published Yoga, Tantra and Meditation in Daily Life, later translated into nine languages. In 1977, Janakananda organized “Meditation Yoga 77,” an international yoga congress held in Stockholm. He invited an international list of speakers, reflecting the many Indian teachers who would visit the Scandinavian school in suc- ceeding years. He later opened a retreat center in southern Sweden. As did Narayanananda’s move- ment, the school spread to the other Scandinavian countries. The first affiliated Norwegian school opened in 1983. In more recent years, other yoga centers, such as the Ashtanga Yoga Center of Hel- sinki, have opened in major Scandinavian urban centers. Already in the 1970s, the expansive I NTERNA - TIONAL S OCIETY FOR K RISHNA C ONSCIOUSNESS tar- geted the Scandinavian countries. They opened their first center in Sweden and eventually spread to Denmark and Finland. Today they maintain a large temple in Grodinge, some 25 miles south of Stockholm. In 1974, Sri C HINMOY (b. 1931) visited Iceland and subsequently formed the only Hindu commu- nity on the island. Chinmoy, noted for his physi- cal feats, once lifted the prime minister of Iceland as part of a weightlifting demonstration. In the 1980s, a small number of Indians began to find their way to Denmark and Sweden. By the beginning of the 21st century, there were some 1,500 Hindus in Sweden and around 3,500 in Denmark. Wherever concentrations of immi- grants settled, temples and community orga- nizations began to appear, among the first the Hindu Union in Jönköping, Sweden, founded in 1974.

It may also be noted that Indian migration to Scandinavia has also included some Sikhs; as of 2005 five gurudwaras were operating, two in Norway, two in Sweden, and one in Denmark.

Hinduism recognizes that individual abilities and interests vary con- siderably among people, so it acknowledges that self-realization can be achieved through devotion, study, faith, work in the world, or meditation. In this way, Hinduism includes disciplines for mind, emotions, body, and action in the world—all as valid ways to realization of ultimate reality, the atman. See also MOKSHA ; SAMADHI . Self-Realization Fellowship (est. 1935) The Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF) is an inter- national religious organization founded in 1935 by Paramahansa Y OGANANDA (1893–1952) to introduce people of all races, cultures, and creeds to the ancient science and philosophy of YOGA and MEDITATION . Through its worldwide service, the society seeks to foster a spirit of greater har- mony and goodwill among the diverse people and nations of the world, and a deeper understanding of the underlying unity of all religions. SRF traces its beginning to 1861 and the work of the legendary mahavatar B ABAJI , who is said by Yogananda to have revived the ancient science of KRIYA YOGA . According to Yogananda, Babaji chose him to take the teachings to the West. In 1917, Yogananda founded the Yogoda Satsanga Society (YSS) of India, headquartered in Dakshineswar (near Calcutta [Kolkata]). Today the YSS has more than 20 educational and medical facilities, including a college of liberal arts and business, a medical college, several schools for boys and girls, and both allopathic and homeopathic hos- pitals and clinics. In 1920 Yogananda traveled to the United States to attend the tercentenary anniversary of the International Congress of Reli- gious Liberals convening in Boston. One of the last Indians to enter America before the change in immigration laws limited Asian immigration, he K 392 Sekkilar 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 392 12/14/06 9:29:26 AM"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"decided to stay in the United States. He formed a center of the Yogoda Satsang in Boston, Mas- sachusetts, and traveled widely in the eastern United States. In 1924, Yogananda made his first trip across the country and founded the headquarters for his work at Mt. Washington in Los Angeles, California. He lectured in the principal cities of the United States, wrote inspirational works, and worked on a home study course on kriya yoga. After the founding of SRF in 1935, other centers were opened in California at Encinitas, San Diego, Hollywood, Long Beach, and Pacific Palisades, with smaller groups in other cities in the United States. During Yogananda’s years in the United States, he initiated thousands of men and women into the teachings and methods of yoga and medita- tion. Central to his teaching and that of SRF is a yogic way to bliss ( ANANDA ) or SELF - REALIZATION , or God realization. The way to bliss is through scientific methods of concentration, including an advanced technique called kriya yoga as taught and passed down by the yogi Babaji. This technique is a system of awakening and energizing the psychic centers or CHAKRAS located along the spinal column. Through deep regular meditation, spiritual cosmic energies are focused and direct perception of the divine is experienced. The blood is decarbonized and recharged with oxygen, the atoms of which are transmuted into “life current” to rejuvenate the brain and spinal centers. The practice makes it possible to withdraw one’s energy and attention from the usual turbulence of thoughts, emotions, and sensory perceptions. In the stillness that is dis- covered, one is able to experience peace and attun- ement with God. The term “Self-realization” as used by Yogananda, signifies realization of one’s true Self, or soul—the individualized expression of the one universal spirit that animates and informs all life. SRF also emphasizes the essential unity of Eastern and Western religious teachings. Services in SRF organizations include interpretations of parallel scriptural passages from the B HAGAVAD G ITA and Christian scripture, especially the New Testament. Yogananda was succeeded by Swami Rajasi Janakananda (James J. Lynn), who died in 1955 and was succeeded by Sri D AYA M ATA (b. 1914), the current head of the fellowship. SRF is coordinated by members of its monastic order. These monks and nuns serve Yogananda’s vision through worldwide spiritual and humani- tarian work, including over 100 meditation cen- ters, retreats, youth programs, publishing and translating programs, temple services, and coordi- nation of the Worldwide Prayer Circle, a network of groups and individuals dedicated to praying for those in need.

Self-Revelation Church of Absolute Monism (est. 1928) The Self-Realization Church of Absolute Monism was founded by Swami Premananda (1903–95), who was called in 1925 by Paramahansa Y OGA - NANDA to move to the United States. While inde- pendent of Yogananda’s primary organization in the United States, the Self-Realization Fellowship, the Church of Absolute Monism has much the same teaching focus. Both stress ADVAITA (non- dualist) V EDANTA , the life and philosophy of Mohandas Karamchand G ANDHI , the unity of all religions, the practice of kriya yoga, and cultural appreciation. The name absolute monism refers to the ancient philosophy of advaita Vedanta, which affirms that ultimate reality is non-dual. The church has linkages to the Mahatma Gan- dhi Memorial Foundation and has an accent on education and culture. The current leader of the church and of the Gandhi memorial center is Sri Mata Kamalananda. She was ordained a minister in the Swami Order in 1973, and a full swami in 1978.

Sen, Keshab Chunder (1838–1884) social reformer and philosopher Keshab Chunder Sen was a philosopher and social reformer, whose career reflected the variety of responses to the modern world that emerged in Hindu society. Sen was born on November 19, 1838, into a wealthy family in Calcutta (Kolkata) who were very involved in both Bengali and Western cul- tural movements. He was recruited at age 19 by Debendranath Tagore, father of the poet R ABIN - DRANATH T AGORE , to the celebrated B RAHMO S AMAJ reform movement, which attempted to purify Hinduism from practices such as caste, child mar- riage, purdah (seclusion of women), ill treatment of widows, and particularly idol worship. He became secretary of the movement in 1859. Sen broke away in 1865 because of personal disagree- ments and formed the Brahmo Samaj of India. This organization also split after Sen married his daughter to a maharajah when she was only 14 years old, an action that was seen as a major betrayal of the movement’s principles. In 1878 Sen formed the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj. His views had changed under the influ- ence of the teacher R AMAKRISHNA , who persuaded him to accept image worship and see the Hindu pantheon in a new light, as a way for the ordinary devotee to engage the divinity concretely. His New Dispensation, which he announced in 1879, has often been taken as tantamount to his conversion to Christianity, but it is more complicated. He considered his movement to be K 394 Self-Revelation Church of Absolute Monism 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 394 12/14/06 9:29:27 AM"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"on a par with the Jewish and Christian traditions and as a fulfillment of Christ’s prophecy. He also believed that his movement would lead to the harmonization of all religions. Though he referred to himself as Jesudas, servant of Jesus, he empha- sized Christ’s Asiatic character and saw Christ in a V EDANTIC light as the one god, who is worshipped under different names by all those who worship God. He died on January 8, 1884.

Sen, Ramprasad (c. 1718–c. 1780) Bengali poet-saint and Kali devotee Ramprasad Sen, who is often referred to by his first name alone, was a beloved Bengali poet-saint, whose songs are known to every Bengali. As for many of the poet-saints of India the details of his life are intermixed with myth. Simi- larly, as with K ABIR , his name and fame impelled other writers to compose many beautiful verses in homage to his works, particularly his collec- tion of songs known as Padabali. His other major attributed works are Bidyasundar, Kalikirttan , and Krishnakirttan . Ramprasad was probably born to a higher- caste Vaidya family of traditional physicians, possibly B RAHMINS . He was educated in S ANSKRIT and in Persian in addition to Bengali. He is said to have lived in the village of Kumarhatt, also known as Halishore, on the banks of the G ANGES not far from Calcutta (Kolkata). It seems certain that he was patronized by the contemporary king, Maha- raja Krishnachandra Ray Bahadur. Ramprasad started out as a clerk for a wealthy household in or near Calcutta. It is said that he was constantly distracted from his duties by thoughts of the GODDESS D URGA or K ALI . Legend says that one of his employers, upon seeing his beautiful verses to the goddess in his account books, told him to cease being an accountant and offered him a salary simply to continue compos- ing devotional verse. Legend also says that when Ramprasad was a little over 60 years old, he announced that on the day when the goddess was going to be immersed in the Ganges (either Kali or Durga Puja day), he also would be immersed with the Divine Mother. It is said that he slowly descended into the river, singing some of his farewell songs. He died sing- ing a song to the goddess Tara. In one of the amazing stories associated with Ramprasad he accompanied the maharajah on a journey on the Ganges. As usual he was sing- ing his devotional songs. The Muslim ruler of the area happened to overhear the song and was enchanted by it. The ruler requested Ramprasad to sing for him so Ramprasad sang a song in Mus- lim style. The Nawab, the Muslim ruler, was not pleased and asked him to sing a song to Kali. The Muslim was moved to tears and offered patron- age and high rank to Ramprasad, who declined them. Most importantly Ramprasad is a central fig- ure in the revival of Shaktism ( see S HAKTA ) or goddess worship in late 18th-century Bengal. His works typically show him drunk or mad with the goddess, and he cannot live without her. His work shows strong TANTRIC influence. Ramprasad’s poems to the goddess see her as a daughter, as a fierce wife of S HIVA , as the Divine Mother, and as his own mother. His sentiment in regard to her is very close to that of another famous Bengali, R AMAKRISHNA .

Shaiva Siddhanta See S AIVA S IDDHANTA . Shaivism Shaivism is the formal name for the group of tradi- tions that worship S HIVA as the supreme divinity. A person who worships Shiva will be called a Shaiva in India or a Shaivite in academic parlance. This loose sect, which encompasses by far the large majority of Hindus, probably began to form around the fifth or fourth century B . C . E . Worship of Lord Shiva is mentioned in both the R AMAYANA and M AHABHARATA epics. The first Shiva LINGAM authenticated archaeo- logically dates from about the first century C . E ., but it is likely that this type of worship was already many centuries old. Scholars often point to a very ancient Indus Valley seal showing a seated fig- ure with a water-buffalo-horned headdress and, apparently, an erect penis, both evocative of Shiva. It is called the Pashupati figure, “Lord of the Ani- mals,” which is also a later designation of Shiva. However, there is no other evidence to indicate worship of a Shiva-like being in the I NDUS V ALLEY CIVILIZATION . Some even discern a “yogic” seating posture in the figure, although Indians do tradi- tionally sit in that cross-legged pattern. The Shiva lingam is actually a sexual symbol showing the coitus of the divine male with the female. The sexual organ of the GODDESS is found in the surrounding circular stone that almost always encases the lingam. It is probably because of this primordial association of Shiva with the goddess that from his first appearance in mythol- ogy he is seen with a wife, S AT I , who tragically dies. She is afterward reincarnated as P ARVATI . At times Shiva is also associated with D URGA and K ALI . With Parvati the divine family develops with an older son, the elephant-headed G ANESHA , and a younger son, K ARTTIKEYA . The first formal Shaivite text may well be a Tamil text relating the worship of the younger son of Shiva, Murugan, another name of Karttikeya, dating from approximately the third century C . E . The first known Shaivite saint, a female ascetic, Karaikkalammaiyar, dates from around the fourth century. Not long after, stone temples were built to Shiva in South India, around the sixth century. As later all around India the central shrine was almost always a Shiva lingam. In a challenge to the Jains in Tamil Nadu, a group of great Shaivite saints began to wander from shrine to shrine and temple to temple sing- ing the praises of Lord Shiva. The three great saints associated with the Tamil Shaivite scripture T EVARAM date to the sixth to eighth centuries. They helped make Shaivism the most influential tradition in the region. The pattern repeated itself farther north in later centuries, as poet-saint devo- tees spread the word of Lord Shiva and popular- ized devotional worship. Shaivite puranas were first written in S ANSKRIT around the sixth century. They told extraordinary stories of the ascetic-erotic Lord Shiva, the chaotic Lord, who resisted household life and children and made trouble for the world and the gods. These puranas form the Sanskrit backbone for the Shaivite cult. By the 12th century Shaivism (as had V AISH - NAVISM ) in the Tamil country had fully assimilated the Sanskritic tradition of the north into the local traditions. Thus Shaivism developed a clear sense of continuity with northern Vedic Brahminism. Both Sanskrit and Tamil were honored as holy languages. Shiva undoubtedly had a northern Indian provenance. All the shrines that the south- ern Shaivite saints frequented were originally associated with local divinities, whom the saints recognized as forms of Shiva. Farther north, the V IRASHAIVA tradition devel- oped in the 12th century in Karnataka. The Viras- haivas did not accept icons and eschewed Vedic worship entirely. They were devoted only to Shiva as a formless indefinable divinity. Each Virashaiva K 396 Shaiva Siddhanta 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 396 12/14/06 9:29:27 AM"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"would simply wear a lingam around the neck to show devotion. Caste was outlawed and women were made equals to men in the tradition. Their path was devotional, and their desire was to real- ize the divine truth that was Shiva. Shaivite icons and temple artifacts appear much later in the north than in the south, but Shaivism was flourishing earlier nonetheless. Smaller shrines with Shiva lingams were appar- ently the norm, places where mendicants gath- ered, often to smoke hashish and sing the praises of the Lord who was everywhere. Between the eighth and 12th centuries the N AT H Y OGIS became prominent among the Shaivite wandering mendicants. Famed among these was the great GURU G ORAKHNATH . These wild, ascetic mendicants were antisocial and often frighten- ing in appearance, carrying begging bowls made of skulls and smearing themselves with human ashes to mimic the chaotic Lord himself. They practiced alchemy in an attempt to achieve immortality. When in the south an organized literature, liturgy, and temple culture had already emerged, North India Shaivism seemed to move along different lines. The Shaivite temple cult began to develop in North India around the ninth or 10th century, but truly dramatic temples were not built until some 600 years after they had appeared in the south. In the 12th century the great A BHINAVAGUPTA wrote his texts outlining K ASHMIRI S HAIVISM , a TANTRIC tradition that relied on personal transfor- mation and ritual to realize the total oneness of Shiva, rather than on a temple culture. His texts were no doubt based on traditions that had been maturing for centuries. Further reading: C. V.

Shakta The term Shakta refers both to the practitio- ner/devotee and to the faith, a female-centered religious tradition that evolved out of prehistoric Mother Goddess worship found in civilizations across the globe. The word Shakta derives from the divine feminine power or S HAKTI and indicates a worshipper of the Goddess primarily. Evidence of this Earth-based and female-centered tradition on the Indian subcontinent dates back perhaps as early as the I NDUS V ALLEY CIVILIZATION (3500 B . C . E .–1500 B . C . E .), where numerous Harrapan seals portraying female figures associated with vegetative symbolism have been found. The pre-Vedic Hindu tradition, with its God- dess-centered worldview, is often traced to the art and archaeological remains of the Harrapan and Mohenjo-daro civilizations. Although the point is contested, many scholars believe these findings definitively point to an early Earth-based, female/ goddess-centered religious tradition. Evidence for this tradition is clear as early as the fourth century, although Shakta itself is a relatively late post–eighth century term applied to those cults, scripture, or persons associated with the worship of the Goddess as Shakti. Before this time the term used for this type of Goddess worship was kula or kaula, a word also used to refer to clans of a female lineage, as well as to menstrual and female sexual fluids. It seems that this belief system whether called Kaula or Shakta, centered on the Goddess and her YONI , or sexual organ, as the primordial force of Earth and cosmos. A Shakta views the female principle as the ani- mating, dynamic force behind all existence while Shakta 397 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 397 12/14/06 9:29:28 AM"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"the male principle, especially in the later medieval tantric traditions, is considered to be the quies- cent, receptive force. In the Shakta tantric world- view, the masculine principle is a complementary force to the all-pervading female power. “Shiva without Shakti is but a corpse, it is said.” Central to Shakta theology is recognition of the interrelationships among the agricultural, lunar, and female reproductive cycles. All of existence is conceived as the power, wisdom, knowledge, and action of a Great Goddess. Shak- tas perform magical rites in order to ensure the continuation of both humans’ and Earth’s fertil- ity. Stones, trees, water, and iconic and aniconic images all are worshipped as embodiments of Shakti or the power of Goddess. Ritual practices also focus on placating deities in order to prevent natural disasters and illness. To a Shakta, the mys- teries of death as well as birth are considered the Goddess’s domain, stemming from the belief that we all originate from and will eventually return to the great Mother Goddess. From earliest times Shaktas have worshipped deities in multiple as well as singular form; they believe that the collectives are ultimately just dif- ferent aspects or manifestations of the supreme Goddess herself. These deities have strong asso- ciations with the natural and human landscape: trees, mountains, hills, bodies of water, and the female body—in particular the sex organs and sexual fluids. Yakshis and YAKSHAS (tree and nature spirits), Grahanis, Matrikas, and Yoginis (goddesses and semigoddesses who are always depicted with animal totems/vehicles) embody both benevolent and malevolent qualities. These deities are connected to the threshold experiences of women’s existence: childbirth, menstruation, sex, illness, and death. Devotees share the belief in the great goddess, Mahadevi, who assumes many forms to defeat any forces that are threatening the natural equi- librium of the Earth and cosmos. Each of these forms carries benevolent as well as malevolent qualities and all have crucial roles in the birth, fruition, preservation, and inevitable destruction of existence. Within the Brahminic fold, Shaktas today wor- ship goddesses such as P ARVATI , Gauri, Ganga, L AK - SHMI , S ARASVATI , and Uma for their pacific natures. At the same time the wrathful, often destructive goddesses such as D URGA , K ALI , C HAMUNDA , and the Matrikas and Yoginis are propitiated, revered, and especially held in awe. Within the Shakta worldview all women are regarded as inherently divine. The ebb and flow of women’s menstrual cycles in accordance with the 28-day lunar cycle are important to this tra- dition. The potency of kula, menstrual blood or other female fluids, plays a central role in rites and practices. The blood is revered for its vibrational potency and is offered to deities such as Kali, Durga, and the Matrikas as a means to pacify as well as worship. Although in orthodox practices animal sac- rifice has in some cases apparently replaced menstrual blood offerings, no female animals are offered to the deities. In many of the tantra texts relevant to this tradition, one finds descriptions of women that honor and revere their female nature; for example: “Women are divinity, women are vital breath. Women are goddess, women are life. Be ever among women in thought.” This is the nature of a Shakta. Contrary to the later Brahminic traditions’ immaterial conception of the universe as BRAHMAN , the Shakta views the divinity as both immanent and transcendent.

Although con- ceived as female in nature, Shakti is not an indi- vidual goddess, but rather a dynamic quality that all goddesses (and even all women, at least within the S HAKTA TANTRIC tradition) are said to possess. Unbridled, uncontainable, spontaneous, ecstatic, blissful, and fierce, Shakti flows from manifesta- tion to dissolution. She is the power to give forth and to withdraw. The concept of Shakti is an ancient one and has pre- VEDIC , prepatriarchal origins. She is often traced to archaeological discoveries from the I NDUS V ALLEY CIVILIZATION (3500–1700 B . C . E .) and to other prehistoric cultures throughout western and central Asia. In India the belief and worship of her all-pervading nature were pushed under- ground during the Vedic period. Shakti regains importance in classical and medieval Hinduism, in which in many cases this primordial power is personified as Devi, the GODDESS , and held in even higher regard than the male deities. Epic texts such as the Devi Bhagavata, Devi Purana, Kalika Purana, Markandeya Purana, and Mahabhagavata Purana accept and worship Shakti as the supreme nature of reality. From earliest times the concept of Shakti appears in discussions of fertility as well as in reverence of the divine as mother of nature and cosmos. In the R IG V EDA the term Shakti is not mentioned; however, various goddess manifesta- tions (Ratri, U SHAS , A DITI , P RITHIVI , Vac-Sarasvati, goddesses) indicate the presence and influence that would later develop into the central figures of the Shakti cult (K ALI , D URGA , Ambika, Uma) that are worshipped today. The later Shakta Upanishads and tantras ( see TANTRISM ) contain philosophical references to Shakti that equate her with BRAHMAN . In these texts the dynamic, all-pervading nature of brahman and Shakti as the fabric underlying all existence cannot be separated into two. In the Shakta U PA - NISHADS as well as in the later Shakta tantras we find references to Shakti’s independent omnipo- tent nature where the complementary receptive qualities of the masculine force as Shiva are “but a corpse” without her activating power. In the epic R AMAYANA , Shakti does not have the independent cult status that we find in the later epics; however, she is held in high regard. In the M AHABHARATA , Shakti once again regains the agency and importance that are evident in the prepatriarchal traditions. Here we learn of her invincible power as Durga and the Matrikas. She is also referred to as Kalika, Ambika, Bhadrakali, Parvati, Mahadevi, and by other names. Shakti continues to gain importance in the puranic texts, the earliest of which, the Mar- kandeya Purana, with its 13 chapters called the Durga Saptasai and Devi Mahatmya, elaborate the primordial all-pervading power of Devi. Here she is philosophically conceived as pure conscious- ness; the creator, preserver, and destroyer; the one and the many manifestations of supreme divinity. Shakti is both immanent and transcendent, illu- sive and manifest, moving and unmoving. She is knowledge, will, and action behind all existence. Here we find Goddess as the absolute reality, and yet she incarnates from time to time to help the gods to carry out her divine work. She also appears to help her devotees conquer the bonds of human suffering and the limitations of the physi- cal realm in order to achieve liberation. In the Markandeya Purana, the goddess is identified with PRAKRITI , the natural sustaining power of existence. She takes on various roles as mother, nurturer, warrior, lover to experience the LILA (play) of her divine consciousness. In the Devi Bhagavata Purana, Shakti is divided into three forms or qualities of existence: sattva (purity), rajas (passion), tamas (inertia). As Mahasarasvati, Mahalakshmi, Mahakali, the Goddess takes the universe from creation to destruction and back to creation again. The Goddess’s distinct iconographic forms are expres- sions of her multiple nature. She has both benevo- lent and pacific as well as wrathful and terrifying Shakti 399 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 399 12/14/06 9:29:28 AM"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"qualities. Her benevolent manifestations include Uma, Gauri, Parvati, Lakshmi, Sarasvati; her ter- rifying ones include Chamunda, Kali, Durga, the Mahavidyas, the Yoginis, and Matrikas. In the Shakta tantras Shakti becomes Para- shakti, the supreme reality who before manifest- ing through the physical world remains in a state of unmanifest repose. In this respect she is ineffable and indescribable. She is worshipped as Mahamaya or Mahadevi in addition to the numer- ous epithets that emphasize the myriad facets of her all-pervading nature. The acknowledgment and worship of the nature of reality as female, as the mobilizing energizing primordial force called Shakti, speaks strongly to the inherently autonomous nature of women. This concept of divinity as female ulti- mately lies in the biological reality of the female body, in particular the power of the womb. Today statues, YANTRAS , and other iconic objects of Shakti worship are not mere representations of Goddess and her ultimate power, but rather embodiments of her Shakti.

This touch is intended to awaken and make the KUNDALINI force rise from the base of the spine. The touching is usually done by the hand, but sometimes with a feather or other object, upon the adept’s head.

Legends around these sites can be found in the puranas and tantras ( see TANTRISM ), however, the stories and number of actual pithas vary; most commonly shakti pithas are located in India, Nepal, Tibet, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. The most popular story of how these pithas were created is found in the Puranas and tantras (Devibhagavata, VII, ch. 30; Kalika Purana, XVIII) and dates to the late medieval period. In this later development of a much earlier legend, the god D AKSHA is hosting a YA J N A (fire sacrifice) but does not invite his daughter, S AT I , because she has mar- ried the ascetic god S HIVA , and Daksha does not approve of Shiva’s antisocial qualities. When Sati learns that all the other deities have been invited to this ceremony and only she and her husband have been excluded, she is outraged and confronts her father at his temple. Staying true to his socially defiant ways, Shiva shows no concern about this family insult and refuses to go with her. Sati arrives alone and confronts her father. According to this version of the myth, Daksha grossly insults both his daughter and her wayward K 400 shaktipat 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 400 12/14/06 9:29:28 AM"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"husband. To assuage her grief, Sati throws herself on the fire. She dies but her body does not burn up in the flames. Hearing of the loss of his wife, Shiva becomes mad with grief. Inconsolable, he wanders the Earth carrying his beloved on his shoulder. In order to stop Shiva’s dance of destruction and to relieve him of the burden of his grief, the gods B RAHMA and V ISHNU decide someone must intervene. Vishnu, the great preserver, follows Shiva and cuts away at Sati’s body. The fallen pieces of her body and limbs create over 50 shakti pithas, which today are worshipped as sites sacred to one of the many manifestations of D EVI such as Kameshvari, Tara, Ambika, and Gauri. A bhairava or fierce form of her beloved Shiva is often associ- ated with each of these sites. These pithas have also been associated with the 51 letters of the Sanskrit alphabet. The earliest mythological explanation of the pithas can be found in the R IG V EDA (X.61.5–7). Here we find the earliest association between the sacrifice and desecration of body parts that later is central to the Sati dismemberment myth. Other legends tell of four important pithas that are associated with the four cardinal directions. These four sites (Kamarupa, Uddiyana, Jaland- hara, Purnagiri) have been important pilgrimage centers to yoginis and yogis. Some legends speak of seven pithas; others speak of as many as 108 across the subcontinent. Clearly these sites point to local cults of wor- ship of the goddess in various manifestations. Today many of these places have become pilgrim- age centers to the goddess as Shakti: Ambika, Parvat, Sati, Durga, Kaliet, and others. The various legends in the tantras and Puranas are later myth- ological explanations for what were originally sacred Goddess sites. For millennia the Goddess has been embed- ded in the natural landscape. Lakes, ponds, or pools have been conceived as her yoni; double hills or mountains, her breasts. The pitha asso- ciated with the Goddess’s breasts at Jalandhara- giri, and her yoni or sexual organ at K AMAKHYA remain two of the most frequented and revered sites for contemporary pilgrims. To ancient peo- ples the Earth itself was the divine mother, and the popularity of these sites reflects an attempt of later cultures to integrate these earlier tradi- tions into their worship in order to attract more followers. At the pithas the Goddess is usually wor- shipped in an iconic form. Often she is revered as a stone that has been painted red (red is the color of Shakti). Sometimes eyes and other anthropo- morphic features are added. Originally these sites were worshipped under various names of the local tribal deities that later became syncretized into the Brahminic fold of goddesses. This is evident, in part, from the great variations in the lists of shakti pithas and the names connected with them. Further reading: K. C.

It is made of black ammonite, from Mount Gandaki in Nepal. A story in the B HAGA - VATA P URANA (c. 1200 C . E .) explains why this black stone is used for worship; another account is in the T ULSIDAS Ramcharitmanas (c. 1600 C . E .). In the worship, water is dripped on the stone and collected beneath. The water is later drunk by the worshipper. Sometimes the shalagrama is shown to dying persons to ensure that they go to Vishnu’s heaven Vaikuntha, as it is seen to have sacred power. shalagrama 401 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 401 12/14/06 9:29:28 AM"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"Further reading: Abee J.

E .) founder of Vedanta philosophy Shankara was the great seventh-century philo- sophical genius who created the first widely known school of V EDANTA . He is also known as Shankaracharya. Shankara was born in Kerala to a family of Nambudiri B RAHMINS , a strict Vedic group. Legend has it that when he was eight years old he wanted to become a renunciant, but his mother would not hear of it. Not long afterward, he was attacked by a crocodile. He cried out to his mother to allow him to renounce the world a moment before death so that he could reach liberation from birth and rebirth. His mother consented, and Shankara was miraculously released from the mouth of the crocodile. He then proceeded to tour India and debate all those whom he encountered. Eventually he became known as the most brilliant philosopher of his time. Following the lineage of his GURU ’s guru Gaudpada, he argued that the BRAHMAN of the U PANISHADS was the only reality. He saw the world as a mere trifle, an illusion, or M AYA , unreal from the point of view of the ultimate. Shankara wrote commentaries on the V EDANTA S UTRA , the Upanishads, and the B HAGAVAD G ITA . In a thoroughgoing analysis he found that they all expressed the understanding that only the path of knowledge, the true knowing of the brahman, could lead to liberation. Devotion and works were only secondary pursuits. He initiated a tra- dition of renunciant yogis (the S HANKARACHARYA O RDER ) who sought the full realization of the brahman in a state of being, consciousness, and bliss ( SAT - CHIT - ANANDA ). Shankara’s name is also connected strongly to S HAIVISM and to the wor- ship of the G ODDESS , through texts that were later attributed to him. Shankara’s system of Vedanta is known as the ADVAITA , or non-dual, V EDANTA , or more properly, Kevala (absolute) advaita Vedanta. Further reading: S. N.

Shankaracharya Order (est. seventh century C . E .) The Shankaracharya Order is an order of renun- ciants said to have been founded by the great seventh-century V EDANTA philosopher S HANKARA (also known as Shankaracharya). It is formally known as the Dashanami (10 Names) Order, because its renunciants or SANNYASIS all take one of 10 names: Aranya, Ashrama, Bharati, Giri, Parvata, Puru, Sarasvati, Sagara, Tirtha, and Vana. They also add the affix ANANDA (transcendent bliss). Examples would be Brahmananda (he who has realized the bliss of BRAHMAN ) Sarasvati and Agehananda (he who has realized bliss in home- lessness) Bharati. Shankaracharya’s aim was to establish a rigor- ously disciplined, intellectually capable group of mendicants who could challenge and defeat the Buddhists of his time and who would debate the theistic Hindus who clung to Vedic orthodoxy. He established four centers or MATHS in four parts of India for this purpose: the Vimala Pitha at Puri in Orissa, the Jyoti Matha in B ADRINATH in the H IMALAYAS , the Kalika Pitha in D VARAKA in K 402 Shankar, Sri Sri Ravi 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 402 12/14/06 9:29:28 AM"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"Gujarat, and the Sharada Pitha in Shringeri in Karnataka. It is still said that the Dashanamis of the Shan- karacharya Order are the most respected group of religious mendicants in India. They are highly learned in S ANSKRIT and V EDANTA philosophy and often are educated in English as well. The order is devoted to noninjury and nonviolence; however, they hired militant mendicants carrying tridents to defend them against attacks by militant Vaish- navite SADHUS or mendicants. Battles between these groups are famous for their carnage. There are currently six “regiments” of Dashanami NAGAS , special naked renunciants who defend the faith. The heads of the four maths are all named Shankaracharya. They oversee extensive organiza- tions with schools and social outreach centers. These schools rely on a network of locally trained Sanskrit pandits, experts who train students in the traditions of Hinduism, making these maths a valuable cultural resource.

The reference is not to world peace, but to the spiritual peace that is understood to accrue to an individual with MEDITATION and even more so with higher realization. Many MANTRAS in S ANSKRIT end with the chant om shantih shantih shantih, or “ OM , peace, peace, peace.” Further reading: Puran Bair, Living from the Heart: Heart Rhythm Meditation for Energy, Clarity, Peace, Joy, and Inner Power (New York: Three Rivers Press, 1998); Clint Willis, ed., Why Meditate?

Shanti Mandir (est. 1987) The Shanti Mandir (Temple of Peace) was estab- lished by Swami Nityananda (b. 1962), brother of Gurumayi Chidvilasananda, not to be confused with Swami Nityananda, the guru of Swami M UK - TANANDA , in 1987, to promote the Shaivite teach- ings of Swami Muktananda, head of the popular Siddha Yoga Dham. Shanti Mandir now has centers in Atul, Gujarat, India; Kankhal, Uttarandchal, India; and Walden, New York. Prior to his death in 1982 Muktananda had chosen a brother and sister team—Nityananda and Swami C HIDVILASANANDA , to coadminister the huge worldwide organization he had built. In 1986 Nityananda withdrew from Siddha Yoga Dham amid tension, controversy, disruption, and questions about his ability to administer the group. He renounced his vows of SANNYAS , entered private life, and set up a MEDITATION practice in California. In July 1987, he established Shanti Mandir (Temple of Peace), over the objections of Siddha Yoga Dham devotees who questioned his authen- ticity and authority. After two years of building Shanti Mandir on December 26, 1989, Nityananda took a quick plunge in the G ANGES near H ARIDVAR and reaffirmed his vows of sannyas and commit- ment to Muktananda. The Mandir in all three of its locations offers courses and meditation intensives and initiates students, using the chanting of MANTRAS as a pri- mary practice. Nityananda also holds seminars, retreats, and workshops in the United States, Aus- tralia, and Europe.

Shashthi Shashthi, “the sixth,” is a GODDESS meant to repre- sent the sixth day after the birth of a child, when it is understood that danger to both the child and the mother has ended. She is believed to protect children from evil and illness. Shashthi is best known in Bengal, where she is worshipped by married women who desire children. She is rep- resented as a golden-complexioned woman with a child in her arms, riding on a cat. There is a Bengali belief that women should never harm a cat because doing so will incur the anger of Shashthi. Festivals are held several times a year to honor this goddess. The husband of a family must worship her on the sixth day after a child’s birth. A wife must make offerings to her after the child’s third month. Women who do not have children go to her to ask for children; many other gods are also approached for this purpose. Further reading: Donald S.

For example, the A RTHASHAS - TRA is an authoritative scripture on artha (worldly action) as it relates to a king. The D HARMASHAS - TRA is authoritative scripture concerning DHARMA (right conduct).

Shatapatha Brahmana The Shatapatha Brahmana (c. 700 B . C . E .) is one of the most important texts for the interpretation of late Vedic ritual ( see V EDAS ). Its treatment of certain ritual ideas may have strongly influenced later Hindu philosophical developments. This B RAHMANA is attached to the White Y AJUR V EDA . The most important part of the Shatapatha Brahmana is its elaboration on the grandest of public Vedic rites, the AGNICHAYANA or “build- ing of the fire altar.” It explains this ritual as a reenactment of the sacrifice of the primordial man or PURUSHA , which created the universe. The ritual thus becomes a cosmic process transcend- ing every mundane action. The various B RAHMINS performing the ritual identify themselves in turn with various aspects of the universe; one Brah- K 404 Shashthi 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 404 12/14/06 9:29:29 AM"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"min is water, another the Sun, another the wind, and so on. This was the first Brahmana in the Vedas to make explicit the central notion that the ritual itself could represent all of reality, both seen and unseen. Over the centuries, as the ritual actors identified more and more with the ritual itself, an esoteric or highly secret form of ritual emerged, carried out within the body of the Brahmin rather than on a public ground. The priest (a highly initiated Brahmin) began to identify himself not only with the ritual, but with all reality. Thus was created the background for the philosophy of the U PANISHADS , in which the identity of the individual self merged with the ultimate reality, the BRAHMAN . Further reading: G. V.

The outermost sheath, which coincides with the human body, is the “food” sheath, the grossest aspect of being. Within that in the body at a subtler level is the “breath” or “life” sheath, which assures bodily sustenance, along with food. Within that in the body at another level is the “mind” sheath, which guides grosser instinctual functions and the sur- face aspects of nervous activity. Within this sheath is the sheath of “understanding,” which overlooks higher and more refined mental functioning. Finally, there is the “bliss” sheath, which is the covering for the soul itself. Some V EDANTA philosophies see these sheaths as simply “not-soul”; the spiritual process gradu- ally rejects them in favor of the self or soul within the heart. Another, more holistic view, sees the spiritual effort as a process of full realization of these sheaths, and their integration with the real- ized self, the secret foundation of the sheath that consists of bliss.

Her name in Sanskrit means “cold” and refers to chill that accompanies the fever of smallpox. Though smallpox has been eradicated, Shitala is still wor- shipped in India to prevent or allay any serious disease. Shitala is understood both to cause disease and to cure it. Sometimes her worshippers paint marks on their faces to mimic the pox. In a way that is not completely clear, the disease itself is seen as grace of the goddess—and her grace removes the disease as well. Shitala is worshipped all over northern India. In South India the same goddess is called M ARI - YAMMAN . Shitala’s shrines are mainly found in the countryside. Her iconography is a golden-com- plexioned female sitting on a lotus or riding on an ass. She is dressed in red clothes. When Shitala is worshipped, presents are made to her to gain her favor. If a person is cured, a larger gift is given. Her flower offerings are sometimes put in the hair of children after worship, to protect them against disease. A seriously ill individual might be placed directly in front of the image of Shitala to aid in the cure.

Shiva Shiva, “the beneficent one,” is the divinity at the center of the largest Hindu religious sect. The tra- dition identifies Shiva with the Vedic god R UDRA , a fierce divinity who caused diseases of cattle and men and was propitiated out of fear. Rudra was known by the epithet shiva (as he was known to relent). Shiva as a separate divinity first appears in the R AMAYANA (c. 600–300 B . C . E .) and M AHABHARATA (c. 700 B . C . E .–100 C . E .) epics; he is cited in the S HVETASHVATARA U PANISHAD (c. 300 B . C . E .) as the highest divinity. Clearly Shiva has ancient roots in North India. Some see his form in a seal from the I NDUS V ALLEY CIVILIZATION (c. 2600 B . C . E .) showing a seated figure with a buffalo-horned headdress and an erect penis. It is clear that the worship of Shiva is quite ancient, many centuries more ancient than the first extant S HIVA LINGAM , which dates to the first century C . E . The LINGAM is an erect penis; it is the aniconic form that represents Shiva in the inner sanctum of virtually all temples dedicated to him. The lingam is nearly always shown surrounded by a circular stone rim that represents the YONI , or sexual organ, of the goddess, indicating his association with the divine feminine from a very early time. In the stories of Shiva he is found first with his wife, S AT I , who tragically dies, and then with Sati’s reincarnated form P ARVATI . His divine family includes the amusing elephant-headed god G ANE - SHA , Shiva and Parvati’s elder son, and K ARTTIKEYA , the eternal youth with his peacock vehicle. The basic Shiva myth depicts him in his youth as a fierce, ascetic naked wanderer with matted locks and smeared with ashes from human crema- tion grounds. He gads about willfully, not observ- ing any social convention. This all changes after the gods learn that only a son of Shiva can defeat the demon that is trying to usurp their power. They send Parvati to seduce him and then send the god of love to induce him to succumb. The uncooperative Shiva simply burns the god of love to ashes. Eventually, however, Shiva does take to Par- vati, and their lovemaking is famous in the lit- erature. As they make love in a beautiful pleasure grove, his passion is so strong that everything in the grove becomes female—including an unfor- tunate king who happens into the grove. Shiva’s son was actually born by accident when he spilled his semen into fire. The fire could not contain the energy and so gave the seed to the G ANGES .

Shivananda Saraswati, Swami (1887– 1963) founder of Divine Life Society Swami Shivananda Saraswati was an Indian saint, YOGA teacher, and author of more than 200 books on spirituality. Through his disciples, he played a major role in spreading Hinduism and YOGA throughout the world. Kuppuswami Iyer was born on September 8, 1887. His father was a pious Hindu government official who sent him to college and to medical school. His father died before he finished medi- cal training and Kuppuswami was forced to leave school. Nevertheless, he maintained his interest in medicine and began a medical journal that specialized in preventive medicine and the Indian A YURVEDIC system of health. He administered a hospital in Malaya, where his meeting with a wandering holy man inspired his own spiritual search. Returning to India he began a pilgrimage around the country. He settled in the holy city of R ISHIKESH , where he was initiated into SANNYAS (renunciation) by Swami Viswananda Saraswati and given the name Swami Shivananda Saraswati. Living at Swargashram on the G ANGES River, he devoted himself to MEDITATION , study, and giving of spiritual guidance to a growing group of disci- ples. He emphasized BHAKTI YOGA and KARMA YOGA and opened a dispensary to serve the residents of the ASHRAM . In 1934 he established his own ashram, Ananda Kutir (Abode of Bliss), across the river in Rishikesh. It had a dispensary and meditation rooms for silent retreats. In 1936 he founded the Divine Life Trust with the goal of spiritualizing all of India. The Divine Life Society was begun as an auxiliary to the trust, and a monthly periodi- cal was begun. Swami Shivananda also began the Forest Academy to train students in his teaching. He died on July 14, 1963. Although Swami Shivananda’s health pre- vented him from visiting the West, he became one of the most influential forces in the dis- semination of Hinduism and yoga throughout the world through his students and disciples. His student Swami Shivananda R ADHA (Sylvia Hill- man) founded the Y ASODHARA A SHRAM S OCIETY in Vancouver. Another student, Swami Vishnude- vananda, founded a chain of S HIVANANDA Y OGA V EDANTA C ENTERS in the United States and Can- ada. In 1959, Swami Chidananda, Shivananda’s successor as head of the Divine Life Society, orga- nized the society in the United States. Another student, Swami J YOTIRMAYANANDA , founded the Yoga Research Society in 1962, and S WA M I S AT - CHIDANANDA created the Integral Yoga Institute in 1966. His disciple and secretary of the Divine Life Society, Swami K RISHNANANDA , although he did not travel to the West, wrote extensively and welcomed seekers from the West to the ashram in Rishikesh.

Shivananda Yoga Vedanta Centers (est. 1958) Shivananda Yoga Vedanta Centers were founded by Swami Vishnudevananda (1927–93), based on the teachings of his GURU Swami Shivananda S ARASWATI (1887–1963) of R ISHIKESH . Shivananda developed an integral system of YOGA , joining the four traditional paths ( BHAKTI , KARMA , JNANA , and raja ) with the addition of japa (repetition of a mantra). He established an ASHRAM and dispen- sary in Rishikesh, India, and later established the Divine Life Society there. Swami Vishnudevananda became a disciple of Swami Shivananda in 1947 after reading Sivana- nda’s books. Over the course of a decade Vishnu- devananda was personally trained by Shivananda and became one of his most accomplished yoga students, adept at hatha yoga and raja yoga. In 1957 Shivananda instructed Vishnudevananda to spread his teachings in North America. Vish- nudevananda established headquarters the fol- lowing year in Montreal, Quebec, and continued to found centers across the United States. In 1962 the Shivananda Ashram Yoga Camp in Quebec was formed and in 1967 Vishnudevananda estab- lished the Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat in the Bahamas. He also founded the True World Order, a peace mission that began in 1969 to organize demonstrations for nonviolent struggle. The orga- nization is known for conducting air drops of leaflets and flowers over conflict-filled areas in the world. The most notable mission occurred in Belfast in 1970. Although Shivananda never traveled to North America, Vishnudevananda assured the spread of his message. Sivananda’s system of yoga con- tinues to be a central teaching at the Vedanta centers, with an emphasis on hatha yoga and raja yoga. There are currently about 80 ashrams and centers around the world, including 14 in the United States. Over 10,000 teachers have been trained. The Shivananda Yoga Vedanta Centers have earned the reputation of preserving the qual- ity and tradition of yoga. Shivananda Yoga Vedanta Centers have pub- lished several books including Vishnudevananda’s The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga, which has sold millions of copies. The center also produces a periodical, Yoga Life, that is available free through the organization’s Web site, www.sivananda.org.

Shiv Sena (est. 1966) Shiv Sena is a Maharastrian nationalist group founded in 1966 as a response to a wave of immi- grants to the state and the city of Bombay (Mum- bai) from Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Punjab. The movement tries to protect the interests of middle- class Maharashtrians in the conflict for resources and power. Shiv Sena is primarily a political and ethnic movement, not a religious movement. However, it uses some religious doctrines to sup- port its political and ideological claims. The founder of the movement is Balasaheb (Bal) Thackeray (he currently uses the name Don Balasaheb ), who is also editor of the Marathi newsletter Marmik, which promotes the group’s ideology. By 1968, Shiv Sena turned their struggle against communists and Muslims.

More recently Shiv Sena has begun to recruit members of the lower castes, particu- larly Dalits. In 1992 Shiv Sena boasted that it played a central role in the destruction of the Babri Masjid Mosque in A YODHYA . In fact, Shiv Sena activ- ists arrived after the demolition, but they were heavily involved in the riots that followed in Mumbai. More recently Shiv Sena has formed an alli- ance with the B HARATIYA J ANATA P ARTY (BJP). Since the BJP losses in the 2004 election the alliance appears to be collapsing. As Bal Thackeray ages, much of the leadership has fallen to his sons, a condition that has weakened the group as a politi- cal force.

Shruti texts are the primary authority in Hinduism; they are complemented, but never superseded, by smriti, or human-made texts. Shruti texts are understood to be heard from a transcendent source. The V EDIC MANTRA texts and their adjuncts, the B RAHMANAS , which include in them the A RANYAKAS and U PANISHADS , are accepted by all as being shruti. These texts are considered to have been “heard” or “seen” by the Vedic RISHIS (seers).

Shudra The term Shudra originates in the ancient R IG V EDA ; it refers to the servant class, as the lowest group in a four-part division ( VARNA ) of human society. It is used in present-day India for castes that are low in the social hierarchy, such as bar- bers, washermen, and others who perform per- sonal services. Each region of India has its own notions of what constitutes a Shudra. Below the Shudras in the informal caste hierarchy (the caste system was l egally abolished after independence) are the Shudra 409 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 409 12/14/06 9:29:30 AM"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"Dalits , untouchables, who are sometimes referred to as the “fifth” and “unclean” stratum of society.

Shurpanakha See R AMAYANA . Shvetambara Shvetambara is one of the two branches of J AINISM . The name, which means “one who wears white gar- ments,” refers to the fact that its monks may wear clothing, as opposed to the D IGAMBARA monks, who are required to be nude. The Shvetambaras prevail among the Jains of northern and western India. There is little doubt that M AHAVIRA , the great leader and promulgator of the Jain tradition, was a naked ascetic, as were his early followers, but the scriptures that are recognized by the Shvetambaras do not require nudity. The Shvetambaras accept the extant version of the early Jain scriptures, the A NGAS , and they follow, study, and preach its teachings. The Digambaras believe the authentic versions have been lost. The only text mutually accepted by both Shvetambaras and Digambaras is the T ATTVARTHA S UTRA . Shvetambaras also believe that women may attain liberation. Because women are not allowed to be naked ascetics, Digambaras believe that they cannot reach the level of detachment needed to become liberated; a woman must be reborn in a male body to reach liberation. Shvetambaras believe that Mallinatha, one of the 24 T IRTHANKARAS (saints) of our half-era ( avasarpini ), was a woman. In general Digambaras (who predominate in southern India) and Shvetambaras are in nearly complete doctrinal agreement, but their com- munities developed separately and do not share festivals or sacred events. The Shvetambaras cel- ebrate their major festival Paryushan around the recitation of the Kalpa Sutra. In the past, the two communities have fought bitterly over control of certain shrines, but in general they live in comity in places where they overlap.

E ., making it one of the later U PANISHADS . It is the only orthodox Upanishad that refers to a sectarian divinity, in this case R UDRA -S HIVA . It understands Shiva to be the same as the B RAHMAN , the ultimate reality, who had not previously been characterized in purely theistic terms. The text equates the terms PURUSHA , which is the person from whom the world evolved in the Vedas, AT M A N (soul or self), BRAHMAN , and God, so as to make clear the identity of all des- ignations for the highest. The theistic quality of this text is developed in later Hindu theism and in theistic or God-oriented V EDANTA .

Several of the names are shared in a corresponding Tibetan Buddhist Siddha tradition. The most famous Siddha master was G ORAKHNATH (Gorakshanatha); his name is included in both Tibetan and Indian lists. In India he is supposed to have been born between 900 and 1200 C . E . The Siddhas practiced alchemy, ingesting poi- sonous oxides of mercury to achieve bodily immortality. They were known for their extreme asceticism, antisocial behavior, frightening appear- ance, and supernatural powers. They were often also associated with magical healing. The Siddhas were tantric and accepted membership from any caste. The modern tradition of S WA M I M UKTANANDA refers to itself as Siddha Yoga; it reveres a lineage of Siddha masters who have characteristics in common with Siddhas elsewhere, but of course also the 84 Siddhas of tradition.

Siddhaswarupananda, Jagad Guru (1948– ) independent bhakti yogi The American-born yogi Jagad Guru Siddhaswa- rupananda was a teacher in the I NTERNATIONAL S OCIETY FOR K RISHNA C ONSCIOUSNESS (ISKCON) before forming his own offshoot organization. Chris Butler was born in 1948 in New Orleans, Louisiana, but moved to Hawaii as an infant and grew up in the islands. His interest in religion in general and YOGA in particular emerged during his last years of high school. He studied with the YOGA teachers available to him and experienced SAMA - DHI sublime consciousness. As a young man, he founded the Haiku School of Nirvana Yoga (also known as the Haiku Meditation Center) on the island of Maui, where he taught A SHTANGA Y OGA and KUNDALINI YOGA . Around 1970 he met Srila B HAKTIVEDANTA S WAMI P RABHUPADA , the founder of ISKCON. Butler accepted Bhaktivedanta’s teaching of devotional or BHAKTI yoga and his emphasis on a personal deity, as opposed to Butler’s previous belief in an imper- sonal divinity. Butler closed his work in Hawaii and accepted an initiation from Bhaktivedanta to join his movement. He remained with ISKCON until after Prabhupada died in 1977. In the year after Bhaktivedanta died, Butler concluded that his GURU had emerged as a non- appointed pure devotee who held his status by virtue of his own spiritual attainment, not via his relationship to the G AUDIYA M AT H center. Shortly before his death Bhaktivedanta, following the example of his guru, Bhaktisiddhanta, appointed 12 men to manage the math. Similarly, Bhaktive- danta appointed 12 men to manage ISKCON. None of these appointees was a guru by virtue of this appointment; each could be a guru only as an unappointed, but accomplished, devotee. Butler assumed that he was such an unap- pointed guru, and, in 1978, as Jagad Guru Sid- dhaswarupananda, he began to initiate disciples. He founded the Science of Identity Foundation as a vehicle to facilitate his teachings. He has led a rather low-key existence, traveling constantly and staying in various locations for relatively short periods as he is invited by his initiates. He has written several short books and produced a vari- ety of video and audio materials for his followers.

Tradition- ally, there are eight siddhis: (1) the ability to grow extremely small, (2) the ability to become extremely light, (3) the ability to become extremely heavy, (4) the ability to touch any object however distant, (5) irresistible will, (6) supremacy over body and mind, (7) dominion over the elements, (8) ability to fulfill all desires. Numerous other powers are also listed in the tradition, such as the ability to fly, physical immortality, the ability to enter another’s body, and knowledge of the past, present, and future. P ATANJALI ’s system and certain other yoga systems such as that of the Theravada Buddhists downplay siddhis as distractions from the path of liberation; adepts are warned not to indulge themselves in these powers, lest they be sidelined in their spiritual progress. Certain systems such as the TANTRA , though, encourage the attainment of siddhi and allow its usage to a greater or lesser degree, depending upon the particular sect.

Sikhism The Sikh religion emerged at the beginning of 16th century C . E . in the Punjab, a territory hotly contested by Hindus and Muslims at the time. It aimed to find the truths common to both faiths, placing less emphasis on laws and rituals and soon emerged as a third, well-organized, Indian religious community. Though raised as a Hindu, Sikhism’s founder, N ANAK (1469–1539), began his adult life in the employ of a Muslim, as was his father. A thought- ful and inwardly oriented youth, he spent periods each morning and evening as a young man in MEDITATION . In his 30th year, his communion with the divine led to an intense experience of God in which he experienced God as the one creator. As a result of the encounter, he quit his job and gave away all his possessions. He began to proclaim his unique message that there is no Hindu and no Muslim. Sikhism would emerge as he began to articulate his message, drawing together what he saw as the best from both faiths. He shared the message in a set of hymns. His message sought to discover what he saw to be the essence of the religious teach- ings around him. In the place of many religious acts, from praying on a prayer mat or living as a renunciant, he called upon people to cultivate the virtues these actions symbolized. For example, he suggested that the essence of asceticism was to remain pure amid impurities. He also called for a casteless society without distinctions based on the family into which one is born. He traveled from Sri Lanka to Tibet spreading his message, although Kashmir and the Punjab proved most receptive. Before his death in 1539, Nanak selected a disciple whom he had named Angad (1504– 52) as his successor. Angad would be followed by eight additional GURUS who were selected K 412 Siddha Yoga Dham 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 412 12/14/06 9:29:31 AM"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"to lead the Sikh community: Guru Amar Das (1479–1574), Guru Ram Das (1534–81), Guru Arjan Dev (1563–1606), Guru Hargobind (1595– 1644), Guru Har Rai (1630–61), Guru Harkrishan (1656–64), Guru Tegh Bahadur (1621–75), and Guru Gobind S INGH (1666–1708). Each of the 10 gurus made his contribution to the development of the faith. For example, the fourth guru began construction on what would become the Golden Temple in A MRITSAR , the phys- ical center of the Sikh community. The formation of the Sikh community, the Khalsa (the pure ones), was completed by the 10th guru, Gobind Singh. He saw to the baptism of new members into the Khalsa by sprinkling with sweetened water stirred with a sword. At the time, each male adopted the name Singh (lion) as his family name. As a visible sign of membership in the community, each male also began to wear the five K’s: (1) kesh, long hair; (2) kangh, a comb; (3) kach, short pants (for quick movement); (4) kara, a steel bracelet; and (5) kirpan, a knife. Through the years, the writing of the gurus were compiled in a book, the Adi Granth. The fifth guru, upon the completion of the Golden Temple, formally installed the volume in the temple, much as Hindus installed statues of dei- ties in their temples.

Since that time, while there are teachers of Sikhism who convey the faith to each new generation, there is no human to whom the status of GURU (teacher) is formerly ascribed. Wherever Nanak traveled, he established local groups called manjis. Over the years, these would mature as gurudwaras, seats of the guru or Adi Granth, the worship centers in which Sikh com- munities gather on a weekly basis. While it had been Nanak’s goal to create a synthesis that would dissolve the differences between Muslim and Hindu, both faiths contin- ued and Nanak’s work had the effect of creating a new religion. A minority community, Sikhs were frequently forced to defend themselves and emerged with a reputation as great warriors. At times aligned with the British, they served with distinction in battles throughout the 19th century, in both India and abroad. Since the death of the last guru, temporal authority in the community passed to the Sri A KAL T AKHT Sahib, a name used to refer to both a building close to the Golden Temple and the Sikh leader who operates from the building. All the issues of import to Sikhs are debated there, and the decrees issued from it are considered binding on the entire community internationally. Another important structure in the community is the Shromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (S.G.P.C.). It oversees the administration of the worship centers ( gurudwaras ) in India and car- ries on an extensive publication and education program. In the 1930s, the S.G.P.C. assembled the most noted Sikh scholars and theologians to produce a consensus statement on the standards of Sikh belief and conduct. The result was the Reht Maryada, a defining document of Sikhism, which offers guidelines for conduct both inside the gurudwaras and in the daily life of Sikhs. The Sikh community declined in the 19th century, in part because of the attractiveness of some of the new movements of the Hindu renais- sance, such as the B RAHMO S AMAJ , which shared many affirmations (such as the idea of one God) with the Sikhs. Many Hindus looked upon the Sikhs as just another sect of Hinduism, a position not accepted by most Sikhs. Several revitalization efforts appeared, including the N IRANKARI and S ANT M AT movements, but with limited appeal. However, it was the Singh Sabha, the govern- ing body that oversees Sikh communities, that seemed to have the greatest effect with its calling the entire community to a new understanding of itself and its heritage. It called for a new alle- giance to the writings of the gurus and an end to encroachments by Christianity and Hinduism into the gurudwaras. The reemergence of the Sikh community was viewed with alarm in some quarters. Some saw it as a challenge to government authority (i.e., Brit- ish rule). The growing popularity of Sikhism set the stage for the development of Sikh national- ism, with its demands that the Punjab, territory in which the Sikhs predominated, be separated from Hindu India. In the decades since World War I, the tension between the Sikhs and the British, and later the Indian, government has waxed and waned. More extreme elements among the Sikhs responded to government attempts to suppress nationalist aspirations with violence, followed by retaliation by the Indian government. The most significant event in the ongoing bat- tles between the government and the Sikh com- munity occurred in June 1984. Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a militant Sikh leader, and his fol- lowers took refuge in the Golden Temple. Unable to persuade him to surrender, under orders from Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, the Indian army invaded the temple, with significant damage to the sacred property and loss of life. The event was a call to arms for the community. Among other consequences, Sikhs living outside India formed the World Sikh Organization. Then in October, Sikhs who served as Indira Gandhi’s bodyguards turned on her and assassinated her.

Sikhs had largely been confined to India until the 20th century. Their migration outward was in part motivated by the same factors that sent other groups to the West, but was also stimulated by the tensions created in the Punjab as the community revived. Many Sikhs targeted by the government for their activity as Sikh nationalists migrated to continue their efforts from a base outside India. Before immigration was curtailed, several thousand Sikhs immigrated to western Canada and the United States. Others took advantage of regulations that allowed free movement through the British Commonwealth to settle in the United Kingdom. Migration by Sikhs into the United States increased considerably after anti-Asian immigra- tion laws were rescinded in 1965. Today, several hundred thousand Sikhs reside in North America. American Sikhs hosted Sikh leaders in 1984 for the founding of the World Sikh Organization, which took place in New York City. As the Ameri- can Sikh community grew, it organized the Sikh Foundation in the 1970s, which has more recently been succeeded by the Sikh Council of North America. The council seeks to coordinate and pro- vide communication among the many gurudwaras across the continent. As the Sikh community expanded in the 1970s, it was faced with a new and different phe- nomenon. A man popularly known as Yogi B HAJAN arrived in Los Angeles and claimed to be a Sikh teacher, but also a teacher of HATHA and KUNDALINI and TANTRIC yoga. He organized a movement of mostly young adult men and women, which he called the Sikh Dharma, though it was better known through its educational arm, the H EALTHY , H APPY , H OLY O RGANIZATION (3HO). After a period of controversy, the Sikh Dharma was recognized as a valid expression of Sikhism, but because of its growth through conversion of individual mem- bers, rather than growth through heredity, it has remained a separate organization.

Singapore Indian migrants began to arrive in what was Brit- ish Malaya during the 19th century, primarily with the intent of finding employment on the sug- arcane and rubber plantations that British entre- preneurs had established. The Crown Colony of Singapore served as an initial point of arrival for Indian migrants, most of whom quickly moved north. However, many chose to stay on the island. Most were from lower-caste families, and more than 60 percent from Tamil Nadu state. By 1900 some 16,000 had arrived. By the beginning of the 20th century, four Hindu temples had been established in Singapore. The oldest of these, Sri Mariammam, was started in 1827; the present structure was erected in 1843 and dedicated to the goddess M ARIYAMMAN , revered for her healing powers. In 1905, after complaints of mismanagement affecting a variety of religious institutions, administration of the temples was turned over to the Mohammedan and Hindu Charitable Endowments Board. That board continued to exist until 1969, when it was split into two boards, one for each religion. In 1915, a second structure, the Hindu Advisory Board, was established to advise the government on Hinduism. Both boards continue to the pres- ent. In the meantime the number of temples had grown to around 30 and the number of Hindus of Indian extraction had risen to about 225,000. The Indian community is now the third largest ethnic group in Singapore behind the Chinese and Malays.

Local temples tend to be home to devotees of both S HAIVISM and V AISHNAVISM and the major deities each reveres. It is also not uncommon to see Bud- dhist and even Christian images in the temples. This syncretism is promoted in line with official government policies focused on building religious harmony in the very diverse religious community of Singapore. In 1978, the community established the Hindu Center to facilitate the transmission of Hinduism to the younger generation. The annual life of the community in Singapore is punctuated by several festivals, all of which have become public events attended by many non-Hindus. Especially notable is the annual Thaipusam festival, a Shaivite festival celebrating the birthday of Lord Subramaniam, the younger son of Lord S HIVA , which occurs toward the end of January each year. Interestingly, this festival was outlawed in India for many years because of bloody hook swinging and body piercing and Sin- gapore is one of the few places where it survives. The week-long festival culminates in an all-day procession in which young men carry a heavy structure honoring the deity from one temple to another through Singapore. Since the 1930s, the Hindu community in Singapore has witnessed impulses for reform, including resistance to BRAHMIN domination of the temples, elevation of the status of women, and the social equity of different castes.

Singh, Guru Gobind (1666–1708) 10th Sikh guru Guru Gobind Singh was the 10th and final Sikh GURU in the lineage of Guru N ANAK , the founder of S IKHISM . He established the beliefs and prac- tices that the community follows to this day, including the devotion to scripture as the only GURU . Gobind Rai was born on December 22, 1666, to Guru Tegh Bahadur, the ninth Sikh guru, and Mata Gujari in Patna in Bihar state. The young boy was taught the language of Bihari and Guru- mukhi script as a child and was schooled in the life and deeds of the previous gurus. He was given a comprehensive education of India: the historical, social, religious, and political context. In keeping with the Sikh tradition he was also trained in music, prayers, and the use of weapons. He was raised in a family who held close relations with both Hindus and Muslims. He spent much of his childhood playing on the banks of the G ANGES River and was said to be bold, with all the mak- ings of a leader. Guru Gobind’s father met a violent death when the boy was less than 10 years old; Sikhs claim he was executed by Emperor Aurangzeb, Mughal ruler of India, as part of a campaign to convert India to Islam. Controversy surrounds the details, but the martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadur remains part of the Sikh belief system. In 1675, the family made a long journey to Punjab, and in November of that year Gobind Rai was initiated as the 10th Sikh guru. Although still a child, he was said to be very self-aware. He continued to train in philosophy, politics, and weaponry. The popularity of the Sikh tradition continued to spread across India, drawing both Muslim and Hindu disciples.

His first marriage was to Mata Jeeto of Lahore, who gave birth to three sons, Jujhar, Zoravar, and Fateh. He later married Mata Sundari of Lahore, who gave birth to another son, Ajit. She survived Singh and was revered as a great teacher by Sikhs after her husband’s death. His last wife, Mata Sahib Devi of the Jehlam District, went to Guru Gobind after vowing to marry no one else. He did not wish to marry but agreed to a platonic relationship in which she could share her life with him. Singh taught the oneness of humankind, love and worship of God, self-awakening, and social justice, all part of the Sikh heritage. His unique contribution, however, was to organize the Khalsa (pure ones) order in 1699, probably in response to his father’s martyrdom decades before. The purpose of the Khalsa was to pro- mote sacrifice for DHARMA , the right way of liv- ing. Members were enjoined to resist any form of slavery based on class, caste, or religion and to prioritize their commitment to social justice. Guru Gobind even advocated the use of arms when in resistance to oppression. He also insti- tuted the five K’s, observed by male Sikhs to the present day: (1) kesh, long hair; (2) kangh, a comb; (3) kach, short pants (for quick move- ment); (4) kara, a steel bracelet; and (5) kirpan, a knife. Guru Gobind Singh declared that upon his death the line of individual gurus would end and the authority of the guru would rest solely in the scripture—the Adi Granth (called the Guru Granth Sahib )—and in the Khalsa, the fellowship of pure followers.

He helped disseminate the Sant Mat teachings in India and around the world. Kirpal Singh was born on Februrary 6, 1894, in Sayyad Kasran in the Rawalpindi District of the Punjab in what is now Pakistan. He was educated at the Edwards Church Mission High School in Peshawar. In January 1912 he signed up for government service in the Military Accounts Department, an occupation that he pursued until retirement in 1947 as deputy assistant control- ler of military accounts. Throughout his early life he studied the basic scriptures of the Sikhs, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, and Zoroastri- ans and began to believe that various religious philosophies communicate the same basic truth, which is the need for each person to attain both self-knowledge and God-knowledge. In 1917 he first had contact with his teacher, Baba Sawan Singh of the Beas lineage of R ADHA - SOAMI teachers. He was later married and became the father of two sons. In February 1924 he was formally initiated by Baba Sawan Singh and given the name Naam, “the word.” It is said that his teacher Sawan Singh passed all his spiritual knowledge onto his disciple through one look in the eyes. In 1935 he began writing and composing his text, Gurmat Sidhant. On April 2, 1948, after the death of his teacher, he began his ministry in the Radhasoami lineage. At the end of that year he started his mission and began giving regular initiations. In June of 1951 he founded the Sawan Ashram in Shakti Nagar, Delhi. Four years later he went on his first world tour. In 1956 in Delhi, he gave the inaugural address to the Ninth General Ses- sion of UNESCO. In 1957 he became the founding president of the World Fellowship of Religions; he later presided over four World Religious Confer- ences over a period of 14 years.

In the epic, she was kidnapped by the demon king Ravana and taken to Lanka. Because of a curse he was unable to violate her, and she refused his advances. Her husband fought successfully for her freedom. However, he doubted that she had remained faithful and cruelly rejected her, saying he had only fought against Ravana to clear his name. To clear her name, Sita underwent a “trial by fire” ( agnipravesha ), which she survived unscathed. Several vernacular versions of the Ramayana indicate that the real Sita never actually went into the fire, sending a substitute instead; in fact, in these versions she was not even really kidnapped, but had only been in hiding. These versions seem to show a later discomfort with the original S ANSKRIT story. After her trial by fire, Sita was then accepted by Rama, until people once more began to chal- lenge her faithfulness and Rama asked Lakshmana to take her away to the forest, in exile once more. He did not know that she was pregnant with his two sons, Kusha and Lava. She gave birth to her sons in the ASHRAM of the very V ALMIKI who is cited as the author of the epic. On one occasion Rama initiated a HORSE SAC - RIFICE ; in that ritual, a horse is allowed to roam at will for a year, followed by the king’s soldiers. Whatever land the horse covers becomes part of the ruler’s kingdom. Kusha and Lava as it hap- pens captured the king’s horse and defeated the king’s army when it arrived, thus defeating, in an act of poetic justice, their father. When Rama heard from V ALMIKI that these were his own sons he asked that they be taken to court, where they sang the Ramayana story. He then called for Sita to return and declared her innocence in open court. Sita, however, refused to return and asked Mother Earth, from which she had been born, to take her back, whereupon she disappeared.

These texts were composed by men but usu- ally memorized rather than committed to writ- ing. They were considered authoritative, but less so than the shruti, or “heard,” texts such as the V EDAS , which had been received by RISHIS (seers) during divine trances. Because of the diverse nature of Hindu tra- dition there have been disagreements between sects as to what texts can be considered smriti. Some hold, for instance, that the B HAGAVAD G ITA is shruti, divinely received, whereas others hold that it is smriti. Further reading: A. L.

Society of Abidance in Truth The Society of Abidance in Truth (SAT) was formed in 1974 by devotees of R AMANA Maharshi (1879–1950). The purpose of the nonprofit soci- ety is to disseminate the teachings of ADVAITA (non-dual) V EDANTA . SAT follows two ancient traditions with roots in India and China. These include the wisdom originally found in the V EDAS and codified in the 19th century as the SANATANA DHARMA , and Ch’an (Zen) Buddhism, as devel- oped during China’s T’ang dynasty. Following the knowledge imparted by Ramana Maharshi, the society emphasizes self-inquiry and self- knowledge to further the realization that no difference exists between one’s nature and the absolute. The teachings proclaim that the true identity of self resides in God. The society does not observe any religious ritual, formal medita- tive technique, or code of conduct. Rather, SAT relies on developing skills of self-observation so that one can experience the unity of self and the highest divinity. SAT holds that in awakening to true formless nature one will find peace, happi- ness, and freedom. Nome and Russell Smith, who have back- grounds in advaita Vedanta and Zen Buddhism, respectively, offer spiritual leadership, weekly teaching sessions, and satsangs (meetings) in Santa Cruz, California. SAT publishes translations of ancient S ANSKRIT texts and books relating to Ramana Maharshi’s life. Membership is primar- ily concentrated in Santa Cruz, but devotees are present throughout the world. SAT welcomes the general public to participate in its events.

The drink was used in such quantities that the Y AJUR V EDA includes a chant to alleviate the effects of exces- sive Soma drinking. Soma was most used by the priests of the S AMA V EDA . A majority of hymns in the Sama Veda itself praise the Soma, personified as a god. In fact, Soma is said to have inspired the composition of Vedic hymns. The drink is said to be sweet and milky. Various attempts have been made to identify the Soma plant. Today it is the name of a vine that does not appear to have intoxicating properties. The Vedic god Soma acts as the husband of the dawns, supports the Earth and sky, and makes the Sun light up. In late Vedic times Soma was con- nected to the Moon. In modern Hindu mythology Soma is the Moon god and the lord of all plants. Scholars identify the beverage Soma with the Haoma, which was also offered to the gods in the Avesta, the scripture of the ancient Persians. Further reading: Alfred Hillebrandt, Vedic Mythology.

Sri See L AKSHMI . Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Mandal (est. 1980) The Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Mandal is an off- shoot of the I NTERNATIONAL S OCIETY FOR K RISHNA C ONSCIOUSNESS (ISKCON), popularly known in North America as the Hare Krishna movement. The Mandal was founded in 1980 by Bhakti Rakasa Sridhara Deva Goswami (1895–1988) to carry on the teachings of his god-brother Swami A. C. Prabhupada B HAKTIVEDANTA (1896–1977), founder of ISKCON. Before he died Prabupada is said to have told his disciples that if dissention occurred in the movement, it should be resolved by Sridhara; they were “god-brothers,” as both received their ini- tiation from Bhaktisiddanthanta Sarawati Takir in the G AUDIYA M AT H in India. This group had been the central Krishna Consciousness organization in Bengal. Prabhupada’s death was in fact followed by intense infighting and theological unrest. Dis- putes were frequent and solutions hard to obtain. When some members of the upper ranks turned to Sridhara, as they had been advised to do, the eventual solution was the founding of a new order. The Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Mandal was formed as the branch that would serve the mission in the United States while remaining affiliated with the Gaudiya Math. Since its founding the mandal has flourished and has engaged in an expansive publishing pro- gram. Guardian of Devotion Press has published a variety of Sridhara’s literature in the field of religion and spirituality. There are affiliated centers in Mex- ico, Brazil, England, Venezuela, South Africa, Italy, the Netherlands, Australia, Austria, and Hungary.

The mission’s objectives are to educate and teach the masses in the art and science of YOGA , tailored for the modern world, and to encourage feelings of unconditional love to everyone inclu- sive of all castes, creeds, and colors. In addition, the mission seeks to establish research centers whose focus is the study of YOGA , helping those who wish to carry forth the mission. Practice and life in the mission include rising before dawn for daily PUJA (worship to divin- ity through offerings such as incense or rice) or spiritual MANTRAS (chants). The honor code of devotees includes being truthful and harmless to others and being free from resentful motives. Typically, members assume a peaceful lifestyle that gives harmony and serenity to their surroundings. The disciples try to live a plain and simple lifestyle devoted to spirituality. The mission has several hundred centers around the world. The president of each center is responsible for the transmission of divine wisdom. More than 1,000 people have been trained to assist these presidents with the authenticity of the raja path or the royal road to divine wisdom. The international headquarters of the mission is in Madras (Chennai), India, and the United States headquarters is in Molena, Georgia.

Sri Vidya Sri Vidya is an all-India cult of the worship of the GODDESS Sri Lalita or Tripurasundari. It initiates in the right-handed tantric tradition ( see TANTRISM ), which emphasizes Sri Lalita as the Great GODDESS . Iconographically, she is seen as a beautiful 16-year old with a parrot on her shoulder; however, this is just her gross form. Her subtle form is the Sri Y ANTRA or Sri C HAKRA , which is a geometric design around a basic point, showing four entranceways at its outer portion that are representative of temple entranceways. The highest form of Sri Lalita is the 16-syl- lable MANTRA that is chanted in worship of her. As is the tantric norm, she is the mantra and one who chants the mantra becomes the goddess. She in effect enters that person and becomes that per- son. The Sri Vidya PUJA (worship and offering) is done at homes and not publicly. The devotee first burns his or her self up symbolically, readying for the transformation into the goddess. “One must become the Goddess to worship the Goddess” is the operative phrase. Doing ritual worship to the diagram of the Sri Yantra, one places mantras on one’s body to transform it into the body of the goddess. The reverse is done when the puja is coming to a close. At the end of the ritual proper the 1,000 names of goddess Sri Lalita are usually chanted. South India has a particularly strong cult of Sri Lalita, where the initiates tend to be B RAHMINS . Thus, though there are tantric aspects to this rit- ual, there is no consumption of forbidden things such as beef or alcohol, as in the left-handed rites. Substitutes are used to make the rites palatable to Brahmin practitioners. The philosophical system involved is a tantric ADVAITA non-dual system, understanding that the manifest world is real and an aspect of the supreme Goddess.

E . decided to form a new community based on a return to traditional values. He is said to have gained access to the basic texts of the Shvetambaras, which tra- ditionally only the monks could read. In reading the texts he was stunned at the laxity shown by the monks of his day. He was convinced that the rituals performed by monks in the Jain temples had nothing to do with the Jain ideals; he felt that even the act of digging in the ground to establish temples and images involved such injury to Earth beings that it was in and of itself a violation of the Jain sacred principle of ahimsa or noninjury. Shaha started a movement assisted by influential Jains to reexamine Jain life in view of the scriptures. His community, which still exists today, adopted the practice of meeting only in halls ( sthanaka ) and not in temples, hence the name Sthanakavasi (inhabit- ers of halls). Lonka Shaha’s fanatical opposition to the worship of icons may have been influenced by the iconoclastic Islam of his era. As a distinguishing feature, Stanakavasi monks wear a mouth covering to prevent injury to invisible beings that might be breathed in and killed. Further reading: John E.

They have been a timeless feature in all native Indian traditions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, J AINISM , and S IKHISM . There are stotras of 1,000 verses, such as Vishnu Sahasranama (in praise of Vishnu) and Lalita Sahasranama (in praise of Sri Lalita), that consist of 1,000 verses; many others consist of 108 verses, but verses of almost any length can be found. From very early times Hindus believed that chanting stotras could induce the gods to grant benefits in this world and, if done with sufficient devotion and frequency, lead to liberation from birth and death. By contrast, in J AINISM and early Buddhism stotras could not gain benefit from spiri- tual teachers such as M AHAVIRA or B UDDHA , because such yogis (unlike gods) did not confer grace; sto- tras were merely capable of calming the mind.

Subramuniyaswami, Satguru (1927–2001) American founder of the Saiva Siddhanta Church The American-born Satguru Subramuniyaswami was an important teacher in the Saiva S IDDHANTA tradition. Through his organizational work, fund- raising, and many books he helped spread Hindu teaching in America and around the world. Born in Oakland, California, on January 5, 1927, and orphaned in 1938 at age 11, Robert Hansen spent his childhood and youth in the San Francisco Bay area and was, before he renounced the world, a lead dancer in the San Francisco Ballet Company. He was raised by a family friend who, as a student of Indian art, dance, and culture, had lived as a guest of the maharaja of Mysore, India. As a child, he wore Indian clothing and learned to appreciate many elements of Indian culture. As a teenager, he was exposed to Swami V IVEKANANDA ’s writings and the lectures of other SWAMIS . He relates that he studied MEDITATION and classical YOGA disciplines with several teachers. At age 21 Hansen traveled to India and Sri Lanka, searching for a spiritual teacher. In Sri Lanka he studied with Shaivite elders and pun- dits ( see S HAIVISM ), one of whom, a member of the Chettiar caste, adopted him into his extended family and introduced him to temple worship. He meditated in the jungle caves at Jalani and attained SELF - REALIZATION by experiencing the absolute real- ity of S HIVA , which transcended all time, space, and form. This experience of Self-Realization became the cornerstone of his mystical teachings. Also in Sri Lanka, he met his GURU , Jnanaguru Yoganathan, also known as Shiva Yogaswami (1872–1964) who initiated him into the Shaivite tradition of siddha yoga and named him Subramuniya. Yogaswami was a direct descendent of the original gurus of this Sri Lankan lineage known as the Nandinatha Sampradaya, a tradition that has its roots in the 2,200-year-old sacred text Tirumantiram, by the saint T IRUMULAR . He followed his initiation with years of spiritual practice ( SADHANA ) and began to be referred to as Satguru, or “one who has attained God-realization and assumes responsibility for the spiritual life of his disciples.” Upon the passing in 1964 of Shiva Yogaswami, Subramuniya (or Gurudeva, as he was affectionately known) became the spiritual successor of the lineage. In 1950, he returned to the United States and continued his spiritual path, developing various psychic powers, including clairvoyance and clair- audience. In 1957, at age 30, he began his pub- lic ministry by founding the Subramuniya Yoga Order and the Christian Yoga Church, both in San Francisco, California. During the 1960s, the latter was disbanded; in 1970 the Subramuniya Yoga Order moved to Hawaii, where it was renamed the Wailua University of the Contemplative Arts. In 1973, the organization became the Saiva Sid- dhanta Yoga Order, and later the Saiva Siddhanta Church. Subramuniya called the Church the “first Hindu church, organized according to the American church system.” In an attempt to sus- tain Shaivite orthodoxy, the church recognizes the celibate monk as the ideal spiritual practitioner and requires at least 12 years of adherence for a man to become a SANNYASI . Women may follow the celibate life of the BRAHMACHARINI , but they are not, strictly speaking, monastics in this church. In addition to the church, Gurudeva created the Himalayan Academy, an educational publica- tion house, and Hindu Heritage Endowment, a public service trust begun in 1995 to establish and maintain permanent sources of income for Hindu institutions worldwide. These organiza- tions serve the growing Hindu D IASPORA . Local missions are on five continents. Subramuniya was instrumental in founding and building 37 Hindu temples around the world, including his own Irai- van Sivalingam temple on the island of Kauai, the first all-granite Agamic (built to Shaivite canoni- K 424 Subramaniya 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 424 12/14/06 9:29:33 AM"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"cal specifications) temple ever built in the West- ern world. He founded Kauai’s Hindu Monastery, known officially as Kauai Aadheenam, the first orthodox Shaivite monastery in the West. Throughout his years of teaching, Subramuni- yaswami traveled widely and met leaders of many faiths and heads of state. He participated in the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1993. In 1995, he named three of his longtime initiated swamis as his consecutive successors, beginning with the present satguru, Bodhinatha Veylanswami. Subramuniya wrote over 30 books explaining Hindu philosophy to adherents and others. His lessons on Shaivism are designed to preserve the teachings among youth, and his illustrated Master Course trilogy—three inspired 1,000-page texts— summarize the religion, culture, and metaphysics of Hinduism. The academy’s quarterly magazine, Hinduism Today, originally begun as a newsletter in 1979, seeks to promote Hindu solidarity in the face of global pluralism and educate Hindus around the world about their heritage. It covers the practices and beliefs of all lineages and traditions within the Hindu fold, and addresses the issues of the day in light of orthodox Hindu teaching. The Web site Hindu Resources Online, a public service inspired by the message of Subramuniyaswami, is another vehicle for dissemination of Shaivite teachings. According to the teachings of Subramuniyas- wami, Shaivism is ageless, the SANATANA DHARMA or eternal faith. An enduring spirituality innate in every man and woman, it is the source of all religions on Earth. Subramuniya died on November 12, 2001, at age 74.

Sundarar, “the Handsome One,” was born a Shaivite B RAHMIN in Tirunavalur. S HIVA claimed Sundarar as his devotee, it is said, on Sundarar’s wedding day, before his marriage could be com- pleted. However, Sundarar later married a temple dancer, Paravai, whom he often mentions in his hymns, and a non-B RAHMIN , upper-caste woman, Cankili. Sundarar lived in the Shaivite city of Tiru- varur, although as the other saints of the Tevaram did, he often traveled to other shrines to sing his devotion of Shiva. He also sang the praises of kings and local chieftains who were his bene- factors. Sundarar, they say, went to heaven on a white elephant (perhaps the white elephant of Indra), accompanied by a Chera king. Sundarar is depicted in iconography with his two wives. His courtly life contrasted with the more austere life of his contemporaries A PPAR and S AMBANTHAR , the others of the sacred trio of saints in Tamil Shaivism.

Tagore invited the young Dane to visit Shanti Niketan, Tagore’s school in India, to “teach silence.” Sorensen arrived in India in 1930 at the age of 40 and began to teach. Immediately he was given the titles of BABA , saint, and GURU , but his gift to the people he met was not captured by these titles. In the four decades he spent in India, he traveled widely and offered his gift of “being” to those who went to him. In 1936 he met R AMANA M AHARSHI (1879–1950) at Arunach- ala and noted Ramana’s quality of self-radiance, which nourished all around him. Ramana later called Sorensen a “rare-born mystic.” On his third visit, Sorensen received a telepathic mes- sage from Ramana, “We are always aware S UN - YATA .” Sorenson wrote that he experienced the words as a “recognition, initiation, MANTRA , and name.” Sorensen thereafter referred to himself and his hut as sunyata (a Buddhist term for void or emptiness). He acquired Indian citizenship in 1953. Sunyata first lived in Haridvar, on a small island in the G ANGES River, but eventually built himself a stone hut in the foothills of the H IMA - LAYAS near Almora. He accepted a small sum from the Birla Foundation in New Delhi, whose purpose is to assist saints and SADHUS (spiritual aspirants). He knew many teachers and saints of his day, including Lama Anagarika Govinda, Wal- ter Evans-Wentz, Mohandas Karamchand G ANDHI , Jawaharlal Nehru, Yashoda Ma, K RISHNA P REM , Sri A NIRVAN , J. K RISHNAMURTI , A NANDAMAYI M A , and N EEM K AROLI B ABA . He remained uninterested in power, fame, or money, preferring nature, his own company, and silence. He did not heal, was not psychic, and did not perform miracles. He simply reminded all he met of the identity of each person and the divine in the words Tat tvam asi —thou are That. Sunyata’s dog Sri Wuji (Chinese for “a full emptiness”) was his constant companion. The saint Anandamayi Ma accepted the dog along with Sunyata into her ashram with the words “Wuji is not a dog.” In 1973, a group of Americans from the Alan Watts Society invited Sunyata to California. At age 84, he arrived in California, where he gave DARSHAN (blessings) at Esalen and Palm Springs. In 1978 he moved to California permanently at age 88 and spent the last six years of his life there. At age 93, in 1984, he was struck by a car in Fairfax, California, and died soon afterward on August Sunyata (1890–1984), Danish sadhu and teacher (Courtesy Sunyata Society) Sunyata 427 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 427 12/14/06 9:29:34 AM"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"13, 1984.

Surdas (Late 15th to late 16th century) Hindi poet-saint Surdas was a poetic of mythic status in North India born in a village called Sihi, which was prob- ably near B RINDAVAN , judging from the Braj dialect of his poems. Most of the biographical details of Surdas’s life are in question. Surdas is credited with writing Sursagar (The Ocean of Sur), a song of about 5,000 verses. As with many poet-saints in India, most of his poetry was written to be sung at public events; it is likely that these “songs” changed for each performance. His extant work is probably the careful textual recording of students and admirers. As is also the case in Indian tradition, his work may well include compositions of genius written by other authors that seemed worthy of inclusion among his. In the end this lack of clear biographical detail matters little in the perspective of the brilliant work represented under the name of Sur. All the stories of his life agree that Surdas was blind, but there they part company. One story puts him at the court of the great Muslim king Akbar. In the other he was a follower of V ALLABHA , the great devotee of K RISHNA , of Brindavan. It is said that Vallabha encouraged Sur to write about the child Krishna’s divine play. Sur’s poetry is one of pure devotion. Millions of people in North India know his songs. His poetry is used for the temple liturgy of the Vallab- hites. Classical vocalists always include his works in their repertoire, as do village singers. Many oth- ers read, recite, or sing his verses. Further reading: Kenneth E.

Surya Surya is the most common of the names for the Sun in the V EDAS , which all seem to refer to differ- ent aspects of this divine body. (S AVITRI is the next most frequent Vedic Sun name.) The Sun is seen as crossing the sky each day on a chariot pulled by horses. In the Vedas Surya is sometimes said to be the son of A DITI and sometimes that of Dyaus (the heavens). Sometimes he is said to be the son or the husband of U SHAS , the dawn. In the era of the PURANAS , Surya is seen as the son of Aditi and the sage Kashyapa. The Sun (under the name Savitri) is the object of worship each morning by twice- born (confirmed), upper-caste Hindu males who chant the G AYATRI M ANTRA . Further reading: Shakti M.

Swami Kuvalayananda Yoga Foundation (est. 1972) The Swami Kuvalayananda Foundation (SKY) of Philadelphia is devoted to the study and practice of HATHA YOGA . It was founded in 1972 as a nonre- ligious organization by Dr. Vijayendra Pratap, who received a Ph.D. in applied psychology from Bom- bay University. Dr. Pratap studied YOGA as a stu- dent of Swami Kuvalayananda (1883–1966), who founded the noted yoga center Kaival yadhama in Bombay, where Pratap was assistant director before moving to America. The SKY Foundation holds HATHA YOGA classes, from basic to the most advanced levels; trains teachers; and focuses on teachings from the A SHTANGA Y OGA system of P ATANJALI . One of the significant objectives of the foundation is to investigate the ancient as well as the more recent developments of yoga as they interface with contemporary times. Dr. Pratap’s foundation has sponsored academic conferences to review what is known about science and yoga. At this point, he and his supporters consider the foundation an academic and research organization seeking ways that science and yogic practice can work together for the good of all humanity. The headquarters are in Philadelphia over the Garland of Letters book- store, which is sponsored by the foundation. Further reading: Vijayendra Pratap, Beginning Yoga (Rutland, Vt.: Chares E.

Sahajanand was born at Chhapaiya, near A YODHYA in northern India. A precocious child, he showed an early inclination to the religious life. Upon his parents’ deaths, when he was 11 years old, he adopted the life of a renunciant and pur- sued his spiritual quest. His seven-year PILGRIMAGE around India ended at Gujarat, where he spent a year with Muktanand Swami, who confirmed that Sahajanand was an incarnation of K RISHNA . Eventually Sahajanand assumed leadership of the devotees of Muktanand Swami. Sahajanand began to reform the movement by recruiting a group of young SANNYASIS (renun- ciants) who were dedicated to his vision of uplifting humankind and involved themselves in various social service activities. He imposed five rules on the sannyasis: they were to avoid greed, worldly desires, attachments, and ego and live a life of celibacy. He also started holding large ceremonies called Vishnu Yajna with the goal of abolishing the popular sacrifice of animals. His actions attracted a large following throughout Gujarat. The non- sannyasi (householder) mem- bers were asked to avoid alcohol and intoxicating drugs, meat, food from improper sources, stealing, and debauchery. Sahahanand authored the Shikshapatri, a work summarizing a code of conduct for his followers. As the movement expanded, followers began to affirm that Sahajanand was the incarnation of Lord Purushottama Narayana (i.e., Krishna). Swaminarayan promoted a form of BHAKTI YOGA , the devotional path to God. He and the movement he founded believe God to be a person and focus their primary attention on Vishnu/ Krishna. Nevertheless, they fall within the larger scope of traditional Hinduism by affirming a phi- losophy of unity in diversity and acknowledging the common history and language of Hinduism. Swaminarayan has been followed as head of the movement by a succession of leaders: Guna- titanand Swami (1785–1867), Bhagatji Maharaj (1829–97), Shastriji Maharaj (1865–1951), Yogiji Maharaj (1892–1971), and Pramukh Maharaj (b. 1921). In 1907 Shastriji Maharaj founded the Bochsanwasi Shri Akshar Purusottam Sanstha, which gave the movement its present corporate structure. He also exported the movement outside India, to East Africa. Later, in the 20th century, Pramukh Swami Maharaj carried the movement to the West, establishing the first center in En gland and subsequently overseeing the vast international Swaminarayan (1781–1830), monk and founder of Swaminarayan movement, pointing to Lord Vishnu (Courtesy Swaminarayan Headquarters, Bombay [Mumbai]) K 430 Swaminarayan movement 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 430 12/14/06 9:29:35 AM"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"spread of the movement through the post–World War II Indian D IASPORA .

He was the first Asian to win the Nobel Prize in literature. Tagore was born May 7, 1861, in the Jorasanko District in Calcutta (Kolkata) in the state of Ben- gal, to the celebrated Hindu reformer Debendra- nath Tagore and Sarada Devi. His father’s father had been a prominent, highly educated business- man and a supporter of the B RAHMO S AMAJ , the Hindu reform sect founded by R AMMOHUN R OY . His father had maintained this affiliation. Rabindranath was the youngest of 14 children, all of whom were well educated, including the girls, in keeping with the newly emerging Bengali progressive tradition. Most of the children were educated in both Bengali and English and used their knowledge to publish magazines, write plays, and sponsor the arts; young Rabindranath had rich surroundings to allow his talent to grow. In 1878, at the age of 17, Rabindranath went to England for a year to study in an elite public school in Brighton, and then at University Col- lege, London. He did not, however, complete his degree. In 1883, he married Mrinalini Devi, and the couple had two sons and three daughters. By this time he had begun to develop a literary repu- tation based on several Bengali works, including a long poem in the Maithili regional linguistic style originated by Vidyapati, the authorship of which he initially attempted to hide, and the poetry anthology, Sandhya Sangit (Twilight song), which he wrote in 1882. This work includes the famous poem Nirjharer Svapnabhanga (The Cry of the Waterfall). In 1890, Tagore began to manage the family estates at Shelaidaha, a riverine region in what is now Bangladesh. There he lived modestly on a houseboat on a tributary of the Padma River. Works of poetry from this period include Sonar Tari (1894), Chitra (1896), and Katha O Kahini (1900). He also began to be known for his essays, plays, and short stories, often set in the local vil- lage and river life. In 1901, Tagore moved to Shantiniketan, in west Bengal, where he started a pioneering edu- cational experiment championing the outdoor classroom run in the ancient Indian way with one teacher and a very few students. Today this school is run by the government of India under the name Vishva Bharati. There he wrote Naivedya (1901) T 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 433 12/14/06 9:29:35 AM"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"and other works. Here, his wife died young and he lost a son and a daughter. His profound grief affected the tone of his work. Tagore had developed a large following among Bengali readers; some English translations of his work had been made, but they were not of high quality. At the urging of some of his English admir- ers he started translating some of his own poems in free verse. In 1912, he went to England to read some of these. It was his fortune to be heard at these readings by the celebrated Irish poet Wil- liam Butler Yeats. The English version of Gitanjali (Song Offerings) (1915) was later published by the India Society with an admiring preface by Yeats. In November 1913 Tagore was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature, based on the attention that this translation had drawn. His literary fame established at the age of 60, Tagore began to paint and exhibit his paintings in India and Europe. He painted in a wistful mod- ernist style that was as impressive as his literary work. Deeply beloved in his home of Bengal, Tagore is the only person in the world to have composed two national anthems, India’s and Bangladesh’s. His love for his country, India, was well known and he joined others of his generation in doing what he could to contribute to the great struggle for independence.

As a result of his refined aesthetic sensibili- ties, his love of nature, and his extensive travels in Europe, America, the Middle East, and the Far East, Tagore developed a philosophy of universal brotherhood and cultural exchange. Above all he believed in the immanence of the divinity and the reflection of that divinity in human beings. As a result he is known and read as a philosopher as well as a literary figure. Perhaps because of his openness of spirit, Tagore’s literature and philoso- phy have found an audience in realms far away from the quiet beauty of the Bengal of his time of which he so passionately wrote.

Taittiriya Upanishad The Taittiriya Upanishad is an U PANISHAD of the Black Y AJUR V EDA . It is considered one of the old- est Upanishads. It consists of three sections. The first section is devoted to teaching; it out- lines elements of the sacred study of the V EDAS . The second section is named for its description of the ANANDA (infinite bliss) of the BRAHMAN (ultimate reality). While in passing, defining the terms self and ultimate reality, it introduces the five SHEATHS that make up a human being. These are the sheath of food, the sheath of breath, the sheath of mind, the sheath of understanding, and the sheath of bliss. In the final section, named after the teacher Bhrigu, these five levels of being are fully described: the sheath of food describes the external body and the sheath of bliss lies in the core of the heart, as the ultimate Self or brahman. The Upanishad con- cludes with a memorable chant, the vision of the sage who realizes brahman: “I am food; I am food; I am food. I am the food-eater; I am the food-eater; I am the food-eater. . . . Earlier than the gods; at the navel of immortality . . . [I see] the golden light!” The food is the manifest universe. The food-eater is the transcendent reality. The sage understands that in SELF - REALIZATION he encompasses all the manifest and unmanifest world.

Tantrism derives from the term tantra, which in certain usages defines systems and texts that contrast themselves with the Vaidika or V EDIC tradition. While elements common to the tantric traditions can easily be enumerated and analyzed, the boundary between a system that is tantric and one that is not is not so easily defined. Philosophically, most Hindu tantric systems focus on “desire” as a path of liberation. This involves a sophisticated reversal process that transforms what is commonly understood in Hinduism as a barrier to liberation, that is, desire, into an instrument for liberation. This method can be applied to numerous aspects of normative life and tradition that are purposely inverted or ignored in order to harness the “lower” aspects of existence and make them servants of liberation. For instance, a tantric devotee might ritually eat beef, forbidden in normative Hinduism, in order to facilitate realization. To be sure, many “tantric” elements infuse ordinary ritualistic, temple-oriented Hinduism. But the key to identifying tantrism are the distinc- tive rituals and practices that form a complex, usually taught to small groups of adepts by a spe- cial GURU . These rituals and practices are almost always practiced in secret, away from mainstream society. Thus tantrism as a fuller, secret complex contains an element, more or less obvious, that runs counter to the overt “sanctioned” philo- sophical streams. Hindu tantrism seeks both supernatural pow- ers (most often considered a distraction from the goal of liberation) and liberation, worldly enjoy- ment and release from the bonds of birth and rebirth. It does this by embracing what is usually eschewed. It takes the world, which is seen to be nothing but a barrier to liberation, as divine and by fully realizing its divinity learns to be its mas- ter, living in it in the full presence of the divine. For the purposes of transformation, the tran- scendent is often seen as a passive masculine reality, and the feminine is seen as the same tran- scendent power in action. Using the polarity of masculine and feminine tantrics seek to realize both poles, finally embracing a totality that fuses, so to speak, that which is beyond with that which is here, or, more accurately, realizes that the two are already fused. Once one understands the unity of the mani- fest and unmanifest, one also understands that the human is the microcosm of the macrocosm; the human is the universal. The tantric sexual ritual, maithuna, is based on these understand- ings. Sexual intercourse ritually replicates the truth of existence, that the masculine is the tran- scendent divinity and the feminine the immanent divinity, with two human bodies. But this ritual need not be practiced directly; many forms of tan- trism practice maithuna metaphorically or simply understand it at a philosophical level. K 436 tantra 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 436 12/14/06 9:29:36 AM"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"Hindu tantrism can be understood as a mar- riage of practices and beliefs from the pre-A RYAN Goddess-oriented cults with the larger and more philosophically encompassing Aryan Vedic (but more directly U PANISHADIC ) traditions. Tantrism as a distinct tradition has its beginnings with the settlement of the Aryans in fringe areas of India (e.g., Kashmir, Bengal, Tamil Nadu). As the two cultural complexes began to merge in the centu- ries before and after the start of the Common Era (with the Aryan Vedic always retaining its cultural supremacy), the forms of tantric practice began to become formalized. Because of their derivation tantric practices are neither purely Vedic nor purely indigenous, but a fusion of the two. It is well known, for instance, that some contemporary non-Hindu tribal people of India still practice sexual rituals and even orgies in fields to promote agricultural (and human) fertility. This is a very ancient ritual, found all over the world in conjunction with early agriculture. It is based on the understanding that the female is the Earth and the male is the sky (and its rain). The two join in sexual embrace to create the fundaments of life. The use of sexual ritual in tantrism most surely derives from this precise process, but it is philosophically aggran- dized or at least explicitly philosophized (as it may not have been before), as the union of God and Goddess. Likewise it is well known that many subgroups in India, both Hindu castes and non-Hindu tribal people, worship the Goddess with alcohol, which is a most despised substance in Brahminical Hin- duism. Vedic tradition does record the usage of very small quantities of alcohol in certain obscure rituals, but the drink is in general condemned. It is obvious again that the use of alcohol in certain tantric rituals, in which it is in fact ritually given to the female (the Goddess or S HAKTI ) before sexual intercourse, is a remanent of the pre-Aryan traditions. The ritual egalitarianism of tantrism, which does not observe caste divisions in ritual, also is probably a substratum tribal value taken up into the main complex, as mainstream Hinduism itself is highly oriented toward social stratifica- tion. Because the combination of pre-Aryan and Vedic needed philosophical interpretation, certain tantric practices such as the eating of beef can be derived only through philosophical reversal. Non-Hindu tribal people are not beef eaters, but they do eat and ritually use buffalo meat. Beef, of course, became the most forbidden substance for all Hindus. Therefore, the ritual eating of beef in tantric ritual is neither Aryan nor non-Aryan, but a philosophically constructed practice. Perhaps ironically, tantrism as a system only became consolidated after B RAHMIN practitioners had written numerous texts in S ANSKRIT to give it a certain orthodox sanction. Because Hinduism itself is a mixture of the same elements as tant- rism, even some of its normative aspects can be said to have tantric roots. Vedic tradition was not associated with place, probably because of the pastoral nature of society in the era of the Vedas. It was also quite clearly aniconic—not using visible, external forms of the divinities. Temple Hinduism, however, is place- based and uses ICONS . It is quite likely that the notions of a specific place that divinities inhabit is a non-Aryan notion. It is undoubtedly the case also that stone or wood images or symbols of divinities are also non-Aryan. It is thus no coincidence that the ritual texts that lay out the principles for temple design, the AGAMAS , are tan- tric in character and form part of the large tantric tradition. The three most important tantric sects are the Vaishnavite tantrics, who have V ISHNU as tran- scendent divinity; the Shaivite tantrics, who have Shiva as transcendent divinity; and the S HAKTA tantrics, who have the Goddess as the transcen- dent divinity. The last two are often difficult to distinguish as they use similar terminology and frameworks. The Ganapatyas (worshippers of G ANESHA ) constitute another, small tantric sect. Historically, there was a group of tantrics called tantrism 437 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 437 12/14/06 9:29:36 AM"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"Sauras or Sun (S URYA ) worshippers, but these do not appear to have an active sectarian presence in India. There are numerous textual classifications and subclassifications of tantric groups and practice, but these seem to be more descriptive than prac- tical. Any regional differences that once existed have by now disappeared. The most important tantric system may be that of Kasmiri Shaivism, which has received the most study and has reached the West through teachers such as Swami M UKTANANDA . Gener- ally, there is a tremendous amount of intentional obscuration and abstruseness in tantric texts to protect them from noninitiates. The Kashmiri Shaivite tradition, however, led by exemplars such as A BHINAVAGUPTA , seemed to make an effort to create philosophical systems that could vie with more orthodox or normative systems in the philosophical arena. Therefore, the Kashmiri Shaivite systems seem to be more clear and open than many others. A second important subsystem is the S RI V IDYA Goddess-oriented tradition. This is, in fact, a modified and highly Brahminized tradition whose textual history has begun to attract significant scholarship. Mention must also be made of S AIVA S ID - DHANTA , a South Indian and Sri Lankan tantric system. Here, there is a significant body of litera- ture not only in Sanskrit but also in Tamil. In fact, some of the texts originated around 600 C . E . The various systems, while they share a com- mon sexual paradigm to portray the relationship between the manifest and unmanifest worlds, are not philosophically uniform. Kashmiri Shaivism, for instance, is completely non-dual ( ADVAITA ), or monistic, whereas Shaivite Siddhanta is purely dualistic; one can realize oneself as a “small Shiva,” but Paramashiva, or transcendent Shiva, is beyond the reach of the soul in transforma- tional terms. That is, the highest Shiva is eternally distinct from the souls. The system of Bengali Vaishnavite Sahajiya, alternatively, retains the Vaishnavite “quasi-non-dualistic” aspect, repre- senting a third philosophical stream. Tantric systems are divided into two tenden- cies that are referred to as left-handed and right- handed. The left-handed is most probably the original practice. It can be shockingly antinomian or antisocial. The A GHORIS are an example of this. These wanderers eat excrement and in other ways try to outrage people in public arenas in order to use the “reversed” energy to gain supernatural powers. The extreme left-handed practices dating from very early in the history of tantrism have made the word tantric as despised in India as in the normative West. Formalized left-handed practice uses the P ANCHA M AKARA , or five forbid- den substances: meat, wine, sexual intercourse, parched grain, and fish. These are combined in a ritual context. Right-handed practice could be considered a Brahminization of the left-handed stream. There, accepted entities or practices are substituted for the “forbidden” ones to align the practice more closely with social norms. This substitution might be a mental visualization of the practice rather than the practice itself; physical substitu- tion, for instance, eating a particular vegetable instead of beef; or complete avoidance of any of the elements in favor of a purely philosophical approach. Some important notions used in Hindu tan- tric practice include SADHANA , or adept practice; DIKSHA , the necessary initiation (distinct from the Vedic initiation); MANTRA , a distinctive usage of mantra practice; YANTRA , abstract designs used for ritual worship and MEDITATION ; and MUDRAS , special hand gestures used in conjunction with meditation and ritual. KUNDALINI yoga is by definition a tantric practice and is a central part of many tantric systems. S HAKTIPAT (Shakti ini- tiation) is also a practice done by some tantric gurus, who can transform an adept, or initiate him or her, by merely a touch that transfers the guru’s Shakti, or grace, to the adept.

There is some evidence of tantrism in Jain tradition, mostly limited to the use of tantric style mantras and certain hints of tantric sexuality. No full tantric practice is known to have emerged in J AINISM . This was primarily due to the severity of Jain asceticism, and the nature of reality accord- ing to Jainism, which left no room for pursuit of enlightenment through desire.

The word refers to the sacred heat that is generated by bodily mortifications and ascetic denial. Tapas confers wondrous powers and abilities upon the YOGI and makes it easier for the adept to break the bonds of attachment to worldly life. In a very literal example of tapas, ancient orthodox yogis used to sit surrounded by five fires under the noonday Sun in order to absorb the heat and gain spiritual power. Other ascetics doing tapasya would endure lengthy fasts or extreme bodily mortifications. There is some indication that the notion of tapasya developed within the Brahminical tradition as a result of association with the fires of the Vedic sacrifice. Further reading: Walter O.

The Tattvartha Sutra was composed by the great Jain Acarya (Saint) Umasvami (or Umasvati). It is the first text of J AINISM written in S ANSKRIT (the ear- lier ones, which are no longer extant, were written in Prakrit, the vernacular tongue that developed from Sanskrit). The Tattvartha Sutra is the first extant text of the Jains, and it systematizes the canonical teachings into an integrated philosophi- cal school. It is written in the concise aphoristic style typical of Indian texts designated as SUTRAS . The Tattvartha Sutra plays a similar authorita- tive role in Jain tradition as the V EDANTA S UTRA of B ADARAYANA or the Y OGA S UTRA of P ATANJALI in Tattvartha Sutra 439 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 439 12/14/06 9:29:36 AM"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"orthodox Hindu culture. In approximately 350 short verses, Umasvami surveys basic Jain doc- trine. He discusses salvation; states of the soul; the human, celestial, and infernal realms; insentient reality; the nature of KARMA , karmic bondage, and the acquisition and removal of karma. The Tat- tvartha Sutra is the only Jain text that is accepted by both of the two main sects, the S HVETAMBARA and the D IGAMBARA . Further reading: P. S.

It can vary in size from a small shrine with a simple thatched roof to vast complexes of stone and masonry. During most times of the year the temple is devoted to individual or family worship or to greeting of the divinity. Since many houses in India have their own shrines set up for worship, the temple is reserved for special worship or for requests to the divinity, often by people who have made PILGRIMAGES . At festival times temples are given over to group worship, as devotees sing BHAJANS or KIRTANS , or to various rituals that com- memorate special events in the life of the divin- ity, for example, the marriage of M INAKSHI at the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai. The early worship of the V EDAS took the form of a ceremony around a fire or fires, without any permanent structures or icons. Location was unimportant. As Hinduism developed, it bor- rowed from other modes of worship, and both location and iconography became central features. Often geography determined temple location: high places that jut out from the countryside would usually have at least small temples at their sum- mits, as would river junctions. In addition, places traditionally associated with events in the lives of a deity would often be marked with temples. The temple at R AMESHVARAM , for example, marks the place where R AMA had his monkey armies build a bridge to cross over and fight the demon king Ravana, according to the R AMAYANA . Today, ICON worship is central to Indian tem- ple worship. The stone itself is not worshipped. The icon is merely the place the divinity inhabits. A complex ritual must first be performed to install the divinity in the image. Thereafter, the image is treated as the divinity itself would be: it is bathed, dressed, sung to, fed, and feted each day. For S HAIVITES , most often the icon is the S HIVA LINGAM , A typical Hindu temple tower. Shown here is the Krishna temple in Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu. (Constance A.

For Vaishnavites the icon is a full represen- tation of V ISHNU in one of his forms; for S HAKTAS it is an image of the great G ODDESS . Often the inner sanctum of the temple, its most holy spot, holds a small, typically modest icon. The more elaborate statues and images are usually located in the larger temple precincts. Large temples often boast a huge array of images of gods and goddesses, usually depicting a particular event in their story. One might see, for instance, N ARASIMHA , the man-lion AVATA R of Vishnu, rip- ping apart his demon foe H IRANYAKASHIPU , or see Shiva in his pose as the divine dancer, N ATARAJA . P UJA , the regular worship service including offerings and rites, is usually performed before the central icon at fixed times during the day. For a donation, devotees can dedicate certain features of a regular puja, such as the recitation of a particular MANTRA . They may also pay for pujas to be conducted by B RAHMIN priests at other times, simple or elaborate at their discretion, in support of certain prayers or pleas to the divinity. A woman might want to have a son, a man might want to gain success in business, or a student might seek success in exams. All worldly and sal- vational requests are taken to the divinity of the temple; popular temples are thronged with people year round. The puja consists, at the minimum, of fruit, water, and flower offerings to the divinity, accom- panied by the appropriate mantras. No puja is done without the ARATI , or waving of a lighted lamp before the divinity. At the end of the ritual people may step forward and waft the smoke from the lamp over their head or face to receive the blessing of the divinity. In certain temples one may receive a little of the food that had been offered to the divinity, called PRASADA , which will confer blessing when eaten. Most temples in India, including all of the well-known temples, allow only Brahmins to perform the rituals. There are smaller and larger shrines all over the country, however, who have non-Brahmin and even S HUDRA (low-caste) priests. These are usually temples serving a smaller local community. By law, any member of any caste may enter any temple in India. Nevertheless, in practice Dalits ( UNTOUCHABLES ) are often barred. Certain temples admit only Hindus; Muslims and Christians will be excluded if they are identified. A famous case of temple exclusion took place when Indira Gandhi, prime minister of India, visited the J AGANNATH temple at Puri. She was excluded because she was married to a non-Hindu. Many great Hindu temples deserve mention: the V ISHVANATHA TEMPLE to Shiva in the holy city B ENARES (Varanasi); the famous K ALI temple at Kali Ghat in Calcutta (Kolkata); the J AGANNATH T EMPLE to K RISHNA in Puri; the temple for the god- dess Kamakshi at K ANCHIPURAM ; the B RIHADISHVARA temple to Shiva in Tanjore; the M EENAKSHI T EMPLE to the goddess Minakshi and the Shrirangam temple to V ISHNU , both in Tamil Nadu. Most Jains also worship at temples. These can be quite elaborate, as at M T . A BU , or smaller buildings. The puja is similar to the Hindu puja in these Jain contexts, but since the T IRTHANKARAS , the exalted personages who are worshipped, are not gods, but human beings, there is no PRASADA or “blessed food” given, and technically no blessing can be given by the image or personage. Instead, worship is aimed largely at instilling values that will lead devotees toward the yogic perfection of the Tirthankara being worshipped. Sikhs have only the Golden Temple at A MRIT - SAR , where the holy book of the Sikhs, Granth Sahib, is enshrined. Sikhs also have gurudwaras, or “entranceways to the guru,” all over the world. These meeting places welcome anyone, but there is no iconic worship or puja there. Recently many Hindu temples, Jain temples, and Sikh gurudwaras have been established in the West. They often have unusual features, as at the Shiva-Vishnu Temple in Livermore, California, where both Shiva and Vishnu are worshipped side by side.

Temple of Cosmic Religion In 1966, while attending the K UMBHA M ELA , a much-celebrated festival of ritual bathing at the confluence of the Y AMUNA and G ANGES rivers in A LLAHABAD , Lord Panduranga Vittala, an incarna- tion of K RISHNA , approached Satguru Sant K ES - HAVADAS (1934–97), an independent teacher of various paths of Indian philosophy, and told him, “Go to the West: spread the cosmic religion.” Later, after returning home to Delhi, Keshavadas experienced a vision in which he understood the spiritual reason for such a journey. The key V EDANTA principle that there is only one truth, he realized, should be used to include, not exclude, others. Religion could be a force to gather together the sacred bonds that unite humanity. The next year, 1967, Keshavadas toured Europe, the Middle East, and the United States. In 1968 he founded a small center in Washington, D.C., that would become the American head- quarters of the Dasashram International Center, as it was known in India. In the mid-1970s he relocated the center to Southfield, Michigan, near Detroit, and changed its name to the Temple of Cosmic Religion. Keshavadas had a primary goal of introducing the wisdom of Hinduism to the West. He wanted to usher in a cosmic religion founded on the princi- ples that truth is one and that all paths lead to God. Keshavadas taught YOGA and MEDITATION as a way to know God and encouraged his followers to dance, sing, and chant. Central to Keshavadas’s beliefs are the precepts of KARMA and REINCARNATION . The world headquarters of the Temple of Cos- mic Religion is now located in Bangalore, India; there are five other centers in India. The U.S. headquarters is currently in Oakland, California. Since the death of Keshavadas in 1997, the temple has been led by his widow, Guru Mata Kesha- vadas. The temple also has centers in Trinidad and England.

Temple of Kriya Yoga The Temple of Kriya Yoga was established on the North Side in Chicago in the 1960s by the Ameri- can Goswami Kriyananda (b. 1930), who had been teaching yoga since the 1940s. The head- quarters of the temple is still located in Chicago. Goswami was born Melvin Higgins; he is not to be confused with his compatriot Swami K RIYANANDA of the ANANDA MOVEMENT . Kriyananda studied YOGA and was initiated by his first GURU , Sri Shelliji, a disciple of Paramah- ansa Y OGANANDA , founder of the SELF - REALIZATION F ELLOWSHIP . Kriyananda, an excellent astrologer, also opened the College of Occult Sciences, which offered many courses in esoteric traditions. During the 1970s Kriyananda established a retreat in South Haven, Michigan, and in 1977 founded the Kriyananda Healing Center as a K 442 Temple of Cosmic Religion 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 442 12/14/06 9:29:37 AM"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"holist ic health facility.

He has written several books about kriya yoga, astrology, and meditation. The temple publishes a periodical, The Flame of Kriya, and maintains a Web site.

Tevaram The Tevaram is the collected hymns of the three most prominent N AYANMARS or Tamil S HAIVITE saints, A PPAR , Jnanasambanthar (also known as S AMBANTHAR or Tirujnanasambanthar), and S UN - DARAR (Suntharamurtti), whose lives spanned the sixth through eighth centuries C . E . These hymns, in the Tamil language, are considered by Tamil Shaivites to be equal in sanctity to the S ANSKRIT V EDAS as scripture and MANTRA ; in a sense, the Tevaram is a Veda. The text is memorized and sung by a hereditary community called Otuvars during daily temple rituals and ceremonials. The hymns of the Tevaram celebrate S HIVA with passionate devotion, dwelling on the many tales of Shiva; his wives, S AT I and P ARVATI ; and his two sons, G ANESHA and K ARTTIKEYA . They lovingly describe the deity’s physical attributes and recount his visitations to famous devotees at the sites of many important Shaivite shrines in Tamil Nadu.

Thailand Contemporary Thailand is a predominantly Ther- avada Buddhist country, where Hinduism, ani- mism, Islam, and Christianity are also practiced. The Hindu minority constitutes only about 1 percent of the population. Nevertheless, the his- toric influence of Hinduism is still apparent. The king of Thailand is always referred to as R AMA , the name of the title character of the Ramakien (the local version of the S ANSKRIT R AMAYANA ), and he is considered an AVATA R of V ISHNU . Though the Thai monarchies date to the formation of the kingdom of Sukothai, the first king to take the title of Rama was Phraphutthayotfa Chulalok, who was named Rama I during the 18th century. The most famous Thai king was Rama V, also known as King Chulalongkorn, who defended Thailand’s independence from European coloniz- ers and introduced democracy. The West knows of him primarily as the child prince of King Mon- gkut (Rama IV) in the book Anna and the King of Siam. The current king, Adulyadej the Great, who rose to power in 1946, is called Rama IX. The Ramakien is a central part of Thai cul- ture. The epic is illustrated in the artwork of many temples and is often performed in dance and puppet plays. The best known image is a massive fresco painted on the wall of the Royal Temple (Temple of the Jade Buddha). Other Hindu imagery, such as YAKSHAS , who act as guardians of the doors, can be found within many Buddhist temples. Monuments to the Hindu gods S HIVA and Vishnu are found in Thai Buddhist temples. The Royal Temple has a small group of B RAHMINS to conduct royal rituals, as Buddhist monks cannot preside over these rites.

There are even temples and PUJAS (worship services) dedicated to the creator god B RAHMA alone, a rarity in India itself. Further reading: Eliezer B.

Theosophical Society (est. 1875) The Theosophical Society was founded in 1875 in New York City by Helena Petrovna B LAVATSKY , Henry Steel Olcott, and William Q. Judge. The founders sought to promote the study of insights from various world religions, investigate spiritu- alist and other occult phenomena, and foster the brotherhood of all humankind. Olcott became the first president (1875–1907), although the writings and teachings of Blavatsky became syn- onymous with the teachings of the society. The society accepted her self-description as a disciple of highly evolved beings, mahatmas, who had instructed her in the ancient wisdom, the secret doctrine, the wisdom religion, or Theosophy. She claimed to have contacted an occult brotherhood of these mahatmas in her travels in the Far East, particularly in Tibet. Their perennial philosophy became the basis of her writings. Although Theosophy has no official dogma, it sees itself as a body of truths that are the basis of all valid religions. It is not a religion per se, but rather a restatement of the essence of religion itself. The three stated objectives of the society are (1) to form a nucleus of the Universal Broth- erhood of Humanity without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste, or color; (2) to encourage the study of comparative religion, philosophy, and science; and (3) to investigate unexplained laws of nature and the powers latent in humans. To Theosophists, the universe is a manifesta- tion of one eternal, infinite reality, the divine, which underlies and pervades everything. Each person is a spark of the divine, a microcosm of the macrocosm, born in order to evolve from latent divinity to perfection. Through many incar- nations, a soul entity or monad of the divine becomes perfect enough to be free from the cycle of birth and death. Blavatsky expounded a cosmological scheme and description of the human body and soul, involving levels and hierarchies that express rela- tionships among humanity, the angelic realms, and ultimately, the divine. Theosophical ideas are largely drawn from the cosmological and psycho- logical teachings of Hinduism and Buddhism and are portrayed in an amalgam of Hindu and Bud- dhist terminology. In 1879 Blavatsky and Olcott settled in India; in 1882 they established Theosophical Society headquarters at Adyar, near Madras (Chennai). In 1895, Judge, who headed the American sec- tion, severed its relations with the British and Indian branches. In 1896 Judge died and was suc- ceeded by Katherine A. T INGLEY , who moved the American section’s headquarters to Point Loma (San Diego), California. Further schisms of the Theosophical Society in America produced the Temple of the People (from the Syracuse, New York, branch) and the Theosophical Society of New York.

Annie B ESANT , an Englishwoman who joined the society after reading Blavatsky’s work, succeeded her as head of the Esoteric Section, a small group who experimented with occult prin- ciples. When Olcott died in 1907 Besant became the new president of the society. The first decades of the movement saw wide- spread interest in Theosophical principles in America, Europe, and India. The synthesis of East and West, religion and science, and esoteric and exoteric understanding made Theosophy compel- ling to cosmopolitan, liberal people, regardless of nationality, who had been disappointed by the dogmatism of both religion and science and sought to unite the diverse peoples of the world in a peaceful brotherhood. Around the turn of the 20th century the movement had begun to decline, but under Besant’s leadership many lodges in Europe, Amer- ica, and India revived. In the Netherlands in 1926 Besant announced to the world gathering of Theosophists that the world teacher whom the society had anticipated since Blavatsky’s time had been located. This teacher was the young Jiddu K RISHNAMURTI . The occult formulations and esoteric teach- ings of the society have influenced many Western teachers and movements that do not use the name Theosophy, including Alice B AILEY and the Lucis Trust; Guy Ballard and the “I AM move- ment”; Elizabeth Clare Prophet and the Church Universal and Triumphant; and Rudolph Steiner and Anthroposophy. Theosophical publishing houses are responsible for making available to the general public many texts and writings of Hinduism. Today the Theosophical movement includes the Judge-Tingley-dePurucker branch called the Theosophical Society, headquartered in Altadena, California. This organization sponsors the Theo- sophical Press, which publishes the periodical Sun- rise and operates a large library. The Theosophical Society in America, part of the larger International Theosophical Society in India, is headquartered in Wheaton, Illinois. This organization sponsors the Theosophical Publishing House and Quest Books, publishes the American Theosophist and Discovery, and operates the Olcott Library at Wheaton. The Theosophist, founded in 1979, is still published at Adyar, India. The United Lodge of Theosophy, founded in 1909 by Robert Crosbie, former member of the Point Loma community, is headquartered in Los Angeles and sponsors Theosophy Company, its publishing house. This organization publishes The- osophy, a monthly periodical. All of the Theosophi- cal organizations cited here maintain Web sites. Although current membership statistics are not available, adherents to the formal structure of Theosophy are becoming fewer. Yet its historic role in introducing Eastern thought and philoso- phy to the West remains secure. Further reading: Bruce F.

Therapanthi The Therapanthis are a schismatic movement within the the S THANAKAVASI sect of Jains ( see J AINISM ). It emerged from the attempt by the 18th- century monk Bhikanji to deal with the peren- nial conflict faced by Jain monks: to eschew all worldliness or to work actively for the welfare and salvation of all beings.

He argued that if one were, for instance, to save the life of a dog, one would then be responsible for the violent KARMA of that animal in the rest of its life. Other Jains, shocked at this conclusion because of its apparent rejection of the Jain notion of AHIMSA or noninjury, predicted that Bhikanji would never have even 12 disciplines. Therefore, when the sect did in fact take hold, it became known as the Therapantha (the way of the 13). Further reading: V. G.

Thind, Bhagat Singh (1892–1967) teacher of Sant Mat in the United States Bhagat Singh Thind, an Indian-American disciple of the reformist S ANT M AT movement, became the subject of a court case in the 1920s that had far- reaching consequences for the American Indian community. Thind, born in A MRITSAR , Punjab, and initi- ated by Sant Mat Satguru Sawan Singh (1858– 1948), migrated to the U NITED S TAT E S in 1913. He attended the University of California and earned his living, as did many Punjabis, working in the lumber mills in Oregon. During World War I he served in the U.S. Army. In 1920 he applied for and was granted citizenship. Thind’s move to become a naturalized citizen occurred in the wake of the passage of the Asian Exclusion Act of 1917, which included provisions that blocked further immigration from India. India’s inclusion in the definition of “Asians” to be excluded had in part been prompted by the so- called “Hindoo riots” that occurred in Washing- ton, Oregon, and northern California protesting the many jobs that were given to Punjabi men in the lumbering industry. After the final approval of Thind’s citizenship, a naturalization examiner challenged the court’s decision. That challenge initiated a three-year court process that rested on a provision of an earlier 1790 law, which had opened citizenship to any “free white person” not otherwise encum- bered. Thind argued that he was a “Caucasian” and hence a “white person.” The case went to the United States Supreme Court, which in 1923, in an opinion written by Justice George Suther- land, ruled that not all Caucasians were white in the common understanding of that term and revoked Thind’s citizenship. That ruling also led to the withdrawal of a number of other previous grants of citizenship to Indian Americans. The ruling in the Thind case stood as federal policy until changes were enacted in immigration law in 1965. In the meantime, Thind remained in the United States and maintained his vocation as a Sant Mat teacher, though generally describing himself as a Sikh ( see S IKHISM ). He lectured widely across the United States, primarily to non-Indian audiences, and authored a number of books and booklets. He educated himself on American religion and argued for his faith, comparing it to transcendentalism and Christianity. In his mature years, cut off from the Sant Mat community, he developed his own unique, eclectic spiritual system. He later married a French American, Vivian Davies, who worked for many years to introduce Indian culture into the United States. They had one son, David, who keeps his father’s writings in print.

The uni- verse arises and disappears in an infinite series of cycles. In this time scheme, every “Great Age” (M AHA - YUGA ) encompasses four successive Ages (Y UGAS ), beginning with an Age of Truth (K RITA , or Satya, Y UGA ) and progressively declining until an Age of Corruption (Kali Yuga, which has no relation to the goddess Kali, spelled differently in S ANSKRIT ). A long series of such oscillating Great Ages even- tually plays out, until the universe dissolves and remains absent for a time equal to its previous presence. Then, it once again emerges into a new round of Great Ages. The Jain tradition shares this notion of cycles, defined somewhat differently. Buddhism has its own version of endless time, stretching in both directions, past and future. Different traditions or puranas describe the story of time in varying ways. In one version, after the long night of B RAHMA , equal to 4,320,000,000 years, when the universe is in dissolution, the Supreme Being, V ISHNU , stimulates the ever -present nature, or PRAKRITI (who exists in potential form while the universe is gone), to reemerge as the universe. The universe then begins a new Krita, or Satya, Yuga, now seen as a Golden Age, fol- lowed by a Treta (Silver) Age, a Dvapara (Bronze) Age, and finally a Kali (Iron) Age, the final Age of Corruption. We are currently in one such final age. Each Mahayuga, or Great Age, equals 12,000 god-years, each of which lasts 360 human years, for a total of 4,320,000,000 human years. The Yugas decrease in duration: a Satya Yuga is 1,728,000 years, Treta is 1,296,000 years, Dvapara is 864,000 years, and Kali is 432,000 years. Dur- ing this decline human stature, longevity, and morality also progressively decline. One thousand Mahayugas, or cycles of four Yugas, make up a kalpa (eon), a day in the life of Lord B RAHMA , 4,320,000,000 years. Each kalpa is followed by a time of calamity and disaster, on the Earth and in all the worlds. All beings perish. Fire overtakes all of the worlds, followed by a massive flood. Finally all the elements return to the seed of primordial nature, or prakriti, and time itself ends, only to reemerge when the cosmic night has ended. Within these cycles is another classification of time called the MANVANTARA , each of which is ruled by a M ANU , or “first man,” the progenitor of the human race in that period. Because the universe dissolves and reappears again and again, there are an infinite number of such figures. Each kalpa sees 14 Manus reign in succession. This means that a manvantara takes up approximately 71 Yugas. One manvantara thus lasts 367,020,000 years. Each manvantara has seven RISHIS (V EDIC seers), certain deities, an I NDRA , and a Manu. The Manu of our era is known as Vaivasvata. He is the seventh Manu of our kalpa, or eon. We are currently in the Kali Yuga, but there is no agreement among the sources as to precisely where we are in this 432,000-year cycle and when this age will end.

Westcott was born in Newburyport, Massa- chusetts. Privately educated, she became inter- ested in social work and founded the Society of Mercy, a relief organization on New York City’s impoverished East Side.

Previously, she and the third co-founder, Henry Steel Olcott (1832–1907), had moved to India, where each had absorbed elements of the Indian spiritual environment. Through the early 1890s, Judge challenged the role of Besant, a relatively new member of the society who emerged as head of its important Esoteric Section, in which Bla- vatsky had taught psychic development and occult practices. Judge’s challenge of Besant led the majority of the American section to break with the interna- tional society. Before he died in 1896 Judge desig- nated Tingley, whom he had seen as a capable and dedicated leader, as his successor. Tingley stepped into her role immediately and traveled the globe on a World Crusade for Theosophy. When she returned to America, she set up headquarters at Point Loma at San Diego, California, where she founded the School for the Revival of the Lost Mysteries of Antiquity. Tingley led the Theosophical Society in an interesting direction, mixing esoteric teach- ings with an experiment in communal living at Point Loma and developing a variety of outward- directed programs in the community. Among the more interesting programs was a relief work effort in Cuba that included taking a group of Cuban children to Point Loma. Theosophy is basically a Western esoteric teaching, but it resonated with Hinduism at a variety of points. Most notably, it shared an understanding of the individual as essentially a substantial soul that reincarnated in different bodies through time. The youth division of the school at Point Loma was designated the Raja Yoga College, a designation Tingley took from the S ANSKRIT sense of “royal union.” She saw true edu- cation to consist in the harmonious development and balancing of all human faculties. As taught at the school, raja yoga was a system for developing psychic, intellectual, and spiritual powers and a union with one’s higher self (the inner divine source of all). The Tingley-led Theosophical Society opposed the emphasis placed on the role of Jiddu K RISH - NAMURTI (1895–1986). Besant’s designation of Krishnamurti as the vehicle of the World Savior in the 1920s attracted many new supporters to the international Theosophical Society, though most left when in 1929 Krishnamurti rejected his con- nection with Theosophy. Tingley’s organization was crippled by Tingley’s death in July 1929 in an automobile accident in Germany, and by the col- lapse of the stock market in October that year that plunged the world into an economic depression. Tingley led every activity at Point Loma, and during her life the society flourished, though her inability to delegate authority and her neglect of the organization’s other centers became evi- dent after her death. The society remained vital through the 1930s but lost the land at Point Loma during World War II. In the later half of the 20th century, the International Theosophical Society recovered the support of the majority of American Theosophists. Further reading: Bruce F.

Tirthankara The Tirthankaras (ford crossers), those who have crossed the ocean of birth and rebirth and have been released from the bonds of KARMA , are the central objects of devotion for Jains ( see J AINISM ). A Tirthankara is a karmically select being, not a god, but a perfected YOGI who has reached enlight- enment.

Technically, no one can become com- pletely released from karma until death; Jains use the term Tirthankara in anticipation of the libera- tion from karma that these venerated beings have earned. In each “half-era,” 24 Tirthankaras manifest. Such events have transpired for an infinite num- ber of eons and will do so in the future; thus, there have been an infinite number of Tirthan- karas, in theory. Besides, Jain cosmology posits numerous other realms beyond our Earth where other Tirthankaras manifest, so it is understood that though we have no living Tirthankara here on Earth, there is always one alive somewhere in the universe. In Jain temples the Tirthankara is often the central icon in the shrine, usually depicted at his or her moment of enlightenment and first teaching, surrounded above and around by all the gods, humans, and animals present to hear the teaching. The 24 Tirthankaras of the current half of a cosmic cycle: R ISHABHA , Ajita, Sambhava, Abhinandana, Sumati, Padmaprabha, Suparshva, Chandraprabha, Suvidhi/Puspadanta, Shitala, Sreyamsa, Vasupujya, Vimala, Ananta, Dharma, Shanti, Kunthu, Ara, Malli, Munisuvrata, Nami, Nemi, P ARSHVANATH /M AHAVIRA . D IGAMBARA and S HVETAMBARA Jains agree on this list; however, the Shvetambara believe that Malli was a woman, while the Digambaras do not accept that women can achieve enlightenment or release from karma in a female birth. Most often the names of the Tirthankaras are followed by the term Natha, or “Lord,” for example, Parshvanath. The final Tirthankara of our half of a cosmic cycle, M AHAVIRA , however, is generally not addressed this way. In iconography, the first Tirthankara and the last three are by far the most commonly seen. Further reading: Jyotindra Jain and Eberhard Fischer, Jaina Iconography, 2 vols. (Leiden: E. J.

Tirumular (c. sixth century) Tamil Shaivite saint Tirumular has a unique position in the Tamil literature. He is one of the 63 orthodox Shaivite ( see S HAIVISM ) saints of the Tamil pantheon, while also considered the first of the mysterious Sittars ( SIDDHAS in Sanskrit), the antinomian, antiortho- dox YOGIS of that tradition. Tirumular is so called because he entered his mula (body) by the grace of Tiru (the sacred one), the designation of S HIVA ’s bull N ANDI . He says in one of his verses, “God cre- ated me, so that I might recreate Him in Tamil.” Tirumular is known for his sixth-century poem Tirumanthiram, which forms the 10th book of the Tamil Shaivite canon, the T IRUMURAI .

Tirumurai The Tirumurai is the Tamil Shaivite ( see S HAIVISM ) canon. This set of sacred texts, written in Tamil, holds a place in that tradition at least equal to the S ANSKRIT texts about S HIVA . It is a collection of devotional hymns and stories of holy men and women, written over the course of 600 years by the 63 Tamil Shaivite poet-saints. The entire 12-volume canon was assembled between 1080 and 1100 by Nambi Antar Nambi. Nambi began with the seven-volume T EVARAM , his collection of hymns by the three great saints S AM - BANTHAR , A PPAR , and S UNDARAR . Nambi then added M ANIKKAVACAKAR ’s poems, the Tirukkovaiyar and T IRUVACAKAM , as the eighth book, and collected 28 hymns by nine other saints into the ninth book. He made the Tirumanthiram of T IRUMULAR the 10th book. The 11th book has two parts; the first contains 40 hymns by 12 other poets, and Tirumurai 449 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 449 12/14/06 9:29:38 AM"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"the second contains his own contribution, the Tirutontar Tiruvantathi.

Finally, Nambi made S EKKILAR ’s P ERIYA P URANAM , a larger summary of the lives and works of the Shaivite saints, the 12th book. Thus, the Tirumurai is a vast heterogeneous collection. It spans the centuries from the first Shaivite saint, the woman Karakkal Ammaiyar (c. 500 C . E .), to Sekkilar in the 12th century. For a fuller list of the Shaivite saints see N AYANMARS .

Tirupati Tirupati (also known as Tirumala) is a site in southern Andhra Pradesh where a TEMPLE to V ISHNU in the form of Venkateshvara stands on top of a sacred hill. It is one of the major PILGRIMAGE sites in India and may be India’s richest temple. People go to see Venkateshvara for practical ends, with wishes for children, wealth, or success in education. It is very common for people to have their head shaved in the town of Tirupati, to fulfill a vow to the deity, who has been humbly beseeched. As many as 30,000 pilgrims a day walk the long narrow winding roads to the top of Tirumala hill to the modest-sized temple there. There are rest houses along the walking route. A bus ride to the summit takes approximately one hour from the bottom. The summit is a dramatic 2,100 feet over the city of Tirupati. As are most Vaish- navite temples Tirupati is known for its delicious PRASADA , or “grace food,” which is given to all who visit the Lord. The food is symbolically offered to God and divinely eaten by him before it is given to the worshippers to take home. The temple is known both for allowing non-Hindus into its inner sanctum and for keeping the eyes of the image covered—its look is considered too potent for people to bear. The temple is located amid the famous seven hills of the Sheshacalam mountain range, said to represent the seven hoods of the divine serpent A DISHESHA , the couch for the recumbent V ISHNU as they float on the M ILK O CEAN between eras. The oldest part of the temple dates to the ninth or 10th century. There is a credible tradition that the temple was originally a M URUGAN or S HIVA temple that was converted to Vishnu by the famous Vaishnava Acharya R AMANUJA in the 12th century. The temple was enlarged considerably under the V IJAYANAGARA kings, who took Venkateshvara as the patron deity of the royal family.

Tiruvacakam The Tiruvacakam is the celebrated collection of hymns by the Tamil Shaivite poet-saint M ANIK - KAVACAKAR . Together with the shorter poem Tiruk- kovaiyar, it forms the eighth book of the Tamil Shaivite canon T IRUMURAI . Tiruvacakam contains 51 hymns comprising a total of 3,414 lines. The hymns range in length from eight to 400 lines and show a significant variety of metrical forms, with 14 subvarieties of meter. The hymns are usually rhymically recited or sung rather than read. The work includes some unusual themes. Some have a woman in the role of devotee to the Lord, singing songs appropriate for playing games or doing village chores. One interesting poem is meant to be sung to awaken the divinity in the temple in the morning (a common part of Indian K 450 Tirupati 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 450 12/14/06 9:29:39 AM"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"temple ritual). Because of its sacredness, Tiruva- cakam has no traditional commentaries attached to it. Manikkavacakar’s most important theme is the shadow of KARMA , which hovers over all as a specter. The poet calls to God to remove the bonds of karma and free him. He also speaks of impurity that takes him on the long road; when impurity has been removed, he becomes a slave to Lord S HIVA . (For both Shaivites and Vaishnavites, the truest devotee is often called a “slave to the feet” of the divinity.) Most importantly he asks for Shiva’s grace to escape the hold of the senses, which lead one to impurity and destruction. Man- ikkavacakar is not, in the end, antisensual, but is wary, as many renunciants are, of the pull of the unrestrained senses.

Transcendental Meditation Transcendental Mediation (T.M.) is a meditation practice taught first in the 1940s by Maharishi M AHESH Y OGI , a disciple of Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (1869–1953), affectionately known as Guru Dev. Maharishi has refused to discuss his early life and little has been discovered. It is known that he was born Mahesh Prasad Varma and that he graduated with a bachelor’s degree from Allahabad University. Beginning in the 1940s, he spent 13 years in silent retreat with Guru Dev. After the death of Guru Dev in 1958, Maharishi started teaching publicly and began to gather disciples. He taught what he had learned from Guru Dev and added some of his own ideas to strengthen the work. His movement began to attract global attention when celebrities such as Mia Farrow, Jane Fonda, and the Beatles became involved. In T.M., each student is given a private, indi- vidual MANTRA or sound for silent repetition. The overall strategy of Maharishi is revealed in his book The Science of Being and Art of Living, in which he spells out the groundwork for creating worlds of unmanifest being, with the goal of real- izing God. The theoretical base on which T.M. operates is termed the Science of Creative Intelligence (SCI); practitioners maintain that their objective is scientific and not religious; the basic technique for SELF - REALIZATION is derived from V EDIC science and technology. T.M. claims that its effective- ness has been scientifically proved in therapeutic settings involving criminals, drug abusers, and alcoholics. The technique is described as a simple mental exercise that initiates deep relaxation and rest. It is generally practiced for 15 to 20 minutes in both the morning and evening. Although the technique was inspired by Vedic practices, instructors in T.M. and the Maharishi do not consider the prac- tice to be specifically Hindu, as it does not require either belief in or devotion to a deity. The ben- efits of this practice (lowering of blood pressure, decreased effects of stress, and rehabilitation from dysfunctional habits) are said to have been veri- fied by more than 500 scientific studies conducted at 214 independent universities and research institutes in over 27 countries. The research has been published in scientific journals in India, Europe, Canada, and the United States. Transcendental Meditation has received acclaim for improving physiological functioning, developing mental potential, improving concen- tration, improving health, preventing disease, and bringing about positive effects on social behavior. In 1977, T.M. announced its S IDDHA program to help initiates achieve paranormal abilities, including levitation of the body. A former teacher of the Siddha program eventually sued the coun- cil, claiming that these manifestations of unusual Transcendental Meditation 451 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 451 12/14/06 9:29:39 AM"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"phenomena could not be achieved. He won a judgment of $138,000. T.M. was largely introduced to the West through two organizations, the Spiritual Regen- eration Movement and the Student International Meditation Society. In 1971, Maharishi purchased the defunct Parsons College in Fairfield, Iowa, and turned it into Maharishi International University, which in 1974 was renamed the Maharishi Univer- sity of Management [of the Universe]). The school awards bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees in consciousness-based education. Currently, almost 800 students are enrolled in programs structured one course at a time in small classes over a period of four weeks. Degrees are granted in science, the humanities, and Vedic science. In 1972, Maharishi revealed a World Plan to guide the nations of the world in using the insights derived from the practice of T.M. and the Science of Creative Intelligence. The World Plan includes a wide spectrum of activities for cultural renewal, health, freedom from war, and personal development. Over the last generation, a number of different organizations have been formed to implement the plan’s ambitious goals. According to the World Plan Council, T.M. is not a new religious group, but some observ- ers disagree. In the United States controversy arose as T.M. teachers were receiving government funds to teach T.M. in places such as the public schools and the armed forces. In 1978, a federal district court in Newark, New Jersey, ruled that T.M. was indeed a religious practice and could not receive public funds; nor could government agencies promote its teachings and practice. After this ruling, the sharp upward trajectory of growth for the movement fell sharply, though it remains a substantial movement worldwide. The New Jersey ruling pointed to the use of MANTRAS as a form of japa yoga; to T.M. initiations, which include traditional religious acts (most of which were never explained to Westerners); and to the acceptance of the movement in India as a form of S HAIVITE Hinduism. Millions of people have taken T.M. courses. There are currently more than 7,000 authorized teachers working at 400 teaching centers. As the movement has grown, it has become to a large extent decentralized. In the United States, a Vedic City is being planned on land adjacent to the Maharishi University of Management. The many T.M.-related bodies are described in Web sites sponsored by the global movement. During the 1980s the council introduced a line of A YURVEDIC medical products and opened a center adjacent to the university to promote them. The writer and physician Deepak Chopra emerged as a leading exponent of Maharishi’s Ayurvedic ( see A YURVEDA ) program but has in recent years distanced himself from the organization.

Where there were no per- manent homes in the Krita Yuga, in the Treta Yuga trees become the homes for people. A beautiful honey (not made by bees) could be found in holes in the trees and was all the food people needed. People were all happy, well fed, and healthy. However, passion and greed began to increase in this age. People remained truthful, but they focused on worldly success. As people cycled between greed and virtue, the trees would dis- appear and reappear. In their absence, people suffered from cold and heat and had to build shelters. Toward the end of the Yuga, people grew more angry and more greedy, and men tried to possess each other’s wives and wealth. In response, Lord B RAHMA emitted the warrior class, the K SHATRIYAS , to set limits in the world. Equality vanished as classes were formed. Further reading: Cornelia Dimmitt and J. A.

Brahma is the creator god, Vishnu is seen as the sustainer of the world, and Shiva is seen as its destroyer. In theistic Hinduism these three are often seen as aspects of one divinity, either Shiva or Vishnu. Shiva and Vishnu are the two divinities around which the two great Hindu sects, S HAIVISM and V AISHNAVISM , constellate. Brahma is not a sectarian divinity, and there are only two temples dedicated solely to Brahma in all of India. Though it resem- bles the trinitarian conceptions of Christianity, the trimurti is a much looser concept and was not emphasized theologically or theorized upon in any way as the Trinity was in Christianity.

Trinidad had become a British colony in 1802, after a takeover from Spain. After Britain abolished slavery in 1833, African slaves left the sugar and cocoa plantations to pursue employment as free workers in urban areas. To fill the labor shortage on plantations, British offi- cials developed a scheme to introduce indentured servants from India. Between 1845 and 1917 approximately 140,000 such workers arrived in Trinidad. Most were from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Calcutta in northern India; others were from Madras (Chennai) in the south. About 60 percent of them were males. The majority left their homes in India to escape decades of famine, while others sought to escape increased British repression in India after the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny, the first of several revolutionary outbreaks of Indian nationalism. Indentured servants were originally contracted to work five years, yet the majority remained in Trinidad and formed permanent settlements. They were enticed by the offer of free land and did not want to return to India, where conditions had not yet improved. Settlers soon converted the land- scape, renaming streets and villages with familiar references to their Indian home. Colonial officials initially sought Indian work- ers from the lower castes, claiming that B RAHMINS had “soft hands” for the hard work of the cane fields. British policy soon explicitly denied pas- sage to the well educated in an effort to prevent Brahmins from stirring resistance among lower- caste workers. Nevertheless, approximately 10 percent of workers entering Trinidad were Brah- mins, who secured passage by concealing their caste status and changing their name. Many arrived in response to the urgent plea for spiritual guidance. As more Hindus settled permanently on the island, Brahmins were able to practice their religious duties more openly. By 1870, pub- lic Hindu rituals were common in villages that had large populations of Indians. Hindus in Trinidad followed the diverse forms of traditional worship and rituals common in their homeland. Over time, exposure to multi- cultural experiences and pressure by Brahmin leaders to make Hinduism a respected religion on the island combined to transform Hindu practices and make them distinct from Indian Hinduism. In the early 20th century the Brahmin caste con- solidated and standardized doctrines and ritual practices in an official, organized orthodoxy now defined by the Sanatana Dharma Maha Sabha, the largest Hindu organization in Trinidad. This central organization prescribes congregationally centered practices, BHAKTI rituals (devotions), and the study of scriptures. The specification of a Hindu orthodoxy has placed Hinduism on a par with other religions, compatible with Christianity and Islam. Changes in Hindu observance include the elimination of caste. Nevertheless, the Brahmin priest is recognized for ritual purposes. Brahmins were once considered to have lost their caste status once they traveled across the ocean, but the general population of Hindus today receive Brahmins with reverence as unique practitioners of essential and inherent duties. Today, many Brahmins in Trinidad are not full-time pandits (teachers) or priests but rather rely upon secular jobs for their income. Hinduism has also made its impact on the larger culture of Trinidad. The popular Hindu fes- tival D IVALI has become recognized as a national holiday in Trinidad with the growing influence of Hindu representation in government. Divali, also known as the festival of lights, is a much anticipated week-long event that honors L AKSHMI , the goddess of light, wealth, and prosperity. It is celebrated in the same way as Hindu communi- ties observe Divali internationally: families and communities join together, homes are decorated with traditional clay lamps, and festive meals and sweets are prepared for the celebration. The climax of the holiday occurs with the lighting of the lamps, which are arranged in homes, on K 454 Trinidad 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 454 12/14/06 9:29:39 AM"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"porches, along streets, and throughout villages. The thousands of lamps are lit to dispel darkness and ignorance. In the 1920s, buildings known as koutias became a regular feature in the country’s land- scape. The structure, found throughout the Bhoj- pur region in India, traditionally served to house the temple caretaker. In Trinidad, koutias became additions to traditional temple structures and served as congregational halls. Many koutias were built in communities where there were no tradi- tional temples, in order to attract visits from SWA - MIS . The congregational halls became converted into central places of worship and began housing numerous Hindu deities. By the 1950s, the koutia temple became a unique feature of Trinidad’s Hin- duism. The structure of the koutia includes a long rectangular body with a flat or low-angled roof. When attached to a traditional temple it appears with a decorative dome at its front entrance. The temple typically holds up to 100 worshippers, who use the structure for congregational rituals, seminar talks with visiting swamis, and general worship services. At present, approximately 300,000 Hindus reside in Trinidad and Tobago. They make up about 23 percent of the country’s population and represent the second largest religion in the country after Christianity. Hinduism continues to thrive. Despite the incursion of secular influences, many young people remain interested in their faith and continue to support the preservation of Hindu traditions. Further reading: K. O.

Tukaram (1608–1649) Maharashtran poet-saint Tukaram was a Maharashtran poet-saint, who sang Marathi songs in praise of Vithoba or Vit- thala, a local incarnation of K RISHNA . He appears to have been low-caste in birth, probably S HUDRA . As with many of the poet-saints little is known of him for certain, and most of that is taken from autobiographical snippets found in his verses. The primary hagiographies, the Bhak- tililamrita and the Bhaktavijaya, were both written by one Mahipati. They contain many miraculous events and much information that is probably not factual. Poet-saints sometimes find the corpus of their works expand over the years as others mimic their style and wish to have verses of their own composition appear under the respected name of a saint. This phenomenon is evident in the case of Tukaram. Thus, there is no possibility of issuing a critical edition of Tukaram’s words, though many editions and sets of verses have been attributed to him. The hagiographical biography is as follows: Tukaram is born as an AVATA R of the Mahatrastran saint-poet Namdev at the behest of V ISHNU him- self, after his parents, Vaishnavite Bolhoba and Kanakai, sincerely entreat God for a saintly son. When Tukaram reaches manhood, his father gives him responsibility in his business. Because his first wife is feeble, Tukaram’s father arranges a sec- ond for him. Tukaram proves inept at business, as he has otherworldly concerns; when he does have a successful venture he gives away all his profits to a needy B RAHMIN . Tukaram falls into severe poverty and his elder wife starves to death. Then his eldest son dies. At this, Tukaram renounces the world and retires to a mountain to worship Vithoba. There Vithoba reveals himself to him. Tukaram’s second wife continues to serve him as her husband but com- plains bitterly of his otherworldly nature. Tukaram is known for his kindness and caring for all. He feeds the hungry by miracles, he aids a lame woman, he repairs a temple. Gradually, he Tukaram 455 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 455 12/14/06 9:29:40 AM"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"attracts disciples and gains fame in his worship of Vithoba at Pandharpur. The famous Maratha king Shivaji visits Tukaram, who tells him to return to kingship and not renounce the world. Tukaram performs many miracles, including turning iron into gold.

It is often put on a four-sided ped- estal placed in a special location in one’s house or near a place of worship. It is sometimes seen to be the wife of Vishnu, L AKSHMI herself. One popular legend explains its origin: once Lakshmi and S ARASVATI quarreled and cursed each other. Sarasvati’s curse turned Lakshmi into a tulsi plant and forced her to live on Earth for- ever. Vishnu, however, intervened and modified the curse, saying that Lakshmi would remain on Earth as tulsi until the river Gandaki flowed from her body. In another story tulsi is understood to be the plant incarnation of Vrindadevi, the primary and archetypal “forest goddess.” She beautifies the flora and fauna of the ultimate spiritual forest, Vrindavana (B RINDAVAN ). She appears in this world so that her leaves may be used in the worship of K RISHNA . Tulsi is offered daily in Vaishnavite pujas, whether in the temple or at home. When an orthodox Vaishnavite B RAHMIN male dies, a tulsi plant is worshipped and a bit of root is placed in his mouth and leaves are placed on his face and eyes; he is sprinkled with a tulsi sprig that has been dipped in water. This ritual is said to guar- antee heaven. Some say that even looking at this sacred plant confers release from sins. Any illness or pollution from contact with pol- luting people or substances is said to be removed by worship of the plant. Tending the tulsi plant is said to assure liberation from birth and rebirth. Sprigs of tulsi are offered to Vishnu especially in the month of Karttika (October–November). Tulsi dipped in saffron will please Vishnu. A twig of tulsi given to someone can lift his or her troubles and anxieties. Tulsi leaves are aromatic, and the plant is thought to help with coughs; it is taken as a folk medicine. Orthodox Vaishnavite Brahmins take it after meals to help digestion. It is also taken before and after rituals. Further reading: Abbé J. A. Dubois, Hindu Manners, Customs and Ceremonies.

Tulsidas (1532–1623) greatest Hindi poet It can be said without reservation that Tulsidas is the greatest poet to write in the Hindi language. Tulsidas was a B RAHMIN by birth and was believed to be a reincarnation of the author of the S ANSKRIT R AMAYANA , V ALMIKI . Tulsidas was born in the village of Rajpur in Uttar Pradesh in 1532 C . E . He died in 1623 C . E . at the age of 91 at Asighat in B ENARES (Varanasi). His father’s name was Atmaram Shukla Dube and his mother’s was Hulsi. Tulsidas’s birth name was Tul- K 456 tulsi 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 456 12/14/06 9:29:40 AM"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"siram. The story of Tulsidas’s life is not historically verifiable and many details clearly are intended to enhance the understanding that he was a saint. For example, he did not cry at birth and was born with 32 teeth. His early life was fraught with sorrow because his parents died when he was still young. Some say that his foster parents also passed away when he was young. We know he was married to a woman named Buddhimati or Ratnavali. It is said he had a son named Tarak. Tulsidas was inordinately fond of his wife. One day she went to her father’s house without telling her husband. When Tulsidas found out, he could not stay away from her and went to sleep with her in her father’s house. Buddhimati, trying to resist his advances in embarrassment, said that if Tulsi- das had half the love for Lord R AMA that he had for her lowly body, he would most certainly reach liberation from birth and rebirth. Shamed by this, Tulsidas resolved to leave the householder life and become an ascetic. He spent the next 14 years visiting the vari- ous PILGRIMAGE sites of North India. Living in the wilderness, Tulsidas would spill the excess water after his ablutions on the root of a particular tree. This pleased the being within the tree, who offered Tulsidas a boon. Tulsidas asked for a direct vision of Lord Rama. The being told Tulsidas to go to a particular temple where H ANUMAN , the monkey god, visited regularly in the form of a leper. He was told to approach Hanuman for his request. This he did, and he received DARSHAN of Lord Rama. Tulsidas wrote 12 books, but, by far, the most important is the Ramcharitmanas ( The Holy Lake of the Acts of Ram ), a Ramayana written in old Hindi ( Avadhi ) couplets. The book was written under the direction of Hanuman himself. It is read all over North India, and particularly during the time of the Ramlila. It is sung aloud in large groups for devotional purposes. Vinaya Patrika is another excellent book said to be written by Tulsi- das, who also authored Gitavali (1571), Kavitavali (1612), and Barvairamayana (1612) Several stories demonstrate Tulsidas’s special spiritual status. Once some thieves went to his ASHRAM to steal. They were frightened off by a dark-complexioned guard holding a bow and arrow in his hand. The next morning they asked Tulsidas about this unusual-looking guard. Tulsi- das realized that it had been Lord Rama and was overcome with devotion. In thanks, he gave away all his wealth to the needy. In another story it is said that Tulsidas, while visiting B ENARES , was greeted by a murderer, asking alms in the name of Lord Rama. Tulsidas invited him to his house and gave him PRASADA , sacred food, from the worship of Rama. The B RAHMINS were angered; they thought it improper to give a criminal such a blessing and to sit and eat with him. The Brahmins challenged Tulsidas; they said they could approve giving alms to a murderer only if the tem- ple icon of N ANDI , Shiva’s bull mount, would accept food from the hand of this murderer. Tulsidas took them up on this challenge, and the temple Nandi did indeed eat from the murderers hands. In another tale saint Tulsidas restores a poor woman’s husband to life. Finally, Tulsidas is said to have been jailed by the Mughal emperor; when he was freed by a band of monkeys, friends of Hanuman, the emperor himself, though a Muslim, recognized Tulsidas as a saint.

In 1968 she received a spiritual awakening and received initiation into SANNYAS (renunciation). She traveled to India with Swami S ATCHIDANANDA , founder of the I NTEGRAL Y OGA I NTERNATIONAL and studied his teachings. She began publishing books and recording devotional music, reflecting her spiritual life. In 1975 she was given the name Swami Turiyasangitananda and began to establish a small following in the United States. In 1983 she established the Vedan- tic Center on 48 acres of land in the Santa Monica Mountains near Agoura, California, and built an ASHRAM to serve its growing membership. The ashram was renamed Sai Anantam Ashram in Chumash Pradesh in 1994. Sai Anantam incorporates both the teachings of Swami Satchidananda and Western spirituality. Music and singing have a central role at the ash- ram. Devotional compositions influenced by Turi- yasangitananda’s musical talents mix traditional BHAJANS with modern Western features. Studies at the center include readings from the V EDAS and the Hindu scriptures as well as Christian, Islamic, and Buddhist texts. Sai Anantam is open to seekers of all faiths. Turiyasangitananda emphasizes basic Vedic prin- ciples including the advancement of human life, self-purification, selfless service, and unity with God. The center has primarily African American members. Approximately 30 residents live at Sai Anantam and others from the surrounding com- munity attend regular worship services. Activities at the ashram include Sunday school for children, weekly worship, chanting of services, and prayer. The ashram has a bookstore and a vegetarian res- taurant. Radio and television programs are also produced by the center. Avatar Book Institute of Agoura Hills distributes Turiyasangitananda’s writings and recordings.

Judith was born on May 17, 1902, in Califor- nia. Her parents were both Danish Theosophists; her mother reportedly chanted a Vedic hymn to the entering soul throughout her pregnancy carry- ing Judith. Her parents sent her to the T HEOSOPHI - CAL S OCIETY ’s Point Loma Raja Yoga School and the Theosophical University. She earned an M.A. and Ph.D. in Religion and Philosophy with a concen- tration in Oriental thought and S ANSKRIT studies. While working on her degrees, she began to teach at the Raja Yoga School. In 1932 she became its assistant principal, a position she left to become the dean of studies at the Theosophical University in 1935. As a scholar, she began to work on the S AN - SKRIT terms that had been introduced into Theo- sophical teachings. Her first book, Sanskrit Keys to the Wisdom-Religion, appeared in 1940. In 1947, Tyberg moved to India to pursue fur- ther studies at Benares Hindu University and to follow a spiritual quest that was leading her from Theosophy to Hinduism.

United Kingdom The National Census of April 2001 reported 559,000 Hindus living in Britain, approximately 1 percent of the population, making Hinduism Britain’s third largest religion. In 1977, 70 per- cent of Hindu residents were Gujarati, 15 percent Punjabi, and others originating from other Indian locations, such as Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, as well as Sri Lanka. The presence of Hinduism in Britain goes back at least to the early 19th century, when Rammohun R OY (1772–1833), founder of the B RAHMO S AMAJ , visited England toward the end of his life and died in Bristol in 1833. In 1870, Keshab Chunder S EN , another representative of the Brahmo Samaj, visited London and initiated the transmission of Hindu thought and practice to the West. Only later, in 1911, was a branch of this Hindu reform- ist organization established in London. The substantial presence of Hindu communi- ties in Britain can be traced to the late 1950s and 1960s, often the result of enforced alienation, rather than employment. Hindus now have a noticeable presence in numerous major British cities. At the early stages of settlement, Hindu communities rented premises for PUJA (worship services). A decade later, during the late 1960s and 1970s unused churches and some private houses were converted into Hindu TEMPLES , and a few temples were built dating from the 1990s. There are some 150 mandirs (temples) in Britain: the earliest is the Sri Geeta Bhawan in Birming- ham (1967), and the largest is the Sri Swamina- rayan Mandir in Neasden, completed in 1995. Hinduism’s main traditions are reflected in Britain’s religious landscape: Vaishnavite, Shaivite, and S HAKTA , as well as some presence of the N AT H tradition. Within the Vaishnavite tradition, the S WAMINARAYAN sect enjoys some prominence. Although followers speak a variety of languages, the use of S ANSKRIT in worship is prevalent. All major Hindu festivals are celebrated. Hinduism has inevitably undergone adapta- tion in the D IASPORA .

Rites of passage have undergone some change. Initially temples were not registered for the solemnization of marriage, thus necessitating a civil ceremony as well as a religious one. Hindu temples, however, are now formally recognized as places of wor- ship, although the ceremony must incorporate elements necessitated by British law. F UNERAL rites have undergone some modification, to make them more compatible with crematorium arrange- ments. The CASTE system continues to prevail and remains relevant to POLLUTION , marriage, and eat- ing prescriptions. A number of umbrella organizations have been formed to champion the interests of British Hin- dus. These include the National Hindu Students Forum UK (founded 1993), the Hindu Council of the UK (founded 1994), and the National Council for Hindu Temples. The last of these was set up in the late 1980s, mainly by the I NTERNATIONAL S OCIETY FOR K RISHNA C ONSCIOUSNESS (ISKCON), to enlist the support of the wider Hindu community for ISKCON’s activities. Few indigenous Britons have converted to Hin- duism in its traditional forms. However, a number of Hindu-related movements have emerged within the country and have proved attractive to West- erners.

United States The dissemination of Hindu thought and practice in the United States began before any Hindu teacher entered America. Ironically, the assimilation of immigrants from India has not been a primary vehicle for the introduction or popularization of Hindu teachings. The development of appreciation for Hindu traditions followed a standard American pattern—dependence on European scholarship and interpretation in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries and independent experimentation and selectivity in the 20th and 21st. During the 17th century, colonists and missionaries set up relation- ships with India that led to translation into English of some Hindu sacred texts. The B HAGAVAD G ITA , translated in 1785, became important to Emerson, Thoreau, and other leaders of the transcendentalist movement early in the 19th century.

Cotton Mather, spokesman for militant Christianity, maintained a keen inter- est in the East, but only as a field in which Chris- tian missionaries might preach, teach, and convert the “heathen.” In 1721, Mather’s India Christiana outlined the methods he felt were best suited to drawing Hindus into the flock of Christ. Later in the 18th century, tangible evidence of contact with India reached American eyes. In 1784, the ship United States sailed to Pondi- cherry and returned to stock Boston, Salem, and Providence with cloth, teas, spices, and crafts. By 1799, William Bentley, minister of the Second Congregational Church of Salem, Massachusetts, set up the East India Marine Society and became the first notable collector in America of Oriental art and artifacts. The first attempts to understand Hinduism and the East were those of American thinkers who were inheritors of the spirit of the Enlightenment, a time in which redefinition of religion was cen- tral. In Europe, Voltaire hailed Confucius as one of history’s great men, and English deists found Oriental religions of equal merit with Christianity.

In the 1780s, while occupying a judgeship in Bengal, Sir Wil- liam established the Asiatic Society and translated the Laws of Manu and Kalidasa’s Sakuntala. Joseph Priestley, scientist, scholar, and founder of English Unitarianism, traveled to America in 1794 and spent the last decade of his life there. His works of philosophy, science, and theology reveal a new understanding and respect for the Hindus, a people of “superior wisdom and civilization.” Praising the culture, control, and traditions of the Hindus, Priestley stopped short of extolling their religion, which he dismissed as “absurd notions” and “complicated polytheism.” As a reader of the translations of Sir William Jones, Priestley looked back toward European thinking and scholar- ship. As a resident in America, he exerted direct influence on John Adams, who heard the elderly Priestley lecture in Philadelphia in 1796. Adams, in turn, referred Thomas Jefferson to Priestley’s writings. At the turn of the century, Hannah Adams’s A View of Religion (1801) encouraged greater acceptance of non-Christian faiths. In her study, Adams devotes considerable attention to Hindu- ism, describing the voluntary suffering to which the Indian submits in order to fulfill religious obligations and labeling Indian religion “the most tolerant of all.” The open-mindedness of A View of Religion reflects a new liberality willing to dis- pute the supremacy of Christianity and to make religious questions and religious toleration a stan- dard, at least among the informed. Spreading this new liberality of interpretation was Unitarianism, with its emphasis on tolerance and the centrality of monotheism. In India, Hin- dus were responding to the impact of Christianity. Among the reformist movements in India was the B RAHMO S AMAJ , a movement based upon the assumed monotheism of the U PANISHADS and the abandonment of all image worship. The founder, Hindu Rammohun R OY , found spiritual affinity with Unitarianism and sought to apply Unitarian standards to Hinduism and to focus the atten- tion of Unitarians on India. By 1820, Roy had published several Hindu texts in English and had developed his ideas on Hindu reform in articles and speeches, which were featured prominently in Unitarian periodicals published in the United States. Roy’s writings and talks explaining Asia and Hinduism were the first expressions by a Hindu in Unitarian terms to which Americans had access. In the 1850s the Unitarian Charles Dall and the Brahmo Samaj’s Keshub Chunder S EN developed a friendship that initiated a relationship between the two organizations that is still bearing fruit. Later in the 19th century, leaders of the tran- scendentalist movement read newly translated Hindu scriptures and incorporated their ideas in an American philosophy. Emerson stressed eclec- tic theology; Thoreau, the immersion in nature; and Bronson Alcott, an interest in universal scrip- tures. Influenced by Emerson, Walt Whitman wrote poetry that expressed a remarkable similar- ity to Asian thought. In his writing he admits he had read “the ancient Hindoo poems,” and he mentions B RAHMA and Hinduism in his “Song of Myself.” While these figures created an intellec- tual climate receptive to the ideas of Hinduism, transcendentalism did not attempt to represent all of Hindu teachings, but rather selected elements consistent with their worldview. Another American group, the Free Religious Association, made up largely of Quakers, Uni- tarians, and transcendentalists, turned to world religions to support their rejection of a faith based solely on the Bible. Their publications and meet- ings featured the works of the Oriental scholar Max Muller and championed the idea of a world Bible. Through this organization, active from 1865 through the late 1880s, the American conscious- ness was exposed to comparisons and contrasts of Christianity and Hinduism. In its 17 years of pub- lication, The Index, journal of the Free Religious United States 465 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 465 12/14/06 9:29:41 AM"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"Association, issued more than 500 separate works explaining and describing the East. Beginning in 1875, the T HEOSOPHICAL S OCIETY took to the United States an appreciation of Hindu- ism and Buddhism, interpreted through the lenses of its Western leaders, H ELENA P ETROVNA B LAVATSKY , Charles Leadbeater, and A NNIE W OOD B ESANT , who traveled to India and took home firsthand impressions. Theosophists directly proclaimed an adherence to Asian thought but included elements of occultism and psychism as well. As a result of this synthesis, the contribution of Theosophy to the developing American consciousness was an amalgam of Hinduism, Buddhism, spiritualism, and rationalism. Helena Blavatsky’s Isis Unveiled claimed direct revelation from Eastern adepts, called Mahatmas, and celebrated the traditional Hindu concepts of REINCARNATION and KARMA . In spite of its original association with spiritualism, Theosophy exerted a major influence in both India and the United States. By 1884, in addition to its success in the United States, over 100 branches of Theosophy flourished in India. Continuing until the present, various Theosophical publish- ing houses have been important disseminators in the United States of Hindu texts, commentaries, and histories. Much of what Americans grasp of Hinduism has been a result of the popularity of Theosophical publications. Uniquely American religions, including New Thought and Christian Science, took up Hindu concepts. The New Thought churches, which include Religious Science, Divine Science, Unity School of Christianity, Mind Cure, and Applied Metaphysics, concentrated on V EDANTA philoso- phy and the concepts of REINCARNATION and KARMA . Indebted to the research of the Theosophists, exponents of New Thought gained for Hinduism a new kind of acceptance, however narrow, in the United States. No longer were the doctrines of the East damned as pagan nonsense; they were now incorporated into American religion. Christian Science, with its radical monism, its doctrine of eternal mind, its disavowal of the ultimate reality of the world, and its unorthodox interpretation of Christ, demonstrated a mixture of Eastern and Western views of reality. The sources of the Chris- tian Science founder Mary Baker Eddy’s ideas remain in debate, but the result is clear: the incor- poration in an organized American church of at least some of the ideas and values of Hinduism. While religious movements and philosophi- cal schools offered their interpretations of Hin- duism, scholars were examining the East from their own perspective. The American Oriental Society, founded in 1842, provided a forum for scholarly exchange. It established a library and published the Journal of the American Oriental Society, which ran bibliographic essays reporting on Vedic research occurring in Germany, transla- tions of religious texts that exposed ideas formerly unavailable to American readers, and essays on the philosophy of Hindu scriptures and on the various schools of Hinduism. These scholarly efforts lifted cultural, religious, and linguistic barriers. Leaders in the society were Edward Salisbury; William Dwight Whitney, who became America’s greatest Oriental scholar; and Charles Rockwell Lanman, who, among other contributions, edited the Har- vard Oriental Series. Attempts to understand and explain surfaced in the general press as well. Although popular magazines did not carry reliable information about Asia, serious reviews served to foster escape from American isolation by looking analytically at Hindu ideas and scholarship. The North American Review, as did the Edinburgh Review, touched on many aspects of Indian culture and the Hindu reli- gion. Book publishing reflected the new interest in the East. The popularity of Sir Edwin Arnold’s Light of Asia (1879) and his free translation of the Bhagavad Gita (1885) drew the author to the United States for a lecture tour. In 1883, the first Hindu GURU visited America. Protap Chunder Mozoomdar, a representative of the B RAHMO S AMAJ , delivered his first American address at the home of Ralph Waldo Emerson’s widow in Concord, Massachusetts. He returned K 466 United States 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 466 12/14/06 9:29:42 AM"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"in 1893 to attend, along with many representa- tives of the religions of Asia, the W ORLD P ARLIA - MENT OF R ELIGIONS in Chicago. The congress was the first international gathering of representa- tives of the major Eastern and Western faiths. Speakers gave formal recognition to non-Chris- tian faiths and made clear that Western thought had always drawn heavily on the East, and that Hinduism was a source of tolerance, introspec- tion, self-discipline, and the opportunity for a full religious life, not mere idol worshipping or polytheism. This 17-day conference, which drew crowds far larger than any forecast, permitted non-Christians to speak about their own faiths and created an appreciation of the offerings of Eastern traditions. The experience affirmed that an interest in comparative religions was not simply the province of a few specialized or elite groups. Swami V IVEKANANDA , another representative of Hinduism and a young disciple of the late Sri R AMAKRISHNA , was one of the parliament’s most impressive speakers. He was hailed by the Ameri- can press as the most persuasive speaker of the parliament. In several eloquent presentations, Vivekananda rejected formalism and delivered a universal gospel of unity in diversity by quot- ing from the sacred books of India. He chose to cite, “Whoever comes to Me, through whatsoever form, I reach him,” and “All men are struggling through paths which in the end lead to Me.” He spoke of the gods of all faiths, not only the God of a respective religion (Rolland, 1931). His popularity established, Vivekananda fol- lowed the parliament session with a two-year tour of the United States. In 1895, he founded the first Hindu organization in the United States, the V EDANTA S OCIETY , and, upon his return to India, he organized the scattered disciplines of Sri Ramakrishna into the R AMAKRISHNA M AT H AND M ISSION . Two disciples, Swami A BHEDANANDA and Swami Turiyananda, traveled from Calcutta (Kol- kata) to head the Vedanta centers in New York and San Francisco, respectively. Establishment of the Vedanta centers coin- cided with the first small wave of immigrants from India to America, in the 1890s—a phenomenon that evoked riots and vitriolic reaction against a “Hindu invasion.” But reason also existed and prompted a growing interest in Hinduism among non-Indians, the establishment of various societ- ies, and the arrival of Indian teachers, partly to serve the immigrants. Among them, in 1902, was a young monk, Swami R AMA T IRTHA , who lectured for two years throughout the United States on the reasonableness of Hinduism—and the evils of the Indian CASTE system. In 1904, a Bengali Vaish- navite, Baba Premanand B HARATI , began a five-year tour, during which he formed the Krishna Samaj; in 1909, Swami P ARAMANANDA , another member of the Ramakrishna Math in India, arrived, eventu- ally to form another group of Vedantins. From the time of the parliament onward, the United States saw the establishment of Hindu organizations and an expanding interest in the teachings of the religion. In large cities such as New York and Chicago, the press chronicled the exploits of visiting teachers from India. Emulat- ing these emissaries, some Americans adopted the role of Hindu teacher and helped disseminate Hindu ideas through publications and formation of groups. In 1903, William Walker Atkinson, a New Thought teacher, assumed the title Yogi R AM - ACHARAKA and published widely on various YOGA s and Hindu philosophy. His many books remain in print a century later. Around 1909, P IERRE A RNOLD B ERNARD , calling himself “Oom the Omnipotent,” founded the Tantrick Order of America and dem- onstrated flamboyant stagecraft while dressed in Eastern garb. In spite of the demise of his move- ment after a few decades, his nephew, Theos Ber- nard (1908–47), wrote several texts on YOGA that remain reliable resources. After two decades of growing interest in Hin- duism from 1895 to 1915, the growth of Hindu groups waned during and after World War I. A string of American occultists created in the public mind the image of SWAMIS as fortune tellers and United States 467 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 467 12/14/06 9:29:42 AM"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"charlatans. After Sara Bull left the greater part of her half-million-dollar estate to the Vedanta Soci- ety, her daughter called for testimony of family servants, who reported frequent visits of swamis, a MEDITATION room, and séances. On the basis of their testimony, the court overturned Bull’s will and awarded the money to her daughter. A series of articles in the press spewed forth, complaining that Americans, particularly women, were duped by Indian “holy men” and were forsaking the true Christian faith. A recurring theme was that Hinduism appealed to bored older women who had sizable fortunes to bequeath to their teach- ers. In 1914, Elizabeth Reed’s Hinduism in Europe and America attacked alleged exploiters of naïve Westerners and blamed the tenets of Hinduism for their crimes. Anti-Asian sentiment had direct political effect as well. Following immigration exclusion acts in 1882 and 1914 directed primarily against Chinese and Japanese immigrants, the Asian Exclusion Act of 1917 specifically denied immigration to Asians from India. By denying entry into the United States from most Asian countries, including India, the act effectively cut off immigration for several generations and halted what would have been, most probably, a significant growth of Hindu- ism. Several years later, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that Indians were not eligible for citizenship and that the citizenship granted to previous Indian immigrants would be revoked. By 1921, a quota system allowed immigration from countries in proportion to each nationality’s per- centage in the United States. The quota for India was approximately 100 annually. This federal act of exclusion significantly curtailed the growth of Hindu movements. Of the organizations formed before 1917, only the Vedanta Society remained. In 1927, Katherine Mayo’s best-selling M OTHER I NDIA damned all things Indian and heaped oppro- brium on the worship of K ALI . Mayo characterized Indians as inert, helpless, and weak: in all, slaves to superstition and oppressors of women and minorities. Perhaps no other writing damaged Indo-American understanding so severely and so prejudiced an entire generation of Americans. From the early 1920s until 1960, anti-Indian feeling was strong, although Hinduism itself was not perceived as a political threat. This period includes two world wars, American isolation- ism after World War I, intense hatred of things Eastern because of Pearl Harbor, and the Korean conflict. That attacks on India and Indian tradi- tions occurred is hardly surprising. What may be surprising are the viability and growth of interest in Hinduism throughout this period. The Hindu community grew very slowly after the passage of the exclusion act. Teachers who immigrated prior to the exclusion act continued to lead and write. A Bengali playwright, Besudeb Bhattacharya, took the name Pundit Acharya and founded the Temple of Yoga, the Yoga Research Institute, and Prana Press in New York. Paramah- ansa Y OGANANDA , charismatic teacher and author of the still-popular Autobiography of a Yogi, arrived in the United States in 1920 and organized the Yogoda-Satsang in 1926. Now known as S ELF - R EALIZATION F ELLOWSHIP , Yogananda’s organization has been extremely influential in disseminating Hindu thought through home correspondence courses and initiation into KRIYA YOGA disciplines. Other teachers from India created organizations, taught Hindu ideas and practices, and fostered interfaith cooperation, including A. K. Mozumdar (The Messianic World Message), Swami Omkar (Shanti Ashrama), Sri D EVA R AM S UKUL (Dharma Mandal), Kedarnath Das Gupta (Fellowship of Faiths), Sant Ram Mandal (Universal Brotherhood Temple and School of Eastern Philosophy), Rishi Krishnananda (Para-Vidya Center), and Swami A. P. Mukerji (Transcendent Science Society). Theosophy continued to contribute to the dissemination of Hindu ideas through its grow- ing number of lodges and its reliable editions of Hindu and Buddhist texts. Theosophy also gained increasing popularity through its promotion of Jiddu K RISHNAMURTI as the vehicle for the coming world teacher, prophesied by spiritual adepts in K 468 United States 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 468 12/14/06 9:29:42 AM"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"the East. Krishnamurti, a poor B RAHMIN boy from South India, had been selected by the Theoso- phists to be groomed for acceptance of a higher consciousness that the world would need in the current era. He lectured throughout the 1920s as the anointed messiah but became disillusioned with the Theosophical enterprise and, in 1929, renounced the organization founded in his name. Upon leaving the Theosophical fold, he began his own career as an independent teacher, founding educational institutions in England, the United States, and India and lecturing until his death in 1986. Although Krishnamurti rejected any claim to represent Hinduism (or any organized religion), he nevertheless taught a form of self-analysis and self-observation that was congruent with Hindu and Buddhist disciplines. And, in his later years, after having shunned the study of sacred texts throughout his life, he became enamored of the V EDAS and the U PANISHADS . Americans who became familiar with Krishnamurti’s teaching were drawn closer to Hindu thought and practice, although they did not identify themselves as “Hindu.” Later, in 1951, a Bengali philosopher, Haridas C HAUDHURI , founded the Cultural Integration Fel- lowship in San Francisco, which represented the first American influence of the famous philoso- pher and mystic Sri A UROBINDO . Chaudhuri was a charismatic proponent of Aurobindo’s approach to integralism in philosophy and yoga, adding his own insights to his teacher’s message through col- laboration with other scholars of the East. In the 1960s Chaudhuri founded the California Institute of Asian Studies, an educational organization that exists today under the name California Institute of Integral Studies. In the fall of 1965, the Asian Exclusion Act was repealed and immigration quotas for Asia became comparable to the quotas for Europe. The number of Indian immigrants rose dramatically. Between 1871 and 1965, only 16,013 Indians had been admitted to the United States. Between 1965 and 1975, over 96,000 were admitted, and the 1980 Census reported 387,223 Indians in the United States (Melton, 1985). By 1965, most large American cities had at least one Hindu center where lectures could be heard, texts purchased or read, and courses taught in Hindu philosophy. Although relatively small, these groups were sig- nificant in their stability and in their attempts to make Hindu literature available. Popular figures such as Edgar Cayce (1877–1945) made tradi- tional Hindu concepts, such as reincarnation and karma, almost standard fare for spiritual seek- ers not bound to traditional denominations. But popularization has been accompanied by charges of violence, fraud, drug misuse, and emotional abuse leveled against some Indian and American promoters and leaders of Hindu and related New Age groups. Hinduism, in its various guises in the United States, has provided inspiration to spiritual seekers, an entry into countercultural pursuits, and groups who have experienced backlash from conservative quarters. Most immigrants from India have not been teachers of Hinduism, but rather Hindu lay people seeking traditional venues and methods of prac- ticing their religion. Unable to fund conventional structures, such as temples and shrines appropri- ate to their respective sects, they have joined other Hindus to create temples that serve several modes of Hindu worship—S HAIVITE , Vaishnavite, and S HAKTA —within one structure. Groups of Hindus have cooperated to recruit traditionally trained priests to the United States to preside over ritual activities at these temples. Since the 1960s, elements of Hinduism have entered popular culture as components of various forms of spirituality, health practices, cosmetics, bumper stickers, and medical and psychological therapies. Somewhat independent of its source in Hinduism is the popular practice of HATHA YOGA , almost pervasive throughout the country in a variety of forms. Romain Rolland, French student of Vedanta, spoke in 1931 of the “strange moral and religious mentality of the modern United States” that was both cause and effect of the appropriation of Hindu thought in the 19th United States 469 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 469 12/14/06 9:29:42 AM"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"century. Simultaneous with stringent efforts to preserve traditional Hindu teachings intact and in toto is the more dominant American practice of eclecticism, which combines elements of any (or all) religions into idiosyncratic fusions designed to serve the individual.

Members of certain low- status castes were considered polluting and not allowed to touch any person of the upper castes, particularly B RAHMINS and members of the warrior and merchant castes. This practice was exagger- ated even further in parts of South India, where certain people were considered unseeable and had to stay out of sight of the upper castes. The history of untouchability no doubt tracks the rise of A RYAN cultural domination of India. There is evidence to suggest that certain tribal groups and peoples last integrated into the Aryan fold became classified as “out-castes” or the “fifth caste” (where the Aryans had a fourfold class system from great antiquity). The custom is sup- ported by a very complex social conception of “ POLLUTION ” related to occupation. Purity is seen to reside in certain types of activity such as teach- ing and recitation of the V EDAS , and in habits such as VEGETARIANISM , while such essential social tasks as sweeping, the collecting of refuse, the removal of carrion animals, and the production of leather are considered severely polluting. Caste, more properly jati, or birth, is in fact directly related in most cases to occupation, so untouchability is generally conferred by birth. (However, certain polluting situations within the family context, such as having someone recently die in the household, make any person, whatever the caste, polluting or “untouchable” for a limited time.) It should be noted that almost all of the major freedom fighters in India who sought indepen- dence from Britain denounced the notion of caste and called for the abolition of untouchability. M OHANDAS K ARAMCHAND G ANDHI was most notable in this regard. He coined the term harijan (those born of God) to relieve the stigma from untouch- ables. The constitution of India was written by an untouchable (who also became a Buddhist), Dr. Babasaheb R. Ambedkar (1891–1956). In the set- ting up of India’s central and state governments, untouchables were given designated quotas of positions, including parliamentary seats, to guar- antee their advancement. Today, India’s untouchables have taken an increasingly militant political stance. They prefer to call themselves Dalit (the oppressed). Many of them have converted to Buddhism, following Dr. Ambedkar’s conversion in late life. Buddhism was always opposed to caste notions and preached spiritual equality. Further reading: B. R.

They all take this name to gain the authority of the original Upanishads, about 14 in number, which are considered part of the B RAHMANA or commentaries that are asso- ciated with the four V EDAS . (Each of the four is divided into a MANTRA portion, which consists of Upanishads 471 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 471 12/14/06 9:29:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"the chants themselves, and a B RAHMANA , or com- mentary. Both portions are considered SHRUTI , or revelation.) Within the Brahmana portion of the Vedas are two classes of passages that later took the names A RANYAKA and Upanishad. The Aranyaka portions often closely resemble the Brahmana but often contain esoteric interpretations of the Vedic ritu- als. The further sections, sometimes within these Aranyaka sections, were termed Upanishads. While included in the Vedic literature, the Upanishads were composed somewhat later, roughly in the sev- enth to third centuries B . C . E ., although they exist in the same ancient literary S ANSKRIT . Upanishad in its literal definition means “to sit down near.” They represented secret teachings reserved for those who sat near their GURU in the forest. They contain a wide range of material. Some of it is indistinguishable from the rest of the Brah- mana or Aranyaka, but other sections discuss the creation and nature of the universe. Most often, the discussions concern the BRAHMAN , or ultimate reality; the ATMAN , the ultimate self or soul; or their relationships with the individual self or soul. In many places these Upanishads make clear that the individual self, seen from the highest consciousness, is nothing but the ultimate reality in all its glory. The exact relationship between the ultimate reality and the souls became the subject of centuries of discussion and mystic insights into the nature of things. The most commonly listed Upanishads are I SHA , K ENA , K AT H A , Prashna, Mun- daka, M ANDUKYA , T AITTARIYA , A ITAREYA , C HANDO - GYA , B RIHADARANYAKA , Pingala, and Jabala. Further reading: S.

The night goddess, Ratri, is often called her sister. Some of the most beautiful hymns of the V EDAS are addressed to Ushas. Sometimes she is seen as the mother of the Sun god and sometimes his wife. She travels in a shining chariot drawn by red horses or cows. She is seen as very beautiful, dressed in orna- ments and fine raiments. She gives life and health to all beings.

In Vedic tradition the words of S ANSKRIT have a divine character. Words are not arbitrary or mere names, but are the essential truth of the object they represent. The sounds of the word tree, for instance, form the essence of a tree. All of reality can be seen as mere congealed speech. Vedantic theory sees four levels of speech: (1) the transcendent level, where speech is the divine silence out of which emerges the mani- fest universe; (2) speech as it becomes incipient thought looking toward manifestation; (3) speech expressed as thought, but before external expres- sion; and (4) speech as uttered words.

It was understood that attachment to worldly desires and ends can result only in continued rebirth, a continued circuit on the wheel of SAMSARA or worldly life. The period from the eighth to the sixth cen- turies B . C . E ., when J AINISM and Buddhism first emerged along with the U PANISHAD era within the V EDIC tradition, saw a great expansion in mendicancy and ascetic orders and a flowering of traditions of renunciation. The Vedas themselves, in their ancient MANTRA sections, upheld a very different, world-affirming point of view. Ever since in India, it has been those who left the ordinary world behind and abandoned worldly concerns who have been credited with the greatest spiritual accomplishments. Vairagya in one form can mean simple avoidance of worldly externals, but in its most difficult form it might mean bodily mortification. In either case it is a central feature of Hindu religious life.

An adher- ent of Vaishnavism is a Vaishnavite, “One who belongs to Vishnu.” Vishnu can be worshipped alone as Mahav- ishnu or “Supreme Vishnu,” but Vaishnavites more commonly worship one of the two most prominent AVATARS or manifestations of the god- head, R AMA or K RISHNA , along with their respec- tive consorts, S ITA or R ADHA . To be sure, every Vaishnavite reveres all 10 of Vishnu’s avatars. As all Hindu traditions do, Vaishnavism traces itself back to the V EDAS and honors them as the ultimate authority. Vishnu, “The All-Pervad- ing,” is only a minor divinity in the Vedas, but the roots of a devotional cult that can be called Vaishnavite had been established by the later Vedic period in the sixth or fifth century B . C . E . The M AHABHARATA and R AMAYANA epics are both primarily Vaishnavite documents, highlighting the stories of Krishna and Rama, respectively. The B HAGAVAD G ITA within the Mahabharata is a sophisticated philosophical text that outlines the Vaishnavite path of devotion in the context of Vedic and U PANISHAD ic visions of the divinity. The later temple-oriented Vaishnavism is based largely on the ancient P ANCHARATRA tradition. The followers of Vaishnavism are many fewer than those of Shaivism, numbering perhaps 200 million. If there is a distinctive character to Vaish- navism, aside from its doctrine of the avatar, it is in its commitment to the life of a householder. There are far fewer renunciants in the Vaishnavite sect than among the Shaivites. (Vishnu, after all, is the “preserver” of the world, whereas Shiva himself is a naked renunciant who is the world destroyer.) Six sects of the Vaishnavites are prominent: the Shrivaishnavas founded in S HRIRANGAM in Tamil Nadu, best known for their great 12th-cen- tury teacher R AMANUJA ; the Gaudiya Vaishnavites of Bengal, founded by the great 15th-century devotional mystic C HAITANYA ; the Vallabhas or Rudrasampradaya founded at B RINDAVAN in the north by the great teacher V ALLABHA around the 15th century; the M ADHVA sect founded in the state of Karnataka at Udipi in the 13th century; the N IMBARKA , or Nimbarki sect, based in Govard- hana and founded by the 15th-century Vedantin philosopher Nimbarka; and the Sri sect founded by Ramananda, who was strongly influenced by the Ramanuja lineage, at A YODHYA . Textually, Vaishnavites revere, in addition to the Vedas and Upanishads, the epics, the B HAGA - VA D G ITA , the Vishnu Purana, the B HAGAVATA P URANA , and the hymns of the A LVARS or other poet-saints of Vaishnavism. They focus, as does Shaivism, on temple worship, with, of course, their own distinctive ritual elements. P RASADA in the form of “blessed food” is typically dis- tributed at Vaishnavite temples and shrines and festivals after being offered to the divinity. This giving of blessed food is less common in Shaivite contexts. Further reading: R. G.

Vaishya Vaishya is the term used in the ancient fourfold class ( VARNA ) system of India for the common peo- ple, including merchants and agriculturists. The earlier V EDIC term was Vish, from which the term Vaishya derived. They were “twice-born” as were the K SHATRIYAS (warriors) and B RAHMINS (priests), being invested with the sacred thread at eight to 12 years of age to symbolize a new birth into soci- ety. They were allowed to learn the V EDAS , though they probably studied them much less than the upper two classes. Vaishya merchants were known for their early support of J AINISM and Buddhism (c. 800 to 500 B . C . E .). Further reading: Klaus K.

He was born in 1473 to a Telegu B RAHMIN , Lakshmana Bhatta, and his wife, Yel- lamma Garu, a member of an influential South Indian family. Her father had been a priest at the V IJAYANAGARA court. Vallabha’s father is said to have fled B ENARES (Varanasi) while his wife was pregnant with Val- labha, because of a rumored Muslim invasion. While he hid in the forest near modern Raipur in Chattisgarh state, Vallabha emerged from his mother stillborn—but miraculously came to life. When the Muslim invasion did not take place, Vallabha’s father returned. As were many of the Vedantic ACHARYAS , or scholar-teachers, Vallabha was a precocious child who learned all the V EDAS and all the philosophi- cal systems in four years of study. After his father died when he was just 11, Vallabha spent the next 20 years wandering India’s sacred sites, remain- ing unmarried. At a mere 12 years old, he is said to have entered into a debate at the Vijayanagara court. He emerged victorious against the views of S HANKARA ’s Vedanta (absolute non-dualist) on the one hand and the views of M ADHVA ’ S supporters (dualist) on the other. Vallabha stayed at the Vijanagara court for some three years, learning the B HAGAVATA P URANA and becoming familiar with the Madhva tradition (which he did not accept). By now he had follow- ers of his own, as his debating victory had greatly enhanced his status. At the age of 15 he set out on a long pil- grimage to a great many of India’s sacred sites. One story relates that at Kaundiya Ashrama ( see ASHRAM ), Vallabha had a vision of the rishi (seer) Kaundinya, who preached to him the path of devotion, or BHAKTI ; even the Vedas and the gods do not know V ISHNU , Kaundinya said; only the one who concentrates his consciousness upon Vishnu and serves him every moment can merit that knowledge. It is said that Vallabha spent time at the impor- tant centers of R AMANUJA ’s followers and Madhva’s followers, learning all the nuances of the different philosophies. Heading north, Vallabha arrived in B RINDAVAN , the center of K RISHNA worship in India. Here he made Krishna his Lord and received the vision to establish a new sect, the Pushti Marga. The last leg of this long pilgrimage took him to the H IMALAYAS . After returning to stay with his mother for one year, he headed to Maha- rashtra and Pandaripura, where he encountered the special form of Krishna, Vitthala. Here he received the divine command to marry, as he had up till now been a celibate, though not a SAN - NYASI (renunciant). When he arrived in Benares in about 1500, he encountered a man who offered him his daughter in marriage. Vallabha 475 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 475 12/14/06 9:29:43 AM"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"Vallabha’s marriage produced two sons, one of whom was central in building his sect. While in the town of Gokula, near Mathura, Vallabha took the vow to establish his new sect. This new tradi- tion was all his own, as he had never accepted anyone as his GURU . The initiatory MANTRA of his sect was Sri Krishna Sharanam Mama, “Shri Krishna is my refuge.” An auspicious miracle soon occurred near Gokula. An image of Krishna in his pose lift- ing the mountain Govardhana appeared out of a cave. It was said that Krishna would only accept food from the hand of Vallabha. On this spot Val- labha built a small temple, later supplanted by a large complex. The temple’s image later had to be moved to Udaipur in Rajasthan, because of the Muslim invaders. There it is known as S RI S RI N AT H J I . Vallabha now embarked on a journey around the country that might be described as evan- gelical. He would debate the proponents of other systems, sharpen his own principles, and gain fol- lowers. His message resonated particularly in the area of Gujarat, thanks to the support of a famous devotional singer there. There are many stories of Vallabha’s meeting with his contemporary S RI C HAITANYA . Both made the B HAGAVATA P URANA the primary authority and both took Krishna as the fullest expression of divinity on Earth. The contrast was between Val- labha the intellectual, who prescribed worship of the child Krishna or the cowherd Krishna, and Chaitanya the ecstatic mystic, who preached “Love Devotion” based on the relationship between Krishna and his lover R ADHA . In all Vallabha wrote 17 books in S ANSKRIT and five in medieval Hindi (Braj). All but one of his Sanskrit “books” were actually brief manuscripts. His longest book was in Sanskrit, Essays on the Light of Knowledge, a full exposition of his theol- ogy. Others of his books in Sanskrit are Vyasa Sutra Bhashya, Jaimini Sutra Bhasya, Bhagavata Tika Subodhini, Pushti Pravala Maryada, and Sid- dhanta Rahasya. In the last year of his life Vallabha took vows of renunciation from the world. He wan- dered as a mendicant for only one year. The story has it that he plunged into the G ANGES at H ANUMAN Ghat in Benares and disappeared in 1531. The philosophical system of Sri Vallabhacha- rya (to call him by his honorific) was technically called Shuddhadvaita (pure non-dualism). He did not believe that the world was illusory—all the universe was Krishna alone. The worldly, then, is a lower aspect of the divine, but still an expression of the being of the divinity. In Vallabha’s system Krishna, as B RAHMAN , or the ultimate reality, was called Purushottama, the highest personage. In practical terms, the Vedanta of Vallabhacha- rya was similar to that of both R AMANUJA and N IM - BARKA . God is permanently transcendent; souls can reach union with God but remain distinct even in liberation. Distinctive in Vallabha’s system is the notion of inherent distinctions among souls. There are privileged souls who are destined for union with the divine, and other souls who are destined for eternal reincarnation without attainment of liberation (this Vallabha has in common with Madhva). His Pushti Marga, or path of grace, is unique. Pushti literally means “nourishment,” and later in the sect’s history, this word began to be taken more literally, and the eating of vast amounts of PRASADA or sacred food became a sign of the sect. However, Vallabha seemed to intend “spiritual nourishment” or “grace.” This effectively means that human efforts to reach the divine are sec- ondary; primary are the will and grace of the divine. Thus, in terms of the YOGA s of the B HAGAVAD G ITA , the yoga of action ( KARMA YOGA ), the yoga of knowledge ( JNANA YOGA ), and even meditative yoga (raja yoga) are of almost no importance to Vallabha. Devotional yoga ( BHAKTI YOGA ) alone is enjoined to gain the grace ( P USHTI ) of the divine.

Valmiki author of the Ramayana Valmiki is the mythological author of India’s great epic the R AMAYANA . His authorship, however, con- sisted simply in putting into a lasting composition a story that was related to him by the ancient RISHI (seer) N ARADA . Valmiki is said once to have seen a hunter shoot a male bird as it was making love to its mate. The female bird, seeing her mate bleed- ing and in distress, cried out piteously. In grief and sorrow, Valmiki uttered a poetic verse of two lines that upon reflection made a special meter. Because he received the line in sorrow ( shoka ), Valmiki termed the meter shloka. It is in this meter, suitable to be accompanied by the Indian lute ( vina ), that most of the Ramayana was composed. Further reading: J. L.

Vamana Avatar There are many versions of the stories about V ISHNU ’s Vamana AVATA R (incarnation), as there are about his other manifestations. In the best-known Vamana story, the avatar appeared in order to fight the asura (demon or antigod) Bali, who had succeeded by his religious austerities in gaining supreme power over the three worlds. Because of his own powers he was depriving the gods of the offerings that ordinar- ily went to them. They went to Vishnu to ask for assistance. He took on the form of a dwarf ( vamana means “dwarf” in S ANSKRIT ) and approached the arrogant demon, B ALI . The foolish demon king offered the dwarf the boon of having whatever territory he could cover in three paces. Thereupon the dwarf, who was Vishnu himself, took one step to possess the Earth, another to possess the sky, and another to possess heaven itself. (In some versions Vamana takes two paces to step over the whole universe and the last step onto Bali’s head.) Thus did Vamana return the worlds to the gods.

After he has completed his studentship and fulfilled his duty in life (when he has seen his children’s children), the man enters the forest with or without his wife to devote him- self to celibacy, austerity, study of the V EDAS , Vedic sacrifices, and spiritual discipline.

The vanaprastha and the san- nyasi stage were clearly the most ideal course of conduct and were probably never followed com- pletely by all B RAHMINS or other upper- CASTE men, for whom they were primarily intended.

The open palm indicates that the divinity or personage will bestow bless- ings upon the person who looks upon him or her with respect or devotion. Many iconic divini- ties, particularly those who have more than two hands, give this gesture with a left hand. This ancient mudra is found in the iconography of the Buddhists, Jains ( see J AINISM ), and Hindus. The B UDDHAS and the Jain T IRTHANKARAS are frequently seen using this hand gesture. This, as may any other mudra, may be used in any Indian dance when divinities are represented.

Varanasi See B ENARES . varna Varna (color) is the Vedic word for social class, in the class scheme found in Rig Veda X. 90. There the divine being is said to have offered himself in sacrifice to create reality. It is said that his mouth became the B RAHMIN , or priestly class; his arms became the Rajanya (K SHATRIYA ), or warrior class; his thighs became the Vish (V AISHYA ), or mer- chants, farmers; and his feet became the S HUDRAS , or the servant class. The “mouth” of society is symbolically impor- tant in India because of the power of divine speech through the S ANSKRIT language. The arms are obviously symbolic of the strong arms of the warrior. The thighs symbolize the ability to pro- create and create prosperity for society. Feet have long been associated with impurity in Indian tradition, but it is a fact that no body can move without its feet. There has been some debate about whether the use of the word color to denote class reflects an ancient racist system. At the present day Brahmins in any part of India tend to have slightly lighter skin than other classes, while the poorest elements of society often have much darker skin. When colors are traditionally assigned to the classes, white is for the Brahmin, red for the warrior, yellow for the mer- chants and farmers, and black for the servants. This verse of the Vedas, which may in fact have been simply an ideal scheme for an inte- K 478 varada mudra 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 478 12/14/06 9:29:44 AM"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"grated society, which could not function without any of its constituents, became the religious justi- fication for the later concept of caste. Caste itself is a Portuguese word adopted into English; the more proper word for this type of social class is jati, or “birth.” Nothing in this Vedic verse implies that varna is fixed at birth or that people can never alter their varna. It is well known, for instance, that the RISHI (seer) Vishvamitra, though born a warrior, became a Brahmin.

He is the Indian counterpart of the Greek Ouranos. Varuna is paired with several deities in rituals and hymns, most commonly with M ITRA . By himself, Varuna is seen as a guardian over the cosmic order. He is called the sovereign ruler of the universe, but this is said of other Vedic gods. Later he becomes the Indian god of the ocean.

Vasanta Panchami Vasanta Panchami festival, literally “The ‘Fifth Day of the Moon’ in the Springtime,” is celebrated on the fifth day of the bright half of the lunar month of Magha (January–February), the begin- ning of spring in India. It is dedicated to the wor- ship of S ARASVATI , the goddess of learning and fine arts. The worship is performed to a fashioned clay image, which is then put into a body of water such as a river or a tank. This festival is particularly popular in Bengal. Some call this festival Sri Panchami and equate Sarasvati (who is usually the wife of Brahma) with L AKSHMI or Sri, the wife of V ISHNU . Part of the day’s observance is a preparation for the H OLI festival, which falls 40 days later. The devotee places a flammable image of the demoness Holika (after whom Holi is supposedly named) on a log, with an inflammable image of P RAHLADA (the great devotee of V ISHNU ) on her lap. During the 40 days people throw twigs and other flammable objects on the log, which is set on fire before the Holi festival commences.

He was particularly popular in the Jain tradition ( see J AINISM ), whose PURANAS abound with stories about his life. Krishna himself is known by the epithet Vasudeva (with a long a as the second letter, indicating that he is the son of Vasudeva). Vasudeva was the chief minister of the evil king Kamsa of Mathura. Kamsa had learned that Vasudeva’s wife, D EVAKI , was destined to bear a son who would eventually kill him. He kept the couple under constant guard and had their first six children killed. The seventh child, B ALARAMA , was miraculously transferred to the womb of Vasudeva’s other wife, Rohini. When the eighth child, K RISHNA , was born, a profound slumber fell Vasudeva 479 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 479 12/14/06 9:29:44 AM"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"upon the guards, and Vasudeva was able to sneak the child across the Y AMUNA River and leave it with the cowherd Nanda and his wife, Y ASHODA , who thus becomes Krishna’s (foster) mother. The Jain puranas credit Vasudeva with 26 wives. The most complete story of the life of Vasudeva is found in the Jain text Vasudevahindi (c. third century C . E .), a work in the Prakrit lan- guage. The text was an adaptation of the earlier B RIHATKATHA story cycle, an ancient Indian story. Further reading: Cornelia Dimitt and J. A.

He makes his first appearance in the V EDAS . He is associated with I NDRA , king of the Vedic gods. He is seen as moving along in a chariot pulled by many horses. Most importantly he is regarded as the father of the monkey god H ANUMAN . B HIMA , one of the five P ANDAVA brothers in the M AHABHARATA , is said to be the son of Vayu. The term vayu is also used for one of the five elements in Hindu physics; in that context it is best translated as “air.” Further reading: Cornelia Dimitt and J. A.

(Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1990). Veda(s) Veda is derived from the word, vid, “to know.” A Veda, then, would literally be a compendium of knowledge. In Indian tradition the four Vedas (sometimes collectively referred to as “the Veda”) are the ancient scriptural texts that are considered the foundation for all of Hinduism. The four are the R IG , S AMA , Y AJUR , and A THARVA V EDAS . The Rig Veda (c. 1500 B . C . E .), the most ancient extant Indian text, is the most important of the four. It consists of over 1,000 hymns, the great majority of them from five to 20 verses long. Very few exceed 50 verses. The hymns praise a pantheon of divinities. A few of them are cosmo- gonic—they tell of the creation of the universe; these were extremely important in the later devel- opment of Hinduism. By far the greatest number of hymns in the Rig Veda are devoted to I NDRA , king of the gods, a deity connected with storms and rain who holds a thunderbolt, and A GNI , the god of fire. The rest of the hymns are devoted to an array of gods, most prominently M ITRA , V ARUNA , S AVITRI , S OMA , and the A SHVINS . The most important gods in the later Hindu pantheon, V ISHNU and S HIVA (in his Vedic guise as R UDRA ), were far less frequently men- tioned in the Rig Veda. A number of goddesses are mentioned, most frequently U SHAS , GODDESS of the dawn. A DITI is said to be the mother of the gods. Scholars have categorized the religion of the Rig Veda as henotheistic: that is, it was polythe- istic, but it recognized each divinity in turn as supreme in certain ways. Later Hinduism main- tained and enriched this henotheistic concept; in time Hindus have even been able to accept Christ and Allah as supreme “in turn.” A very powerful ritual tradition was central to the Rig Veda, with fire always a central feature. At public and private rituals ( YAJNAS ) worshippers spoke to and beseeched the divinities. Animal sac- rifices were a regular feature of the larger public rites in the Vedic tradition. Two of the other Vedas, the Yajur and Sama, were based on the Rig Veda. That is, it supplied most of their text, but the words were reorganized for the purposes of the rituals. Yajur Veda, the Veda of sacrificial formulas, has two branches, the K 480 Vatsyayana 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 480 12/14/06 9:29:44 AM"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"Black and the White Yajur Vedas; it contains the chants that accompanied most of the important ancient rites. The Sama Veda, the Veda of sung chants, is largely focused on the praise of the god Soma, the personification of a sacred drink imbibed during most rituals that probably had psychedelic properties. Priests of the three Vedas needed to be present for any larger, public ritual. The Atharva Veda became part of the greater tradition somewhat later. It consists primarily of spells and charms used to ward off diseases or influence events. This text is considered the source document for Indian medicine (A YURVEDA ). It also contains a number of cosmogonic hymns that show the development of the notion of divine unity in the tradition. A priest of the Atharva Veda was later included in all public rituals. From that time tradition spoke of four Vedas rather than three. In the Vedic tradition, the Vedas are not con- sidered to be human compositions. They were all “received” by RISHI S or seers whose names are frequently noted at the end of a hymn. Whatever their origin, none of the texts was written until the 15th century C . E . They were thus passed down from mouth to ear for at least 3,000 years. It is an oral tradition par excellence. The power of the word in the Vedic tradition is considered an oral and aural power, not a written one. The chanting itself has the power to provide material benefit and spiritual apotheosis. Great emphasis, therefore, was laid on correct pronunciation and on memorization. Any priest of the tradition was expected to have an entire Veda memorized, including all its components, as detailed in the following. Each of the four Vedas is properly divided into two parts, the MANTRA , or verse portion, and the B RAHMANA , or explicatory portion. Both parts are considered revelation or SHRUTI . The Brahma- nas comment on both the mantra text and the rituals associated with it, in very detailed, varied, and esoteric fashion. They repeatedly equate the rituals and those performing them with cosmic, terrestrial, and divine realities. Early Western scholars tended to discount these texts as priestly mumbo-jumbo, but later scholarship has recog- nized the central importance of the Brahmanas to the development of Indian thought and philoso- phy. It is not known when the various subdivi- sions of the Vedas were identified and named. The name Brahmana derives from a central word in the tradition, BRAHMAN . Brahman is generi- cally the name for “prayer,” specifically the power or magic of the Vedic mantras. (It also was used to designate the “one who prays,” hence the term BRAHMIN for priest). Brahman is from the root brih (to expand or grow) and refers to the expansion of the power of the prayer itself as the ritual pro- ceeds. The brahman is said to be “stirred up” by the prayer. In later philosophy, brahman was the transcendent, all-encompassing reality. The culmination of Brahmana philosophy is often said to be found in the S HATAPATHA B RAH - MANA of the White Yajur Veda, which explicates the AGNICAYANA , the largest public ritual of the tradition. Shatapatha Brahmana makes clear that this public ritual is, in fact, a reenactment of the primordial ritual described in Rig Veda, X. 90, the most important cosmogonic hymn of the Vedas. That hymn describes the ritual immolation of a cosmic “man,” who is parceled out to encompass all of the visible universe and everything beyond that is not visible. That is, the cosmic “man” is ritually sacrificed to create the universe. Through the annual agnichayana, the universe is essentially re-created every year. The Brahmana understands that, at its most perfect, the Vedic ritual ground is identical to all the universe, visible and invisible. The Brahmanas contained two important sub- divisions that were important in the development of later tradition. The first is called the A RANYAKA ; this portion of the text apparently pertained to activity in the forest ( aranya ). The Aranyakas contain evidence of an eso- teric version of Vedic yajna, or ritual practice, that was done by adepts internally. They would essentially perform the ritual mentally, as though Veda 481 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 481 12/14/06 9:29:45 AM"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"it were being done in their own body and being. This practice was not unprecedented, since the priests of the Atharva Veda, though present at all public rituals, perform their role mentally and do not chant. However, the esoteric Aranyaka rituals were performed only internally. From this we can see the development of the notion that the adept himself was yajna or ritual. The U PANISHADS , a second subdivision within Brahmanas, were the last of the Vedic subdivi- sions, commonly found within the Aranyakas. Many of these texts, as did the Brahmanas in general, contained significant material reflecting on the nature of the Vedic sacrifice. In fact, the divisions among Brahmana proper, Aranyaka, and Upanishad are not always clear. The most impor- tant feature of the Upanishads was the emergence of a clear understanding of the identity between the individual self, or AT M A N , and the all-encom- passing brahman, which now was understood as the totality of universal reality, both manifest and unmanifest. The genesis of this Upanishadic view that the self was in unity with cosmic reality can be clearly traced. Firstly, Shatapatha Brahmana explained that the most perfect ritual was to be equated to the universe itself. More accurately it was the uni- verse, visible and invisible. Second, the Aranyakas began to make clear that the initiated practitioner was to be equated to the ritual itself. So, if the ritual equals all reality, and the individual adept equals the ritual, one easily arrives at the idea that the individual equals all reality. The Upanishads, then, were the outgrowth not of philosophical speculation, but of self-conscious ritual practice. The later orthodox Upanishads (those physically associated with a Vedic collection) barely mention the rituals; they merely state the derived abstract concepts. Another key breakthrough in the Upanishads was the explicit discussion of REINCARNATION and the theory of KARMA , the notion that actions in this birth would have consequence in a new birth. There is evidence that karma, or ethi- cally conditioned rebirth, had its roots in earlier Vedic thought. But its full expression in V EDANTA (Hindu philosophy) had to wait for the Upani- shads. There, the earlier notion of reaching unity with the ultimate reality was seen not merely as a spiritual apotheosis, but also as a way out of the trap of rebirth (and redeath). Many texts have called themselves the “fifth Veda” to emphasize their importance in the tradi- tion. The A RTHASHASTRA , the N ATYASHASTRA , and the M AHABHARATA all have claimed that designa- tion. Sometimes the TANTRA also refers to itself as the fifth Veda. Tamil S HAIVITES or the Tamil Vaishnavites refer to their sacred texts, respectively, the T EVARAM and the Nalayira Divya Prabantham, as the Tamil Veda. Other local traditions in various languages do likewise. The term Veda is also sometimes used generi- cally in other fields of knowledge. Medicine, for example, is referred to as the “Veda of Life” ( A YURVEDA ), and the study of war is the “Veda of the Bow” ( Dhanurveda ).

Vedanta Vedanta, literally the end or conclusion ( anta ) of the V EDA , is the most important philosophical school in Indian tradition. It is a wide and capa- cious field that includes those who adhere to a strict non-dualist ( ADVAITA ) perspective, those who believe in a non-dualism with certain reserva- tions, and those who believe in the type of dual- ism ( DVAITA ) that states that God and the human soul will never be one. The one basic requirement of Vedanta is that it rest upon the three basic texts: the U PANISHADS , the V EDANTA S UTRAS , and the B HAGAVAD G ITA . Most commonly known in both India and the West is the Vedanta of S HANKARA , the seventh-century philosophical savant. This Vedanta understands that the world is illusory, M AYA , and only the transcendent ultimate reality, the BRAHMAN , is real. That brahman has no characteristics and does not act in any way. It is a pure plenum or totality that is sometimes characterized as infinite being ( sat ), infinite consciousness ( cit ), and infinite bliss ( ANANDA ). ( See SAT - CHIT - ANANDA .) A second type of Vedanta might best be described as BHAKTI Vedanta or devotional Vedanta. Here the oneness of the godhead is also under- stood, but the world is seen to be real and perme- ated by God in the form of V ISHNU , usually, or his incarnations R AMA or K RISHNA . (Vedantas that emphasize S HIVA in this way are rare.) There is no duality of soul, world, and God, but God is seen as supreme and all other realities as subsidiary. It is non-dualism with the reservation that the god- head has supreme power to act. Finally, there is the rare minority sect of Vedanta championed by Sri M ADHVA , who argues that the soul, the world, and God are all separated from each other eternally and will never be one. All is dependent upon the radically transcendent God. In the Neo-Vedanta of the followers of R AMA - KRISHNA , reality is still one, but “God” may be characterized as “Allah” or “Christ” as well as in the usual Hindu ways. Because of the power of the word Vedanta, even systems like that of S RI A UROBINDO that resemble the TANTRA will be char- acterized as Vedanta. His followers have some- times called his system Integral Vedanta. All systems of Vedanta (except that of Aurobindo) agree that the highest goal is to break the bonds of KARMA and realize mukti, or liberation.

Swami V IVEKANANDA , a disciple of Sri Ramakrishna, first introduced Ramakrish- na’s ideas of Vedanta to the U NITED S TAT E S when he addressed the W ORLD P ARLIAMENT OF R ELIGIONS in Chicago in 1893. His message was so well received that he lectured throughout the coun- try and founded the first Vedanta Society in the United States in New York City in 1896. Other swamis or monastics in the order founded other Vedanta Societies in major cit- ies. Swami A BHEDANANDA served the New York society and taught throughout the United States from 1897 to 1921. In San Francisco, Swami Trigunatita oversaw the construction of the first Hindu temple in the United States in 1906. Swami P ARAMANANDA (1885–1940) lectured all over the United States and established centers in Los Angeles and Boston. In 1923 he established A NANDA A SHRAMA at La Crescenta, California. Swami Nikhilananda founded a center in Manhat- tan in 1933. Swami Prabhavananda (1914–76) established centers in Portland, Oregon, and Hol- lywood, California. The Vedanta Society in Hol- lywood became the Vedanta Society of Southern California, with several monasteries, a convent, and the Vedanta Press. The writers Gerald Heard (1889–1971), Aldous Huxley (1894–1963), and Christopher I SHERWOOD (1904–86) were disciples of Prabhavananda. The Vedanta Societies remain under the author- ity of the central monastery, the Ramakrishna Order, headquartered in Belur Math, India. The larger organization, the Ramakrishna Math and Mission, administers a network of Ramakrishna Missions in major cities and some rural areas of India. Missions sponsor hospitals in addition to religious services. S WAMI s are trained at the math and are sent to direct Vedanta centers outside India. At present, all swamis are male, although nuns are part of the organization and convents are provided for nuns through the Sarada Math, named for S ARADA D EVI , the wife of Ramakrishna. Several swamis have left the Vedanta Society because of its traditional authority structure.

Chapter I systematically and with great specific- ity discusses the Upanishad passages dealing with BRAHMAN (the universal reality) and AT M A N (the soul or self). Chapter II is devoted to a refutation of the other interpretations, as presented by the schools of S AMKHYA , Y OGA , N YAYA , V AISHESHIKA , M IMAMSA , C HARVAKA , Buddhism, and J AINISM . Chapter III dis- cusses the PRAMANAS , the valid methods of obtain- ing knowledge (such as perception, inference, or scripture) in order to understand the brahman and atman. The fourth and final chapter discusses the results of brahman realization. The Vedanta Sutra, Upanishads, and B HAGAVAD G ITA form the traditional foundational texts for Vedantic philosophy. As a result, Vedanta Sutra has attracted numerous and varied commentar- ies. S HANKARA , R AMANUJA , and M ADHVA all wrote extensive commentaries, which strongly disagree with one another, largely because the extremely concise style of the individual lines often admits to varied interpretations.

Castes who desire to gain respect and perhaps eventual advancement in the hierarchy will adopt vegetarianism as a way to “Sanskritize” or become more Brahminical. Hindus who are on any spiritual quest in India will remove meat and other things such as spices from their diet in order to ensure spiritual purity. Meat is considered to be tamasic ( see GUNAS ), or spiritually negative, and is believed to cause excessive desire for sexuality and a tendency toward violence. Most scholars agree that vegetarianism was not originally part of the Vedic or Brahmini- cal system, though this remains a controversial conclusion. The solid evidence of the Vedic texts themselves as well as authoritative DHARMA (right conduct) texts such as the D HARMASHASTRA of Manu , indicate quite clearly that meat, including beef, was eaten by all sectors of Indian society including Brahmins. The Jains ( see J AINISM ) and Buddhists, how- ever, were extremely critical of the Brahminical animal sacrifices and of the habit of eating meat. The Jains were most radical in this regard; Jain monks (and to a lesser degree the laity) practiced AHIMSA (noninjury) from as early as 900 B . C . E ., as did the B UDDHA from around 600 B . C . E . For the Jain monks, every motion of the body had to be calculated to minimize its effect on invisible microscopic beings that were believed to exist in air, water, fire, and earth. (This may have been the first human conception of micro- organisms.) All the more did they refrain from slaughtering and eating large animals. Strict vegetarianism was required for monks, and the laity followed their example. One could never be a Jain in India, then or now, and eat meat or eggs.

They were less absolute, but they too discour- aged MEAT - EATING . The Brahminical tradition began to move in the direction of ahimsa toward the end of the last millennium before the Common Era. Law codes such as the Manu Smriti or the Dharmashastra of Manu allow Brahmins to eat the meat of sacrificial animals, but other meat eating is discouraged. The influence of ahimsa is clear in the argument that ritually sacrificing an animal is not himsa, or “killing” per se. As time went on, and Vedic ritual began to recede in importance in the culture, Brahmins took on strict vegetarianism as a sign of purity. They also followed the Jains and Buddhists in pre- venting any needless killing of any being. While Jainism and Buddhism remained localized or minority traditions, Brahmin conduct was always the model for the Hindu majority. Vegetarianism soon became the pan-Indian ideal. Further reading: D.

Often they are pictured astride an animal; at other times there is a depiction of the animal standing alone in the foreground or background. Vedic divinities did not have such mounts, but mounts were created for them in later times to make their images accord with those of the non-Vedic gods. The vehicle of V ISHNU is the man-eagle G ARUDA ; the vehicle of S HIVA is the bull N ANDI ; D URGA is often depicted astride a lion or tiger; S ARASVATI is seen in association with a swan or peacock; K ARTTIKEYA , the younger son of Shiva and P ARVATI , has a peacock vehicle; G ANESHA , the elephant-headed divinity, is seen in association with the lowly rat. L AKSHMI is unique in having a lotus that she is always shown seated upon, which serves as her vehicle. There are, however, many prominent divini- ties who do not have iconographic vehicles. These include R AMA and S ITA , P ARVATI and K RISHNA . Among the Jains the T IRTHANKARAS (perfected beings) were usually depicted in association with particular animals, perhaps in imitation of the Hindu notion. However, since the Jain tradition is so old, it is quite possible that the practice origi- nated with them. Further reading: Cornelia Dimitt and J. A.

Initially it connoted the knowledge of the Vedic MANTRAS and ritual, and it bestowed great power. When the U PANISHADS concluded that Vedic rituals alone could not help break the cycle of birth and rebirth, Vedic knowledge began to be called the “lower knowledge” ( apara vidya ) while the Upanishadic knowledge was called the higher or liberating knowledge ( para vidya ). Buddhism also used the term to refer to knowledge of the path that breaks the cycle of birth and rebirth.

He is thought to be the brother of Sayana; Sayana is the commentator on the V EDAS . Vidyaranya composed several texts. The Sarvadarshanasangraha is a discussion of different philosophical views. The Panchapadika- vivarana is considered an excellent and thorough summary of the non-dualist philosophical per- spective; Vivarnaprameyasangraha explores the same theme in a more scholarly fashion. Vidyarana’s Jivanmuktiviveka discusses those beings who have already been liberated from the cycle of birth and rebirth but remain in embodied existence. Finally, Panchadashi is a popular com- pendium in verse of Vedantic thought, known for its clarity and accessibility. Here he outlines his own understanding of the nature of the ultimate brahman, describing the maya or illusory world appearance as being in a sense a power of the BRAHMAN . Brahman is the underlying pure reality, while all names and forms are the false discolor- ation over the pure whiteness, as it were, of the ultimate reality. Further reading: S. N.

Vijayanagara (1336–1630) Vijayanagara, the “City of Victory,” was a fortress city founded by an alliance of kings as a bulwark against the Muslims in the south of India. Its vast ruins can still be seen at the site of Hampi in Karnataka. The city was the capital of a sprawling empire that controlled almost all of India south of the Krishna and the Tungabhadra Rivers at its height under King Krishnadevaraya. The empire took the name of the city, the Vijayanagara empire. Vijayanagara played a key role in Hindu history, by successfully fending off many Muslim invasions and preserving and promoting Hindu culture for nearly 300 years, at a time when the rest of India was suffering complete Muslim domination. Two princes, Harihara and Bukka, created the kingdom in 1336. Harihara I (1336–57) planned and built the great new city of Vijayanagara, which became the capital of the empire in 1343. In 1346, the Hoysalas, the last remaining South Indian rivals to the Vijayanagara kingdom, were defeated. The city covered 20 square miles and had seven concentric lines of fortifications. It had at its height a population of 500,000 people. It was an international city with wide trade ties, which helped finance beautifully carved and embellished buildings. The culture saw a flowering of South Indian civilization with support for all the sects of Hinduism, including Vaishnavite, Shaivite, and the G ODDESS , and for the heterodox Jains as well ( see J AINISM ).

Dadaji, as he in known to his friends and disciples, was born in 1942 to a B RAHMIN family in Badwel in South India. He had spiritual experi- ences as a young boy and at age six experienced a bright light filling his room and a voice urg- ing him to commit himself to the inner path of enlightenment.

In 1962 he developed a relationship with Sri A NANDAMURTI , founder and creator of the A NANDA M ARGA Y OGA S OCIETY . He delighted in the services the society provided for the sick, the poor, and the elderly. Very quickly he was promoted to yoga teacher. In 1966 Dadaji felt the need to spread the words and programs of the society to help humanity. He left India as an emissary of the society to found centers in Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sin- gapore, Hong Kong, and the Philippines. He was honored by the United Nations for his heroic work in the aftermath of the great earthquake that struck Manila in 1968. In 1969 Dadaji went to the U NITED S TATES and assisted in developing the Ananda Marga Society there. However, in the mid-1970s he left the society, created the Yoga House Ashram, and developed his own following. He settled in the San Francisco area and continued to teach that service to humanity was as important as yoga or MEDITATION . His life has been devoted to bridging the rivers that separate the East and West through traditional yoga techniques.

Vindhya Mountains The Vindhya Mountains, 1,000 to 3,500 feet in elevation, are a range of hills forming a natural barrier between northern and southern India. They mark the northern edge of the central Indian or Deccan plateau. From Gujarat state on the west, they extend about 675 miles across Madhya Pradesh state to touch on the G ANGES River valley near B ENARES (Varanasi) in Uttar Pradesh. These mountains are mentioned in the Indian epics and are mythologically associated with numerous per- sonages including A GASTYA , who is said to have caused them to bow down permanently in his travels to South India.

Vindhyavasini is depicted with the face of a bird and the body of a woman, having four arms.

Vindhyavasini is mentioned in the Devi Mahatmya, an important text that presents the various incarnations or forms of the great Goddess (Mahadevi). She is also men- tioned in an early 19th-century local text called the Vindhya Mahatmya. In both she is understood to be the BRAHMAN , or ultimate reality, in its totality. She is also assimilated to Mahalakshmi, or L AKSHMI , conceived of as the ultimate divinity. Vindhyavasini is primarily connected with the Vaishnavite tradition. The story goes that when K RISHNA was given to his foster mother Nanda to escape being killed by the evil king Kamsa, in exchange V ASUDEVA , Krishna’s father, received a divine child, Vindhyavasini. Kamsa, getting word that a birth might have occurred, went to Krish- na’s mother D EVAKI ’s house and tried to seize the new girl child. She escaped the king’s grasp and prophesied, before returning to the Vindhyas, that Kamsa would be killed by Krishna. A different account of Vindhyvasini’s birth (resembling the tale that K ALI emerged from P ARVATI ) tells of a goddess, Kaushiki, who was formed when Parvati shed her dark complexion to become golden or light in color (earning her the standing epithet Gauri, or white one). Kaushiki immediately went to the H IMALAYAS to take up her role as Vindhyavasini. There is an active and elaborate PILGRIMAGE to Vindhyavasini around the village of Vindhyachal at the northern foothills of the Vindhyas, where they touch the G ANGES between A LLAHABAD and B ENARES (Varanasi). The temple of Vindhyavasini has elements that resemble those of Kali, and ani- mal sacrifices are performed. Further reading: John Stratton Hawley and Donna Marie Wulff, eds.

Virashaivas The Virashaivas are a BHAKTI , or devotional, move- ment in the southern Indian state of Karnataka that was founded in the 12th century by their leader, B ASAVANNA . The Virashaivas were socially radical, condemning all forms of caste, establish- ing equality of the sexes, and rejecting ritual of all kinds as empty posturing. Most important for them were the GURU , the saints as a group, a personal relationship with Lord S HIVA , and high regard for the wandering seeker who embraces poverty and defies convention. One Virashaivite saint, for example, A KKA M AHADEVI , was a woman who wandered about naked. Virashaiva orthodoxy has eight elements: (1) the GURU who leads the self to Shiva; (2) the LIN - GAM , the sole symbol of Shiva, worn on a necklace by anyone; among the Virashaivas there is no indication that the lingam is considered a phallic symbol; (3) the jangama, the male or female wan- dering religious teacher who is considered God incarnate; the guru, lingam, and jangama all have sanctifying power; (4) the holy water that has touched the feet of the guru and been drunk as a sign of devotion; (5) PRASADA (grace), food blessed by the guru; devotees take this food from the feet of the guru together; commensality and commu- nity sharing occur regardless of CASTE , in defiance of ordinary social behavior in Indian tradition; (6) holy ash, which is worn as a sign of Shiva; (7) rudraksa beads, a necklace made of seeds from a special plant and worn as a sign of Shiva; they are sacred to all who worship Shiva; and (8) the five-syllable MANTRA , Om Nama Shivaya; this is an important mantra for all Shaivites. The Virashaivas recognize a number of impor- tant saints born from the 10th to the 12th cen- turies. The poem-songs of these saints are sung and recited as part of devotion. These saints are Basavanna, Akka Mahadevi, Allama Prabhu, and Devara Dasimayya.

Vishishtadvaita The term Vishishtadvaita is very commonly misin- terpreted as “qualified” (or “modified”) ( vishishta ) non-dualism ( ADVAITA ). A more accurate (though still imprecise) translation is “non-duality with differentiation.” This reflects Vishishtadvaita’s understanding of the three reals: Ishvara (God), cit (consciousness) and acit (unconsciousness). The conscious and unconscious existence are real aspects or attributes of God, non-dual or non-dif- ferent from God from the point of view of God, but they are also eternally distinct (differentiated), in that they are attributes only. God or BRAHMAN and the world are seen to have the relation of soul and body. The manifest universe is the body of God, but in his plentitude he is also an unchangeable infinity beyond the world, untouched in any way by the negatives or impurities of the world of manifestation. Vishishhadvaita tradition begins with the 12 A LVARS , the mystic poet-singers of Tamil Nadu who date from the eighth to the 10th centuries. The songs of these Alvars inspired and shape the tradition of Vishishtadvaita. The philosophy expressed in these songs was first systematically explored by the teacher Nathamuni, probably in the ninth century C . E . Nathamuni is said to have received the verses of N AMMALVAR , which he put to music in Vedic style. These verses are still sung in the temples of Tamil Nadu, in addition to verses in S ANSKRIT , and are part of the Vaishnavite V EDA in Tamil. Nathamuni is credited with composing three Sanskrit texts that still inform the tradition. He had 11 disciples, the most important of whom were Pundarikaksha, Karukanatha, and Shrikrishna Lak- shminatha. Pundarikaksha’s student Rama Mishra became the guru of the famed Yamunacharya, who was also the grandson of Nathamuni. Yamunacha- rya was probably born in the early 10th century. He was a king who renounced everything to go to S RIRANGAM , one of the most important shrines for the Sri Vaishnavite tradition, which supports the philosophy of Vishishtadvaita. Yamunacharya had many disciples, of whom 21 became prominent. R AMANUJA (born at the end of the 11th century), the greatest ACHARYA of the lineage, was born to the elder sister of one of Yamunacharya’s disciples, Mahapurna. Yamu- nacharya composed six important Sanskrit works developing the philosophy of Vishishtadvaita. As with other great acharyas of the Vishishtadvaita tradition he was a great devotee, as well as a great scholar; one of the six works he composed was a praise poem to Lord K RISHNA . Yamunacharya apparently lived to a ripe age but died before he could meet Ramanuja. Ramanuja’s own guru understood that his stu- dent would one day outshine him and tried to have him killed, but Ramanuja was miraculously saved from this attempt. Eventually, Ramanuja took Mahapurna, his uncle, to be his guru and followed him to Srirangam. He arrived just after Yamunacharya died. From seeing three of Yamuna’s fingers twisted, after death, he learned that he should do three things: (1) convert the people to the Vaishnavite doctrine of surrender, (2) write a commentary to the V EDANTA S UTRA , and (3) write extensively on Sri Vaishnavism. All these things he did. Not long afterward, he renounced the householder life and went to Srirangam to head the order and devote himself to the divinity of that shrine. Ramanuja is famed for his Sri Bhashya, his commentary on the Vedanta Sutra, but he also wrote a commentary on the B HAGAVAD G ITA and several other major Vedantic works. All Ramanuja’s works were written in Sanskrit. Two important philosophers followed Ramanuja, Parashara Bhattar, who wrote a Sanskrit com- mentary on the Sanskrit Thousand Divine Names of Vishnu, and Pillan or Kurukesha, who wrote a K 490 Vishishtadvaita 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 490 12/14/06 9:29:47 AM"},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"Tamil commentary on the hymns of the Alvars, which became a philosophical backbone for later Vishishtadvaita thought. The most prolific later teacher among many later philosophers in this lineage was Venkatanatha of the 15th century, who wrote numerous works in Sanskrit and Tamil. Most significant in the philosophy of Sri Vaishnavism is a vision of a personal divinity that is worshipped with great passion and devotion. At the same time that divinity, Vishnu, is understood to be the transcendent brahman of the U PANISHADS . The Alvar’s faith was passionate and mystical. Ramanuja’s commentaries were subtle philosophy that sought to legitimate their path in terms of Vedanta. The two paths together constitute what Sri Vaisnavas call the “Double Vedanta” ( Ubayave- danta ), which relies on both Sanskrit and Tamil textual bases.

Vishnu Vishnu in his various forms is one of the most worshipped gods in the Indian pantheon. His tradition, known as V AISHNAVISM , constitutes the second largest sect within Hinduism. Vishnu first appears in the V EDAS as a rather insignificant divinity, with only minor ritual impor- tance. There are only 64 mentions of him in the R IG V EDA , most of them in passing, with only a handful of hymns addressed to him alone. He is celebrated in the Vedas mostly for his “three steps” that saved the world, in his incarnation as V AMANA AVATA R . Vishnu first gains prominence in the later Vedic period, apparently after being identified with V ASUDEVA , a non-Vedic god popular in west- ern India in the last centuries before the Common Era, and with the god Narayana of the Vedic B RAH - MANA literature. By the time of the M AHABHARATA and R AMAYANA epics his prominence was assured. He was identified both with the gods K RISHNA , hero of the Mahabharata, and R AMA , hero of the Ramayana. Eventually, Vishnu’s cult reached full devel- opment when he was recognized as Mahavishnu (great Vishnu), preserver of the universe, who entered into the world when needed in succes- sive AVATA R s or “descents.” Before the world is created, Vishnu sleeps on the cosmic M ILK O CEAN on the back of the divine serpent A DISHESHA . Out of his navel grows a lotus from which B RAHMA the creator god emerges to create the universe. Once Lord Venkateshwara, popularly known as Balaji, is one of the manifestations of Lord Vishnu.

Iconographically, Vishnu is depicted as being of dark blue color with four arms. He is seated on a throne. In his four hands he holds a conch, a war discus, a mace, and a lotus. He wears the Kaustubha gem around his neck and has a tuft of hair on his chest called Shrivatsa. His vehicle is the man-eagle G ARUDA . His spouse is L AKSHMI , or Sri. In the highest understanding he exists as all things and also transcends them. Vishnu as the sustainer divinity takes human or animal incarnations when needed to maintain or defend the world. The B HAGAVAD G ITA says that whenever there is a decrease in righteousness and an increase in unrighteousness in the world, Vishnu (there K RISHNA ) sends himself forth. Only Vishnu among the gods is seen to take on incar- nations as part of a divine duty. Other gods such as S HIVA and the Goddess will be found in various forms, but these will not be referred to in general as avatars or incarnations. There are different lists of avatars or incarna- tions of Vishnu in different texts and traditions, variously containing 10, 12, or 22 god names. The most common list of avatars is M AT S YA (fish), K URMA (tortoise), V ARAHA (boar), Nara- simha (man-lion), V AMANA (dwarf), P ARASHURAMA (R AMA with the axe), Rama of the R AMAYANA , K RISHNA , B UDDHA , and K ALKI (his future incarna- tion). Sometimes Krishna’s brother B ALARAMA is made the 11th avatar and sometimes both Krishna and Balarama are classified as one avatar. Whenever Vishnu takes an avatar, he is subject to birth and death just as a human is. Krishna of the M AHABHARATA , for instance, dies by being shot in the heel. Further reading: R. G.

It arose as the religious wing of the militant R ASHTRIYA S VAYA M S EVAK S ANGH (RSS). The VHP was founded in 1964, in order to redefine Hindutva, or Hinduism, in a simplified but rigorous form that could compete with other world religions. It is an attempt to create a single, unified Hindu culture. Two leaders of the S HANKA - RACHARYA O RDER were present at its formation. The VHP devised a uniform religious practice, which it publicized in the 1980s. All Hindus were expected to worship S URYA (the Sun) at dawn and dusk, wear the OM symbol around their neck, keep a copy of the B HAGAVAD G ITA in their home, main- tain a shrine to their personal deity, and attend temple services. The VHP’s writings give no importance to the four V EDAS , which have always been considered the most sacred Hindu scripture. Instead, they exalt the military ethos of the B HAGAVAD G ITA and R AMAYANA . The focus of worship for the VHP has been on BHAKTI (devotional) practices, com- bined with sacrifices and PILGRIMAGES , with little attention to SELF - REALIZATION or renunciation. A unique practice introduced during the 1980s was the worship of bricks with the name of R AMA inscribed upon them. Bricks like these were used as weapons against Muslims in the murderous riots of 1992 and 2002 ( see H INDU N ATIONALISM ). Though the VHP courts the lower castes, it exalts the K SHATRIYA or warrior caste. In North America the VHP operates secretly. Its visual presence is best seen through the affili- ated Hindu Student Congress.

On Earth he is said to have fashioned the entire world, including men and women. He shares in sacrifices made by people to the other gods. The Ribhus, who make chariots and other objects for the gods, are said to be his pupils. Vishvakarma persists in the mythology of the PURANAS , where he maintains his role as divine architect and artisan.

In November 1881, while studying at Cal- cutta University, he visited Sri R AMAKRISHNA , the famous mystic and priest at the K ALI temple of Dakshineswar near Calcutta. Narendra was fas- cinated by Ramakrisha’s claim that he saw God clearly, and he wanted to know more. Although responsible for the care of his poverty-stricken family upon the death of his father, Narendra continued his work at the university and his study with Ramakrishna. He spent five years in training with Ramakrishna, during which he became committed to renouncing all of life in quest of God-realization. Ramakrishna died of throat cancer in August 1886. Then Narendra and a small group of Ramakrishna’s disciples took vows to become monks and renounce the world. In 1887 he took the vow of SANNYAS and became Swami Vivekananda (bliss of discernment). With some other young monks, Vivekananda wandered all over the subcontinent, begging for food and lodging. In his travels he learned first- hand of the imbalances in Indian society and the inhumanity of the CASTE system. He began to see the need for social service for millions of poor Indians, not traditionally an interest of spiritual seekers in India. In 1893 Vivekananda attended the W ORLD P ARLIAMENT OF R ELIGIONS in Chicago, with the intent of representing the message of Hinduism to the West. He was the most popular speaker at the parliament, giving classical, erudite dis- positions on the nature and value of Hinduism, which excited many. From this success he began a tour of the United States, lecturing in the Midwest and New York City, where in 1895 he founded the Vedanta Society of New York, the first Hindu organization founded in the United States. Upon his return to India in 1897, he found that his success in the West had increased his renown. He gathered his brother monks and founded the Ramakrishna Math and Mission, whose very name emphasized Ramakrishna’s uni- fication of the monastic life with social service. He found a site for the monastery at Belur and began relief work in nearby Calcutta. He worked with S ARADA D EVI , Sri Ramakrishna’s widow, to serve the poor. The Ramakrishna Math and Mis- sion is today one of the largest monastic orders in Hinduism. His teaching centered around advaita Vedanta and he constantly pointed to the identity of each person with the highest BRAHMAN . He believed that no one could be free until all are free. Even the desire for personal salvation should be relin- quished in favor of tireless work for the salvation of others. Vivekananda wanted to raise the inferior sta- tus of women in Hinduism by including them in spiritual life. He worked with many women in India, including Sarada Devi and Sister N IVEDITA , and with many Western disciples in promot- ing the education of and service to women. He insisted that the women of India must be able to meet the modern age with adequate education; it was the topic of one of his many books. Vivekananda made a second visit to the West in 1899–1900, during which he founded other Vedanta Centers. He was only 39 when he died on July 4, 1902, at Belur Math near Calcutta.

They are undertaken for myriad reasons, but always with the desire of pleasing the divinity. Vows are often taken to do a par- ticular thing in exchange for help from God. For instance, a mother might promise to donate a sum of money to a certain divinity’s temple, if her gravely ill child should recover. A person might carry out a vow to shave his or her head and make a PILGRIMAGE to a god’s temple in exchange for success on exams or to get a male child. In times past very severe vows were some- times taken. People were known to starve themselves to death in exchange for a divinity’s promise to remove a curse on their family; oth- ers vowed that if a son were born they would offer him up to a renunciatory order upon his coming of age. Indian mythology records innu- merable severe vows. Ravana the demon king, for instance, took a vow to stand on one toe for 10,000 years in order to win overlordship of the universe. Most vows in modern times involve fast- ing, celibacy, pilgrimage, study of sacred books, feeding of B RAHMINS or mendicants, or limited vows of abstention. Vratas can be classified in different ways. One classification divides them into those that are bodily, those that pertain to speech, and those that pertain to the mind. Another type of classification is related to dura- tion and timing of the vow, whether for a day, several years, until the fortnight is over, or until a certain star appears. A third classification is according to the divinity for whom the vow is performed. Last are vows that are specific to certain CASTES or communities. To be valid, vows must almost always begin in a condition of ceremonial purity. Most vows begin early in the morning. Festivals, in general, often entail vows taken by various family mem- bers; typically they involve fasting, but they may also involve celibacy, service to the divinity, and pilgrimage. There is a long list of special days appropriate to specific vows, usually entailing particular obli- gations of worship and observances. A devotee might vow to worship the Sun and fast on the day of Acalasaptami; to worship L AKSHMI at the base of a tree during Navaratri; to abstain from plowing on A MBUVACHI ; to abstain from fish on Bakapan- caka; or to bathe three times and make special offerings to the ancestors on Bhismapanchaka. Certain days of the month are auspicious for par- ticular vows. The 11th of the month is observed as a fast day by many Hindus. The Caturvargacin- tamani of Hemadri (c. 13th century) lists nearly 700 such vows. Further reading: Sudhir Ranjan Das, A Study of Vrata- Rites. Foreword by Nirmal Kumar Bose (Calcutta: S. C.

This overview of the status and role of women in Hindu India, and of the culture’s attitudes toward them, reflects that variety. It should be born in mind that social correlates of gender, such as CASTE , class, stage of life, age, and family membership, are all variables that significantly affect the position of women in Hindu society, so that women in Hinduism dem- onstrate significant differences in their lives. It is the case that in prehistory everywhere there were significantly more autonomy and sex- ual freedom for women (and men) than in later times. There are indications, certainly, that in pre-Vedic times in India (before 1500 B . C . E .), such freedom and autonomy existed among the pre- A RYAN tribal people who inhabited every corner of India. Tribal groups such as the Santals to this day do not restrict women’s sexuality and action in any way as their more staid counterparts in the larger culture do. Ancient Tamil poetry, dated as early as 300 B . C . E ., shows women freely choosing sexual partners before marriage and relying upon love marriages rather than family arrangements. Also, groups such as the Nayars show that matri- liny and matrilocality, which must be associated with more supportive lives for women, were probably fairly common in the Indian, pre-Aryan substratum that provides the cultural undergird- ing for much of later Hinduism. A pattern develops, visible in the Brahminical texts, of women’s having roles in the early Vedic culture (1500–800 B . C . E .) that began to be denied them even in the late Vedic period. Some RISHI s, for instance, were arguably women, and in the White Y AJUR V EDA there are chants that can be performed only by a woman who knows Sanskrit. Though Hindu tradition even up to the present day understands that women were never allowed to recite the V EDAS or even witness a Vedic ritual, these examples indicate that this rule was not strictly observed in early Vedic tradition. When hierarchies of society begin to be created in association with the creation of historical cities worldwide (in India beginning around 800 B . C . E .), such social developments generally result in the restriction of the rights of women. So was it in India, where women began to be subjugated more and more to family and husband and began to lose their role as independent actors. But as soon as the early urban period had come to fruition, perhaps W 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 499 12/14/06 9:29:48 AM"},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"as early as 400 C . E ., women began to participate as direct actors in the devotional movements and play important roles there. A good example is Karaikkal Ammaiyar (400 C . E .), who became the first of the 63 Shaivite saints. Movements like these pointed toward spiritual equality for women and, though the women saints form the exception to the rule of social constraints for women, they were prominent and numerous for many centuries leading up to the modern era. More than one movement, such as the V IRASHAI - VA S of Karnataka in the 11th century, called for spiritual equality for women and equal access to spiritual leadership. Sikhs, starting in the 15th century, held similar views, and the saint-poets of North India directly questioned the notion that gender should have any role in determining spiri- tual development or accomplishment. When modernity comes forward in the 18th through 20th centuries and radically changes traditions such as child marriage, dowry, the ban on widow remarriage, and the custom of the childless wife’s burning herself on the funeral pyre of her older husband, it must be understood that these traditions had not been unchallenged and contested in different regions and different movements within Hinduism’s large umbrella. It is important to emphasize that modern India’s legal rectification of these negative cultural sanc- tions upon women was complete, even though legal actions have not completely solved these problems. Histories of oppression are not solved overnight by the passing of just laws, but these bold legal measures are significant for a young postcolonial, independent nation. MODERNIZATION Modernization is dramatically affecting the social and religious lives of women in India. Since inde- pendence, India has sought to throw off the cloak of traditional prejudices related to caste, race, reli- gion, and gender. While traditional practices that contribute to the low status of women in India, such as child marriage, sati (widow self-immola- tion), dowry, and female infanticide, are illegal, these practices continue in some areas and among groups who have low socioeconomic status. Traditional Indian cultural practices have usu- ally been given religious justification, even when the scriptural bases for such practices were non- existent, as was often the case with women’s issues. In the extremely heterogeneous society that is India today, cultural practices cannot easily be distinguished from the religiously sanctioned prescriptions and proscriptions of Hinduism. Hindu women in India occupy a broad range of statuses, varying from the most modernized, educated, and independent to some of the most traditional, least educated, and subordinate. Within India today, social class is more important in determining the status of women than is caste membership. Educated, urbanized women often marry outside caste, religion, and nationality. It is becoming more common for newly married couples to choose their own place of residence after marriage, so that they are not within the joint family system. As a result, many elderly women and men no longer receive care from younger generations but are being placed in nursing homes where neglect can be a problem. FEMINISM On the whole, Indian women, even proponents of women’s rights and equality, resist the term feminist, which is often associated with aggres- siveness, sexual permissiveness, immodesty, and a lack of womanly virtues; feminists are assumed to be against motherhood, family values, and men. For many the image of feminism is too directly discordant with the image of the “ideal woman” in Hindu society as defined in the Brahminic scrip- tures or puranas. Even filmmakers, writers, and artists whose work aims to castigate male privilege and sexist attitudes often reject the label feminist. Modern reform movements to improve the sta- tus of women first arose in the 19th century, after the country had entered the mainstream of world civilization under British imperial rule. Both K 500 women and Hinduism 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 500 12/14/06 9:29:48 AM"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"women and men worked together to improve the conditions of women’s lives. Reform was strongest in Bengal and Maharashtra and tended to focus on ideals of family and society, rather than the inde- pendence and autonomy of women. A new women’s movement emerged in India in the 1970s, unaligned with any political parties and uninfluenced by foreign or government funding. Primarily composed of female volunteers, these women have sought to highlight the misogynist aspects inherent within Hinduism, advocate for women’s rights over their own bodies and sexual- ity, and undermine tolerance for domestic violence. They have had to contend not only against nation- alist elements, but also against Leftist resistance to discussing the oppression of women. The opening up of the domestic economy to liberalization and globalization since the early 1990s has affected the outlook of the feminist movement in India. Various nongovernmental organizations funded by foreign aid have shown interest in some of the demands of the women’s movement. WOMEN AND THE SACRED Hindu women have the feminine divine before them all the time, as the Hindu tradition preserves a worship of the GODDESS that probably dates from the Neolithic. Many divine tales recount the supremacy of the female aspect of the divine over the masculine. Through this access, women gain power in being and bearing; yet, in the social sphere, women have generally not been given freedom to reflect the powerful goddesses overtly. In Hindu society one can often hear a man say that his sister or wife is the “goddess” and, there- fore, should be treated well and respected. Social conditions, however, support significant oppres- sion of Indian women, especially those of lower social standing. The goddesses who become role models for Indian women are not those that show autonomy and independence but those that embody subordi- nate roles. S ITA , the obedient wife of Lord Rama , is the traditional role model for Hindu women. Women understand that the fierce goddesses (which Western women often view as inspiring) are goddesses that are not to be imitated. Uncon- trolled by society and convention, powerful god- desses are not seen as role models. One of the greatest insults to an Indian woman is to be called a K ALI . As is the case in most of the world, women in India have throughout the centuries been the main cultural transmitters of myths and story and simple religious practices. While history records the lives of great male SWAMIS and teachers, little is recorded of the prayers, vows, and devotions of Hindu women who take on the tasks of assuring the welfare of their families by asking for divine intercession and aid. Yet, it is this integrative func- tion performed by women that connects the every- day world to the cosmic order, even as it sacralizes the universe—an essential Hindu practice. While males, in the main, were free to develop philoso- phies and movements, women, forced into more limited roles, creatively reached out to the forces of the universe to preserve and protect their loved ones and provide for a harmonious and fruit- ful society. For every wandering ascetic who did his renunciation for higher spiritual gain, one could count, contemporaneously, thousands of individual women who practiced vows, fasts, and disciplines to ensure the welfare of those around them. This role of women as powerful religious and spiritual actors, although recognized in the culture, is largely unrecorded. The paucity of women saints in the history of Hindu tradition belies the agency that women have exerted in the temples, shrines, and households of India over the centuries. This agency has been central to the continuity of Hinduism over time.

Woodroffe, Sir John (Arthur Avalon) (1865–1936) scholar of tantric texts Sir John Woodroffe was an Englishman, Indian civil servant, and scholar who pioneered the mod- ern study of the tantric literary tradition. Woodroffe was born December 15, 1865, the eldest son of James T. Woodroffe, advocate-gen- eral of Bengal and occasional member of the gov- ernment of India, and his wife, Florence. John was educated at Woburn Park School and University College, Oxford, where he studied law. He was called to the Bar by the Inner Temple in 1889. He soon served as advocate of the Calcutta (Kolkata) High Court and was made a fellow of Calcutta University and appointed Tagore Professor of Law. He served as judge on the High Court and in 1915 served as chief justice. In addition to his practice and writing on jurisprudence, Woodruffe studied S ANSKRIT and Hindu philosophy extensively, particularly TA N - TRIC literature. As a result of long and assiduous study of classical texts and contacts with tantric pundits of Bengal, he translated important tan- tric texts and added his own commentary and introductions. His publication The Garland of Letters is a clear and authoritative exposition of the Mantra Shastra and includes his explanation of the philosophy underlying tantric philosophy and practice. Around 1910, Woodroffe was initiated by Shi- vachandra Vidyarnava. He did not take students, but rather remained a scholar, intent upon provid- ing clear and authoritative translations and expo- sitions that would be appreciated only decades after his death. His publications have left an enduring legacy of original resources translated into English and valuable commentary on tantra. He collaborated with a fellow initiate, Atal Behari Ghose, in pro- ducing the first translations and interpretations of tantra in a Western language. Because Ghose remained anonymous in his publications, Wood- roffe also published under a pseudonym, Arthur Avalon. Under the name Avalon, he published Shakti and Shakta, commentaries on the Shakta Tantra Shastra, and under the name Woodroffe, he published The Garland of Letters, a commentary on the Mantra Shastra. He lectured in England and India, including addresses to the Royal Asi- atic Society and the Vivekananda Society. After retirement from legal work in India, he returned to England and served as reader in Indian law at the University of Oxford. He died there on Janu- ary 18, 1936.

World Parliament of Religions (Chicago, 1893) The World Parliament of Religions was the first interfaith religious convention in the West to intro- duce major Eastern religions to a public audience. Held in conjunction with the Chicago World’s Fair, the opening ceremonies were attended by 4,000 people in the newly opened Hall of Columbus. Originally the idea of Charles Carroll Bonney, a Chicago attorney with an interest in comparative religion, the parliament was organized by a Presby- terian minister, John Henry Barrows (1847–1902), as one of 20 congresses covering a number of topics, including women’s progress, temperance, commerce, literature, music, and agriculture. Rep- resentatives of the Roman Catholic Church, Greek Orthodox Church, Confucianism, Buddhism, J AIN - ISM , Hinduism, and Protestantism addressed the audiences over the course of two weeks, creating a climactic event for the closing of the 19th century. A number of Christian faiths refused to send rep- resentatives to a forum that would valorize “false faiths.” Unprecedented attention was given to Asian religions; their beliefs and practices were explained directly by adept practitioners from the Orient. Hinduism was represented by Swami V IVEKANANDA and Nara Sima Charyar; J AINISM by Virchand R. Gandhi; the B RAHMO S AMAJ by Protap Chunder Mozoomdar and B. B. Nagarkar; and T HEOSOPHY by G. N. Chakravarti. The largest Asian contin- gent was made up of representatives of Buddhism, from Sri Lanka and Japan. The goal was to have a personal spokesperson for every religion, an ambi- tious and impossible ideal to meet. In fact, major Asian religions were represented by practitioners of only one or two sects within each larger reli- gious complex. In the case of Hinduism, Swami Vivekananda’s remarks represented V EDANTA phi- losophy and practice but gave no understanding of popular forms of S HAIVISM or V AISHNAVISM . Most presentations and papers focused on the areas of agreement between Western and Eastern religions. Several problems between East and West were addressed repeatedly, particularly the misrepresentations of Oriental religions in the West and the destructive ardor and arrogance of Christian missionaries in the East. The entire Sep- tember 22 session was “Criticism and Discussion of Missionary Methods.” Both negative and posi- tive assessments of the parliament were made by missionaries, yet, whatever the final evaluation, missionary delegates revealed a new awareness of the appeal of Asian religion and the need for changes in missionary methods. Protap Chunder Mozoomdar, representative of the Brahmo Samaj, while vociferously con- demning the social abuses of India, explained the “world’s religious debt to Asia.” He cited a higher view of nature, recognition of the value of intro- spection, and the crucial roles of devotional activ- ity and self-discipline in a full religious life. His prominence at the world parliament was the sec- ond time he had influenced American audiences with his words of tolerance. His visit in 1883–84 to the United States preceded the parliament by a decade and constituted the first visit of a Hindu teacher to the United States. Swami Vivekananda, with fluency in the En glish language and a commanding stage pres- ence, was a sensation with all of his addresses. He became a celebrity as he adroitly rejected, in World Parliament of Religions 503 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 503 12/14/06 9:29:49 AM"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"memorable phrases and stories, Western notions of Hinduism as polytheistic and idolatrous. Vive- kananda’s clear exposition of tolerance toward other faiths as the essence of Hinduism was a rev- olutionary addition to the West’s understanding. The press noted the masterful oration and erudition of Oriental delegates and commented on the arrogance of Western churches that sent partially educated students of theology to instruct the wise and accomplished spiritual leaders of the East. One missionary to India for many years, the Reverend Thomas Slater of the London Mission- ary Society, observed, “The Hindus, by instinct and tradition, are the most religious people in the world.” A number of delegates from the East had been or were in 1893 members of the Theosophical Society. Peppered throughout the remarks from Asian representatives were ideas about synthetic religion, a clear influence from Theosophy. The- osophists termed the parliament a “distinctly Theosophical step.” Although most of the population of the U NITED S TAT E S and the West in general were unaware of the proceedings of the parliament, the concluding remarks of the session lauded the event as per- haps the most important religious gathering ever assembled. The parliament encouraged a growing conviction that the features that believers held in common were essential characteristics of all religions, and that tolerance and charity among all religions were more important than differences in belief. Most certainly, the parliament created a new appreciation of Oriental religions. Further reading: John Henry Barrows, ed., The World’s Parliament of Religions, 2 vols.

World Vaishnavite Association (est. 1994) The World Vaishnavite Association was formed in 1994, in large part to heal the splintering that had occurred around the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) in the years following the death of its founder, Srila A. C Bhaktivedanta Swami P RABHUPADA (1896–1977). ISKCON taught a form of devotional ( BHAKTI ) yoga in the tradition of C HAITANYA Mahaprabhu (1486–1533). ISKCON had been the leader and role model for this form of worship in the 20th century. It rapidly expanded during the 1960s, but in the years since Prabhupada’s death in 1977, the organization has faced a variety of leadership problems and experienced a number of schisms in different parts of the world. Additionally, new organizations emerged in India from the G AUDIYA M AT H , the spiritual home of Prabhupada prior to his founding of ISKCON. The World Vaishnavite Association was formed to address issues and heal the divisions that had occurred within the movement. Despite unity of faith and practice, numerous differences concern- ing organization and the nature of leadership existed. Some groups thought that the leadership style followed by Sri Prabhupada should continue and that current SWAMIS should be venerated in the same exalted manner as Prabhupada. Others thought Prabhupada unique and eschewed any veneration of the current GURUS . More than two dozen factions emerged.

They also invited the leaders of splinter groups to par- ticipate. In February 1994, they published the initial copy of a periodical. The World Vaisnava Association Newsletter was distributed to every group from the Gaudiya Math lineage to keep them apprised of developments. In November 1994 a founding meeting was held with 120 participants. Twenty-eight ACHARYAS and SANNYASIS became founding members.

The WVA tries to help communi- ties through troubling times in the regions where it has a presence and to promote missionary efforts outside India.

It may be simply an offering of clarified butter into a fire, or it may involve 17 priests in an elaborate 12-day ritual including the building of a large fire altar as in the AGNICHAYANA . The ritual of the yajna always includes a fire, Sanskrit MANTRAS , and some sort of offering. In the larger public rituals a sacrifice of some animal or animals has been common. The word yajna is frequently translated roughly as “sacrifice.” Further reading: Jan Gonda, Vedic Literature (Samhitas and Brahmanas): A History of Indian Literature, Vol. 1, no. 1 (Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1975); Thomas Hopkins, The Hindu Religious Tradition (Encino, Calif.: Dickenson, 1971); Frits Staal, AGNI: The Altar of Fire, 2 vols.

His teachings are recorded in dialogues in the B RIHADARANYAKA U PANISHAD and the C HANDOGYA U PANISHAD . In one teaching he is asked how many gods there are and he answers: “Three hundred and three and three thousand and three.” Pressed to be clearer he says there are 33. He is questioned again and again and eventually arrives at the state- ment that there is only one “God,” the BRAHMAN , or all. In another dialogue one of his wives asks him whether wealth could make her immortal and he propounds a notion that everything that exists is underlain by one reality, which is what is to be held dear, not wealth. Yajnavalkya was said to have been the source for the White Y AJUR V EDA . The Yajnavalkya whose name is attached to an important text of D HARMA - SHASTRA is unlikely to be the same individual.

Later the term designated certain semidivine beings. These yakshas could change form at will; they lived in caves, mountains, forests, trees, bodies of water, and even magic cities in the sky. They are roughly analogous to gnomes, fairies, or sprites in the European tradition. Yakshas or yakshis were often associated with sacred trees in villages. Indian temple iconography often depicts trees with beautiful yakshis sensuously entwined. Such yakshas and yakshis turn up in the M AHAB - HARATA and the R AMAYANA , and in greater numbers in the PURANAS and in the works of such great S AN - SKRIT poets as K ALIDASA and B HAVABHUTI . The earliest Indian sculptures, which tend to be Buddhist (c. 200 B . C . E .), are replete with yaksas and yakshis; they are well known in Buddhist literature as well. Yakshas also appear in Jain sculpture and literature ( see J AINISM ). Some Jain temples show yakshis particularly in subsidiary shrines. Finally, in the Hindu puranas, yakshas are also frequently encountered. In physical form they tend to be very handsome or beautiful, and they are very prosperous as well. K UBERA , the god of wealth, is always depicted as attended by yaksas. Further reading: Ananda K.

Yama Yama is the Indian god of death and the under- world. He is the son of Visvasvat, the Sun. In the V EDAS he is seen as the first mortal to die and thereby becomes king of the world of the dead. According to the Atharva Veda, he is accompa- nied by two four-eyed dogs in his realm. There he dwells with the ancestors, who receive offerings of food from men. In the Vedic context, the realm of the dead is quite unlike the Christian hell; it is an afterworld of satisfaction and pleasures. One verse of the R IG V EDA mentions Yama’s twin sister, Yami, who asks him to mate with her to create the human race. Yama refuses. The ancient Iranian Avesta knows Yama by the name Yima. In later puranic descriptions Yama’s realm is depicted less pleasantly; karmic retribu- tions are even meted out ( see KARMA ). Yama in his role as guardian of the realm of the dead appears in many contexts in Indian tradition. In the K AT H A U PANISHAD he offers the wisdom of BRAHMAN , AT M A N , and liberation to the young N ACHIKETAS . In the M AHABHARATA he plays an important role in the story of S AVITRI and Satyavan.

All of these restraints are developed to ever higher levels as YOGA progresses, so that “speaking the truth” becomes a struggle to avoid even the desire to lie. Though some say that these constrants are not part of yoga per se, in fact a focus on these con- straints is a common yogic practice. Furthermore, the other branches or elements of the eightfold path such as “concentration” ( dharana ) are seen as enhancing and perfecting the yamas.

It is almost always drawn with colored powder on the floor or ground in a ritual process. It it usually a geometric pattern, with flowers or flower petals. Once it is completed, a MEDITATION is performed, focusing on the center of the yantra, which is most often the BINDU , a condensed point of con- sciousness out of which the universe is seen to evolve. The yantra is usually seen as the subtle form of the divinity; when one creates a yantra one mani- fests an alternative form of the totality of the divin- ity for more focused ritual and worship. In ritual and meditation, one moves outward from the bindu to the other aspects and junctures of the design. Or, one may begin at the outer edge of the design and work inward toward the bindu. The yantra may in certain circumstances be worshipped in and of itself and in other circumstances will form a part of a much larger ritual. As with most tantric rituals, these are rarely performed in public. Sometimes yantras are referred to as mandalas. The S RI Y ANTRA is sometimes called Sri Chakra. Buddhism and J AINISM also use yantras, though in Buddhism they will generally be referred to as mandalas. yantra 509 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 509 12/14/06 9:29:50 AM"},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"Further reading: Madhu Khanna, Yantra, the Tantric Symbol of Cosmic Unity (Rochester, Vt.: Inner Tradi- tions, 2003); P.

Yantra, Sri The Sri Y ANTRA , or Sri Chakra, is an important cult object for the S RI V IDYA tradition of TANTRISM . It is understood as being the subtle form of the goddess Sri Lalita. The yantra’s geometric design combines five downward-pointing triangles representing the Goddess, or S HAKTI , with four upward-pointing triangles representing S HIVA . In the “nine circuits,” all the parts of the design are worshipped in turn: the junctures of the triangles, the central BINDU , certain outlying features such as circles of lotus petals, and the outer border that looks like a set of four entrances to a temple. The process can either begin with the bindu and work out to the edge, or follow the opposite path. A new Sri Chakra is always carefully drawn whenever a PUJA to Sri Yantra is performed. The pujas that are done in this tradition are always per- formed privately, except for pujas done to the few large Sri Yantras found in select temples. An exam- ple is the K ANCHIPURAM temple to Kamakshi, who is sometimes identified with Sri Lalita. In this temple there is a very large Sri Yantra that is worshipped by a designated priest in a secret way. This ritual is never witnessed by anyone, except the priest.

The word yoga is derived from the root yuj, “to yoke,” probably because the early practice con- centrated on restraining or “yoking in” the senses. Later the name was also seen as a metaphor for “linking” or “yoking to” God or the divine. The earliest form of yoga may have been the Jain yoga (c. 900 B . C . E .), which involved severe sensual denial and restraint ( see J AINISM ). To free the soul from birth and rebirth Jains felt it was necessary to restrain the senses completely so as to be beyond both “love” and “hate,” or more accu- rately, beyond any positive or negative emotion. The early Jain monks and T IRTHANKARAS (perfected beings) would train themselves to ignore the body completely and to train the mind to ignore even the strongest positive and negative stimuli. The details of these ancient Jain practices are lost to us. Jain yoga today is focused more on restraining oneself to prevent injury to any living being, which was always a concern in that tradition. An element of worldly denial has always been part of all yoga, and even today yogis can be found who perform extreme feats of restraint. Yoga of this sort is ultimately about controlling all bodily functions, so that even the autonomic nervous system can be under the adept’s control. When S WA M I R AMA first traveled to the United States in the 1970s, he demonstrated such control by stop- ping his heart completely for more than a minute while being attached to a heart monitor. The B UDDHA ’s yoga (c. 600 B . C . E .) was created specifically to counter the earlier push toward complete bodily denial. He declared that mental control was the final object of yoga and did not need to be accomplished by hurting the body. Central to his yoga were watching of the breath and observing of the sensations of the body. The U PANISHADS (c. 900–300 B . C . E .) do not dis- cuss yoga per se, but they point toward a mental practice that aims to realize the unity of one’s own self with the ultimate Self. This yoga is known as JNANA YOGA , sometimes called “the Yoga of Knowledge.” Nothing is said about postures and only one Upanishad speaks of sitting in a quiet place to meditate. A form of MEDITATION , however, seems to have been central to this type of yoga. A number of passages in the Upanishads imply both bodily denial and attention to the breath. The B HAGAVAD G ITA (c. 200 B . C . E .) makes the first mention of a yoga that uses focus on God as the central practice (in the later Y OGA S UTRA , a focus on God is an adjunct practice to the central disciplines). The yoga developed in the Bhaga- vad Gita was called “devotional yoga,” or BHAKTI YOGA . One focused one’s mind in the same yogic way as in other practices, but one used God as a focus point for all consciousness. Nowadays the chanting of the Gita itself or other texts will be part of the practice. The Bhagavad Gita also contains the earliest reference to KARMA YOGA —in which the focus is on good conduct in the world. One acts in a dis- interested way without regard to the fruits of one’s actions. This makes everyday life a form of yoga. M OHANDAS K ARAMCHAND G ANDHI considered this the most important yoga; he wrote extensively about this practice. The A SHTANGA (eight-limbed) YOGA of P ATA N - JALI (c. second century C . E .) involved a sitting yoga, sometimes called raja yoga, which focused on breathing. As one observed the breath, one developed ways of concentrating the mind and eventually controlling the mind. A SANAS , or pos- tures, are well developed in today’s versions of yoga 511 J 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 511 12/14/06 9:29:50 AM"},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"P ATANJALI yoga, but his Yoga Sutra does not list any postures; these may have been later addi- tions to the practice, or they may have developed separately and then merged with the Patanjalian school. There are strong resemblances between the practices found in the early Buddhist texts and those found in Patanjali. H AT H A YOGA is an amalgam of practices that may have emerged separately and were later combined. It includes the basic practices that can be found in Patanjali as well as postures. The term hatha origi- nally meant “violent,” and it is possible that this style of yoga originated in certain types of severe yoga that were softened for protection of the body. In some systems hatha yoga includes KUNDALINI YOGA as part of its path. The focus of breath con- trol becomes the “serpent” or “Goddess Energy” (kundalini) at the base of the spine, which must be awakened and forced upward to pierce the psychic centers or CHAKRAS that run parallel to the spine. The NADIS or subtle bodily channels are used to guide breath into the central spinal chan- nel to help the raising of the kundalini through the centers. Finally, the rising kundalini meets the god S HIVA at a point above the head called SAHASRARA CHAKRA . This meeting provokes absolute enlighten- ment. Kundalini yoga practice itself can vary; the kundalini methods used in hatha yoga are some- what different from those used in TANTRA yoga. Tantra is the most esoteric of all of the yogas. All yogas, and in fact all paths toward spiritual advance in the Indian tradition, depend upon the guidance of a GURU . However, the tantra yoga practices are so complicated and often danger- ous that a guru is of the utmost importance. The basic realization of tantra yoga is that the phenomenal world is nothing but the divine truth—the transcendent and the earthly divinity are one and the same. Whereas other yogas look toward a retreat from the sensual, tantra plunges into the dangers of the senses in order to reach the highest realization. This is true in particular of the notorious practices of “left-handed” tantra. In the process of worship the devotee (most often a male) drinks alcohol, eats the forbidden beef, and has sexual intercourse with a low-caste partner or “goddess.” The sexual union is seen as the union of the divin- ity in its transcendent form with the divinity in its mundane aspect. The practice aims to produce an understanding of the divinity in its totality. Alcohol too helps teach about the “bliss” of the infinite. Eating forbidden beef and other acts nor- mally thought as “polluting” teach that even the dirt and refuse in the world are essentially divine. “Right-handed” tantra yoga does not resort to these forbidden practices. It includes much ritual and chanting of MANTRAS to guide the conscious- ness to its chosen goal. Apart from these general categories of yoga, many specialized disciplines have emerged, including KRIYA YOGA and Integral Yoga ( see Sri A UROBINDO ). Further reading: S. N.

His father, a railway executive, was a disciple of L AHIRI M AHASAYA , one of those who revived KRIYA YOGA in the 20th century. Mukunda relates that, as a child, he was healed by a photo- graph of Lahiri. After high school, Mukunda joined a hermitage in B ENARES (Varanasi), the Sri Bharat Charma Mahamandal, where he met Sri Y UKESWAR Giri. Sri Yukeswar gave him the vows of SANNYAS (renunciation) in the Shankaracharya Order, Giri branch, in 1914 and he became Yogananda, mean- ing the “bliss that comes from yoga.” In 1916 he discovered the techniques of Yogoda, a system of life-energy control for physi- cal and spiritual development, which, combined with traditional yoga, became the central concern of his teachings. Yogananda expressed a sustained interest in education. He attended Scottish Church College and later transferred to Serampore Col- lege to be near Yukteswar. In 1917, he founded a school for boys, Yogoda San-Sanga Brahmacharya Vidyalaya, at Dihik, Bengal, and in 1918 moved the school to Ranchi. His school included high school subjects as well as yoga and MEDITATION . In 1920 Yogananda went to the United States to speak at the International Congress of Reli- gious Liberals in Boston, where he remained to teach for three years. In 1924 he conducted a lecture tour of the United States that resulted in the establishment of several centers in his name. An American headquarters for these centers was set up at Mount Washington in Los Angeles. His personality was extremely effective in relaying his message and the ancient wisdom of India to a Western audience. Yogananda taught kriya yoga, which he describes as a scientific technique for God-real- ization. The practice is conveyed in an initiation ceremony and involves meditation and visualiza- tion. His approach to kriya yoga is presented as a form of raja yoga but also includes concepts and exercises similar to those of KUNDALINI YOGA . Yogananda originally called his work the Yogoda Satsang Society, but, in 1935, he incorpo- rated his organization as the Self-Realization Fel- lowship. His lectures were collected into a home correspondence course for students to study in any location. Also in 1935, he visited India for the last time and was given the title Paramahansa, meaning “great swan,” because his guru recog- nized that Yogananda had reached the state of nirvikalpa samadhi (irrevocable God-union). Once back in the United States, Yogananda wrote his most famous book, Autobiography of a Yogi, perhaps the most widely read account of a Hindu teacher, published in 1946. His account is an absorbing story of a search for truth, interwoven with explanations of the subtle laws by which yogis perform miracles and attain self-mastery.

Yoga Sutra The Yoga Sutra of P ATANJALI outlining A SHTANGA Y OGA is the earliest and most important text of the HATHA YOGA , or “posture yoga,” tradition. It is dated around the second century C . E . The SUTRA designation refers to the text style: a collection of very concise lines that often need further expla- nation to be understood fully. The Yoga Sutra totals 195 sutras divided into four books: Book I is on concentration; Book II outlines the practice and means of reaching the highest goals; Book III details powers gained in the practice of yoga, including supranormal powers; Book IV describes various aspects of the nature of things but par- ticularly the nature of the liberated state. Scholars believe the four chapters may have been written at different times, but all the hatha yoga traditions consider them to be a single authoritative text. Book I begins with a definition: “Yoga is the practice of ceasing the false identification with the fluctuations of the mind.” It then lists the types of mental fluctuations and discusses how to curb their influence on the self, soul, or PURUSHA . It deals with types of concentration (dharana), the obstacles that get in the way, and methods of overcoming them. Finally, it discusses God as a special self and presents the goal of a stable mind and attaining undisturbed calm. Book II begins with methods for overcoming the mental “afflictions,” things that cause distrac- tions. It discusses the origin of KARMA , the causes of sorrow or pain, how to escape these through yoga, the eight branches of yoga (Ashtanga Yoga), abstentions (yama), observances (niyama), pos- tures (asana), breath control (pranayama), and withdrawal of sense organs from their objects (pratya hara). Book III begins by discussing the internal practices of yoga, including MEDITATION (dhyana) and various levels of concentration, including SAMADHI , the highest. It goes on to discuss seed- less concentration (i.e., concentration without an object) and different categories of mental tranquility. Finally it discusses the attributes and powers one can achieve though these practices, including supernormal powers. Book IV discusses philosophy, including argu- ments against other Indian philosophical systems. It ends with a discussion of the highest state of liberation and tranquility. The Yoga Sutra is usually studied together with the ancient commentary of Vedavyasa (V YA S A ), which expands in detail upon each of the subjects covered in the brief sutras. Most yoga schools rely on this commentary explicitly or implicitly. There are many subcommentaries to the commentary of Vedavyasa, which are used by different schools in support of their particular practices.

Yogendra, Sri (1897–1989) pioneer teacher of hatha yoga Sri Yogendra was one of the important figures in the modern revival of HATHA YOGA , both in India and in the U NITED S TATES . He founded the Yoga Institute and helped provide a scientific basis for the practice of yoga. Yogendra was born on November 18, 1897, as Manibhai Harihai Desai in rural Gujarat, India. As a student at St. Xavier’s College in Bombay (Mumbai), he met his GURU , Paramahansa Madha- vadasaji. After several years, however, he ceased to be a disciple. Desai did not wish to lead a celibate life; instead, he wished to find out whether there could be a scientific underpinning for the practice of hatha yoga. In 1918 he founded the Yoga Insti- tute of India. In 1919, Desai, who had by this time assumed the name Yogendra, moved to the United States to work with several medical doctors who shared his interest in the yogic arts. Among the people he met was Benedict L UST (1872–1945), founder of the new medical system called naturopathy. Lust saw the value of hatha yoga for his work and studied it with Yogendra. Along with the early experiments on yoga, Yogendra completed his first books while in America: Light on Hatha Yoga and a volume on Rabindranath T AGORE . In 1922 Yogendra returned to India. He planned a second visit to the United States in order to continue the research, but in 1924 Congress passed new immigration laws that prevented Asians from entering the country and Yogendra was not allowed to visit again. Lust was left to spread the practice of hatha yoga on his own. Unable to continue his work in America, Yogendra threw himself into the task of building his Yoga Institute. He provided his own funding with royalties from his invention of a new type of boot polish. He found a helpmate in the form of Sita Devi, whom he married in 1927. The 1930s became a time of significant expan- sion. A magazine, the Journal of the Yoga Institute (now Yoga and Total Health ), was launched, and Yogendra wrote several books on the basics of hatha yoga, a practice that had largely disappeared over the centuries in India. Yogendra continued his efforts to present hatha yoga practice to the United States by working with an American stu- dent, Theos Bernard (1908–47), whose Ph.D. dis- sertation for Columbia University was eventually published as Hatha Yoga: The Report of a Personal Experience (1943). ( See B ERNARD , P IERRE A RNOLD .) Aftr the disruptions of World War II, Yogendra purchased land in Mumbai as a permanent home for the institute. In the 1950s, the institute began to build a global reputation through the steady arrival of Westerners to study there. Yogendra continued to write, turning out a series of books. He was active well into his eighties, but in 1985 turned over directorship of the institute to his eldest son, Dr. Jayadeva Yogendra.

It can take the form of a pot or other vessel, a cleft rock, or a pond, lake, or pool. In certain esoteric rituals, a human vagina is worshipped directly. The association of female genitals with the divine female principle, and the correlation of women’s reproductive and sexual cycles with the Earth’s seasonal and vegetative cycles, have given the yoni cosmological significance. Considered the gateway between life and death, as well as the generative force behind all existence, the yoni has had special importance particularly in the KAULA , S HAKTA , and TANTRA tra- ditions. However, even ordinary Shaivite devotees worship the yoni together with the S HIVA LINGAM (phallus); the popular icon consists of a rounded stone shaft placed upright on a horizontal circular base that forms the yoni. All of these practices are probably based on pre-Vedic, prepatriarchal civilizations. Many female figurines have been discovered in a pre- Harappan site in the Zhob Valley dating to the midfourth millennium B . C . E . Many of these fig- ures had pronounced breasts and yonis, perhaps signifying their generative function. Cowry shells, a common representation of the vulva, were also found at these sites. Scholars believe women most likely used these objects in rituals, perhaps together with their own menstrual and sexual flu- ids, in order to ensure a fruitful harvest. Numerous seals, ritual objects, and yoni /lin- gam structures from the later I NDUS V ALLEY CIVI - LIZATIONS of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa also point to an early understanding of the sanctity of female sexuality and its association with the Earth’s fertility. Reverence of the female principle and the belief that it controls the perpetuation of the human and vegetative life cycles seems to lie at the base of these civilizations. In the fourth century C . E ., the cult of the god- dess Lajja Gauri arose across the subcontinent. The most well-known images depict a woman with her legs bent and open and her vulva com- pletely exposed. Often, her head has been replaced with a pot filled with vegetation. In some depic- tions vegetation emerges from her yoni. These iconographical representations of the Goddess seem to have originated in the early Indus Valley, or even pre-Indus Valley civilizations. Lajja Gauri and another goddess of vegetation, Sakhambari, are worshipped today as the embodiment and generator of fertility, fortune, abundance, and life- force energy, qualities that are also associated with the yoni. The Goddess in general is conceived as the elemental source of all animal and plant life, as creative power personified. Creative female sexual power is represented in various symbols even today. The lotus has become a quintessential symbol of the yoni. In S HAKTA and TANTRA texts, the yoni, as is the lotus, is a symbol of perfection, symmetry, and beauty. In Hindu cosmology waters are considered the perennial source and equated with the Goddess’s womb. As the lotus rests on the water and remains unsaturated by water, not soiled by mud, to Shakta tantrics, so the yoni remains perpetu- ally pure. In Hindu architecture, the temple is con- ceived as a microcosmic representation of the macrocosmic whole. The inner sanctum of Hindu temples, regardless of religious sect, is called the garbhagriha, which means “womb-house.” In Guwahati, Assam, at the site of the Kamarupa Temple, the Goddess in her form as the Great Yoni is worshipped. Here she is worshipped in aniconic form as a dark wet rock over which a natural spring flows. Each summer this water turns red and is worshipped as the Goddess’s menstrual blood. K AMAKHYA , in Assam, is a PILGRIMAGE site to Shaktas, Kaulas, and Tantrikas who worship a woman’s menstrual blood as the sacred and potent elixir of life. In these traditions, women’s men- strual cycles relate to processes of the universe. The body itself is considered the link between earth and cosmos, a microcosmic representation of the macrocosmic whole. In Kaula, Shakta, and tantric cosmogony women play a divine role due K 516 yoni 001-518_hindu_a-z.indd 516 12/14/06 9:29:51 AM"},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"to the nature of their sex. In these ideologies lib- eration ( MOKSHA ) is possible to humans within this lifetime, but only through ritual sexual practices and the worship of the yoni, female sexual fluids, and menstrual blood. In the first section of the Yoni Tantra, Shiva tells D EVI , the Goddess, that all gods and their power of creation, maintenance, and destruc- tion originate in the yoni. In the Yoni Tantra the Mahavidyas, 10 tantric goddesses of spiritual liberation, are each associated with different parts of the yoni. The tantric Sri Chakra cult also gives special importance to the yoni. The main iconic emblem of the Goddess, the S RI Y ANTRA , is composed of interlocking triangles. Five of these, symbolizing the yoni, point downward; the other four, symbol- izing the LINGAM , point upward, in reference to the union of feminine and masculine qualities and representing the mysteries of creation and destruction.

Four Yugas make up one M AHAYUGA , or Great Age: the Golden Age (K RITA , or Satya, Y UGA ), the Silver Age (T RETA Y UGA ), the Bronze Age (D VAPARA Y UGA ), and the Iron Age (K ALI Y UGA , no con- nection with the goddess Kali). The Yugas are named after an ancient dice game, in which a 1, or kale, was the worst throw and a 4, or krita (literally, the one that makes it!), is the best. The Yugas decrease in duration: Satya Yuga lasts 1,728,000 years, Treta 1,296,000 years, Dvapara 864,000 years, and Kali 432,000 years. The figures are sometimes given in “god-years,” each divine year equal to 360 human years. Then the Satya Yuga is 4,800 divine years; the Treta Yuga 3,600 divine years; the Dvapara Yuga 2,400 divine years; and the Kali Yuga 1,200 divine years. Each Mahayuga totals 12,000 divine years. As the Yugas follow one another, every aspect of human life suffers a decline, including human height, longevity, and morality. We are currently in the Kali Yuga, the most corrupt of the ages.

After this interlude, the progression of the Yugas resumes. The process goes on to infinity. Jain tradition has a similar progression of ages with different names.

Yukteswar, Sri (1855–1936) kriya yoga teacher Sri Yukteswar was an important link in the lineage that revived KRIYA YOGA , especially through his pupil Paramahansa Y OGANANDA . Priya Nath Karar was born in 1855 in Seram- pore, a suburb of Calcutta (Kolkata). He received his primary education at a modern English school and was later admitted into Calcutta University but left the university when he found his physics teacher to be incompetent. He continued to study informally by auditing classes in physics, chemistry, biology, physiology, and anatomy at the Calcutta Medical College. Especially talented in mathemat- ics, he also studied astronomy and astrology. He would later become a famous spiritual teacher and astrologer. He married, but his wife died after giv- ing birth to his daughter. As a widower, he cared for his daughter and widowed mother. In 1883 he met L AHIRI M AHASAYA , who initiated him into the practice of kriya yoga. Kriya means “work,” in this case a specific set of mental and physical practices for SELF - REALIZATION . He mas- tered the system and soon became a guru of kriya yoga himself. Having been raised in Serampore, a center for Christian missionaries, Priya Nath was greatly influenced by the teachings of the Holy Bible and Jesus Christ. He wrote his own interpretation of the Bhagavad Gita and also drew comparisons between the teachings of K RISHNA and the teach- ings of Christ. In 1894 Priya Nath went to A LLAHABAD for the K UMBHA M ELA , a PILGRIMAGE festival that occurs four times every 12 years, attended by millions of people from all over the world. Here he first met B ABAJI , his teacher’s teacher, a semilegendary saint who appeared and reappeared at long inter- vals. Although not yet a SANNYASI (renunciant), he was honored as such by Babaji. In this encounter, Babaji encouraged Priya Nath to write about the similarities in the Hindu and Christian traditions, certain that the West could benefit from learning of these connections. Babaji assured him that they would meet again when the book was finished; indeed, when Kaivalya Darshanam, the Holy Sci- ence, was published, Babaji appeared under a tree near where Priya Nath took his daily bath in the G ANGES River. By the early 1900s Priya Nath was teaching to wider audiences; in 1902 he established Sat Sanga Sabha, a religious cultural institution that offered educational, social, and spiritual programs, includ- ing courses in kriya yoga and the Yogashastras. At this time, he received the vows of SANNYAS and was given the name Swami Sri Yukteshvar Giri (union with God) by Swami Krishna Dayal Giri. In 1913, he met his student Mukunda Lal, later known as Y OGANANDA , and later bestowed on him the title of Paramahansa (great swan). Yukteswar took mahasamadhi (died) in 1936 while meditat- ing in the lotus position. His body is buried in his ASHRAM ; his tomb has become a sacred place for initiates of kriya yoga.
