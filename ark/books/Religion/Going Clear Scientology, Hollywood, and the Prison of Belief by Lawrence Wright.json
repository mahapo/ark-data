The church won’trelease official membership figures, but informally it claims 8 million membersworldwide, a figure that is based on the number of people who have donated tothe church. A recent ad claims that the church welcomes 4.4 million new peopleevery year. And yet, according to a former spokesperson for the church, theInternational Association of Scientologists, an organization that church membersare forcefully encouraged to join, has only about 30,000 members. The largestconcentration, about 5,000, is in Los Angeles. A survey of American religiousaffiliations compiled in the Statistical Abstract of the United States estimatesthat only 25,000 Americans actually call themselves Scientologists. That’s lessthan half the number identifying themselves as Rastafarians.Despite decades of declining membership and intermittent scandals that mighthave sunk other faiths, Scientology remains afloat, more than a quarter centuryafter the death of its chimerical leader, L. Ron Hubbard. In part, its survivalis due to colossal financial resources—about $1 billion in liquid assets,according to knowledgeable former members. Strictly in terms of cash reserves,that figure eclipses the holdings of most major world religions. Scientology’swealth testifies to the avidity of its membership, relentless fund-raising, andthe legacy of Hubbard’s copyrights to the thousand books and articles hepublished.The church also claims about 12 million square feet of property around theworld. Hollywood is the center of Scientology’s real-estate empire, withtwenty-six properties valued at $400 million. The most recent addition to thechurch’s Hollywood portfolio is a television studio on Sunset Boulevard formerlyowned by KCET, acquired in order to open a Scientology broadcasting center. InClearwater, Florida, where Scientology maintains its spiritual headquarters, thechurch owns sixty-eight largely tax-exempt parcels of land, valued at $168million. They include apartment buildings, hotels and motels, warehouses,schools, office buildings, a bank, and tracts of vacant land. The church oftenacquires landmark buildings near key locations, such as Music Row in Nashville,Dupont Circle in Washington, DC, and Times Square in New York City. A similarstrategy governs the placement of Scientology’s holdings in other countries.Typically, these buildings are magnificently restored architectural treasures,lavishly appointed, even if the membership is negligible. The church owns afive-hundred-acre compound in Southern California and a cruise ship, theFreewinds, which is based in the Caribbean. The Church of Spiritual Technology,the branch of Scientology that owns the trademarks and copyrights to all churchmaterials, including Hubbard’s immense body of popular fiction, maintains secretbases in several remote locations in at least three American states, where thefounder’s works are stored in titanium canisters in nuclear-blast-resistantcaverns. One of the vault locations, in Trementina, New Mexico, has an airstripand two giant interlocking circles carved into the desert floor—a landmark forUFOs, some believe, or for Hubbard’s reincarnated spirit, when he chooses toreturn.There are really three tiers of Scientologists. Public Scientologists constitutethe majority of the membership. Many of them have their first exposure to thereligion at a subway station or a shopping mall where they might take a free“stress test” or a personality inventory called “The Oxford Capacity Analysis”(there is no actual connection to Oxford University). On those occasions,potential recruits are likely to be told that they have problems thatScientology can resolve, and they are steered to a local church or mission forcourses or therapy, which the church terms “auditing.” That’s as far as most newmembers go, but others begin a lengthy and expensive climb up the church’sspiritual ladder.The mystique that surrounds the religion is owed mainly to the second tier ofmembership: a small number of Hollywood actors and other celebrities. To promotethe idea that Scientology is a unique refuge for spiritually hungry movie stars,as well as a kind of factory for stardom, the church operates Celebrity Centresin Hollywood and several other entertainment hubs. Any Scientologist can takecourses at Celebrity Centres; it’s part of the lure, that an ordinary member canenvision being in classes with notable actors or musicians. In practice, thereal celebrities have their own private entry and course rooms, and they rarelymix with the public—except for major contributors who are accorded the sameheightened status. The total number of celebrities in the church is impossibleto calculate, both because the term itself is so elastic and because somewell-known personalities who have taken courses or auditing don’t wish to havetheir association known.An ordinary public Scientologist can be inconspicuous. No one really needs toknow his beliefs. Public members who quit the church seldom make a scene; theyjust quietly remove themselves and the community closes the circle behind them(although they are likely to be pursued by mail and phone solicitations for therest of their lives). Celebrity members, on the other hand, are constantly beingpressed to add their names to petitions, being showcased at workshops and galas,or having their photos posted over the logo “I’m a Scientologist.” Their famegreatly magnifies the influence of the church. They are deployed to advance thesocial agendas of the organization, including attacks on psychiatry and thepharmaceutical industry, and the promotion of Hubbard’s contested theories ofeducation and drug rehabilitation. They become tied to Scientology’s banner,which makes it more difficult to break away if they should become disillusioned.Neither the public nor the celebrity tiers of Scientology could exist withoutthe third level of membership—the church’s clergy, called the Sea Organization,or Sea Org, in Scientology jargon. It is an artifact of the private navy thatHubbard commanded during a decade when he was running the church while on thehigh seas. The church has said on various occasions that the Sea Org has 5,000,6,000, or 10,000 members worldwide. Former Sea Org members estimate the actualsize of the clergy to be between 3,000 and 5,000, concentrated mainly inClearwater, Florida, and Los Angeles. Many of them joined the Sea Org aschildren. They have sacrificed their education and are impoverished by theirservice. As a symbol of their unswerving dedication to the promotion ofHubbard’s principles, they have signed contracts for a billion years ofservice—only a brief moment in the eternal scheme, as seen by Scientology, whichpostulates that the universe is four quadrillion years old.The church disputes the testimony of many of the sources I’ve spoken to for thisbook, especially those former members of the Sea Org who have now left theorganization, calling them “apostates” and “defectors.” It is certainly truethat a number of them no longer accept the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard; but manystill consider themselves fervent Scientologists, saying that it was the churchitself that has strayed from his example. They include some of the highestofficials who have ever served in the organization.Scientology is certainly among the most stigmatized religions in the world,owing to its eccentric cosmology, its vindictive behavior toward critics anddefectors, and the damage it has inflicted on families that have been brokenapart by the church’s policy of “disconnection”—the imposed isolation of churchmembers from people who stand in the way of their longed-for spiritual progress.In the United States, constitutional guarantees of religious liberty protect thechurch from actions that might otherwise be considered abusive or in violationof laws in human trafficking or labor standards. Many of these practices arewell known to the public.And yet curious recruits continue to be attracted to the religion, though not inthe numbers that Scientology claims; celebrities still find their way to thechurch’s VIP lounge; and young people sign away the next billion years of theirexistence to an organization that promises to work them mercilessly forpractically no pay. Obviously, there is an enduring appeal that survives thewidespread assumption that Scientology is a cult and a fraud.I have spent much of my career examining the effects of religious beliefs onpeople’s lives—historically, a far more profound influence on society andindividuals than politics, which is the substance of so much journalism. I wasdrawn to write this book by the questions that many people have aboutScientology: What is it that makes the religion alluring? What do its adherentsget out of it? How can seemingly rational people subscribe to beliefs thatothers find incomprehensible? Why do popular personalities associate themselveswith a faith that is likely to create a kind of public relations martyrdom?These questions are not unique to Scientology, but they certainly underscore theconversation. In attempting to answer them in this book, I hope we can learnsomething about what might be called the process of belief. Few Scientologistshave had a conversion experience—a sudden, radical reorientation of one’s life;more common is a gradual, wholehearted acceptance of propositions that mighthave been regarded as unacceptable or absurd at the outset, as well as theincremental surrender of will on the part of people who have been promisedenhanced power and authority. One can see by this example the motor that propelsall great social movements, for good or ill.LAWRENCE WRIGHTAustin, Texas"},{"pageContent":"[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_001_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"1[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_L02_r1.jpg]THE CONVERTLondon, Ontario, is a middling manufacturing town halfway between Toronto andDetroit, once known for its cigars and breweries. In a tribute to its famousnamesake, London has its own Covent Garden, Piccadilly Street, and even a ThamesRiver that forks around the modest, economically stressed downtown. The city,which sits in a humid basin, is remarked upon for its unpleasant weather.Summers are unusually hot, winters brutally cold, the springs and falls fine butfleeting. The most notable native son was the bandleader Guy Lombardo, who washonored in a local museum, until it closed for lack of visitors. London was adifficult place for an artist looking to find himself.Paul Haggis was twenty-one years old in 1975. He was walking toward a recordstore in downtown London when he encountered a fast-talking, long-haired youngman with piercing eyes standing on the corner of Dundas and Waterloo Streets.There was something keen and strangely adamant in his manner. His name was JimLogan. He pressed a book into Haggis’s hands. “You have a mind,” Logan said.“This is the owner’s manual.” Then he demanded, “Give me two dollars.”The book was Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health, by L. Ron Hubbard,which was published in 1950. By the time Logan pushed it on Haggis, the book hadsold more than two million copies throughout the world. Haggis opened the bookand saw a page stamped with the words “Church of Scientology.”“Take me there,” he said to Logan.At the time, there were only a handful of Scientologists in the entire provinceof Ontario. By coincidence, Haggis had heard about the organization a couple ofmonths earlier, from a friend who had called it a cult. That interested Haggis;he considered the possibility of doing a documentary film about it. When hearrived at the church’s quarters in London, it certainly didn’t look like acult—two young men occupying a hole-in-the-wall office above Woolworth’sfive-and-dime.As an atheist, Haggis was wary of being dragged into a formal belief system. Inresponse to his skepticism, Logan showed him a passage by Hubbard that read:“What is true is what is true for you. No one has any right to force data on youand command you to believe it or else. If it is not true for you, it isn’t true.Think your own way through things, accept what is true for you, discard therest. There is nothing unhappier than one who tries to live in a chaos of lies.”These words resonated with Haggis.Although he didn’t realize it, Haggis was being drawn into the church through aclassic, four-step “dissemination drill” that recruiters are carefully trainedto follow. The first step is to make contact, as Jim Logan did with Haggis in1975. The second step is to disarm any antagonism the individual may displaytoward Scientology. Once that’s done, the task is to “find the ruin”—that is,the problem most on the mind of the potential recruit. For Paul, it was aturbulent romance. The fourth step is to convince the subject that Scientologyhas the answer. “Once the person is aware of the ruin, you bring about anunderstanding that Scientology can handle the condition,” Hubbard writes. “It’sat the right moment on this step that one … directs him to the service that willbest handle what he needs handled.” At that point, the potential recruit hasofficially been transformed into a Scientologist.Paul responded to every step in an almost ideal manner. He and his girlfriendtook a course together and, shortly thereafter, became Hubbard QualifiedScientologists, one of the first levels in what the church calls the Bridge toTotal Freedom.HAGGIS WAS BORN in 1953, the oldest of three children. His father, Ted, ran aconstruction company specializing in roadwork—mostly laying asphalt and pouringsidewalks, curbs, and gutters. He called his company Global, because he wasserving both London and Paris—another Ontario community fifty miles to the east.As Ted was getting his business started, the family lived in a small house inthe predominantly white town. The Haggises were one of the few Catholic familiesin a Protestant neighborhood, which led to occasional confrontations, includinga schoolyard fistfight that left Paul with a broken nose. Although he didn’treally think of himself as religious, he identified with being a minority;however, his mother, Mary insisted on sending Paul and his two younger sisters,Kathy and Jo, to Mass every Sunday. One day, she spotted their priest driving anexpensive car. “God wants me to have a Cadillac,” the priest explained. Maryresponded, “Then God doesn’t want us in your church anymore.” Paul admired hismother’s stand; he knew how much her religion meant to her. After that, thefamily stopped going to Mass, but the children continued in Catholic schools.Ted’s construction business prospered to the point that he was able to buy amuch larger house on eighteen acres of rolling land outside of town. There werea couple of horses in the stable, a Chrysler station wagon in the garage, andgiant construction vehicles parked in the yard, like grazing dinosaurs. Paulspent a lot of time alone. He could walk the mile to catch the school bus andnot see anyone along the way. His chores were to clean the horse stalls and thedog runs (Ted raised spaniels for field trials). At home, Paul made himself thecenter of attention—“the apple of his mother’s eye,” his father recalled—but hewas mischievous and full of pranks. “He got the strap when he was five yearsold,” Ted said.When Paul was about thirteen, he was taken to say farewell to his grandfather onhis deathbed. The old man had been a janitor in a bowling alley, having fledEngland because of some mysterious scandal. He seemed to recognize a similardangerous quality in Paul. His parting words to him were, “I’ve wasted my life.Don’t waste yours.”In high school, Paul began steering toward trouble. His worried parents sent himto Ridley College, a boarding school in St. Catharines, Ontario, near NiagaraFalls, where he was required to be a part of the cadet corps of the RoyalCanadian Army. He despised marching or any regulated behavior, and soon beganskipping the compulsory drills. He would sit in his room reading Ramparts, theradical magazine that chronicled the social revolutions then unfolding inAmerica, where he longed to be. He was constantly getting punished for hisinfractions, until he taught himself to pick locks; then he could sneak into theprefect’s office and mark off his demerits. The experience sharpened anincipient talent for subversion.After a year of this, his parents transferred him to a progressive boys’ school,called Muskoka Lakes College, in northern Ontario, where there was very littlesystem to subvert. Although it was called a college, it was basically apreparatory school. Students were encouraged to study whatever they wanted. Pauldiscovered a mentor in his art teacher, Max Allen, who was gay and politicallyradical. Allen produced a show for the Canadian Broadcasting Company called AsIt Happens. In 1973, while the Watergate hearings were going on in Washington,DC, Allen let Paul sit beside him in his cubicle at CBC while he edited JohnDean’s testimony for broadcast. Later, Allen opened a small theater in Torontoto show movies that had been banned under Ontario’s draconian censorship laws,and Paul volunteered at the box office. They showed Ken Russell’s The Devils andBernardo Bertolucci’s Last Tango in Paris. In Ted’s mind, his son was working ina porno theater. “I just shut my eyes,” Ted said.Paul left school after he was caught forging a check. He attended art schoolbriefly, and took some film classes at a community college, but he dropped outof that as well. He grew his curly blond hair to his shoulders. He began workingin construction full-time for Ted, but he was drifting toward a precipice. Inthe 1970s, London acquired the nickname “Speed City,” because of themethamphetamine labs that sprang up to serve its blossoming underworld. Harddrugs were easy to obtain. Two of Haggis’s friends died from overdoses, and hehad a gun pointed in his face a couple of times. “I was a bad kid,” he admitted.“I didn’t kill anybody. Not that I didn’t try.”He also acted as a stage manager in the ninety-nine-seat theater his fathercreated in an abandoned church for one of his stagestruck daughters. On Saturdaynights, Paul would strike the set of whatever show was under way and put up amovie screen. In that way he introduced himself and the small community of filmbuffs in London to the works of Bergman, Hitchcock, and the French New Wave. Hewas so affected by Michelangelo Antonioni’s Blow-Up that in 1974 he decided tobecome a fashion photographer in England, like the hero of that movie. Thatlasted less than a year, but when he returned he still carried a Leica over hisshoulder.Back in London, Ontario, he fell in love with a nursing student named DianeGettas. They began sharing a one-bedroom apartment filled with Paul’s books onfilm. He thought of himself then as “a loner and an artist and an iconoclast.”His grades were too poor to get into college. He could see that he was goingnowhere. He was ready to change, but he wasn’t sure how.Such was Paul Haggis’s state of mind when he joined the Church of Scientology.LIKE EVERY SCIENTOLOGIST, when Haggis entered the church, he took his firststeps into the mind of L. Ron Hubbard. He read about Hubbard’s adventurous life:how he wandered the world, led dangerous expeditions, and healed himself ofcrippling war injuries through the techniques that he developed into Dianetics.He was not a prophet, like Mohammed, or divine, like Jesus. He had not beenvisited by an angel bearing tablets of revelation, like Joseph Smith, thefounder of Mormonism. Scientologists believe that Hubbard discovered theexistential truths that form their doctrine through extensive research—in thatway, it is “science.” The apparent rationalism appealed to Haggis. He had longsince walked away from the religion of his upbringing, but he was still lookingfor a way to express his idealism. It was important to him that Scientologydidn’t demand belief in a god. But the figure of L. Ron Hubbard did hover overthe religion in suggestive ways. He wasn’t worshipped, exactly, but his visageand name were everywhere, like the absolute ruler of a small kingdom.[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_002_r1.jpg]L. Ron Hubbard in the 1960sThere seemed to be two Hubbards within the church: the godlike authority whoseevery word was regarded as scripture, and the avuncular figure that Haggis sawon the training videos, who came across as wry and self-deprecating. Those werequalities that Haggis shared to a marked degree, and they inspired trust in theman he had come to accept as his spiritual guide. Still, Haggis felt a littlestranded by the lack of irony among his fellow Scientologists. Their inabilityto laugh at themselves seemed at odds with the character of Hubbard himself. Hedidn’t seem self-important or pious; he was like the dashing, wisecracking heroof a B movie who had seen everything and somehow had it all figured out. WhenHaggis experienced doubts about the religion, he reflected on the 16 mm films ofHubbard’s lectures from the 1950s and 1960s, which were part of the church’sindoctrination process. Hubbard was always chuckling to himself, marveling oversome random observation that had just occurred to him, with a little wink to theaudience suggesting that they not take him too seriously. He would just open hismouth and a mob of new thoughts would burst forth, elbowing each other in therace to make themselves known to the world. They were often trivial anddisjointed but also full of obscure, learned references and charged with a senseof originality and purpose. “You walked in one day and you said, ‘I’m aseneschal,’ ” Hubbard observed in a characteristic aside,and this knight with eight-inch spurs, standing there—humph—and say, “I’msupposed to open the doors to this castle, I’ve been doing this for a long time,and I’m a very trusted retainer.”…He’s insisting he’s the seneschal but nobodywill pay him his wages, and so forth.… He was somebody before he became theseneschal. Now, as a seneschal, he became nobody—until he finally went out andgot a begging pan on the highway and began to hold it out for fish and chips aspeople came along, you know.… Now he says, “I am something, I am a beggar,” butthat’s still something. Then the New York state police come along, or somebody,and they say to him—I’m a little mixed up in my periods here, but they say tohim—“Do you realize you cannot beg upon the public road without license Number603-F?”…So he starves to death and kicks the bucket and there he lies.… Now he’ssomebody, he’s a corpse, but he’s not dead, he’s merely a corpse.… Got the idea?But he goes through sequences of becoming nobody, somebody, nobody, somebody,nobody, somebody, nobody, not necessarily on a dwindling spiral. Some people getup to the point of being a happy man. You know the old story of a happy man—Iwon’t tell it—he didn’t have a shirt.…Just as this fuzzy parable begins to ramble into incoherence, Hubbard comes tothe point, which is that a being is not his occupation or even the body hepresently inhabits. The central insight of Scientology is that the being iseternal, what Hubbard terms a “thetan.” “This chap, in other words, was somebodyuntil he began to identify his beingness with a thing.… None of thesebeingnesses are the person. The person is the thetan.”“He had this amazing buoyancy,” Haggis recalled. “He had a deadpan sense ofhumor and this sense of himself that seemed to say, ‘Yes, I am fully aware thatI might be mad, but I also might be on to something.’ ”The zealotry that empowered so many members of the church came from the beliefthat they were the vanguard of the struggle to save humanity. “A civilizationwithout insanity, without criminals and without war, where the able can prosperand honest beings can have rights, and where Man is free to rise to greaterheights, are the aims of Scientology,” Hubbard writes. Those breathless aimsdrew young idealists, like Haggis, to the church’s banner.To advance such lofty goals, Hubbard developed a “technology” to attainspiritual freedom and discover oneself as an immortal being. “Scientology works100 percent of the time when it is properly applied to a person who sincerelydesires to improve his life,” a church publication declares. This guaranteerests on the assumption that through rigorous research, Hubbard had uncovered aperfect understanding of human nature. One must not stray from the path he haslaid down or question his methods. Scientology is exact. Scientology is certain.Step by step one can ascend toward clarity and power, becoming more oneself—but,paradoxically, also more like Hubbard. Scientology is the geography of his mind.Perhaps no individual in history has taken such copious internal soundings anddescribed with so much logic and minute detail the inner workings of his ownmentality. The method Hubbard put forward created a road map toward his ownideal self. Hubbard’s habits, his imagination, his goals and wishes—hischaracter, in other words—became both the basis and the destination ofScientology.Secretly, Haggis didn’t really respect Hubbard as a writer. He hadn’t been ableto get through Dianetics, for instance. He read about thirty pages, then put itdown. Much of the Scientology coursework, however, gave him a feeling ofaccomplishment. In 1976, he traveled to Los Angeles, the center of theScientology universe, checking in at the old Château Élysée, on Franklin Avenue.Clark Gable and Katharine Hepburn had once stayed there, along with many otherstars, but when Haggis arrived it was a run-down church retreat called the ManorHotel.1 He had a little apartment with a kitchen where he could write.There were about 30,000 Scientologists in America at the time. Most of them werewhite, urban, and middle class; they were predominantly in their twenties, andmany of them, especially in Los Angeles, were involved in graphic or performingarts. In other words, they were a lot like Paul Haggis. He immediately became apart of a community in a city that can otherwise be quite isolating. For thefirst time in his life, he experienced a feeling of kinship and camaraderie withpeople who had a lot in common—“all these atheists looking for something tobelieve in, and all these wanderers looking for a club to join.”In 1977, Haggis returned to Canada to continue working for his father, who couldsee that his son was struggling. Ted Haggis asked him what he wanted to do withhis life. Haggis said he wanted to be a writer. His father said, “Well, thereare only two places to do that, New York and Los Angeles. Pick one, and I’llkeep you on the payroll for a year.” Paul chose LA because it was the heart ofthe film world. Soon after this conversation with his father, Haggis and DianeGettas got married. Two months later, they loaded up his brown Camaro and droveto Los Angeles, moving into an apartment with Diane’s brother, Gregg, and threeother people. Paul got a job moving furniture. On the weekends he tookphotographs for yearbooks. At night he wrote scripts on spec at a secondhanddrafting table. The following year, Diane gave birth to their first child,Alissa.SCIENTOLOGY HAD a giddy and playful air in the mid-seventies, when Haggisarrived in Los Angeles. It was seen as a cool, boutique religion, aimedespecially toward the needs of artists and entertainers. The counterculture wasstill thriving in the seventies, and Scientology both was a part of it and stoodapart from it. There was a saying, “After drugs, there’s Scientology,” and itwas true that many who were drawn to the religion had taken hallucinogens andwere open to alternative realities. Recruits had a sense of boundlesspossibility. Mystical powers were forecast; out-of-body experiences were to beexpected; fundamental secrets of the universe were to be revealed.Haggis became friends with other Scientologists who also hoped to make it inHollywood. One of them was Skip Press, a writer and musician on the staff of theCelebrity Centre, which was the church’s main foothold in the entertainmentindustry. Like many young recruits, Press believed that Scientology had givenhim superhuman powers; for instance, he believed that when he got into the rightmental state, he could change traffic lights to green. He and Haggis formed acasual self-help group with other aspiring writers. They met at a Scientologyhangout across from the Celebrity Centre called Two Dollar Bill’s, where theywould criticize each other’s work and scheme about how to get ahead.[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_003_r1.jpg]Paul Haggis on vacation in Antigua in 1975, the year he joined the Church ofScientologyEventually, this informal writers club came to the attention of Yvonne Gillham,the charismatic founder of the Celebrity Centre. Naturally warm and energetic,Gillham was an ideal candidate to woo the kinds of artists and opinion leadersthat Hubbard sought to front his religion. The former kindergarten directorstaged parties, poetry readings, workshops, and dances. Chick Corea and othermusicians associated with the church often played there. Gillham persuadedHaggis and his circle to hold their meetings at the Celebrity Centre, and theywere folded into her web.Haggis and a friend from the writers club eventually got a job scriptingcartoons for Ruby-Spears Productions, beginning with a short-lived series calledDingbat and the Creeps, then Heathcliff. After that, Haggis went on to writeRichie Rich and Scooby-Doo for Hanna-Barbera. He bought a used IBM Selectrictypewriter. His career began to creep forward.One day, a well-off strawberry farmer from Vancouver introduced himself toHaggis and Skip Press at the Celebrity Centre, saying he wanted to produce alife story of L. Ron Hubbard. He was offering fifteen thousand dollars for ascript. Press declined, but Haggis accepted the money. His memory is that it wasa horror script that he hoped to interest the strawberry farmer in. He neveractually wrote a script about Hubbard, and eventually returned the entire sum,but in Press’s opinion, that was when Haggis’s career began to accelerate. “Themoney enabled Paul to cruise a bit and develop his career. Next thing I knew,Paul was getting an agent.” His Scientology connections were paying off.HAGGIS SPENT much of his time and money taking advanced courses and being“audited,” a kind of Scientology psychotherapy that involves the use of anelectropsychometer, or E-Meter. The device measures bodily changes in electricalresistance that occur when a person answers questions posed by an auditor.Hubbard compared it to a lie detector. The E-Meter bolstered the church’s claimto being a scientific path to spiritual discovery. “It gives Man his first keenlook into the heads and hearts of his fellows,” Hubbard claimed, adding thatScientology boosted some people’s IQ one point for every hour of auditing. “Ourmost spectacular feat was raising a boy from 83 IQ to 212,” he once boasted tothe Saturday Evening Post.The theory of auditing is that it locates and discharges mental “masses” thatare blocking the free flow of energy. Ideas and fantasies are not immaterial;they have weight and solidity. They can root themselves in the mind as phobiasand obsessions. Auditing breaks up the masses that occupy what Hubbard terms the“reactive mind,” which is where the fears and phobias reside. The E-Meter ispresumed to measure changes in those masses. If the needle on the meter moves tothe right, resistance is rising; to the left, it is falling. The auditor askssystematic questions aimed at detecting sources of “spiritual distress”—problemsat work or in a relationship, for instance. Whenever the client, or “preclear,”gives an answer that prompts the meter needle to jump, that subject becomes anarea of concentration until the auditor is satisfied that emotional consequencesof the troubling experience have drained away. Certain patterns of needlemovement, such as sudden jumps or darts, long versus short falls, et cetera,have meaning as well. The auditor tries to guide the preclear to a “cognition”about the subject under examination, which leads to a “floating” needle. Thatdoesn’t necessarily mean that the needle is frozen. “The needle just idlesaround and yawns at your questions,” Hubbard explains. The individual shouldexperience a corresponding feeling of release. Eventually, the reactive mind iscleansed of its obsessions, fears, and irrational urges, and the preclearbecomes Clear.2Haggis found the E-Meter impressively responsive. He would grasp a cylindricalelectrode in each hand. (When he first joined Scientology, the electrodes wereempty Campbell’s soup cans with the labels stripped off.) An imperceptibleelectrical charge would run from the meter through his body. The meter seemedable to gauge the kinds of thoughts he was having—whether they were scary orhappy, or when he was hiding something. It was a little spooky. The auditoroften probed for what Scientologists call “earlier similars.” If Paul was havinganother fight with Diane, for instance, the auditor would ask him, “Can youremember an earlier time when something like this happened?” Each new memory ledfurther and further back in time. The goal was to uncover and neutralize theemotional memories that were plaguing Paul’s behavior.Often, the process led participants to recall past lives. Although that neverhappened to Haggis, he envied others who professed to have vivid recollectionsof ancient times or distant civilizations. Wouldn’t it be cool if you had manylifetimes before? he thought. Wouldn’t it be easier to face death?Scientology is not just a matter of belief, the recruits were constantly told;it is a step-by-step scientific process that will help you overcome yourlimitations and realize your full potential for greatness. Only Scientology canawaken individuals to the joyful truth of their immortal state. Only Scientologycan rescue humanity from its inevitable doom. The recruits were infused with asense of mystery, purpose, and intrigue. Life inside Scientology was just somuch more compelling than life outside.Preclears sometimes experience mystical states characterized by feelings ofbliss or a sense of blending into the universe. They come to expect suchphenomena, and they yearn for them if they don’t occur. “Exteriorization”—thesense that one has actually left his physical being behind—is a commonlyreported occurrence for Scientologists. If one’s consciousness can actuallyuproot itself from the physical body and move about at will—what does that sayabout mortality? We must be something more than, something other than, a merephysical incarnation; we actually are thetans, to use Hubbard’s term, immortalspiritual beings that are incarnated in innumerable lifetimes. Hubbard said thatexteriorization could be accomplished in about half the preclears by having theauditor simply command, “Be three feet back of your head.” Free of thelimitations of his body, the thetan can roam the universe, circling stars,strolling on Mars, or even creating entirely new universes. Reality expands farbeyond what the individual had originally perceived it to be. The ultimate goalof auditing is not just to liberate a person from destructive mental phenomena;it is to emancipate him from the laws of matter, energy, space, and time—orMEST, as Hubbard termed them. These are just artifacts of the thetan’simagination, in any case. Bored thetans had created MEST universes where theycould frolic and play games; eventually, they became so absorbed in theirdistractions they forgot their true immortal natures. They identified with thebodies that they were temporarily inhabiting, in a universe they had inventedfor their own amusement. The goal of Scientology is to recall to the thetan hisimmortality and help him relinquish his self-imposed limitations.Once, Haggis had what he thought was an out-of-body experience. He was lying ona couch, and then he found himself across the room, observing himself lyingthere. The experience of being out of his body wasn’t that grand, and later hewondered if he had simply been visualizing the scene. He didn’t have thecertainty his colleagues reported when they talked about seeing objects behindthem or in distant places and times.In 1976, at the Manor Hotel, Haggis went “Clear.” It is the base camp for thosewho hope to ascend to the upper peaks of Scientology. The concept comes fromDianetics. A person who becomes Clear is “adaptable to and able to change hisenvironment,” Hubbard writes. “His ethical and moral standards are high, hisability to seek and experience pleasure is great. His personality is heightenedand he is creative and constructive.” Among other qualities, the Clear has aflawless memory and the capacity to perform mental tasks at unprecedented ratesof speed; he is less susceptible to disease; and he is free of neuroses,compulsions, repressions, and psychosomatic illnesses. Hubbard sums up: “Thedianetic clear is to a current normal individual as the current normal is to theseverely insane.”Haggis was Clear #5925. “It was not life-changing,” he admits. “It wasn’t like,‘Oh my God, I can fly!’ ” At every level of advancement, he was encouraged towrite a “success story” saying how effective his training had been. He had readmany such stories by other Scientologists, and they felt overly effusive, gearedtoward getting through the gatekeepers so that the students could move on to thenext level.THE BRIDGE TO TOTAL FREEDOM is a journey that goes on and on (althoughconfoundingly, in the Scientology metaphor, one moves “higher and higher”—up theBridge rather than across it). Haggis quickly advanced through the upper levels.He was becoming an “Operating Thetan,” which the church defines as one who “canhandle things and exist without physical support and assistance.” An editorialin a 1958 issue of the Scientology magazine Ability notes that “neither Buddhanor Jesus Christ were OTs according to the evidence. They were just a shadeabove Clear.”When Haggis joined the church, there were seven levels of Operating Thetans.According to church documents that have been leaked online, Hubbard’shandwritten instructions for Operating Thetan Level One list thirteen mentalexercises that attune practitioners to their relationship with others. Thedirectives for OT I are so open-ended it could be difficult to know whether theyhave been satisfactorily accomplished. “Note several large and several smallmale bodies until you have a cognition,” for instance. Or, “Seat yourselfunobtrusively where you can observe a number of people. Spot things and peopleyou are not. Do to cognition.” The point is to familiarize oneself with one’senvironment from the perspective of being Clear.In the second level, OT II, Scientologists attempt to delete past-life“implants” that hinder progress in one’s current existence. This is accomplishedthrough exercises and visualizations that explore oppositional forces: “Laughtercomes from the rear half and calm from the front half simultaneously. Then theyreverse. It gives one a sensation of total disagreement. The trick is toconceive of both at the same time. This tends to knock one out.”Each new level of achievement marked the entrance to a more select spiritualfraternity. Haggis didn’t have a strong reaction to the material, but then, hewasn’t expecting anything too profound. Everyone knew that the big revelationsresided in OT III.Hubbard called this level the Wall of Fire.“The material involved in this sector is so vicious, that it is carefullyarranged to kill anyone if he discovers the exact truth of it,” he wrote in1967. “So in January and February of this year I became very ill, almost lostthis body, and somehow or another brought it off, and obtained the material, andwas able to live through it. I am very sure that I was the first one that everdid live through any attempt to attain that material.”In the late seventies, the OT mysteries were still unknown, except to the elect.There was no Internet, and Scientology’s confidential scriptures had never beenpublished or produced in court. Scientologists looked toward the moment ofinitiation into OT III with extreme curiosity and excitement. The candidate hadto be invited into this next level—Scientologists were cautioned that thematerial could cause harm or even death to those who were unprepared to receiveit. The enforced secrecy added to the mystique and the giddy air of adventure.One could look back at this crucial moment and examine the pros and cons ofHaggis’s decision to stay in Scientology. The fact that people often sneered atthe church didn’t deter him; on the contrary, he reveled in being a member of astigmatized minority—it made him feel at one with other marginalized groups. Themain drawback to belief was his own skeptical nature; he was a proud contrarian,and it would never have occurred to him to join the Baptist church, forinstance, or to return to Catholicism; he simply wasn’t interested.Intellectually, faith didn’t call to him. Scientology, on the other hand, wasexotic and tantalizing. The weirdness of some of the doctrines was hard tofathom, but there was no doubt in Haggis’s mind that he had gained somepractical benefits from his several years of auditing and that his communicationskills had improved through some of the coursework. None of that had requiredhim to “believe” in Scientology, but the religion had proved itself in certainways that mattered to him. The process of induction was so gradual that thingsthat might have shocked him earlier were more acceptable by the time he cameupon them. Whenever he ran into something on the Bridge to Total Freedom that hecouldn’t fathom, he convinced himself that the next level would make everythingunderstandable.Scientology was a part of his community; it had taken root in Hollywood, just asHaggis had. His first writing jobs had come through Scientology connections. Hiswife was deeply involved in the church, as was his sister Kathy. His circle offriends was centered in the church. Haggis was deep enough into the process bynow to understand implicitly that those relationships would be jeopardized if hechose to leave the church. Moreover, he had invested a considerable part of hisincome in the program. The incentive to believe was high.He was also looking forward to having the enhanced abilities that his fellowadherents on the Bridge were constantly talking about. Although Hubbard hadexplicitly told Operating Thetans not to use their powers for “parlor tricks,”there was a section of Advance!, a magazine for upper-level Scientologists,titled “OT Phenomena,” where members could report clairvoyant or paranormalexperiences. Parking spaces magically made themselves available and waitersimmediately noticed you. “I saw that my goldfish was all red and lumpy,” oneScientologist writes in Advance! “My husband, Rick, said that he’s had goldfishlike that before and they don’t recover.” The correspondent relates that sheused her abilities to “flow energy” into the fish “until a big burst of matterblew. I ended off. When I went home that night the fish was completely healed.”She concludes, “It was a big win for me, and the fish. It couldn’t have beendone without the technology of L. Ron Hubbard.” Even if such effects were randomand difficult to replicate, for those who experienced them life was suddenlyfull of unseen possibilities. There was a sense of having entered a sphere oftranscendence, where minds communicate with each other across great distances,where wishes and intentions affect material objects or cause people tounconsciously obey telepathic orders, and where spirits from other ages or evenother worlds make themselves known.“A theta being is capable of emitting a considerable electronic flow,” Hubbardnotes, “enough to give somebody a very bad shock, to put out his eyes or cut himin half.” Even ordinary actions pose unexpected dilemmas for the OT, Hubbardwarns. “How do you answer the phone as an OT?” he asks in one of his lectures.“Supposing you get mad at somebody on the other end of the telephone. You gocrunch! And that’s so much Bakelite. The thing either goes into a fog of dust inthe middle of the air or drips over the floor.” To avoid crushing telephoneswith his unfathomable strength, the OT sets up an automatic action so he doesn’thave to pick the receiver up himself. “Telephone rings, it springs into the air,and he talks. In other words, through involuntary intention the telephone standsthere in mid-air.” The promise of employing such powers was incrediblytantalizing.Carrying an empty briefcase, Haggis went to the Advanced Organization buildingin Los Angeles, where the OT III material was held. A supervisor handed him amanila envelope. Haggis locked it in the briefcase, which was lashed to his arm.Then he entered a secure study room and bolted the door behind him. At last, hewas able to examine the religion’s highest mysteries, revealed in a couple ofpages of Hubbard’s handwritten scrawl. After a few minutes, Haggis returned tothe supervisor.“I don’t understand,” Haggis said.“Do you know the words?”“I know the words, I just don’t understand.”“Go back and read it again,” the supervisor suggested.Haggis did so. In a moment, he returned. “Is this a metaphor?” he asked.“No,” the supervisor responded. “It is what it is. Do the actions that arerequired.”Maybe it’s an insanity test, Haggis thought—if you believe it, you’reautomatically kicked out. He considered that possibility. But when he read itagain, he decided, “This is madness.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 It has since been spectacularly renovated and turned into Scientology’spremier Celebrity Centre.2 Hubbard sometimes disparaged the term “lie detector” in connection withE-Meters. “In the first place they do not detect lies and in the second placethe police have known too little about the human mind to know that theirinstrument was actually accurate to an amazing perfection. These instrumentsshould be called ‘emotion detectors’ ” (Hubbard, “Electropsychometric AuditingOperator’s Manual,” 1952). According to David S. Touretsky, a research professorin computer science at Carnegie Mellon University (and a prominent Scientologycritic), what are called “thoughts” are actually “fleeting patterns of chemicaland electrical activity in our brains” that have no actual mass. “The meter isreally more of a prop or talisman than a measuring instrument. Interpretingneedle movements is like reading tea leaves. A good fortune teller picks up onlots of subliminal cues that let them ‘read’ their subject, while the tea leavesgive the subject something to fixate on. And the subject is heavily invested inbelieving that the auditor and the meter are effective, so it’s a mutuallyreinforcing system.” The E-Meter measures skin resistance, like a lie detector.“Strong emotional reactions do cause changes in muscle tension or micro-tremorsof the fingers will also cause changes in the current flowing to the meter, soit’s not purely measuring the physiological changes associated with skinresistance like a real lie detector would. (And real lie detectors also look atother variables, such as pulse and respiration rates.)” (David Touretsky,personal correspondence.)"},{"pageContent":"2[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_L02_r1.jpg]SOURCEThe many discrepancies between Hubbard’s legend and his life have overshadowedthe fact that he genuinely was a fascinating man: an explorer, a best-sellingauthor, and the founder of a worldwide religious movement. The tug-of-warbetween Scientologists and anti-Scientologists over Hubbard’s biography hascreated two swollen archetypes: the most important person who ever lived and theworld’s greatest con man. Hubbard himself seemed to revolve on this same axis,constantly inflating his actual accomplishments in a manner that was rather easyfor his critics to puncture. But to label him a pure fraud is to ignore thecomplex, charming, delusional, and visionary features of his character that madehim so compelling to the many thousands who followed him and the millions whoread his work. One would also have to ignore his life’s labor in creating theintricately detailed epistemology that has pulled so many into itsnet—including, most prominently, Hubbard himself.Lafayette Ronald Hubbard was born in Tilden, Nebraska, in 1911, a striking,happy child with gray eyes and wispy carrot-colored hair. His father, Harry Ross“Hub” Hubbard, was in the Navy when he met Ledora May Waterbury, who wasstudying to be a teacher in Omaha. They married in 1909. By the time their onlychild came along two years later, Hub was out of the service and working in theadvertising department of the local Omaha newspaper. May returned to herhometown of Tilden for the birth.When Ron was two, the family moved to Helena, Montana, a gold town that wasfamous all over the West for its millionaires and its prostitutes. It was alsothe capital of the frontier state. Hub managed the Family Theater, which,despite its name, shared a building downtown with two bordellos. Even as a youngchild, Ron loved to watch the vaudeville acts that passed through, but theenterprise shut its doors when a larger theater opened nearby.Ron’s maternal grandparents lived nearby. Lafayette Waterbury was a veterinarianand a well-regarded horseman who doted on his redheaded grandson. “I was ridingbroncs at 3½ years,” Hubbard later boasted. He supposedly began reading at thesame precocious age, and according to the church he was “soon devouring shelvesof classics, including much of Western philosophy, the pillars of Englishliterature, and, of note, the essays of Sigmund Freud.”When the United States entered the First World War in 1917, Hubbard’s fatherdecided to re-enlist in the Navy. Ledora got a job with the State of Montana,and she and six-year-old Ron moved in with her parents, who had relocated toHelena. When the war ended, Hub decided to make a career in the Navy, and theHubbard family was launched into the itinerant military life.Hubbard’s family was Methodist. He once remarked, “Many members of my familythat I was raised with were devout Christians, and my grandfather was a devoutatheist.” Ron took his own eccentric path. Throughout his youth, he wasfascinated by shamans and magicians. As a boy in Montana, he says, he was made ablood brother to the Blackfoot Indians by an elderly medicine man named Old TomMadfeathers. Hubbard claims that Old Tom would put on displays of magic byleaping fifteen feet high from a seated position and perching on the top of histeepee. Hubbard observes, “I learned long ago that man has his standards forcredulity, and when reality clashes with these, he feels challenged.”A signal moment in Hubbard’s narrative is the seven-thousand-mile voyage he tookin 1923 from Seattle through the Panama Canal to Washington, DC, where hisfather was being posted. One of his fellow passengers was Commander Joseph C.“Snake” Thompson of the US Navy Medical Corps. A neurosurgeon, a naturalist, anda former spy, Thompson made a vivid impression on the boy. “He was a verycareless man,” Hubbard later recalled. “He used to go to sleep reading a bookand when he woke up, why, he got up and never bothered to press and change hisuniform, you know. And he was usually in very bad odor with the NavyDepartment.… But he was a personal friend of Sigmund Freud’s.… When he saw me—adefenseless character—and there was nothing to do on a big transport on a verylong cruise, he started to work me over.”No doubt Thompson entertained the young Hubbard with tales of his adventures asa spy in the Far East. Raised in Japan by his father, a missionary, Thompsonspoke fluent Japanese. He had spent much of his early military career roamingthrough Asia posing as a herpetologist looking for rare snakes while covertlygathering intelligence and charting possible routes of invasion.“What impressed me,” Hubbard later remarked, “he had a cat by the name ofPsycho. This cat had a crooked tail, which is enough to impress any young man.And the cat would do tricks. And the first thing he did was teach me how totrain cats. But it takes so long, and it requires such tremendous patience, thatto this day I have never trained a cat. You have to wait, evidently, for the catto do something, then you applaud it. But waiting for a cat to do somethingwhose name is Psycho …”One of Thompson’s maxims was “If it’s not true for you, it’s not true.” He toldyoung Hubbard that the statement had come from Gautama Siddhartha, the Buddha.It made an impression on Hubbard. “If there’s anybody in the world that’scalculated to believe what he wants to believe and to reject what he doesn’twant to believe, it is I.”Thompson had just returned from Vienna, where he had been sent by the Navy tostudy under Freud. “I was just a kid and Commander Thompson didn’t have any boyof his own and he and I just got along fine,” Hubbard recalls in one of hislectures. “Why he took it into his head to start beating Freud into my head, Idon’t know, but he did. And I wanted very much to follow out this work—wantedvery much to. I didn’t get a chance. My father … said, ‘Son, you’re going to bean engineer.’ ”THOMPSON WAS ABOUT to publish a review of psychoanalytic literature in theUnited States Naval Medical Bulletin; indeed, he may have been working on it ashe traveled to Washington, and no doubt he drew upon the thinking reflected inhis article when he tutored Hubbard in the basics of Freudian theory. “Man hastwo fundamental instincts—one for self-preservation and the other for racepropagation,” Thompson writes in his review. “The most important emotion of theself-preservation urge is hunger. The sole emotion of the race-propagation urgeis libido.” Psychoanalysis, Thompson explains, is the “technic” of discoveringunconscious motivations that harm the health or happiness of the individual.Once the patient understands the motives behind his neurotic behavior, hissymptoms automatically disappear. “This uncovering of the hidden motive does notconsist in the mere explaining to the patient the mechanism of his plight. Theunderstanding alone comes from the analytic technic of free association andsubsequent rational synthesis.” Many of these thoughts are deeply embedded inthe principles of Dianetics, the foundation of Hubbard’s philosophy of humannature, which predated the establishment of Scientology.In 1927, Hubbard’s father was posted to Guam, and Ledora went along, abandoningRon to the care of her parents. For a man as garrulous as L. Ron Hubbard turnedout to be, reflections on his parents are rare, almost to the point of writingthem out of his biography. His story of himself reads like that of an orphan whohas invented his own way in the world. One of his lovers later said that he toldher that his mother was a whore and a lesbian, and that he had found her in bedwith another woman. His mistress also admitted, “I never knew what to believe.”Hubbard made two voyages to visit his parents in Guam. One trip included adetour to China, where he supposedly began his study of Eastern religions afterencountering magicians and holy men. According to the church’s narrative, “Hebraved typhoons aboard a working schooner to finally land on the China coast.…He then made his way inland to finally venture deep into forbidden Buddhistlamaseries.” He watched monks meditating “for weeks on end.” Everywhere he went,the narrative goes, the teenage Hubbard was preoccupied with a central question:“ ‘Why?’ Why so much human suffering and misery? Why was man, with all hisancient wisdom and knowledge accumulated in learned texts and temples, unable tosolve such basic problems as war, insanity and unhappiness?”In fact, Hubbard’s contemporary journals don’t really engage such philosophicalpoints. His trip to China, which was organized by the YMCA, lasted only tendays. His parents accompanied him, although they are not mentioned in hisjournals. He did encounter monks, whom he described as croaking like bullfrogs.The journals reflect the mind of a budding young imperialist, who summons anunearned authority over an exotic and unfamiliar culture. “The very nature ofthe Chinaman holds him back,” Hubbard observes on the ship back to Guam. “Thetrouble with China is, there are too many chinks here.”The journals provide a portrait of an adolescent writer trying on his futurecraft by cataloguing plot ideas, such as, “A young American in India with anorganized army for rent to the various rajahs. Usual plot complications.”Another idea: “Love story. Goes to France. Meets swell broad in Marseilles.” Heis trying uncertainly to find his voice:Rex Fraser mounted the knoll and setting his hat more securely against the windsquinted at the huddle of unpainted shacks below him.“So this,” he said to his horse, “is Montana City.”Hubbard entered the School of Engineering at George Washington University in thefall of 1930. He was a poor student—failing German and calculus—but he excelledin extracurricular activities. He began writing for the school newspaper. A newliterary magazine at GWU provided a venue for his first published works offiction. He became director of the gliding club, a thrilling new pastime thatwas just catching on (Hubbard’s gliding license was #385). The actual study ofengineering was a secondary pursuit, as his failing grades reflected.In September 1931, Hubbard and his friend Philip “Flip” Browning took a fewweeks off to barnstorm through the Midwest in an Arrow Sport biplane. “Wecarefully wrapped our ‘baggage,’ threw the fire extinguisher out to save half ahorsepower, patched a hole in the upper wing, and started off to skim over fouror five states with the wind as our only compass,” Hubbard writes. By now, hehad taken to calling himself “Flash.”Hubbard’s account of this adventure, “Tailwind Willies,” was his firstcommercially published story, appearing in The Sportsman Pilot in January 1932.It was the launch of an unprecedented career. (He would go on to publish morebooks than any other author, according to the 2006 Guinness World Records, with1,084 titles.)In the spring of 1932, at the height of the Great Depression, Hubbard undertooka venture that displayed many of the hallmarks of his future exploits. He posteda notice on several university campuses: “Restless young men with wanderlustwanted for the Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition. Cost to applicant $250payable at the dock in Baltimore before sailing. Must be healthy, dependable,resourceful, imaginative, and adventurous. No tea-hounds or tourist materialneed apply.” The goals of the expedition were grand and various—primarily, tomake newsreels for Fox Movietone and Pathé News, while exploring the piratehaunts of the Caribbean and voodoo rites in Haiti. There were also vague plansto “collect whatever one collects for exhibits in museums.”“It’s difficult at any age to recognize a messiah in the making,” wrote one ofthe young men, James S. Free, a journalist who signed on to the expedition. Hewas twenty-three years old, two years older than Hubbard. They were going to bepartners in the adventure, along with Hubbard’s old flying buddy, Phil Browning.“I cannot claim prescient awareness that my soon-to-be business partnerpossessed the ego and talents that would later develop his own privatereligion,” Free wrote in a notebook he titled “Preview of a Messiah.”Hubbard was living with his parents in Washington, DC, when Free arrived. “Ronintroduced me to his mother, whose long light brown hair seemed dark beside thereddish glow of her son’s hair and face,” Free wrote, in one of the few recordsof the actual relationship between Hubbard and his mother. “I recall little elseabout her except that like her husband, Navy lieutenant Henry Ross Hubbard, sheplainly adored young Ron and considered him a budding genius.”Hubbard filled Free in on new developments. Phil Browning, the other partner,had dropped out at the last minute, but he had managed to get the loan of somelaboratory equipment from the University of Michigan; meantime, Hubbard wasnegotiating with a professional cameraman for the anticipated films of thevoodoo rites “and that sort of salable material.” Thanks to Free’s efforts tosign up more than twenty new members of the expedition, Hubbard said, “We haveenough cash to go ahead.”The trip was a calamity from the start. A number of the “buccaneers” who signedup bailed out at the last minute, but fifty-six green collegians with no ideawhat they were doing clambered aboard the antiquated, four-masted schooner DorisHamlin. The adventure began with the Doris Hamlin having to be towed out ofBaltimore harbor because of lack of wind. That was almost the end of theexpedition, since the tug was pulling toward the sea while the ship was stilltied to the dock. Once in the Atlantic, the ship was either becalmed in glassyseas or roiling in high chop. The mainsails blew out in a squall as theexpedition steered toward St. Thomas. Seasickness was rampant. At every port,more of the disgusted crew deserted. The only film that was shot was a desultorycockfight in Martinique.It soon became evident that the expedition was broke. There was no meat orfruit, and the crew was soon reduced to buying their own food in port. Hubbarddidn’t have enough money to pay the only professional sailors on the ship—thecaptain, the first mate, and the cook—so he offered to sell shares in theventure to his crewmates and borrowed money from others. He raised seven oreight hundred dollars that way, and was able to set sail from Bermuda, only tobecome mired in the Sargasso Sea for four days.After a meager supper one night, George Blakeslee, who had been brought along asa photographer, had had enough. “I tied a hangman’s noose in a rope andeverybody got the same idea,” he wrote in his journal. “So we made an effigy ofHubbard and strung it up in the shrouds. Put a piece of red cloth on the headand a sign on it. ‘Our red-headed _____!’ ” Hubbard stayed in his cabin afterthat.The furious captain wired for money, then steered the ship back to Baltimore,pronouncing the expedition “the worst and most unpleasant I ever made.” Hubbardwas not aboard as the “jinx ship,” as it was called in the local press, creptback into its home port. He was last seen in Puerto Rico, slipping off with asuitcase in each hand.In some respects, Hubbard discovered himself on that unlucky voyage, which hetermed a “glorious adventure.” His infatuation with motion pictures first becameevident on this trip, although no movies were actually made. Despite thedefections, Hubbard demonstrated an impressive capacity to summon others to joinhim on what was clearly a shaky enterprise. Throughout his life he would enlistpeople—especially young people—in romantic, ill-conceived projects, often atsea, where he was out of reach of process servers. He was beginning to inventhimself as a charismatic leader. The grandeur of his project was not yetevident, even to him, but in the Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition he clearlydefined himself as an explorer, sailor, filmmaker, and leader of men, eventhough he failed spectacularly in each of those categories. He had anincorrigible ability to float above the evidence and to extract from hisexperiences lessons that others would say were irrational and even bizarre.Habitually, and perhaps unconsciously, Hubbard would fill this gap—betweenreality and his interpretation of it—with mythology. This was the source of whatsome call his genius, and others call his insanity.WHEN HE WAS TWENTY-THREE, Hubbard married Margaret Louise Grubb, an aspiringaviator four years his senior, whom he called Polly. Amelia Earhart had justbecome the first female to fly solo across the Atlantic, inspiring many daringyoung women who wanted to follow her example. Although Polly never gained apilot’s license, it wasn’t surprising that she would respond to Ron’sswashbuckling personality and his tales of far-flung adventures. They settled ina small town in Maryland, near her family farm. Ron was trying to make it as aprofessional magazine writer, but by that point—at the end of 1933—he had onlyhalf a dozen articles in print. Soon, Polly was pregnant, and Ron had to find away to make a living quickly.Pulp fiction derives its name from the cheap paper stock used in printing thegarish magazines—Weird Tales, Black Mask, Argosy, Magic Carpet—that becamepopular in Depression-era America. The pay for contributors was miserable—thestandard rate was a penny a word. To fill the usual 128 pages, each pulpmagazine required 65,000 words, so that the yearly quota to fill the 150 pulpweeklies, biweeklies, and monthlies that crowded the newsstands in 1934 amountedto about 195,000,000 words. Many well-known writers began their careers byfeeding this gigantic maw, including Dashiell Hammett, H. P. Lovecraft, ErleStanley Gardner, Raymond Chandler, Ray Bradbury, and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Thepulps nurtured genres that were perhaps not new but until then had never been soblatantly and abundantly expressed.Hubbard’s actual life experiences seemed wonderfully suited for such literature.His first pulp story, “The Green God,” published in Thrilling Adventures in1934, is about a naval intelligence officer (possibly based on Snake Thompson)who is tortured and buried alive in China. “Maybe Because—!,” published inCowboy Stories, was the first of Hubbard’s forty-seven westerns, which must havedrawn upon his childhood in Montana. Soon, however, there were stories aboutsubmarines and zombies, tales set in Russia or Morocco. Plot was all that reallymattered, and Hubbard’s amazing capacity for invention readily colored thecanvas. Success in the pulps depended on speed and imagination, and Hubbard hadboth in abundance. The church estimates that between 1934 and 1936, he wasturning out a hundred thousand words of fiction a month. He was writing so fastthat he began typing on a roll of butcher paper to save time. When a story wasfinished, he would tear off the sheet using a T-square and mail it to thepublisher. Because the magazines didn’t want an author to appear more than oncein the same issue, Hubbard adopted pen names—Mr. Spectator, Capt. HumbertReynolds, Rene Lafayette, Winchester Remington Colt, et cetera—accumulatingabout twenty aliases over the years. He said that when he was writing stories hewould simply “roll the pictures” in his mind and write down what he saw asquickly as possible. It was a physical act: he would actually perspire when hewrote. His philosophy was “First draft, last draft, get it out the door.”Ron and Polly’s son, L. Ron Hubbard, Jr., was born prematurely on May 7, 1934,in Encinitas, California, where the couple had gone to vacation. The baby, whomthey called Nibs, weighed little more than two pounds at birth. Ron fashioned anincubator out of a cupboard drawer, using a lightbulb to keep it warm, whilePolly fed Nibs with an eyedropper. Two years later, in New York City, Polly gavebirth to a daughter, Katherine May Hubbard, whom they called Kay.In 1936, the family moved to Bremerton, Washington, near where Ron’s parentswere then living, as well as his mother’s family, the Waterburys. They warmlyaccepted Polly and the kids. Ron was doing well enough to buy a small farm innearby Port Orchard with a house, five bungalows, a thousand feet of waterfront,and a view of Mount Rainier—“the prettiest place I ever saw in my life,” hewrote to his best friend, Russell Hays, a fellow author of pulps who lived inKansas. Ron spent much of his time in New York, however, cultivating hisprofessional contacts, and leaving his wife and children for long periods oftime.Hubbard pined for Hollywood, in what would be a long-term, unrequited romance.Despite his overtures, he received only “vague offers” from studios forshort-term contracts. “I have discarded Hollywood,” he complained to Hays. “Ihaven’t got enough charm.” But in the spring of 1937, Columbia Pictures finallyoptioned one of Hubbard’s stories to be folded into a serial, titled The Secretof Treasure Island. Hubbard quickly moved to Hollywood, hoping to finally makeit in the movie business. (He later claimed to have worked on a number of filmsduring this time—including the classic films Stagecoach, with John Wayne, andThe Plainsman, with Gary Cooper—but he never actually received any film creditsother than The Secret of Treasure Island.) By midsummer he had fled back to thefarm in Washington, blaming the long hours, tension, and “dumb Jew producers.”Once again, he threw himself into writing the pulps with a fury, but also with anew note of cynicism. “Never write about a character type you cannot find in themagazine for which the story is intended,” he advised Hays. “Never write aboutan unusual character.” Realism was no asset in this kind of writing, hecomplained, remarking on “my utter inability to sell a story which has anyconnection with my own background.… Reality seems to be a very detestedquantity.”Then, on New Year’s Day, 1938, Hubbard had a revelation that would change hislife—and eventually, the lives of many others. During a dental operation, hereceived a gas anesthetic. “While under the influence of it my heart must havestopped beating,” he relates. “It was like sliding helter-skelter down into avortex of scarlet and it was knowing that one was dying and that the process ofdying was far from pleasant.” In those brief, hallucinatory moments, Hubbardbelieved that the secrets of existence were accidentally revealed to him.Forrest Ackerman, who later became his literary agent, said that Hubbard toldhim that he had risen from the dental chair in spirit form, glanced back at hisformer body, and wondered, “Where do we go from here?” Hubbard’s disembodiedspirit then noticed a huge ornate gate in the distance, which he floatedthrough. On the other side, Ackerman relates, Hubbard discovered “anintellectual smorgasbord of everything that had ever puzzled the mind of man—youknow, how did it all begin, where do we go from here, are there past lives—andlike a sponge he was just absorbing all this esoteric information. And all of asudden, there was a kind of swishing in the air and he heard a voice, ‘No, notyet! He’s not ready!’ And like a long umbilical cord, he felt himself beingpulled back, back, back. And he lay down in his body, and he opened his eyes,and he said to the nurse, ‘I was dead, wasn’t I?’ ” The nurse looked startled,and the doctor gave her a dirty look for letting Hubbard know what had happened.In Hubbard’s own written account of the event, he remembers voices crying out ashe is being restored to life, “Don’t let him know!” When he came to, he was“still in contact with something.” The intimation that he had briefly been givenaccess to the divine mystery lingered for several days, but he couldn’t call itback. “And then one morning, just as I awoke, it came to me.”In a fever, he dashed off a small book he titled Excalibur. “Once upon a time,according to a writer in The Arabian Nights, there lived a very wise old man,”the book begins, in the brief portion that the church has published of thefragments it says it has in its possession. The old man, goes the story, wrote along and learned book, but he became concerned that he had written too much. Sohe sat himself down for ten years more and reduced the original volume to onetenth its size. Even then, he was dissatisfied, and he constrained the work evenfurther, to a single line, “which contained everything there was to be known.”He hid the sacred line in a niche in his wall. But still he wondered, Could allhuman knowledge be distilled even further?Suppose all the wisdom of the world were reduced to just one line—suppose thatone line were to be written today and given to you. With it you could understandthe basis of all life and endeavor.… There is one line, conjured up out of amorass of facts and made available as an integrated unit to explain such things.This line is the philosophy of philosophy, thereby carrying the entire subjectback into the simple and humble truth.All life is directed by one command and one command only—SURVIVE.Hubbard sent excited telegrams to publishers in New York, inviting them to meethim at Penn Station, where he would auction off a manuscript that would changethe world. He wrote Polly, “I have high hopes of smashing my name into historyso violently that it will take a legendary form even if all the books aredestroyed.”But Excalibur was never published, leading some to doubt that it was everwritten. The stories Hubbard later told about the book added to the sense thatit was more mythical than real. He said that when the Russians learned of thebook’s contents, they offered him money and laboratory facilities to completehis work. When he turned them down, they purloined a copy of his manuscript fromhis hotel room in Miami. Hubbard explained to his agent that he ultimatelydecided to withdraw the book from publication because the first six people whoread it were so shattered by the revelations that they had lost their minds. Thelast time he showed Excalibur to a publisher, he said, the reader brought themanuscript into the room, set it on the publisher’s desk, then jumped out thewindow of the skyscraper.Hubbard despondently returned to the pulps. Five years of torrential output hadleft him exhausted and bitter. His work was “worthless,” he admitted. “I havelearned enough of my trade, have developed a certain technique,” he wrote toHays. “But curbed by editorial fear of reality and hindered by my own revolt Ihave never dared loose the pent flame, so far only releasing the smoke.”That same year Hubbard received an offer to write for a magazine calledAstounding Science-Fiction. The editor, John W. Campbell, Jr., twenty-sevenyears old at the time, was to preside over what Hubbard and others would mark asthe Golden Age of Science Fiction. One of the many brilliant young writers whowould be pulled into Campbell’s orbit, Isaac Asimov, described Campbell as “atall, large man with light hair, a beaky nose, a wide face with thin lips, andwith a cigarette holder forever clamped between his teeth.” Campbell was anoverbearing champion of extreme right-wing ideas and crackpot science—especiallypsychic phenomena—and he would hold forth in nonstop monologues, often adoptingperverse views, such as supporting slavery, then defending such propositions tothe point of exhausting everyone in the room. “A deviant figure of markedferocity,” as the British writer Kingsley Amis observed. On the other hand,Campbell was also a caring and resourceful editor who groomed inexperiencedwriters, such as Robert A. Heinlein—first published in Astounding—and turnedthem into cultural icons.Campbell considered science fiction to be something far more than cheap literarydiversion; for him, it amounted to prophecy. His conviction of the importance ofthe genre added a mystical allure that other forms of pulp fiction never aspiredto. Fanzines and sci-fi clubs, composed largely of adolescent boys who weredrawn to the romanticized image of science, formed in many cities around thecountry; some of those fans went on to become important scientists, and theirwork was animated by ideas that had first spilled out of the minds of writerssuch as Heinlein, Asimov, and Hubbard. “Science fiction, particularly in itsGolden Age, had a mission,” Hubbard writes. “To get man to the stars.” He sawhimself as well qualified for the field: “I had, myself, somewhat of a sciencebackground, had done some pioneer work in rockets and liquid gases.”Hubbard discovered his greatest talents as a writer in the field of sciencefiction, a more commodious genre and far more intellectually engaging thanwesterns or adventure yarns. Science fiction invites the writer to grandlyexplore alternative worlds and pose questions about meaning and destiny.Inventing plausible new realities is what the genre is all about. One startsfrom a hypothesis and then builds out the logic, adding detail and incident togive substance to imaginary structures. In that respect, science fiction andtheology have much in common. Some of the most closely guarded secrets ofScientology were originally published in other guises in Hubbard’s sciencefiction.Certainly, the same mind that roamed so freely through imaginary universes mightbe inclined to look at the everyday world and suspect that there was somethingmore behind the surface reality. The broad canvas of science fiction allowedHubbard to think in large-scale terms about the human condition. He was bold. Hewas fanciful. He could easily invent an elaborate, plausible universe. But it isone thing to make that universe believable, and another to believe it. That isthe difference between art and religion.HUBBARD NOW LIVED two lives: one on the farm in Port Orchard, surrounded by hisparents and Polly and the kids; the other in New York, where he rented anapartment on the Upper West Side. The city rewarded him with the recognition hecraved. He enjoyed frequent lunches at the Knickerbocker Hotel with hiscolleagues in the American Fiction Guild, where he could swap tales and schmoozewith editors. He also became a member of the prestigious Explorers Club, whichadded credibility to his frequently told stories of adventure.“In his late twenties, Hubbard was a tall, well-built man with bright red hair,a pale complexion, and a long-nosed face that gave him the look of areincarnated Pan,” a fellow science-fiction writer, L. Sprague de Camp, laterrecalled. “He arranged in his New York apartment a curtained inclosure the sizeof a telephone booth, lit by a blue light bulb, in which he could work fastwithout distraction.”The fact that Hubbard was a continent away from his wife offered him theopportunity to court other women, which he did so openly that he became anobject of wonder among his writer colleagues. Ron blamed Polly for hisphilandering. “Because of her coldness physically, the falsity of herpretensions, I believed myself a near eunuch,” he wrote in a private memoir(which the church disputes) some years later. “When I found I was attractive toother women, I had many affairs. But my failure to please Polly made me alwayspay so much attention to my momentary mate that I derived small pleasure myself.This was an anxiety neurosis which cut down my natural powers.”One of those momentary mates was named Helen. “I loved her and she me,” Hubbardrecorded. “The affair would have lasted had not Polly found out.” Polly haddiscovered two letters to different women that Hubbard left in the mailbox whenhe was back in Port Orchard; she took the letters, read them, then vengefullyswitched the envelopes, and put them back in the mail. For a while, Ron andPolly didn’t speak.They were apparently reconciled in 1940, when the two of them cruised to Alaskaon their thirty-foot ketch, the Magician, which they called Maggie. They lefttheir children with other family members for the several months they were gone.Hubbard called the trip the Alaskan Radio-Experimental Expedition, whichentitled him to fly the Explorers Club flag. The stated goal was to rewrite thenavigation guide of the Alaskan coast using new radio techniques; however, whenthe engine broke down in Ketchikan, he told a local newspaper that the purposewas “two-fold, one to win a bet and another to gather material for a novel ofAlaskan salmon fishing.” Some of Hubbard’s friends, he related, had wagered thathis boat was too small for such a journey, and he was determined to prove themwrong.While he was stranded in Ketchikan, waiting for a new crankshaft, Hubbard spentseveral weeks regaling listeners of the local KGBU radio about his adventures,which included tracking down a German agent who had been planted in Alaska withorders to cut off communications in the case of war, and lassoing a brown bearon a fishing trip, which proceeded to crawl into the boat with him.When the crankshaft finally arrived, Ron and Polly headed home, arriving a fewdays after Christmas, 1940, nearly six months after they set out. Little hadbeen accomplished. “Throughout all this, however,” the church narrative goes,“Mr. Hubbard was continuing in his quest to answer the riddles of man.”THE COMPETING NARRATIVES of Hubbard’s life arrive at a crucial point in thequarrel over his record in the US Navy during the Second World War and theinjuries he allegedly received. He certainly longed for a military career, buthe failed the entrance examination for the US Naval Academy and was furtherdisqualified because of his poor eyesight. He lied—unnecessarily—about his agewhen he signed up for the US Marine Corps Reserve in 1930, backdating his birthby two years; this stratagem may have helped him get promoted over hiscontemporaries to first sergeant. His official record notes that he was“inactive, except for a period of active duty for training.” He requested to bedischarged the following year because “I do not have the time to devote to thewelfare of the Regiment.”Months before Pearl Harbor, however, Hubbard was once again angling to get acommission in the Navy. He gathered a number of recommendations, including onefrom his congressman, Warren G. Magnuson, who wrote to President FranklinRoosevelt, praising “Captain” Hubbard, “a well-known writer” and “a respectedexplorer,” who has “marine masters papers for more types of vessels than anyother man in the United States.… In writing organizations he is a key figure,making him politically potent nationally.” The congressman concluded: “Aninteresting trait is his distaste for personal publicity.” Senator Robert M.Ford of Washington signed his name to another letter of recommendation thatHubbard actually wrote for him: “This will introduce one of the most brilliantmen I have ever known: Captain L. Ron Hubbard.”In April 1941, his poor eyesight caused him to fail his physical once again. Butwith German U-boats attacking American shipping in the North Atlantic—and evenin American coastal waters—President Roosevelt declared a national emergency,and Hubbard’s physical shortcomings were suddenly overlooked. He received hiscommission in the Naval Reserve, as a lieutenant (junior grade), in July 1941.According to Hubbard, he got into the action right away. He said he was aboardthe destroyer USS Edsall, which was sunk off the north coast of Java. All handswere lost, except for Hubbard, who managed to get to shore and disappear intothe jungles. That is where he says he was when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harboron December 7, 1941. (Actually, the Edsall was not sunk until March 1942.)Hubbard said that he survived being machine-gunned by a Japanese patrol while hewas hiding in the area, then escaped by sailing a raft to Australia. Elsewhere,Hubbard claimed that he had been posted to the Philippines at the outbreak ofthe war with Japan, then was flown home on the Secretary of the Navy’s privateplane in the spring of 1942 as the “first U.S. returned casualty from the FarEast.”According to Navy records, however, Hubbard was training as an intelligenceofficer in New York when the war broke out. He was indeed supposed to have beenposted to the Philippines, but his ship was diverted to Australia because of theoverwhelming Japanese advance in the Pacific. There he awaited other transportto Manila, but he immediately got on the wrong side of the American navalattaché. “By assuming unauthorized authority and attempting to perform dutiesfor which he has no qualification he became the source of much trouble,” theattaché complained. “This officer is not satisfactory for independent dutyassignment. He is garrulous and tries to give impressions of his importance.” Hesent Hubbard back to the United States for further assignment.Hubbard found himself back in New York, working in the Office of the CableCensor. He agitated for a shipboard posting, and was given the opportunity tocommand a trawler that was being converted into a gunboat, the USS YP-422,designed for coastal patrol. “Upon entering the Boston Navy Yard, Ron foundhimself facing a hundred or so enlisted men, fresh from the Portsmouth NavalPrison in New Hampshire,” the church narrative goes. “A murderous looking lot,was Ron’s initial impression, ‘their braid dirty and their hammocks black withgrime.’ While on further investigation, he discovered not one among them hadstepped aboard except to save himself a prison term.” Hubbard allegedly spentsix weeks drilling this convict crew, turning them into a splendid fightingunit, “with some seventy depth charge runs to their credit and not a singlecasualty.” But according to naval records, he was relieved of command before theship was even launched, by the commandant of the Boston Navy Yard, who declaredhim “not temperamentally fitted for independent command.” There is no recordthat Hubbard saw action in the Atlantic at any time.The Navy then sent Hubbard to the Submarine Chaser Training Center in Miami. Hearrived wearing dark glasses, probably because of conjunctivitis, which plaguedhim throughout the war and after, but he explained to another young officer,Thomas Moulton, that he had been standing too close to a large-caliber gun whileserving as the gunnery officer on a destroyer in the Pacific, and the muzzleflash had damaged his eyes. Hubbard’s classmates at the sub-chaser school lookedupon him as a great authority because of his wartime adventures. That he seemedso reticent to boast about them only enhanced his standing.While he was in Miami, Hubbard contracted gonorrhea from a woman named Ginger.“She was a very loose person,” he confides in his disputed secret memoir. “I wasterrified by it, the consequences of being discovered by my wife, the navy, myfriends.… I took to dosing myself with sulfa in such quantities that I wasafraid I had affected my brain.”Wartime sexual diseases were a common affliction, and servicemen were constantlybeing cautioned about the dangers of casual romance. Although American sexualrelations were freer in practice than the popular culture admitted at the time,divorce was still sharply stigmatized; and yet, as a young man Hubbard seemed tobe constantly driven toward reckless liaisons and courtships that would destroyhis marriages and alienate his children (he would eventually father sevenchildren by three wives). He admitted in his disputed memoir that he sufferedfrom bouts of impotence, which he apparently treated with testosterone. He alsowrote of his concerns about masturbation, which at the time was considered asign of moral weakness that could also lead to many physical ailments, such asweak eyesight, impotence, and insanity.HUBBARD WAS FINALLY given another ship of his own, the USS PC-815, and herequested Moulton to join him as his executive officer. The ship was beingconstructed in Portland, Oregon, and when it was finally commissioned, in April1943, the local paper wrote about it, describing Hubbard as a “LieutenantCommander” (he was actually not yet a full lieutenant), who was “a veteransub-hunter of the battles of the Pacific and the Atlantic.” There is a photo ofHubbard and Moulton standing in front of the small ship, which was suited mainlyfor harbor patrol. Hubbard is wearing his glasses and holding a pipe in hishands, with the collar of his pea jacket turned up and a determined look on hisface. “These little sweethearts are tough,” he says of the ship. “They couldlick the pants off anything Nelson or Farragut ever sailed. They put up asizzling fight and are the only answer to the submarine menace. I stateemphatically that the future of America rests with just such escort vessels.”It is worth lingering a moment over this overblown statement. The scriptedlanguage might as well have been lifted from one of Hubbard’s pulp-fictionheroes. Hubbard must have longed to be such a figure in reality, only to bethwarted by his repeated quarrels with higher authority. Each detail Hubbardoffers—comparing himself advantageously with history’s greatest naval heroes,asserting that he holds the future of his nation in his hands—testifies to hisneed for grandeur and heroism, or at least to be seen as grand and heroic. Hewould soon be given an opportunity.The PC-815 was equipped with depth charges and sonar to detect enemy submarines.Sonar sends out pinging sounds, which, in clear water, go unanswered, butobstacles, such as enemy submarines—or fish, or debris, or even schools ofshrimp—generate echoes. The art of reading such responses is a tricky one, andalthough Hubbard had trained on the device in sub-chaser school, he had beennear the bottom of his class.He cast off from Astoria, Oregon, for his shakedown cruise on May 18, bound forSan Diego to pick up radar equipment. At 3:40 a.m., only five hours out of port,the sonar picked up an echo ten miles off Cape Lookout in a heavily traveledshipping lane. Hubbard and Moulton immediately put on headsets, trying todetermine what the object was. In particular, they were listening for thegiveaway sound of a propeller. The craft made no recognition signals that wouldhave indicated it was an American vessel. “It made noises like a submarine andit was behaving like a submarine,” Moulton later testified. “So we proceeded toattack.”“The target was moving left and away,” Hubbard wrote in his subsequent ActionReport. “The night was moonlit and the sea was flat calm.” The professionalwriter in him warmed to the narrative: “The ship, sleepy and sceptical, had cometo their guns swiftly and without error. No one, including the CommandingOfficer, could readily credit the existence of an enemy submarine here on thesteamer track.”It wasn’t crazy to think that enemy ships might be in the area. A Japanesesubmarine had bombarded an oil facility near Santa Barbara the year before.Another Japanese submarine, the intrepid I-25, had shelled Fort Stevens, at themouth of the Columbia River, not far from where Hubbard and his crew were now.The I-25 had also smuggled a disassembled seaplane to the Oregon coast inSeptember 1942, where it was put back together and used to drop incendiary bombsin the forest near Mount Emily.Shortly after the first echo, “with dawn breaking over a glassy sea,” an objectappeared on the surface. Hubbard ordered the guns to open fire. It turned out tobe a log. Hours passed. Convinced that the submarine was still out there,Hubbard ordered depth charges dropped on the elusive craft. “Great air boilswere seen and the sound of blowing tanks was reported by the soundman,” Hubbardwrote. “All guns were now manned with great attention as it was supposed thatthe sub was trying to surface.” Incredibly, a second submarine was suddenlydetected, only four hundred yards away. Hubbard radioed for assistance andadditional explosives. Other naval ships soon arrived, but they were reluctantto drop their charges on a target they couldn’t seem to locate. Hubbard wasfurious and blamed their “inexperience or unwillingness” for their failure tofollow his lead.Hubbard continued the attacks all day and into the next morning. At seven a.m.,he reported, “a boil of orange colored oil, very thick, came to the surfaceimmediately on our port bow.… Every man … then saw the periscope, moving fromright to left.” His gunners let loose. “The periscope vanished in an explosionof 20mm bullets.”After sixty-eight hours of action, Hubbard’s ship was ordered to return to port.Hubbard and Moulton claimed that they had succeeded in sinking at least one,possibly two, enemy subs. An official investigation of the incident concluded,“There was no submarine in the area.” A well-known magnetic deposit nearby mostlikely caused the echoes that were picked up on the sonar. The only evidence ofa submarine was “one bubble of air,” which might well have been the result ofthe turbulence caused by the heavy explosions. Japanese records after the warshowed that no submarines had been present off the Oregon coast at the time.1Hubbard continued to San Diego on his shakedown cruise. In June, the PC-815participated in an exercise off the coast of the Mexican state of Baja.Afterward, he ordered additional gunnery and small-arms fire, shelling SouthCoronados Island, a dry atoll that he apparently failed to realize was a part ofMexico. He was admonished for firing on an ally and relieved of his command. Hefelt unjustly treated but also remorseful about the compromised situation he hadplaced his shipmates in. “This on top of having sunk two Jap subs withoutcredit, the way my crew lied for me at the Court of Inquiry, the insults of theHigh Command, all combined to put me in the hospital with ulcers,” Hubbard notedin his disputed secret memoir. He spent the next three months in a navalhospital in San Diego. In a letter to his family he explained that he had beeninjured when he had picked up an unexploded enemy shell that had landed on deckand had blown up in midair when he tried to throw it overboard.In October, he got another assignment, this time as the navigation officer onthe cargo ship the USS Algol. The US Navy and Marines had begun their finalisland-hopping campaign before the expected invasion of Japan itself—OperationDownfall. Millions of Allied casualties were forecast. For a man who wanted tobe a hero, there would be a genuine opportunity. Instead, Hubbard requested atransfer to the School of Military Government at Princeton. “Once conversantwith the following languages, but require review: Japanese, Spanish, Chamorro,Tagalog, Peking Pidgin and Shanghai Pidgin,” Hubbard wrote in his application,adding, “Experienced in handling natives, all classes, in various parts ofworld.” Through all the carnage, the end of the war was lurching into view, andthe likely occupation of Japan was on the horizon. A polyglot such as Hubbardclaimed to be would certainly find a place in the future administration.When he arrived in Princeton, in September 1944, Hubbard fell in with a group ofscience-fiction writers who had been organized into an informal military thinktank by his friend Robert Heinlein. The Navy was looking for ways to counter thekamikaze suicide attacks on Allied ships, which had begun that fall asdesperation took hold of the Japanese military planners. Hubbard would spendweekends in Philadelphia at the Heinleins’ apartment, along with some other ofhis former colleagues, including his former editor, John Campbell, gamingdifferent scenarios for the Navy. (Some of their suggestions were actuallytested in combat, but none proved useful.) Heinlein was extremely solicitous ofhis old friend, remarking, “Ron had had a busy war—sunk four times and woundedagain and again.” The fact that Hubbard had an affair with Heinlein’s wifedidn’t seem to affect his deep regard. “He almost forced me to sleep with hiswife,” Hubbard later marveled.There was another lissome young woman hanging around with the science-fictioncrowd: Vida Jameson, whose father, Malcolm, was a part of the Campbell group ofAstounding writers. “Quiet, shy little greymouse,” one of the crowd describedVida, “with great soulful black eyes and a habit of listening.” She wastwenty-eight, and already selling stories to the Saturday Evening Post, a morerespectable literary endeavor than the pulps. Hubbard proposed to her. She knewhe was married and refused his offer; still, she was captivated by him andcontinued her relationship with him until after the war.Hubbard graduated from the School of Military Government in January 1945, andwas ordered to proceed to Monterey, California, to join a civil affairs team,which would soon follow the invading forces. The Battle of Okinawa, in southernJapan, got under way that spring, creating the highest number of casualties inthe Pacific Theater. Kamikaze attacks were at their peak. American troopssuffered more than 60,000 casualties in less than three months. Japanese forceswere fighting to the death. The savagery and scale of the combat has rarely beenequaled.Once again, Hubbard stood on the treacherous precipice, where the prospect ofheroic action awaited him—or else indignity, or a death that would be obscuredby the deaths of tens of thousands of others. One month after the invasion ofOkinawa, Hubbard was admitted to the Oak Knoll Naval Hospital in Oakland,California, complaining of stomach pains.This is a key moment in the narrative of Dianetics and Scientology. “Blindedwith injured optic nerves and lame with physical injuries to hip and back at theend of World War II, I faced an almost nonexistent future,” Hubbard writes ofhimself during this period. “I was abandoned by my family and friends as asupposedly hopeless cripple.” Hubbard says he healed himself of his traumaticinjuries, using techniques that would become the foundation of Dianetics andScientology. “I had no one to help me; what I had to know I had to find out,” herecalled. “And it’s quite a trick studying when you cannot see.”Doctors at Oak Knoll were never sure exactly what was wrong with him, except fora recurrence of his ulcer. In records of Hubbard’s many physical examinationsand X-rays, the doctors make no note of scars or evidence of wounds, nor do hismilitary records show that he was ever injured during the war.In the hospital, Hubbard says, he was also given a psychiatric examination. Tohis alarm, the doctor wrote two pages of notes. “And I was watching this, youknow, saying, ‘Well, have I gone nuts, after all?’ ” He conspired to take a lookat the records to see what the doctor had written. “I got to the end and itsaid, ‘In short, this officer has no neurotic or psychotic tendencies of anykind whatsoever.’ ” (There is no psychiatric evaluation contained in Hubbard’smedical records.)POLLY AND THE TWO CHILDREN had spent the war waiting for Ron on their plot inPort Orchard, but there was no joyous homecoming. “My wife left me while I wasin a hospital with ulcers,” Hubbard noted. “It was a terrible blow when she leftme for I was ill and without prospects.”Soon after leaving the hospital, Hubbard towed a house trailer behind an oldPackard to Southern California, where so many ambitious and rootless members ofhis generation were seeking their destiny. There was a proliferation of exoticnew religions in America and many other countries, caused by the tumult of warand disruptions of progress that older denominations weren’t prepared to solve.Southern California was filled with migrants who weren’t tied to old creeds andwere ready to experiment with new ways of thinking. The region was swarming withTheosophists, Rosicrucians, Zoroastrians, and Vedantists. Swamis, mystics, andgurus of many different faiths pulled acolytes into their orbits.The most brilliant member of this galaxy of occultists was John WhitesideParsons, known as Jack, a rocket scientist working at what would later becomethe Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Technical Institute. (Parsons,who has a crater on the Moon named after him, developed solid rocket fuel.)Darkly handsome and brawny, later called by some scholars the “James Dean of theoccult,” Parsons was a science-fiction fan and an outspoken advocate of freelove. He acquired a three-story Craftsman-style mansion, with a twelve-cargarage, at 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue in Pasadena—a sedate, palm-linedstreet known as Millionaires Row. The house had once belonged to Arthur H.Fleming, a logging tycoon and philanthropist, who had hosted former presidentTheodore Roosevelt, John Muir, and Albert Einstein in its oval dining room. Thestreet had also been home to William Wrigley, of the chewing-gum fortune, andthe beer baron Adolph Busch, whose widow still lived next door.She must have been appalled to watch as Parsons divided the historic home andthe coach house behind it into nineteen apartments, then advertised for renters.He sought artists, anarchists, and musicians—the more Bohemian the better. “Mustnot believe in God,” the ad stated. Among those passing through the “Parsonage”were an aging actress from the silent movie era, an opera singer, severalastrologers, an ex-convict, and the chief engineer for the development of theatomic bomb. A number of children from various alliances constantly racedthrough the house. Parsons threw parties that featured “women in diaphanousgowns,” as one visitor observed, who “would dance around a pot of fire,surrounded by coffins topped with candles.” Parsons turned the mansion into theheadquarters of the Agapé Lodge, a branch of the Ordo Templi Orientis, a secretfraternal organization dedicated to witchcraft and sexual “magick,” based on thewritings of the notorious British writer and provocateur Aleister Crowley, whoseglowering countenance was captured in a portrait hanging in the stairwell.Despite the bizarre atmosphere that he cultivated, Parsons took his involvementin the OTO seriously, making brazen ethical claims for his movement—claims thatwould sound familiar when Scientology arose only a few years later. “The breakupof the home and family, the confusion in problems of morals and behavior, thefrustration of the individual need for love, self-expression and freedom, andthe immanence of the total destruction of western civilization all indicate theneed for a basic reexamination and alteration of individual and social values,”Parsons writes in a brief manifesto. “Mature investigation on the part ofphilosophers and social scientists have [sic] indicated the existence of onlyone force of sufficient power to solve these problems and effect the necessarychanges, and that is the force of a new religion.”TWENTY-ONE-YEAR-OLD SARA ELIZABETH “BETTY” NORTHRUP, Parsons’s feisty mistress,was the younger sister of his wife, who had run off with another man. Sara wastall, blond, buxom, and wild, often claiming to have lost her virginity at theage of ten. “Her chief interest in life is amusement,” one of the boardersobserved. But she was also quick and intelligent and full of joy, delightingeveryone around her. She had become involved with Parsons, who was ten yearsolder, when she was fifteen. Her parents tolerated the relationship; in fact,her indulgent father helped bankroll the Parsonage, which Sara purchased jointlywith Parsons while she was still a teenager. One evening Robert Heinleinappeared at the house, bringing along his friend L. Ron Hubbard, who was wearingdark glasses and carrying a silver-handled cane. “He was not only a writer buthe was a captain of a ship that had been downed in the Pacific and he was weekson a raft and had been blinded by the sun and his back had been broken,” Saralater recalled. “I believed everything he said.”A few months later, Hubbard moved in. He made an immediate, vivid impression onthe other boarders. “He dominated the scene with his wit and inexhaustible fundof anecdotes,” one of the boarders, Alva Rogers, later recalled. “Unfortunately,Ron’s reputation for spinning tall tales (both off and on the printed page) madefor a certain degree of skepticism in the minds of his audience. At any rate, hetold one hell of a good story.” Like Hubbard, Rogers had red hair, and he wasintrigued by Hubbard’s theory that redheads are the living remnant of theNeanderthals.Hubbard invited one of his paramours from New York, Vida Jameson, to join him atthe Parsonage, with the ostensible task of keeping the books. It’s a testimonyto his allure that she came all the way across America to be with him, althoughsoon after she arrived, she discovered that she had been displaced.The other boarders watched in astonishment as Hubbard worked his charms on theavailable women in the household, before setting his sights on “the mostgorgeous, intelligent, sweet, wonderful girl,” as another envious suitordescribed Sara Northrup. “There he was, living off Parsons’ largesse and makingout with his girlfriend right in front of him. Sometimes when the two of themwere sitting at the table together, the hostility was almost tangible.”Enlivened, no doubt, by their rivalry over Sara, Parsons and Hubbard quicklydeveloped a highly competitive relationship. They liked to begin their morningswith a bout of fencing in the living room.Parsons struggled with his feelings of jealousy, which were at war with hisphilosophy of free love. He could understand Northrup’s attraction to the newboarder, describing Hubbard in a letter to Crowley in 1946 as “a gentleman, redhair, green eyes, honest and intelligent.… He moved in with me about two monthsago.” Then Parsons admits, “Although Betty and I are still friendly, she hastransferred her sexual affections to Ron.” He went on to admire Hubbard’ssupernatural abilities. “Although he has no formal training in Magick, he has anextraordinary amount of experience and understanding in the field. From some ofhis experiences I deduced that he is in direct touch with some higherintelligence, possibly his Guardian Angel. He describes his Angel as a beautifulwinged woman with red hair whom he calls the Empress and who has guided himthrough his life and saved him many times.”The extent to which Scientology was influenced by Hubbard’s involvement with theOTO has long been a matter of angry debate. There is little trace in Hubbard’slife of organized religion or spiritual philosophy. In the Parsonage, he wasdrawn into an obscure and stigmatized creed, based on the writings and practiceof Crowley—the “Great Beast,” as he called himself—who gloried in being one ofthe most reviled men of his era. The Church of Scientology explicitly rejectsany connection between Crowley’s thinking and Hubbard’s emerging philosophy; yetthe two men were similar in striking ways. Like Hubbard, Crowley reveled in alife of constant physical, spiritual, and sexual exploration. He was a daring,even reckless mountaineer, and his exploits included several failed attempts toclimb the world’s most formidable peaks. He, too, was a prolific writer whoauthored novels and plays as well as books on magic and mysticism. Boisterousand highly self-regarding, he had been kicked out of an occult society calledthe Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn after feuding with some of its mostprominent members, including William Butler Yeats, whom Crowley accused of beingenvious of his talent as a poet. He may have served as a British spy whileliving in America during World War I, despite the fact that he was constantlypublishing anti-British propaganda. Crowley relied on opiates and hallucinogensto enhance his spiritual pursuits. During an excursion to Cairo in 1904, hediscovered his Holy Guardian Angel, a disembodied spirit named Aiwass, whoclaimed to be a messenger from the Egyptian god Horus. Crowley said that over aperiod of three days, Aiwass dictated to him an entire cosmology titled The Bookof the Law, the main principle of which was, “Do what thou wilt shall be thewhole of the law.”Nibs—Hubbard’s estranged eldest son and namesake, L. Ron Hubbard, Jr. (he laterchanged his name to Ronald DeWolf)—claimed that his father had read the bookwhen he was sixteen years old and developed a lifelong allegiance to blackmagic. “What a lot of people don’t realize is that Scientology is black magicjust spread out over a long time period,” he contended. “Black magic is theinner core of Scientology—and it is probably the only part of Scientology thatreally works.”One striking parallel between Hubbard and Crowley is the latter’s assertion that“spiritual progress did not depend on religious or moral codes, but was like anyother science.” Crowley argued that by advancing through a graded series ofrituals and spiritual teachings, the adept could hope to make it across “TheAbyss,” which he defined as “the gulf existing between individual and cosmicconsciousness.” It is an image that Hubbard would evoke in his Bridge to TotalFreedom.Although Hubbard mentions Crowley only glancingly in a lecture—calling him “myvery good friend”—they never actually met. Crowley died in 1947 at the age ofseventy-two. “That’s when Dad decided that he would take over the mantle of theBeast and that is the seed and the beginning of Dianetics and Scientology,” Nibslater said. “It was his goal to be the most powerful being in the universe.”JACK PARSONS EXPERIMENTED with Crowley’s rituals, taking them in his owneccentric direction. His personal brand of witchcraft centered on the adorationof female carnality, an interest Hubbard evidently shared. Parsons recorded inhis journal that Hubbard had a vision of “a savage and beautiful woman ridingnaked on a great cat-like beast.” That became the inspiration for Parsons’s mostaudacious mystical experiment. He appointed Hubbard to be his “scribe” in aceremony called the “Babalon Working.” It was based on Crowley’s notion that thesupreme goal of the magician’s art was to create a “moonchild”—a creatureforetold in one of Crowley’s books who becomes the Antichrist. Night afternight, Parsons and Hubbard invoked the spirit world in a quest to summon up a“Scarlet Woman,” the female companion who would play the role of Parsons’sconsort. The ceremony, likely aided by narcotics and hallucinogens, requiredHubbard to channel the female deity of Babalon as Parsons performed the“invocation of wand with material basis on talisman”—in other words,masturbating on a piece of parchment. He typically invoked twice a night.Parsons records that during one of these evenings a candle was forcibly knockedout of Hubbard’s hand: “We observed a brownish yellow light about seven feethigh in the kitchen. I brandished a magical sword and it disappeared. His rightarm was paralyzed for the rest of the night.” On another occasion, he writes,Hubbard saw the astral projection of one of Parsons’s enemies manifest himselfin a black robe. “Ron promptly launched an attack and pinned the phantom figureto the door with four throwing knives.”Evidently, the spirits relented. One day, an attractive young woman namedMarjorie Cameron showed up at the Parsonage. Parsons later claimed that a boltof lightning had struck outside, followed by a knock at the door. A beautifulwoman was standing there. She had been in a traffic accident. “I don’t knowwhere I am or where I’ve come from,” she told him. (Cameron’s version is thatshe had been interested in the stories of the naked women jumping over fires inthe garden, and she persuaded a friend who was boarding at the Parsonage to takeher for a visit.) “I have my elemental!” Parsons exclaimed in a note to Crowleya few days later. “She has red hair and slant green eyes as specified.… She isan artist, strong minded and determined, with strong masculine characteristicsand a fanatical independence.”The temple was lit with candles, the room suffused with incense, andRachmaninoff’s “Isle of the Dead” was playing in the background. Dressed in ahooded white robe, and carrying a lamp, Hubbard intoned, “Display thyself to OurLady; dedicate thy organs to Her, dedicate thy heart to Her, dedicate thy mindto Her, dedicate thy soul to Her, for She shall absorb thee, and thou shaltbecome living flame before She incarnates.” Whereupon Parsons and Cameronresponded, “Glory unto the Scarlet Woman, Babalon, the Mother of Abominations,that rideth upon the Beast.” Then, as Hubbard continued the incantation, Parsonsand Cameron consummated the ceremony upon the altar. This same ritual went onfor three nights in a row. Afterward, Parsons wrote to Crowley, “Instructionswere received direct through Ron, the seer.… I am to act as instructor guardianguide for nine months; then it will be loosed on the world.”Crowley was unimpressed. “Apparently Parsons or Hubbard or somebody is producinga Moonchild,” he complained to another follower. “I get fairly frantic when Icontemplate the idiocy of these goats.” Cameron did become pregnant, but got anabortion, with Parsons’s consent, so it’s unclear exactly what this ceremony wasdesigned to produce. (Parsons and Cameron later married and aborted anotherpregnancy.) Nonetheless, Parsons asserted that the ritual had been a success.“Babalon is incarnate upon the earth today, awaiting the proper hour for hermanifestation,” he wrote after the ceremony. “And in that day my work will beaccomplished, and I shall be blown away upon the Breath of the father.”Until that apocalypse occurred, Hubbard and Parsons decided, they would go intobusiness together. The plan was for Hubbard to purchase yachts in Florida, sailthem through the Panama Canal to California, and resell them at a profit.Parsons and Sara sold the Parsonage and handed over the money to Hubbard—morethan twenty thousand dollars from Parsons alone. Hubbard and Northrup promptlyleft for Miami.While in Florida, Hubbard appealed to the Veterans Administration for anincrease in his medical disability. He was already receiving compensation forhis ulcers, amounting to $11.50 per month. “I cannot tolerate a generaldiet—results in my having to abandon my old profession as a ship master andexplorer, and seriously hampers me as a writer.” He said his eyesight had beenaffected by “prolonged exposure to tropical sunlight,” incurred while he was inthe service, which caused a chronic case of conjunctivitis. He also complainedthat he was lame from a bone infection, which he theorized must have occurred bythe abrupt change in climate when he was shipped to the East Coast. “My earningpower, due to injuries, all service connected, has dropped to nothing,” hesummed up. Sara Northrup added a handwritten note of support. “I have know [sic]Lafayette Ronald Hubbard for many years,” she claimed. “I see no chance of hiscondition improving to a point where he can regain his old standards. He isbecoming steadily worse, his health impaired again by economic worries.”Parsons grew to believe that Hubbard and Sara had other plans for his money, andhe flew to Miami to confront them. When he learned that they had just sailedaway, he performed a “Banishing Ritual,” invoking Bartzabel, a magical figureassociated with Mars. According to Parsons, a sudden squall arose, ripping thesails off the ship that Hubbard was captaining, forcing him to limp back toport. Sara’s memory was that she and Ron were on their way to California, whenthey were caught in a hurricane in the Panama Canal. The ship was too damaged tocontinue the voyage. Parsons gained a judgment against the couple, but declinedto press criminal charges, possibly because his sexual relationship with Sarahad begun while she was still below the age of consent, and she threatened toretaliate. Hubbard’s friends were alarmed, both about his business dealings withParsons and his romance with Sara. “Keep him at arm’s length,” Robert Heinleinwarned a mutual friend. His wife, Virginia, regarded Ron as “a very sad case ofpost-war breakdown,” and Sara as Hubbard’s “latest Man-Eating Tigress.”Sara repeatedly refused Ron’s entreaties to marry him, but he threatened to killhimself unless she relented. She still saw him as a broken war hero whom shecould mend. Finally, she said, “All right, I’ll marry you, if that’s going tosave you.” They awakened a minister in Chestertown, Maryland, on August 10,1946. The minister’s wife and housekeeper served as witnesses to the wedding.The news ricocheted among Hubbard’s science-fiction colleagues. “I suppose Pollywas tiresome about not giving him his divorce so he could marry six other galswho were all hot & moist over him,” one of Hubbard’s writer friends, L. Spraguede Camp, wrote to the Heinleins. (In fact, Polly didn’t learn of the marriagetill the following year, when she read about it in the newspapers.) “How manygirls is a man entitled to in one lifetime, anyway?” de Camp fumed. “Maybe heshould be reincarnated as a rabbit.”The Church of Scientology admits that Hubbard was involved with Parsons and theOTO, characterizing it, however, as a secret mission for naval intelligence. Thechurch claims that the government had been worried about top Americanscientists—including some from Los Alamos, where the atom bomb was developed—whomade a habit of staying with Parsons when they visited California. Hubbard’smission was to penetrate and subvert the organization.“Mr. Hubbard accomplished the assignment,” the church maintains. “He engineereda business investment that tied up the money Parsons used to fund the group’sactivities, thus making it unavailable to Parsons for his occult pursuits.”Hubbard, the church claims, “broke up black magic in America.”EVEN IF HUBBARD WAS a government spy, as the church claims, the availablerecords show him at what must have been his lowest point in the years just afterthe war. His physical examination at the Veterans Administration in Los Angelesin September 1946 notes, “No work since discharge. Lives on his savings.” (TheVA eventually increased his disability to forty percent.) Sara noticed that hewas having nightmares. That winter, they moved into a lighthouse on a frozenlake in the Poconos near Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. It was an unsettling timefor Sara; they were isolated, and Ron had a .45 pistol that he would firerandomly. Late one night, while she was in bed and Ron was typing, he hit heracross the face with the pistol. He told her that she had been smiling in hersleep, so she must have been thinking about someone else. “I got up and left thehouse in the night and walked on the ice of the lake because I was terrified,”Sara said in 1997, in an account she dictated shortly before she died. She wasso shocked and humiliated she didn’t know how to respond.Ron had begun beating her in Florida, shortly after her father died. Her griefseemed to provoke Ron—she assumed it was because she wasn’t being who he neededher to be. No one had ever struck her before. She recognized now how dangeroustheir relationship was; on the other hand, Ron’s need for her was so stark. Hehad been blocked for a long time, and Sara had been churning out plots for him,and actually writing some of his stories. Ron worried that he would never writeagain. He frequently threatened suicide. Sara didn’t believe in divorce—it was aterrible stigma at the time—and she still thought she could save Ron. “I keptthinking that he must be suffering or he wouldn’t act that way.” And so, shewent back to him.Ron took a loan and bought a house trailer, and he and Sara drove across thecountry to Port Orchard, where his parents and his undivorced first wife andchildren were living. Sara had no idea why people treated her so strangely,until finally Hubbard’s son Nibs told her that his parents were still married.Once again, Sara fled. Ron found her waiting for the ferry that was leaving forCalifornia. The engines of the ship grumbled as Ron hastily pleaded his case. Hetold her that he really was getting a divorce. He claimed that an attorney hadassured him that he and Sara actually were legally married. Finally, the ferryleft without her.Soon after that, Ron and Sara set out for Hollywood. They got as far as Ojai,California, where Ron was arrested for failing to make payments on the housetrailer they were living in.In October 1947, Hubbard sent the VA an alarming and revealing plea:I am utterly unable to approach anything like my own competence. My lastphysician informed me that it might be very helpful if I were to be examined andperhaps treated psychiatrically or even by a psychoanalyst.… I avoided out ofpride any mental examinations, hoping that time would balance a mind which I hadevery reason to suppose was seriously affected.… I cannot, myself, afford suchtreatment.Would you please help me?Nothing came of this request. There is no record that the VA conducted apsychological assessment of Hubbard. Throughout his life, however, questionswould arise about his sanity. Russell Miller, a British biographer, tracked downan ex-lover of Hubbard’s, who described him as “a manic depressive with paranoidtendencies.” The woman, whom Miller called “Barbara Kaye” (her real name wasBarbara Klowden), later became a psychologist. She added, “He said he alwayswanted to found a religion like Moses or Jesus.” A man who later worked in thechurch as Hubbard’s medical officer, Jim Dincalci, listed his traits: “Paranoidpersonality. Delusions of grandeur. Pathological lying.” Dr. Stephen Wiseman, aprofessor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of British Columbia,who has been a prominent critic of Scientology, speculated that a possiblediagnosis of Hubbard’s personality would be “malignant narcissism,” which hecharacterizes as “a highly insecure individual protecting himself withaggressive grandiosity, disavowal of any and every need from others, antisocialorientation, and a heady and toxic mix of rage/anger/aggression/violence andparanoia.”And yet, if Hubbard was paranoid, it was also true that he really was oftenpursued, first by creditors and later by grand juries and governmentinvestigators. He may have had delusions of grandeur, as so many critics say,but he did in fact make an undeniable mark on the world, publishing many bestsellers and establishing a religion that endures decades after his death.Grandiosity might well be a feature of a personality that could accomplish suchfeats.A fascinating glimpse into Hubbard’s state of mind during this time is found inwhat I am calling his secret memoir. The church claims that the document is aforgery. It was produced by the former archivist for the Church of Scientology,Gerald Armstrong, in a 1984 suit that the church brought against him. Armstrongread some portions of them into the record over the strong objections of thechurch attorneys; others later found their way onto the Internet. The church nowmaintains that Hubbard did not write this document, although when it was enteredinto evidence, the church’s lawyers made no such representation, saying that thepapers were intensely private, “constitute a kind of self-therapy,” and did notreflect Hubbard’s actual condition.This disputed document has been called the Affirmations, or the Admissions, butit is rather difficult to define. In part, the thirty pages constitute a highlyintimate autobiography, dealing with the most painful episodes in Hubbard’slife. Many of the references to people and events made in these pages aresupported by other documents. It appears that Hubbard is using techniques onhimself that he would later develop into Dianetics. He explores memories thatpose impediments in his mental and spiritual progress, and he prescribesaffirmations or incantations to counter the psychological influence of theseevents. These statements would certainly be the most revealing and intimatedisclosures Hubbard ever made about himself.There are three sections in this document, each of which seems to have adifferent purpose.The first section is called “Course I.” This is what I have termed the secretmemoir, as it contains reflections on the most embarrassing or troublingfeatures of Hubbard’s biography. “The purpose of this experiment is tore-establish the ambition, willpower, desire to survive, the talent andconfidence of myself,” Hubbard declares straightforwardly at the start. “I wasalways anxious about people’s opinion of me and was afraid I would bore them.This injected anxiety and careless speed into my work. I must be convinced thatI can write skillfully and well.” Those who criticize his work are fools, hewrites. “I must be convinced I have succeeded in writing and with ease willregain my popularity, which actually was not small.”“My service record was none too glorious,” he admits. He also confesses hisshame about his frequent affairs. But he is intent on succeeding in hisrelationship with Sara, whom he describes as “young, beautiful, desirable.”Unfortunately, he is handicapped by bouts of impotence. “I want her always. ButI am 13 years older than she. She is heavily sexed. My libido is so low I hardlyadmire her naked.”Sex preoccupies him. He’s worried about his “very bad masturbatory history,” hissexual diseases, and his impotence, which he had been treating with testosteronesupplements. “By eliminating certain fears of hypnosis, curing my rheumatism andlaying off hormones, I hope to restore my former libido. I must!”Through self-hypnosis, he hopes to convince himself of certain prescriptivemantras, including:I can write.My mind is still brilliant.That masturbation was no sin or crime.That I do not need to have ulcers anymore.That I am fortunate in losing Polly and my parents, for they never meant well byme.That I believe in my gods and spiritual things.That my magical work is powerful and effective.That the numbers 7, 25, and 16 are not unlucky or evil for me.That I am not bad to look upon.That I am not susceptible to colds.That Sara is always beautiful to me.That these words and commands are like fire and will sear themselves into everycorner of my being, making me happy and well and confident forever!The second part of the document, labeled “Course II,” included the statementsthat have come to be called Affirmations, although Hubbard refers to them asincantations. He had recently gotten a new recorder for dictation, called aSoundScriber. It may be that he recorded this portion and played it back tohimself as a means of self-hypnosis. This section begins with the command “Youare asleep.”In this lesson, Hubbard tells himself, he will learn several important things:You have no urge to talk about your navy life. You do not like to talk of it.You never illustrate your point with bogus stories. It is not necessary for youto lie to be amusing and witty.You like to have your intimate friends approve of and love you for what you are.This desire to be loved does not amount to a psychosis.You can sing beautifully.Nothing can intervene between you and your Guardian. She cannot be displacedbecause she is too powerful. She does not control you. She advises you.You will never forget these incantations. They are holy and are now become anintegral part of your nature.Material things are yours for the asking. Men are your slaves.You are not sleepy or tired ever.… Your Guardian alone can talk to you as yousleep but she may not hypnotize you. Only you can hypnotize yourself.The desires of other people have no hypnotic effect on you.Nothing, no one opposes your writing.… You can carry on a wild social life andstill write one hundred thousand words a month or more.… Your writing has a deephypnotic effect on people.You will make fortunes writing.Your psychology is advanced and true and wonderful. It hypnotizes people. Itpredicts their emotions, for you are their ruler.You will live to be 200 years old.You will always look young.You have no doubts about God.You are not a coward.Your eyes are getting progressively better. They became bad when you used themas an excuse to escape the naval academy. You have no reason to keep them bad.Your stomach trouble you used as an excuse to keep the Navy from punishing you.You are free of the Navy.Your hip is a pose. You have a sound hip. It never hurts. Your shoulder neverhurts.Your foot was an alibi. The injury is no longer needed.Testosterone blends easily with your own hormones.… You have no fear of what anywoman may think of your bed conduct. You know you are a master. You know theywill be thrilled. You can come many times without weariness.… Many women are notcapable of pleasure in sex and anything adverse they say or do has no effectwhatever upon your pleasure.You have no fear if they conceive. What if they do? You do not care. Pour itinto them and let fate decide.You can tell all the romantic tales you wish.… But you know which ones werelies.… You have enough real experience to make anecdotes forever. Stick to yourtrue adventures.Money will flood in upon you.Self pity and conceit are not wrong. Your mother was in error.Masturbation does not injure or make insane. Your parents were in error.Everyone masturbates.The most thrilling thing in your life is your love and consciousness of yourGuardian.She has copper red hair, long braids, a lovely Venusian face, a white gownbelted with jade squares. She wears gold slippers.You can talk with her and audibly hear her voice above all others.You can do automatic writing whenever you wish. You do not care what comes outon the paper when your Guardian dictates.The red-haired Guardian Hubbard visualizes so vividly is a kind of ideal mother,who also functions as his muse and is the source of his astoundingly rapidwriting. Hubbard loves her but reassures himself that his Guardian does notcontrol him. In all things, he is the controlling force. She seems to be anartifact of the influence of Aleister Crowley. Jack Parsons had said thatHubbard called his Guardian “the Empress.”His fear of hypnotism is quite striking. He was an accomplished stage hypnotist,a skill he displayed at a meeting of a group of sci-fi fans in Los Angeles, whenhe put nearly everyone in the audience into a trance, and persuaded one of themthat he was holding a pair of miniature kangaroos in the palm of his hand. Healso once tried to hypnotize Sara’s mother, after she had a stroke, to persuadeher to leave her money to him. But then he would accuse Sara of hypnotizing himin his sleep.If one looks behind the Affirmations to the conditions they are meant tocorrect, one sees a man who is ashamed of his tendency to fabricate personalstories, who is conflicted about his sexual needs, and who worries about hismortality. He has a predatory view of women but at the same time fears theirpower to humiliate him.The third and final section of this document is titled “The Book.” It contains achecklist of personal goals and compliments he pays to himself, but it is also aportrait of the superman that he wishes to be. He does make mention of an actualbook—he calls it One Commandment—that seems to be a reference to Excalibur. “Itfreed you forever from the fears of the material world and gave you materialcontrol over people,” he writes.You are radiant like sunlight.You can read music.You are a magnificent writer who has thrilled millions.Ability to drop into a trance state at will.Lack of necessity of following a pulp pattern.You did a fine job in the Navy. No one there is now “out to get you.”You are psychic.You do not masturbate.You do not know anger. Your patience is infinite.Snakes are not dangerous to you. There are no snakes in the bottom of your bed.You believe implicitly in God. You have no doubts of the All Powerful. Youbelieve your Guardian perfectly.The judge in the Armstrong suit, where this document was presented as evidence,offered his own amateur diagnosis of Hubbard’s personality in a crushingdecision against the church:The organization is clearly schizophrenic and paranoid, and this bizarrecombination seems to be a reflection of its founder LRH. The evidence portrays aman who has been virtually a pathological liar when it comes to his history,background, and achievements. The writings and documents in evidenceadditionally reflect his egoism, greed, avarice, lust for power, andvindictiveness and aggressiveness against persons perceived by him to bedisloyal or hostile. At the same time it appears that he is charismatic andhighly capable of motivating, organizing, controlling, manipulating, andinspiring his adherents.… Obviously, he is and has been a very complex person,and that complexity is further reflected in his alter ego, the Church ofScientology.IN 1948, ten years after his first attempt to establish himself as ascreenwriter, Hubbard had returned to Hollywood, setting up shop as a freelanceguru. “I went right down in the middle of Hollywood, I rented an office, got ahold of a nurse, wrapped a towel around my head and became a swami,” Hubbardlater said. “I used to sit in my penthouse on Sunset Boulevard and write storiesfor New York and then go to my office in the studio and have my secretary telleverybody I was in conference while I caught up on my sleep,” he recalled onanother occasion. He painted a far different picture in a letter to the VeteransAdministration, which was demanding reimbursement for an overpayment: “I cannotimagine how to repay this $51.00 as I am nearly penniless and have but $28.50 tolast me for nearly a month to come,” he writes. “My expenditures consist of $27a month trailer rent and $80 a month food for my wife and self which includesgas, cigarettes and all incidentals. I am very much in debt and have not beenable to get a job.” Instead of repaying the VA, he boldly asks for a loan.In Hollywood, Hubbard began perfecting techniques that he first developed in thenaval hospital and that later became Dianetics. He boasts to Hays, “Been amusingmyself making a monkey out of Freud. I always knew he was nutty but didn’t havea firm case.” He adds that he has been conducting research on inferioritycomplexes: “Nightly had people writhing in my Hollywood office, sending guys outtwice as tall as superman.” For the first time, he floats the idea of a book,which he tentatively titles An Introduction to Traumatic Psychology. He thinksit will require about six weeks to write. “I got to revolutionize this herefield because nobody in it, so far as I can tell, knows his anatomy from agopher hole.”Hubbard was casting around for a new direction in his life. He took up acting atthe Geller Theater Workshop, paid for in part by the VA, but that didn’t satisfyhim. There was a larger plan stirring in his imagination. “I was hiding behindthe horrible secret. And that is I was trying to find out what the mind was allabout,” he recalls. “I couldn’t even tell my friends; they didn’t understand.They said, ‘Here’s Hubbard, he’s leading a perfectly wonderful life. He gets toassociate with movie actresses. He knows hypnotism and so has no trouble witheditors. He has apartments and stuff.’ ”IT WAS THE LARVAL STAGE of Hubbard’s astonishing transformation—from thedepressed, rejected, impoverished, creatively exhausted figure he paints in theAffirmations, to his nearly overnight success as a thinker and founder of aninternational movement when his book Dianetics was finally published. He wrotehis friend Robert Heinlein, “I will soon, I hope give you a book risen from theashes of the old Excalibur which details in full the mathematics of the humanmind, solves all the problems of the ages, and gives six recipes foraphrodisiacs and plays the mouth organ with the left foot.” He writes a littleabout recovering from the war, then remarks, “The main difficulty these days isgetting sane again. I find out that I am making progress. Of course there isalways the danger that I will get too sane to write.” He is angling for aGuggenheim grant for his book on psychology. Meantime, he was so pressedfinancially that he begged Heinlein for a loan of fifty dollars. “Golly, I neverwas so many places in print with less to show for it,” Hubbard complained. “Icouldn’t buy a stage costume for Gypsy Rose Lee.”Hubbard was writing these letters from Savannah, Georgia, in the waning days of1948 and the spring of 1949. He said he was volunteering in a psychiatric clinicat St. Joseph’s Medical Center, “getting case histories at the request of theAmerican Psychiatric Assoc.” It is a shadowy period in his life, but it was inSavannah that he began to sketch out the principles that would form the basis ofhis understanding of the human mind. He claimed to be getting phenomenal resultson nearly every malady he addressed. “One week ago I brought in my first asthmacure,” he writes to Heinlein. “I have an arthritis to finish tomorrow and so itgoes.”It’s unclear whether Hubbard himself was receiving treatment in Savannah. “Myhip and stomach and side are well again,” he writes to Heinlein, adding that heis “straightening out the kinks that have held down production on the moneymachine.”In his letters, Hubbard continually speculates about the book he hopes to finishsoon. “It ain’t agin religion,” he boasts to Heinlein. “It just abolishes it.…It’s science, boy, science.” He makes a vague reference to the research he’sperforming on children. “This hellbroth I cooked up works remarkably well onkids,” he remarks. “Took a scared little kid that was supposed to be stupid andwas failing everything and worked on him about thirty-five hours just to makesure. That was last month. So now he turns up this afternoon with all A’s andall of a sudden reading Shakespeare.” He was also noting improvement in himself,both in his work and in his recovered sexual powers. “I am cruising on fourhours sleep a night. But the most interesting thing is, I’m up to eight comes.In an evening, that is.”Heinlein was eager for details. Hubbard responded by outlining what he wouldlater call the Tone Scale. It describes the range of human emotional states,from one to four. At bottom, there is Apathy, then Anger. These lower tones weregoverned by the unconscious, which Hubbard says should be called the “reactivemind.” The third level, which was as yet untitled, is the normal state for mostof humanity; and the fourth is a condition of happiness and industriousness.Hubbard’s experimental technique aimed at raising an individual out of the lowertones and into the superior state of the fourth tone. His method, as hedescribed it to Heinlein, was to drain off the painful experiences andassociations that an individual has accumulated in his lifetime. Once that’sdone, “astonishing results take place.” Asthma, headaches, arthritis, menstrualcramps, astigmatism, and ulcers simply disappear. There is a huge boost incompetence. The reactive mind is eliminated, and the rational mind takes over.At the end of April 1949, Hubbard sent a note to Heinlein that he was moving toWashington, DC, for an indefinite stay. There was no word about Sara. Threeweeks later, the thirty-eight-year-old Hubbard applied for a license inWashington to marry twenty-six-year-old Ann Jensen. The application was canceledthe next day at the request of the bride. Perhaps she had learned that Hubbardwas already married to his second wife and had previously committed bigamy. Inany case, Ann Jensen’s name disappears from Hubbard’s life story.He and Sara moved to Elizabeth, New Jersey, where John Campbell, Hubbard’seditor at Astounding Science-Fiction before the war, resided. Campbell visitedHubbard often and became one of his first and most important converts. “Dammit,the man’s got something—and something big,” he wrote excitedly to Heinlein.Campbell underwent the treatment, which employed “deep hypnosis.” In thatentranced state, Campbell was able to retrieve traumatic memories of his birth.“I was born with a cord wrapped around my neck, strangling me,” he recounted toHeinlein. The doctor who delivered him, whom Campbell now remembered had aGerman accent, had barked at Campbell’s mother, saying, “You must stopfighting—you are killing him. Relax!” Later, the doctor put some corrosivemedication in the baby’s eyes, and said, “You’ll forget all about this in alittle while.” Campbell characterized these instructions as “unshakeablepost-hypnotic commands of tremendous force,” which governed much of hissubsequent behavior. “The neighbor bratlings could tease me unmercifully—anddid—because I couldn’t fight,” he told Heinlein; his mother would often attemptto console him by telling him that he would forget the painful experiences ofhis childhood soon enough, with the result that many of the most importantmoments of his life were lost to him. “Ron’s technique consists of bringingthese old memories into view, and then erasing the memory,” Campbell explained.He writes that although he now doesn’t remember his actual birth, he doesremember retrieving it and relating it to Hubbard, who then erased the realmemory, with its painful associations, leaving Campbell with the experience ofknowing what happened to him without actually having the memory continue itssinister influence. Obviously, the line between a real memory and an implantedone, or a confabulation, was very difficult to draw.This was the most potent medicine ever discovered, Campbell continued, but alsothe most dangerous weapon imaginable if not properly handled. “With theknowledge I now have, I could turn most ordinary people into homicidal maniacswithin one hour.” And yet, as an editor, Campbell recognized the commercialpossibilities: “This is the greatest story in the world—far bigger than theatomic bomb.” He added in a postscript that he had also lost twenty pounds intwenty-five days—another commercial bonanza. Campbell was beside himself becauseHubbard had yet to actually start writing the book. “The key to world sanity isin Ron Hubbard’s head, and there isn’t even an adequate written record!”In December, Ron and Sara moved into what Hubbard termed “a little old shack” inBayhead, New Jersey, with eight bedrooms, near the beach. In March 1950, he sentthe Heinleins a handmade miniature book catalogue from “Hubbard House”publishers, proclaiming the spring collection:AnnouncingA New Hubbard EditionCompletely New MaterialNot a revisionCo-Authors—Ron & Sara HubbardRelease Date March 8, ’50—11:50 A.M.Weight—9 lbs. 2 oz. — Height—21 in.Alexis ValerieHas received rave notices from all reviewers!Alexis was the image of her father, who delighted in her precociousness. “Ron isgoing at a little less than the speed of light all day and every day,” Sarawrote to the Heinleins, “then, in the middle of the night he goes in and tellsAlexis all about it.”Ron promised to send Heinlein a galley of Dianetics as soon as it was available.He reported that it was 180,000 words, “begun Jan. 12, ’50, finished Feb. 10,off the press by April 25.” When one of his followers asked Hubbard how he hadbeen able to dash it off so quickly, Hubbard said that his guardian spirit, theEmpress, had dictated it to him.Like several other prominent sci-fi writers of the Golden Age, includingHeinlein and A. E. van Vogt, Hubbard had been strongly influenced by thewritings of Alfred Korzybski, a Polish American philosopher who created thetheory of general semantics. In New Jersey, Sara read Korzybski and quotedseveral passages aloud to Ron, who immediately grasped the ideas as the basisfor a system of psychology, if not for a whole religion.Korzybski pointed out that words are not the things they describe, in the sameway that a map is not the territory it represents. Language shapes thinking,creating mental habits, which can stand in the way of sanity by preservingdelusions. Korzybski argued that emotional disturbances, learning disorders, andmany psychosomatic illnesses—including heart problems, skin diseases, sexualdisorders, migraines, alcoholism, arthritis, even dental cavities—could beremedied by semantic training, much as Hubbard would claim for his own work. Hecited Korzybski frequently, although he admitted that he could never get throughthe texts themselves. “Bob Heinlein sat down one time and talked for ten wholeminutes on the subject of Korzybski to me and it was very clever,” he laterrelated. “I know quite a bit about Korzybski’s works.”From this secondhand knowledge, Hubbard saw the need for creating a specialvocabulary, which would allow him to define old thoughts in new ways (the soulbecomes a thetan, for instance); or invent new words, such as “enturbulate”(confuse) and “hatting” (training); or use words and phrases in a novel manner,such as turning adjectives or verbs into nouns, or vice versa (“an overt,” “astatic,” “alter-isness”); plus a Pentagon-level glut of acronyms—all of whichwould entrap his followers in a self-referential semantic labyrinth.Hubbard granted his friend and acolyte John Campbell a scoop by letting him buya lengthy excerpt of his forthcoming book. Thus the world got its first look atDianetics in the pages of Astounding Science-Fiction. “This article is not ahoax, joke, or anything but a direct, clear statement of a totally newscientific thesis,” Campbell warns his readers, who might be confused by findinga work of scholarship in a pulp magazine. “I know dianetics is one of, if notthe greatest, discovery of all Man’s written and unwritten history,” he wrote toa puzzled contributor. “It produces the sort of stability and sanity men havedreamed about for centuries.” He assured a young writer that Hubbard would winthe Nobel Peace Prize for his work.The book itself, Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health, appeared inMay. It was completely unexpected, given Hubbard’s history as a writer. Heintended it to stand as a capstone to the “fifty thousand years of thinking menwithout whose speculations and observations the creation and construction ofDianetics would not have been possible.” In Scientology, Dianetics is known asBook One. “With 18 million copies sold, it is indisputably the most widely readand influential book on the human mind ever published,” the church maintains.Scientology dates its own calendar from 1950, the year Dianetics was published.Hubbard’s theory is that the mind has two parts. The analytical, or conscious,mind is the center of awareness, the storehouse of all past perceptions. Nothingis lost from its data banks. Every smell or pattern or sound attached to one’sprevious experiences is present and capable of being completely recaptured. Thisis the mind that observes and thinks and solves problems. It is rational andaware of itself.The other form of mentality is the reactive mind. It is the single source ofnightmares, insecurity, and unreasonable fears. It doesn’t think. It is arepository of painful and destructive emotions, which are recorded even while anindividual is sleeping, or unconscious, or still in the womb. The recording isnot the same as a memory, in the sense of being a mental construct; it isphysically a part of the cellular structure and capable of reproducing itself ingenerations of new cells. “Cells are evidently sentient in some currentlyinexplicable way,” Hubbard speculates. When awakened by some stimulus, therecording—Hubbard calls it an “engram”—turns off the conscious mind and seizescontrol of an individual’s actions or behavior.Hubbard compares the engram to a posthypnotic suggestion. He describes a man ina trance who has been told that every time the operator touches his tie, thesubject will remove his coat. When the subject is awakened, he is notconsciously aware of the command. “The operator then touches his tie,” Hubbardwrites. “The subject may make some remark about its being too warm and so takehis coat off.” This can be done repeatedly. “At last the subject may becomeaware, from the expressions on people’s faces, that something is wrong. He willnot know what is wrong. He will not even know that the touching of the tie isthe signal which makes him take off his coat.” The hypnotic command in hisunconscious continues to govern his behavior, even when the subject recognizesthat it is irrational and perhaps harmful. In the same way, Hubbard suggests,engrams work their sinister influence on everyday actions, undermining one’sself-confidence and subverting rational behavior. The individual feels helplessas he engages in behavior he would never consciously consent to. He is “handledlike a marionette by his engrams.”Although there were no recorded case histories to prove his claim that hundredsof patients had been cured through his methods, through “many years of exactresearch and careful testing,” Hubbard offered appealing examples ofhypothetical behavior. For instance, a woman is beaten and kicked. “She isrendered ‘unconscious.’ ” In that state, she is told she is no good, a faker,and that she is always changing her mind. Meantime, a chair has been knockedover; a faucet is running in the kitchen; a car passes outside. All of theseperceptions are parts of the engram. The woman is not aware of it, but whenevershe hears running water or a car passing by, the engram is partly restimulated.She feels discomfort if she hears them together. If a chair happens to fall aswell, she experiences a shock. She begins to feel like the person she wasaccused of being while she was unconscious—a fickle, no-good faker. “This is nottheory,” Hubbard repeatedly asserts. It is an “exact science” that represents“an evolutionary step in the development of Man.”Hubbard proposed that the influence engrams have over one’s current behavior canbe eliminated by reciting the details of the original incident until it nolonger possesses an emotional charge.4 “Dianetics deletes all the pain from alifetime,” Hubbard writes. “When this pain is erased in the engram bank andrefiled as memory and experience in the memory banks, all aberrations andpsychosomatic illnesses vanish.” The object of Dianetics therapy is to drain theengrams of their painful, damaging qualities and eliminate the reactive mindentirely, leaving a person “Clear.”WRITTEN IN a bluff, quirky style, and overrun with patronizing footnotes that dolittle to substantiate its bold findings, Dianetics nonetheless became asensation, lodging itself for twenty-eight weeks on the New York Timesbest-seller list and laying the groundwork for the category of postwar self-helpbooks that would seek to emulate its success. Hundreds of Dianetics groupssprang up around the United States and in other countries in order for itsadherents to apply the therapeutic principles Hubbard prescribed. One onlyneeded a partner, called an auditor, who could guide the subject to locate hisengrams and bring them into consciousness, where they would be released andrendered harmless. “You will find many reasons why you ‘cannot get well,’ ”Hubbard warns, but he promises, “Dianetics is no solemn adventure. For all thatit has to do with suffering and loss, its end is always laughter, so foolish, somisinterpreted were the things which caused the woe.”The book arrived at a moment when the aftershocks of the world war were stillbeing felt. Behind the exhilaration of victory, there was immense trauma.Religious certainties were shaken by the development of bombs so powerful thatcivilization, if not life itself, became a wager in the Cold War contest. Loss,grief, and despair were cloaked by the stoicism of the age, but patients beingtreated in mental hospitals were already on the verge of outnumbering thosebeing treated for any other cause. Psychoanalysis was suspiciously viewed inmuch of America as a European—mainly Jewish—import, which was time-consuming andfantastically expensive. Hubbard promised results “in less than twenty hours ofwork” that would be “superior to any produced by several years ofpsycho-analysis.”The profession of psychiatry, meantime, had entered a period of brutalexperimentation, characterized by the widespread practice of lobotomies andelectroshock therapy. The prospect of consulting a psychiatrist was accompaniedby a justified sense of dread. That may have played a role in Hubbard’s decisionnot to follow up on his own request for psychiatric treatment. The appearance ofa do-it-yourself manual that claimed to demystify the secrets of the human mindand produce guaranteed results—for free—was bound to attract an audience. “Itwas sweepingly, catastrophically successful,” Hubbard marveled.The scientific community, stupefied by the book’s popularity, reacted withhostility and ridicule. It seemed to them little more than psychological folkart. “This volume probably contains more promises and less evidence per pagethan has any publication since the invention of printing,” the Nobel physicistIsidor Isaac Rabi wrote in his review of Dianetics for Scientific American. “Thehuge sale of the book to date is distressing evidence of the frustratedambitions, hopes, ideals, anxieties and worries of the many persons who throughit have sought succor.” Erich Fromm, one of the predominant thinkers of thepsychoanalytic movement, denounced the book as being “expressive of a spiritthat is exactly the opposite of Freud’s teachings.” Hubbard’s method, hecomplains, “has no respect for and no understanding of the complexities ofpersonality.” He derisively quotes Hubbard: “In an engineering science likeDianetics we can work on a push-button basis.” But, of course, that was part ofthe theory’s immense appeal.One of the most painful reviews of Dianetics, no doubt, was by Korzybski’s mostnotable intellectual heir (and later, US senator from California), S. I.Hayakawa. He not only dismissed the book, he also criticized what he saw as thespurious craft of writing science fiction. “The art consists in concealing fromthe reader, for novelistic purposes, the distinctions between establishedscientific facts, almost-established scientific hypotheses, scientificconjectures, and imaginative extrapolations far beyond what has even beenconjectured,” he wrote. The writer who produces “too much of it too fast and tooglibly” runs the risk of believing in his own creations. “It appears to meinevitable that anyone writing several million words of fantasy andscience-fiction should ultimately begin to internalize the assumptionsunderlying the verbiage.” Dianetics, Hayakawa noted, was neither science norfiction, but something else: “fictional science.”Not all scientists rejected Hubbard’s approach. One of his early supporters wasCampbell’s brother-in-law Dr. Joseph Winter, a physician who had also writtenfor Astounding Science-Fiction. Searching for a more holistic approach tomedicine, Winter traveled to New Jersey to experience Hubbard’s methodfirsthand. “While listening to Hubbard ‘running’ one of his patients, or whilebeing ‘run’ myself, I would find myself developing unaccountable pains invarious portions of my anatomy, or becoming extremely fatigued and somnolent,”he reported. “I had nightmares of being choked, of having my genitalia cut off,and I was convinced that dianetics as a method could produce effects.”Hubbard’s method involved placing the patient in a state of “reverie,” achievedby giving the command “When I count from one to seven your eyes will close.” Atremble of the lashes as the eyelids flutter shut signals that the subject hasfallen into a receptive condition. “This is not hypnotism,” Hubbard insists.Although a person in a Dianetic reverie may appear to be in a trance, theopposite is the case, he says: “The purpose of therapy is to awaken a person inevery period of his life when he has been forced into ‘unconsciousness.’Dianetics wakes people up.”Sara watched the effect that Ron was having on his patients. “He would holdhands with them and try to talk them into these phony memories,” she recalled.“He would concentrate on them and they loved it. They were so excited aboutsomeone who would just pay this much attention to them.”Dr. Winter tried out Hubbard’s techniques on his six-year-old son, who wasafraid of the dark because he was terrified of being choked by ghosts. Winterasked him to remember the first time he saw a ghost. “He has on a long whiteapron, a little white cap on his head and a piece of white cloth on his mouth,”the boy said. He even had a name for the ghost—it happened to be the same asthat of the obstetrician who delivered him. Winter then asked his son to look atthe “ghost” in his mind repeatedly, until the boy began to calm down. “When themaximum relaxation had apparently been obtained after ten or twelve recountings,I told him to open his eyes,” Winter reported. “It has been over a year sincethat short session with my son, and he has not had a recurrence of his fear ofthe dark in all that time.”The idea that early memories—even prenatal ones—could be recaptured was centralto Hubbard’s theory. Every engram rooted in the reactive mind has itspredecessors; the object of Dianetics therapy is to hunt down the originalinsult, the “basic-basic,” which produced the engram in the first place. Freudhad also postulated that childhood traumas would be played out in later lifethrough symptoms of hysteria or neurosis. In his famous Wolf Man case, forinstance, Freud traced a childhood neurosis in his patient to the sight of hisparents copulating when he was a year and a half old. “Everything goes back tothe reproduction of scenes,” Freud thought at the time. He recognized that inmany cases such childhood memories were clearly invented, but from an analyticalperspective, they were still useful, because the emotions and associationsattached to the confabulations opened a window onto the patient’s subconscious.False childhood memories were often as deeply believed in as real ones, but whatmade them stand apart from actual memories was that they were almost always thesame, unvarying from patient to patient; they must be somehow universal. Freud’sprotégé Carl Jung would seize on this fact to construct his theory of theCollective Unconscious. Freud himself came to believe that what was a falsememory in a present-day patient’s mind had been a reality at some point inprehistory. “It seems to me quite possible that all the things that are told tous to-day in analysis as phantasy—the seduction of children, the inflaming ofsexual excitement by observing parental intercourse, the threat ofcastration…—were once real occurrences in the primaeval times of the humanfamily, and that children in their phantasies are simply filling in the gaps inindividual truth with prehistoric truth.” And yet Freud continued to be troubledby the fact that many of these supposed memories were formed at a suspiciouslyearly age. “The extreme achievement on these lines is a phantasy of observingparental intercourse while one is still an unborn baby in the womb,” he notedwryly. That absurdity was one of the reasons he eventually cast aside theseduction theory.For Hubbard, however, early or even prenatal traumas were literally true. Hebelieved that the fetus not only recorded details of his parents copulatingduring his pregnancy, but also every word spoken during the act. Such recordingscan be restimulated in adult life by hearing similar language, which would thenawaken the anxiety that the fetus experienced—during a violent sexual episode,for instance. That could lead to “aberration,” which for Hubbard includes allpsychoses, neuroses, compulsions and any other deviation from rational behavior.Engrams form chains of similar incidents, Hubbard suggests. He gives the exampleof seventeen prenatal engrams found in a single individual, who “had passed for‘normal’ for thirty-six years of his life.” Among them:COITUS CHAIN, FATHER. 1st incident zygote. 56 succeeding incidents. Twobranches, father drunk and father sober.COITUS CHAIN, LOVER. 1st incident embryo. 18 succeeding incidents. All painfulbecause of enthusiasm of lover.FIGHT CHAIN. 1st incident embryo. 38 succeeding incidents. Three falls, loudvoices, no beating.ATTEMPTED ABORTION, SURGICAL. 1st incident embryo. 21 succeeding incidents.ATTEMPTED ABORTION, DOUCHE. 1st incident fetus. 2 incidents. 1 using paste, 1using Lysol, very strong.MASTURBATION CHAIN. 1st incident embryo. 80 succeeding incidents. Mothermasturbating with fingers, jolting child and injuring child with orgasm.And so on, all leading up to:BIRTH. Instrument. 29 hours labor.Hubbard’s view of women as revealed in this and many other examples is not justcontemptuous; it betrays a kind of horror. He goes on to make this amazingstatement: “It is a scientific fact that abortion attempts are the mostimportant factor in aberration. The child on whom the abortion is attempted iscondemned to live with murderers whom he reactively knows to be murderersthrough all his weak and helpless youth!” In his opinion, it is very difficultto abort a child, which is why the process so often fails. “Twenty or thirtyabortion attempts are not uncommon in the aberree and in every attempt the childcould have been pierced through the body or brain,” Hubbard writes. “Howevermany billions America spends yearly on institutions for the insane and jails forthe criminals are spent primarily because of attempted abortions done by somesex-blocked mother to whom children are a curse, not a blessing of God.”One of the charges that would be lobbed against Hubbard by his disaffectedeldest son was that his father had attempted two abortions on his mother. “One Iobserved when I was around six or seven,” L. Ron Hubbard, Jr., later testified.He recalled seeing his father standing over his mother with a coat hanger in hishand. The other attempted abortion was upon himself. “I was born at six and ahalf months and weighed two pounds, two ounces. I mean, I wasn’t born: this iswhat came out as a result of their attempt to abort me.” Hubbard himself writesin his secret memoir that Polly was terrified of childbirth, “but conceiveddespite all precautions seven times in five years resulting in five abortionsand two children.” While he was writing Dianetics, and Sara was pregnant withAlexis, she says, Hubbard kicked her in the stomach several times to attempt tocause a miscarriage. Later, Hubbard told one of his lovers that he himself hadbeen born of an attempted abortion.While Hubbard was still writing Dianetics, he contacted both the AmericanPsychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association, representinghimself as a colleague who had made fundamental advances in the science.Patients placed in a trance state, he explained, could be guided to remembertheir own births. In sixteen of what he says were the twenty cases that heexamined, psychosomatic illnesses had been caused by pre-birth or birth traumas.“Migraine headache, ulcers, asthma, sinusitis and arthritis were amongst thoseillnesses relieved,” he asserted. In a similar letter to the AmericanGerontological Society, he also claimed that sixteen of the twenty cases hadbeen made measurably younger. His preliminary title for the work was “CertainDiscoveries and Researches Leading to the Removal of Early Traumatic ExperiencesIncluding Attempted Abortion, Birth Shock and Infant Accidents and Illnesseswith an Examination of Their Effects on the Adult Mind and an Account ofTechniques Evolved and Employed.” When scientists tested some of Hubbard’sclaims and found that his techniques produced no measurable improvement, heblamed them for failing to understand his system.Hubbard’s rejection by the mental health establishment, even before Dianeticswas published, was itself a kind of pre-birth trauma. After that, wheneverDianetics or Scientology was attacked in the press or by governments, Hubbardsaw the hand of psychiatrists. “The psychiatrist and his front groups operatestraight out of the terrorist textbooks,” he wrote bitterly years later. “TheMafia looks like a convention of Sunday school teachers compared to theseterrorist groups.” Toward the end of his life he concluded that if psychiatrists“had the power to torture and kill everyone, they would do so.… Recognize themfor what they are: psychotic criminals—and handle them accordingly.” Psychiatrywas “the sole cause of decline in this universe.”HUBBARD SET UP schools to train auditors in major cities, which, along with thebook sales and his lecture fees, generated a cascade of revenue. “The money wasjust pouring in,” Sara marveled. Hubbard began carrying huge wads of cash aroundin his pocket. “I remember going past a Lincoln dealer and admiring one of thosebig Lincolns they had then,” Sara recalled. “He walked right in there and boughtit for me, cash!”The people who were drawn to Dianetics were young to middle-aged white-collarProtestants who had a pronounced interest in science fiction. Some weremotivated by the prospect of employment in this booming new field. Others weretruth seekers, often veterans of other movements and cults that were respondingto the dislocations of the era. And then there were those who had heard thelegend of the heroic Navy officer who had been blinded and crippled by the war,who had healed himself through Dianetic techniques. Like Hubbard, they sought acure. Society and science had let them down. Through Dianetics, they hoped to belifted up, enlightened, restored, and made whole.One of the contradictory features of Dianetics is the fact that Hubbardcontinually referred to the powers of Clears, but as yet he had not actuallyproduced a single one for inspection. Among other powers, a Clear “has completerecall of everything which has ever happened to him or anything he has everstudied. He does mental computations such as those of chess, for example, whicha normal would do in half an hour, in ten or fifteen seconds.” Such claimspresumed that there was already a sizable population of Dianetic graduates withexceptional abilities, and Hubbard’s readers naturally wondered where they were.In August 1950, Hubbard presented the “World’s First Clear” at the ShrineAuditorium in Los Angeles. Sonia Bianca, a very nervous physics student fromBoston, was brought to the stage. Hubbard claimed that through Dianetics, Biancahad attained “full and perfect recall of every moment of her life.” The audiencebegan peppering her with questions, such as what she had had for breakfast eightyears before, or what was on this page[Wrig_9780385350273_epub_c03_r1.htm#page122] of Hubbard’s book, or evenelemental formulas in physics, her area of specialty. She was incapable ofresponding when someone asked the color of Hubbard’s necktie, when he brieflyhad his back turned to her. It was a very public fiasco. Hubbard would notannounce another Clear for sixteen years. One of his disillusioned acolyteslater concluded that the concept of clearing was just a gimmick to dramatize thetheory of Dianetics. “The fact is that there were never any clears, as he haddescribed them,” Helen O’Brien, Hubbard’s top executive in the United States,wrote. “There were randomly occurring remissions of psychosomatics.”Meanwhile, his bigamous marriage to Sara was careening toward a spectacularconclusion. A month after the Sonia Bianca debacle, Ron and Sara were living atthe Chateau Marmont in Hollywood. He was beating her regularly. “With or withoutan argument, there’d be an upsurge of violence,” Sara recalled. “The veins inhis forehead would engorge” and he would strike her, “out of the blue.” One timehe broke her eardrum. And yet, she stayed with him, a hostage to his needs. “Ifelt so guilty about the fact that he was so psychologically damaged,” Sarasaid. “I felt as though he had given so much to our country and I couldn’t evenbring him peace of mind. I believed thoroughly that he was a man of great honor,had sacrificed his well being to the country.… It just never occurred to me hewas a liar.” Ron finally explained his dilemma: he didn’t want to be married—“Ido not want to be an American husband for I can buy my friends whenever I wantthem”—but divorce would hurt his reputation. The solution: if Sara really lovedhim, she should kill herself.Sara took little “Alexi,” as she called their daughter, and moved into the LosAngeles Dianetics Research Foundation, in a former governor’s mansion near theUniversity of Southern California campus. Soon after that, Sara began an affairwith another man, Miles Hollister.Hubbard furiously told his own lover, Barbara Klowden, that Sara and Miles wereplotting to have him committed to a mental institution. Indeed, Sara hadconsulted a psychiatrist about Hubbard’s condition. She told him that Ron hadsaid he would rather kill her than let her leave him. The psychiatrist said thatHubbard probably needed to be institutionalized, and he warned Sara that herlife was in danger.Nonetheless, Sara went directly to Ron and told him what the doctor had said. Ifhe got treatment, she said, she would stay with him; otherwise, she was going toleave. Ron responded by threatening to kill their child. “He didn’t want her tobe brought up by me because I was in league with the doctors,” Sara recalled, inher deathbed tape. “He thought I had thrown in with the psychiatrists, with thedevils.”On the night of February 24, 1951, Sara went to the movies and left her baby inthe care of a young man named John Sanborne, who was studying at the foundation.Alexis had become a kind of celebrity, or at least a curiosity. Hubbard had beentouting her as the world’s first “dianetic baby”—shielded since birth againstany engram-forming disruptions or parental conflict. As a result, Hubbardboasted, Alexis talked at three months, crawled at four, and had no phobias. Atabout ten o’clock, eleven-month-old Alexis began crying in her crib, so Sanbornepicked her up to comfort her. Suddenly, the infant said in a hoarse whisper,“Don’t sleep.” Sanborne was startled. He didn’t think a baby could talk likethat. “It went through me in a funny way,” he later said. “The hair raising onthe back of the neck type of feeling.”At eleven p.m. there was a knock on the door. One of Hubbard’s aides appeared,wearing a topcoat, with his hand in his pocket. Sanborne believed he wascarrying a gun. The man said that Hubbard was here to take his daughter. Hubbardhimself then came through the door, also wearing a topcoat, with his hand in hisright pocket. They took the child and disappeared.Later that night Hubbard returned with two other men to abduct Sara. “We haveAlexis and you’ll never see her alive unless you come with us,” Hubbard said.They tied her hands and dragged her out of bed into a waiting Lincoln. She saysthat Hubbard had her in a chokehold to keep her from screaming. Hubbard’sassistant, Richard de Mille (son of the famous movie director and producer CecilB. DeMille), drove aimlessly, while Hubbard and Sara, who was wearing only anightgown, sat in back. She warned him that kidnapping was a capital offense.In San Bernardino, Hubbard ordered de Mille to stop at the county hospital so hecould have Sara committed, but it was the middle of the night and no doctorwould talk to him. Eventually, Hubbard and Sara negotiated a truce. Hubbard toldher where Alexis was hidden—he had hired a nurse in West Los Angeles to watchher—and Sara signed a note saying that she had gone with Hubbard of her own freewill. Hubbard and de Mille went to the Yuma, Arizona, airport and flew toPhoenix, while Sara drove the Lincoln back to Los Angeles in her nightgown topick up Alexis. When she arrived at the nursing center, however, she was toldthat a young couple had just left with the baby.Hubbard and de Mille flew on to Chicago, where Hubbard voluntarily presentedhimself for a psychological examination in order to counter the accusation thathe was a paranoid schizophrenic. The psychologist administered some diagnostictests, including Rorschach inkblots, and later provided a report that said thatHubbard was a creative individual who was upset by family problems and depressedabout his work. Hubbard was extremely pleased; he would often mention that hehad been given a clean bill of health by the psychological profession. Sararemembered that he then called her and told her that he had killed Alexis. “Hesaid that he had cut her into little pieces and dropped the pieces in a riverand that he had seen little arms and legs floating down the river and it was myfault, I’d done it because I’d left him,” Sara remembered.Hubbard and de Mille then traveled to Elizabeth, New Jersey, where the DianeticsFoundation had its headquarters. Meantime, the young couple that Hubbard hadhired to abduct Alexis from the nursing center drove the infant all the wayacross the country to deliver her to Hubbard. It was the middle of March andsnowing in New Jersey, so Hubbard decided to move on to Florida, where heintended to write his next book. De Mille came along with the baby. After a fewdays in Tampa, Hubbard still felt edgy and announced that the three of them wereflying to Cuba. “He believed that as long as he had the child he could controlthe situation,” de Mille told one of Hubbard’s biographers.For six weeks, Sara had searched for Alexis in Southern California, enlistinglocal police, sheriffs, and the FBI, but the authorities regarded the abductionas a domestic dispute. Finally, she filed a writ of habeas corpus demandingAlexis’s return, setting off a press uproar. On April 23, 1951, Sara added tothe sensation by finally filing for divorce in Los Angeles County, revealingthat Hubbard was already married when they wed. She accused Hubbard ofsubjecting her to “systematic torture,” including sleep deprivation, beatings,strangulations, and “scientific torture experiments.” She said that she hadconsulted medical professionals, who concluded that Hubbard was “hopelesslyinsane, and crazy.”Soon afterward, Sara received a surprising letter of support from Polly:If I can help in any way, I’d like to—You must get Alexis in your custody—Ron isnot normal. I had hoped that you could straighten him out. Your charges probablysound fantastic to the average person—but I’ve been through it—the beatings,threats on my life, all the sadistic traits you charge—twelve years of it.…Please do believe I do so want to help you get Alexis.Meantime, in Havana, Hubbard hired a couple of women to take care of the baby.They kept her in a crib with wire over the top. To de Mille, it seemed thatAlexis was being held like a monkey in a cage.Cuba was run by mobsters, who had turned it into a hedonistic paradise, butHubbard took little advantage of the nightlife; he locked himself in a hotelroom, rented an old typewriter with Spanish-language keys, and began to write.According to de Mille, Hubbard wrote all night with a bottle of rum at hand,which was empty in the morning.The book Hubbard was pounding out in Havana was Science of Survival. Heintroduced his readers to the Tone Scale, which had evolved since he sketched itout in his letter to Robert Heinlein two years before. The scale classifiesemotional states, starting at zero, Body Death. The lower tones arecharacterized by psychosis, where hatred and anger give way to perversion,artful lying, cowardice, withdrawal, and apathy. “People below the 2.0 level, nomatter their avowed intention, will bring death or injury to persons, things andorganizations around them if in the anger bracket, or death to themselves if inthe apathy bracket,” Hubbard writes. “Anyone below 2.0 level is a potentialsuicide.” Their bodies stink, as does their breath. At 2.5, there is a breakpoint between the normal and the neurotic. This stage is characterized byboredom, vagueness, indifference, and pointless conversation. At level 3.0 oneenters a stage that Hubbard characterizes as “very high normal,” where one isresistant to infections, tolerant, and reasonable; however, he is alsoinsincere, careless, and untrustworthy.Clear registers 4.0 on the scale. A person who has attained this level is nearlyaccident-proof and immune to bacteria. He is exhilarated, eager, strong, able,curious, ethical, creative, courageous, responsible, and impossible tohypnotize. And yet this state is only one-tenth of what Hubbard forecasts in therealm of human potential. His scale goes all the way to 40.0, Serenity ofBeingness, but the capabilities of the upper regions are largely unknown.Given the circumstances that surrounded the creation of this book, it’sinteresting to read what Hubbard writes about sexual behavior and attitudestoward children. Not only was he on the run in Cuba with his abducted daughterwhen he wrote this, he was also being sued for non-support of the two childrenfrom his first marriage, whom he hadn’t seen for years. “Sex,” he wrote, “is anexcellent index of the position of the preclear on the Tone Scale.” The highestlevels are characterized by monogamy, constancy, a pleasurable attitude towardsex, and an intense interest in children, although the urge to procreate ismitigated by the sublimation of sexual desire into pure creative thought. At 3.0on the scale, sexual interest is diminished but the urge to procreate remainshigh. That begins to fall off at 2.5, “not for any reason beyond a generalfailure to be interested in anything.” Children are tolerated, but there islittle interest in their affairs. At 2.0, sex becomes revolting and childrenprovoke anxiety. Rape and child abuse characterize 1.5.Then Hubbard arrives at a level that preoccupies him, 1.1 on the Tone Scale.“Here is the harlot, the pervert, the unfaithful wife, Free Love, easy marriageand quick divorce and general sexual disaster,” he writes. “A society whichreaches this level is on its way out of history.” A mother who is at 1.1 on theTone Scale will attempt to abort her child. However, once the child is born, “weget general neglect and thoughtlessness about the child and no feelingwhatsoever about the child’s future or any effort to build one for it. We getcareless familial actions, such as promiscuity, which will tear to pieces thefamily security upon which this child’s future depends. Along this band, thechild is considered a thing, a possession.”Hubbard finished the book and wrote this dedication:ToAlexis Valerie HubbardFor Whose Tomorrow MayBe Hoped a World ThatIs Fit To Be FreeHubbard eventually wrote a note to Sara to explain his whereabouts, saying thathe was in a Cuban military hospital, about to be transferred to the States “as aclassified scientist immune from interference of all kinds.” He adds, “I will behospitalized probably a long time. Alexis is getting excellent care. I see herevery day. She is all I have to live for. My wits never gave way under all youdid and let them do but my body didn’t stand up. My right side is paralyzed.… Ihope my heart lasts.… Dianetics will last 10,000 years—for the Army and Navyhave it now.” He concludes by warning that in the event of his death, Alexiswill inherit a fortune, but if Sara gains custody, the child will get nothing.Hubbard did return to the United States and hunkered down in Wichita, Kansas,where a wealthy supporter, Don Purcell, provided him sanctuary. Hubbard’s oldfriend Russell Hays was there, consulting for the Cessna Aircraft Corporation.Hubbard arrived with “a Cadillac so damn long he couldn’t hardly park itanywhere, and two concubines,” Hays marveled. When Sara discovered where herhusband was, she sought to enjoin his assets. Hubbard retaliated by writing aletter to the US attorney general, explaining the peril he was in. “I am,basically, a scientist in the field of atomic and molecular phenomena,” he saidby way of introduction. He said that his own investigation showed that Sara wastied to Communists who had infiltrated the Dianetics Foundation. This was at theheight of McCarthyism and the Red Scare. “I did not realize my wife was oneuntil this spring,” Hubbard wrote. He named several of his disaffectedfollowers, including Gregory Hemingway, son of the famous novelist. “When, when,when will we have a round-up?” he implored.Meantime, Sara came to Wichita to pursue the divorce and to get Alexis back. Ronblithely suggested that they should take a trip together. “He told me that I wasunder the influence of this communist cell” run by her husband, Sara recalled.“And that they were dictating to me what to do, and that I was in a state ofcomplete madness. I told him, ‘Yep, I think you’re right. The only thing I cando is to work through it and do whatever they say.’ ” Ron replied that theCommunists had hypnotized her. Sara played along, but insisted she would have togo through the divorce; only then would she be able to break free of theirpower.“You know, I’m a public figure and you’re nobody,” Ron said, “so if you have togo through the divorce, I’ll accuse you of desertion so it won’t look so bad onmy public record.” As long as she was going to get Alexis back as part of thebargain, Sara agreed.[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_004_r1.jpg]Sara Northrup Hubbard in April 1951, when she was suing Hubbard for the returnof their baby daughter, AlexisOn the day of the divorce, Ron was convinced that the spell the Communists hadcast over Sara would be broken, and she would come back to him. When they walkedout of the courtroom, Sara told him that she had to get their daughter. Ron tookher to the place where Alexis was being held. Sara said that the last thing shehad to do was go to the airport. She already had a ticket. Then the enchantmentwould dissolve and she would be free.On the day of her scheduled departure, Ron drove Sara and Alexis to the airport.“We got halfway there and he said he wasn’t going to do it,” Sara recalled.“You’re going to get on that plane and go away, aren’t you?” Ron said.“Well, I have to follow their dictates,” Sara replied. “I’ll just go to theairplane.”Ron parked the car. He told her that he couldn’t stand the idea that she wouldbe under the influence of psychiatrists, and that he might never see either ofthem again. “I’m not going to let you go,” he said.“I got out of the car, it was on the edge of the airfield,” Sara remembered. “Ileft all Alexi’s clothes in the car, I left my suitcase, one of her shoes felloff and I had my purse. I just ran across the airfield, across the runways, tothe airport and got on the plane. And it was the nineteenth of June and it wasthe happiest day of my life.”IN THE SPACE of a year, Hubbard had gone from destitution and obscurity to greatwealth and international renown, followed by a crashing descent. The foundationhe had created to train auditors plummeted into debt and soon declaredbankruptcy. Close supporters, such as John Campbell and Dr. Winter, deserted.Dianetics proved to be a fad that had swept the country, infatuating tens oreven hundreds of thousands of people, but then burned itself out more quicklythan the hula hoop.Once again, Hubbard got a house trailer, and this time he drove it to Lawrence,Kansas, where Russell Hays now lived. Hays instructed Hubbard to park histrailer on some raw land he owned nearby. “That didn’t please him,” Hays said.“I wouldn’t want to have to live with him, he’d get on my nerves.” Hubbard wasdrinking and had a number of drugs along with him, and he pressed Hays to supplyhim with marijuana. Hays later dried some horseweed and mailed it to Hubbard,signing the letter, “I. M. Reefer.”Hays advised the discouraged Hubbard to make use of his extensive mailing list.There were many followers who still believed in the man and his method. Some hadhad meaningful emotional breakthroughs. Others had experiences—such as leavingtheir bodies—that conclusively proved to them the validity of Hubbard’s claims.These acolytes provided the bedrock of support that Hubbard needed to regeneratehis broken organization, rebuild his finances, and repair the stain on hisreputation caused by his personal scandals.In addition to Hubbard’s relentless self-confidence, several new factorssalvaged his movement. He had a new device, the E-Meter, developed by one of hisfollowers, which Hubbard revealed in March 1952. The E-Meter would replace theDianetic reverie with what appeared to be a more scientific approach, one thatdidn’t look so much like a hypnotic trance. “It sees all, knows all,” Hubbarddeclared. “It is never wrong.” And he had a new wife, Mary Sue Whipp, a petiteTexan, twenty years his junior, whom he married that same month. She was alreadypregnant with the first of their four children.Hubbard also had a new name for his movement. From now on, it was Scientology.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 According to the church, “There was something under the water and it wasdefinitely hostile, and after they dropped their charges, there was oil andsomething sunk.… It definitely happened.”2 A conspicuous example of Dianetic processing involved John Brodie, theoutstanding quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, who suffered an injury tohis throwing arm in 1970 that threatened to end his career. Despite the bestmedical attention and physical therapy, his elbow remained sore and swollen.Finally, he went to Phil Spickler, a Scientologist and Dianetic auditor, whoasked Brodie to tell him about previous incidents that might be keeping his armfrom healing. Brodie related that he had been in a severe traffic accident in1963, in which his arm had been broken. As he explored the incident withSpickler, Brodie seemed to recall one of the ambulance attendants saying, “Well,that poor sonofabitch will never throw a football again.” And yet Brodie wasunconscious at the time. How could he have such a memory? Spickler told him thiswas all part of an engram that was keeping him from getting well. “The ambulanceattendant’s prediction had been simmering in my unconscious for seven years,agitating all my deepest fears of declining ability or failure,” Brodie laterwrites. “It had finally surfaced as this psychosomatic ailment in my throwingarm. Phil made me tell the story again and again and again, until no chargeshowed on the E-Meter” (John Brodie and James D. Houston, Open Field, p. 166).The swelling on Brodie’s arm diminished. He went on to have one of the greatestseasons of his career, and was voted the National Football League’s mostvaluable player that year."},{"pageContent":"3[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_L02_r1.jpg]GOING OVERBOARDGiven his biography, it would be easy to dismiss Hubbard as a fraud, but thatwould fail to explain his total absorption in his project. He would spend therest of his life elaborating his theory and—even more obsessively—constructingthe intricate bureaucracy designed to spread and enshrine his visionaryunderstanding of human behavior. His life narrowed down to his singular mission.Each passageway in his interior expedition led him deeper into his imagination.That journey became Scientology, a totalistic universe in which his every turnwas mapped and described.Hubbard’s own logic was inclining him toward conclusions that he was at firstreluctant to draw. By admitting the validity of prenatal memories, he was boundto confront a dilemma: What if the memories didn’t stop there? When patientsbegan having “sperm dreams,” Hubbard had to accept the idea that prenatalengrams were recorded “as early as shortly before conception.” Then, whenpatients began to remember previous lives, Hubbard resisted the idea; itthreatened to tear apart his organization. “The subject of past deaths and pastlives is so full of tension that as early as last July 1950, the board oftrustees of the [Dianetics] Foundation sought to pass a resolution banning theentire subject,” he confided. Still, the implications were intriguing. What ifwe have lived before? Might there be memories that occasionally leak throughinto present time? Wouldn’t that prove that we are immortal beings, onlytemporarily residing in our present incarnations?Instead of remembering, the patient undergoing Dianetic counseling “returns” tothe past-life event. “There is a different feel to another period in time that’sso basic it’s hard to describe,” Hubbard’s top US executive, Helen O’Brien,recalled. “If you find yourself in a room, there may be color with unfamiliartones because of gaslight shining on it. The air has a strange quality. Itsparticles of dust derive from unmodern constituents. Even human bodies seem toradiate a different kind of warmth when they are covered with the fabrics ofanother age. Memory, per se, filters out all that. When you return, you find thepast intact.” Some of the “returnings” were shocking or painful. O’Brien’s firstpast-life experience in an auditing session was that of being a young Irishwoman in the early nineteenth century. She could feel the coarse texture of herfull-skirted dress as she walked down a narrow country lane, hearing the birdsand feeling the warm country air. But when she turned a corner of her house, shesaw a British soldier bayoneting her fourteen-year-old son in the yard. “Iliterally shuddered with grief,” O’Brien writes. When the soldier threw her tothe ground and tried to rape her, she spit in his face. He crushed her skullwith a cobblestone. O’Brien’s auditor had her re-experience the scene over andover until she was able to move through the entire bloody tableau unaffected.“By the end of it, I was luxuriously comfortable in every fibre,” she writes.“When I walked downstairs … the electric lights dazzled me. The clean modernlines of the house interior, and the furniture, were elegant and strange to mebeyond all description. I was freshly there from another age. For the first timein this lifetime, I knew I was beyond the laws of space and time.“I was never the same again.”With his new acceptance of past-life experiences, Hubbard could now describe theindividual as being divisible into three parts. First there was the spirit, orsoul, which Hubbard calls the thetan. The thetan normally lives in or near abody but can also be entirely separate from it. When a person goes exterior, forinstance, it is the thetan part of him that travels outside the body or viewshimself from across the room. The mind, which serves mainly as a storehouse ofpictures, functions as a communication and control system for the thetan,helping him operate in his environment. The body is merely the physicalcomposition of the person, existing in space and time.Anyone who stands in the way of a thetan’s spiritual progress is a SuppressivePerson (SP). This is a key concept in Scientology. Hubbard uses the term todescribe a sociopath. The Suppressive instinctively fights against constructiveforces and is driven berserk by those who try to help others. Hubbard estimatesthat Suppressives constitute about twenty percent of the population, but onlyabout two and a half percent are truly dangerous. “A Suppressive Person willgoof up or vilify any effort to help anybody and particularly knife withviolence anything calculated to make human beings more powerful or moreintelligent,” Hubbard writes. “The artist in particular is often found as amagnet for persons with anti-social personalities who see in his art somethingwhich must be destroyed.”Naturally, anyone who is close to a Suppressive Person is in great danger offalling under his influence. Hubbard called that person a Potential TroubleSource. If, for instance, a parent opposes a child who wants to joinScientology, that parent is likely to be declared an SP; and as long as thechild remains in contact with the parent, he is in danger of being defined as aPTS. He will be denied auditing and training. Eventually, the child will have tomake a choice, either to leave the church—which offers him a path to careersuccess, personal improvement, and salvation—or to disconnect from his parent,who is the cause of his failure to achieve happiness and realize his dreams.Hubbard had learned some difficult lessons from his experience with Dianetics.He was by nature an autocrat, but his work beckoned to amateurs. The movementinspired by his book had sprung up so quickly there was no real chance to reinit in and exert the kind of authority that might have made it more durable.Although he tried to impose order by creating professional training schools forauditors, in truth he had more or less surrendered control of the movement fromthe moment of inception by empowering his readers to become practitionersthemselves; all they had to do was to follow the formulas sketched in his book.Entrepreneurs grabbed hold of the concept and snatched it out of his hands. Theyspread the message, but they also diluted it. When the Dianetics movementsubsided, Hubbard was unable to restore the momentum that had given it such arocket-powered launch. Imitators and competitors came onto the field, some evenrivaling Hubbard himself. He was determined not to make the same mistakes withScientology. From now on, he would exercise total control. His word was law. Hewas not just the founder, he was “Source”—the last word, whose everypronouncement was scripture.In the evolution of Dianetics to Scientology, however, there was a larger wheelturning inside Hubbard’s protean imagination. Until now, religion had playedlittle or no part in his life or his thought—except, perhaps, as it wasreflected in the cynical remark he is reported to have made on a number ofoccasions, “I’d like to start a religion. That’s where the money is.” One of theproblems with Dianetics, from a moneymaking perspective, was the lack of along-term association on the part of its adherents. Psychotherapy has atheoretical conclusion to it; the patient is “cured” or decides that theprocedure doesn’t work for him. In either case, the revenue dries up. Religionsolves that problem. In addition to tax advantages, religion supplies acommodity that is always in demand: salvation. Hubbard ingeniously developedScientology into a series of veiled revelations, each of which promised greaterabilities and increased spiritual power. “To keep a person on the Scientologypath,” Hubbard once told one of his associates, “feed him a mystery sandwich.”It may be true that his decision to take his movement in a new direction hadmore to do with the legal and tax advantages that accrue to religiousorganizations than it did with actual spiritual inspiration. He was desperatefor money. The branches of his Dianetics Foundation were shuttered, one afteranother. At one point, Hubbard even lost the rights to the name Dianetics. Thetrend for his movement was toward disaster.A letter Hubbard wrote to one of his executives in 1953 shows him weighing theadvantages of setting up a new organization. “Perhaps we could call it aSpiritual Guidance Center,” he speculates. “And we could put in nice desks andour boys in neat blue with diplomas on the walls and 1. knock psychotherapy intohistory and 2. make enough money to shine up my operating scope and 3. keep theHAS [Hubbard Association of Scientologists] solvent. It is a problem ofpractical business.“I await your reaction on the religion angle.”In the anti-Scientology narrative, this is one of several clear statements ofHubbard’s calculations and proof that the “church” was nothing more than amoneymaking front. But Hubbard follows this with the observation, “We’retreating present time beingness, psychotherapy treats the past and the brain.And brother, that’s religion, not mental science.” At the end of that year,Hubbard incorporated three different churches: the Church of American Science,the Church of Spiritual Engineering, and the eventual winner in the brand-namecontest, the Church of Scientology. The Church of Scientology of California wasestablished on February 18, 1954, quickly followed by another in Washington, DC.The fields of psychotherapy and religion have bled into each other on manyoccasions. They have in common the goal of reshaping one’s view of the world andletting go of, or actually renouncing, one’s previous stance.1 Hubbard saidthere were “many, many reasons” to ally Scientology with religion. “To some thisseems mere opportunism,” he later admitted to a reporter. “To some it would seemthat Scientology is simply making itself bulletproof in the eyes of the law.”Among the many other incentives to turn Hubbard’s movement into a religion,there is one that might be considered especially in light of the frequent chargethat he was insane. Religion is always an irrational enterprise, no matter howennobling it may be to the human spirit. In many cultures, people who might beconsidered mentally ill in Western societies are thought of as religioushealers, or shamans. Anthropologists have called schizophrenia the “shamansickness,” because part of a shaman’s traditional journey requires suffering anillness that cannot be cured except by spiritual means. The shaman uses thepowers and insights he gains from his experience to heal his community. This isexactly the history that Hubbard paints as his own: a blind cripple in the Navyhospital, given up for lost, who then heals himself through techniques herefines into Dianetics. This is the gift he humbly offers as a means of healinghumanity. “The goal of Dianetics is a sane world—a world without insanity,without criminals and without war,” he declares. “It can be stopped only by theinsane.”For both the shaman and the schizophrenic, the boundaries between reality andillusion are soft, and consciousness slips easily from one to the other.Hubbard, with his highly imaginative mind, certainly had immediate access tovisionary worlds; his science-fiction stories are evidence of that. But it is adifferent matter to be able to cast the nets of one’s imagination into theunconscious and pull out best-selling books. The schizophrenic is rarely soproductive in the material world.Sometimes in Hubbard’s writings, however, he puts forward what appear to befantasies of a highly schizophrenic personality. In 1952, for instance, he begantalking about “injected entities,” which can paralyze portions of the anatomy orblock information from being audited. These entities can be located in the body,always in the same places. For instance, one of the entities, the “crew chief,”is found on the right side of the jaw down to the shoulder. “They are the‘mysterious voices’ in the heads of some preclears,” Hubbard said. “Paralysis,anxiety stomachs, arthritis and many ills and aberrations have been relieved byauditing them. An E-Meter shows them up and makes them confess their misdeeds.They are probably just compartments of the mind which, cut off, begin to act asthough they were persons.”Hubbard says there are actually two separate genetic lines that, in the historyof evolution, first came together in the mollusk, but have been contending fordominance ever since, even in human beings. “In the bivalve state, one findsthem at war with each other in an effort to attain sole command of the entirebivalve,” Hubbard writes. This primordial contest manifests itself in higherforms of life in such things as right- and left-handedness. “Your discussion ofthese incidents with the uninitiated in Scientology can produce havoc,” Hubbardwarns. “Should you describe the ‘Clam’ to someone, you may restimulate him tothe point of causing severe jaw hinge pain. One such victim, after hearing abouta clam death, could not use his jaws for three days.”HUBBARD’S THIRD WIFE was smart and poised, a decorous partner for him. She wasso slight and weightless that it might be easy to overlook her, but her Southernmanners and Texas accent concealed a hard and determined nature. Unlike Sara orPolly, Mary Sue was a true believer, a natural enforcer. One of Hubbard’sexecutives later described her as “pragmatic, cold, cunning, calculating,efficient, and fiercely loyal.” She had flinty blue eyes, a sharp, prominentnose, and a rare lopsided smile that would expose her uneven, slightly crossedfront teeth.[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_005_r1.jpg]Mary Sue and Ron with Diana, Quentin, Arthur, and SuzetteRon and Mary Sue, with their burgeoning family, began a restless search for anew home—for themselves and for the international headquarters of the church. In1955, they moved to Washington, DC, but they stayed only a few months beforemoving to London. Less than two years later, they were back in Washington,living in a dignified brownstone near Dupont Circle, across the street from theAcademy of Scientology. Hubbard was prospering once again, with mountingcommissions from the sale of E-Meters and training processes, and royalties fromsixty books in print. In 1956, his salary from the church was only five hundreddollars a month; but the following year, the church began paying him apercentage of its gross profits, and his income took a gigantic leap.In Washington, Hubbard set up visiting hours from four to six every afternoon,and made a point of warning the pilgrims who trod the path to his door not tomistake him for a god or a guru, “so knock off the idolizing.” And yet hecouldn’t resist exaggerating his status. Identifying himself as a nuclearphysicist, Hubbard published a book in 1957, All About Radiation, in which hepromoted a formula he called Dianazene, a mixture of nicotinic acid andvitamins, that was supposed to cure cancer as well as sunburns. “It should betaken daily,” he recommended, “with milk and chocolate.”Ron and Mary Sue had four children in six years. Diana, born in 1952, was theeldest and clearly the dominant one. She had her father’s red hair and agenerous splattering of freckles. Quentin, born two years later, was the onlyone who was not a radiant redhead; he was small with ash-blond hair, like MarySue, and would always be his mother’s favorite. Suzette was a year younger; shewas a cheerful child, but somewhat overshadowed by her big sister. The baby,Arthur, was born in 1958. Seen together, the Hubbard family made a vividimpression, with their ruddy complexions and their striking hair color.Although the children had a nanny, they spent much of their time unsupervised.School was an afterthought; it wasn’t until Diana demanded to learn how to writeher name that the children began their education. Mary Sue was a chilly presenceas a mother; she rarely cuddled or even touched her children, but in the earlyyears she would read to them—Mary Poppins, Winnie the Pooh, and Kipling’sstories—in her slight Texas twang. As she took on additional responsibility inScientology, she became even more removed; but Ron would hug the kids and tossthem in the air. The house echoed with his booming laugh. He taught the childrenhow to play “Chopsticks” on the piano and showed them card tricks with his quickhands and perfectly manicured fingernails. He would play records and dance withthe children to Beethoven or Ravel or Edvard Grieg’s Peer Gynt Suite—bold,soaring music. He liked to sing, and he would burst into “Farewell and Adieu toYou Fair Spanish Ladies,” and “Be Kind to Your Web-Footed Friends,” a children’ssong that is sung to the tune of “The Stars and Stripes Forever.” He wasfanatical about taking vitamins, and he made sure the children took theirs, aswell. Afterward, they would all roar to see who was the strongest.Hubbard was restless in Washington, and in 1959 he moved his family back toEngland, to a luxurious estate in Sussex called Saint Hill Manor, which hepurchased from the Maharajah of Jaipur. Hubbard employed an extensive householdstaff, including two butlers, a housekeeper, a nanny, a tutor for the children,a chauffeur, and maintenance workers for the estate. “Dr.” Hubbard presentedhimself to the curious British press as an experimental horticultural scientist;to prove it, he allowed a photograph to be published of himself staring intentlyat a tomato that was attached to an E-Meter. The headline in Garden News was“Plants Do Worry and Feel Pain.”[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_006_r1.jpg]Hubbard using the E-Meter on a tomato in 1968 to test whether it experiencespainThe grand mansion was a terrific playground for the children. It was actually aU-shaped castle with crenelated rooflines, ivy-covered walls, and rumors ofghosts. There were fifty-two rolling acres to play in, with rose gardens,goldfish ponds, and a lake. The house itself had sweeping staircases, elevators,and even secret rooms where the children could hide from the nanny. The childrenalso prowled through their mother’s closet. Left to herself, Mary Sue was anindifferent dresser, but Ron brought tailors from London carrying gorgeous boltsof cloth, and racks of clothing brought in from the top department stores, allin Mary Sue’s size. Her closet was full of sparkling gowns and shimmeringdresses. Trim and regal by nature, Mary Sue was a wonderful model, but shereally only dressed for him.Hubbard’s third-floor research room was the enticing inner sanctum; it waspainted royal blue, with a bear rug in front of the fireplace, and a privatebathroom that was redolent of the Spanish sandalwood soap he favored. Hubbardwould disappear into his office every day for hours and hours, alone with hisE-Meter, “mapping out the bank and looking for the next undercut,” as heexplained, meaning that he was trying to inventory the reactive mind anddiscover a path through its many snares.School was, as usual, a secondary consideration. The children would take a taxito class, when they actually went. Their father didn’t really believe in publiceducation, so he didn’t pressure them. Sometimes, they had a tutor, but it wasDiana who taught Suzette how to read. She didn’t want Suzette to suffer the sameembarrassment she had when she started school so far behind her peers. By theage of nine, Suzette was reading adult literature. She decided she wanted to bea writer, like her father. Quentin developed an obsession with airplanes, and hewould often persuade the nanny or the chauffeur to take him to Gatwick Airportinstead of to class, so he could watch the various aircraft taking off andlanding. He loved to stand near the runway with the heavy planes lumbering justoverhead. He was soon able to close his eyes and identify the make of the planestrictly by its sound.[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_007_r1.jpg]Hubbard at Saint Hill Manor in 1959 showing an E-Meter to his children, Quentin,Diana, Suzette, and ArthurIn school, other children would ask the older Hubbard kids about their fatherand what was going on in the castle. They realized that they didn’t actuallyknow. One day, Diana, Quentin, and Suzette marched into Hubbard’s office anddemanded, “What is this ‘Scientology’?” Hubbard put them all on a starterDianetics course.Scientology was in its formative stage, still unfurling from Hubbard’simaginative mind. This was a volatile moment in Hubbard’s life and thedevelopment of his movement. The fervent response of so many to his revelationsmust have added reality and substance to what otherwise might have seemed merefantasies. Not only was he inventing a new religion, he was also reinventinghimself as a religious leader. He was creating the legend of who he was in theminds of those who believed in him. And inevitably, he became imprisoned bytheir expectations.His followers lived in a state of constant anticipation, trading legends amongthemselves about the marvels they had experienced or heard about, andspeculating upon what was to come. Moments of magic and transcendence keptreason at bay. Ken Urquhart, who served as Hubbard’s butler and later as hissecretary—or “Communicator”—recalls coaching a “little old English lady” on aScientology training exercise. As he observed her, “I noticed her nice skin, hereyes, eyebrows. I noted that behind the skin on her forehead was the bone of herforehead, and I knew that behind that lay her brain. As I thought that thought,her forehead absolutely disappeared. I was looking directly at her brain. I wasfirst astounded and then quickly horrified. Here I was exposing her brain togerms and the cold. At once her forehead was back in place.”If Scientology really did bestow enhanced powers upon its adherents, Hubbardhimself—of all people—should be able to exercise them. Hubbard’s frailties wereobvious to everyone; among other things, his hands shook from palsy and he washard of hearing, constantly exclaiming, “What? What?” He sensed the presumptionsthat surrounded him. “Your friends,” he said one day to Urquhart as his bath wasbeing prepared, “might be curious as to why I employ somebody to open theshutters in my room when I can do it myself.” He meant that he should be able,by sheer mental power, to project his intention and the shutters would openthemselves. “Well, a lot of people would like me to appear in the sky over NewYork so as to impress the world. But if I were to do that I’d overwhelm a lot ofpeople. I’m not here to overwhelm.” Urquhart thought of saying that he wasperfectly willing to be overwhelmed in order to see such a demonstration, but hewasn’t altogether sure that Hubbard could actually do it. The failure ofHubbard’s followers to challenge him made them complicit in the creation of themythical figure that he became. They conspired to protect the image of L. RonHubbard, the prophet, the revelator, and the friend of mankind.On the other hand, there were moments when Hubbard seemed to be toying with thelimits of possibility. It was rumored that he could move the clouds around inthe sky or stir up dust devils in his wake. Urquhart remembers a time whenHubbard was talking to him while sitting in a chair more than an arm’s lengthaway. “My attention wandered,” he recalled. Suddenly, he felt a finger pokinghim in the ribs. “I came back. He was talking away, grinning and eyes twinkling.He had not moved his arms or gotten up from the chair.” Such ineffableexperiences seemed to add up to something, although it was not clear what thatmight be.Hubbard’s neighbors soon learned more about the new lord of the manor.Scientology’s expansion, coupled with the increasingly bold claims that Hubbardmade about the health benefits that could be expected, brought the organizationunder scrutiny by various governments. The first blow was a 1963 raid by USMarshals, acting on a warrant issued by the Food and Drug Administration toseize more than a hundred E-Meters stored in the Washington church. The FDAcharged that the labeling for the E-Meter suggested that it was effective indiagnosing and treating “all mental and nervous disorders and illnesses,” aswell as “psychosomatic ailments of mankind such as arthritis, cancer, stomachulcers, and radiation burns from atomic bombs, poliomyelitis, the common cold,etc.”2The IRS began an audit that would strip the church of its religious taxexemption in 1967. At the same time, an Australian government board of inquiryproduced a sweeping report that was passionate in its condemnation. “There aresome features of Scientology which are so ludicrous that there may be a tendencyto regard Scientology as silly and its practitioners as harmless cranks. To doso would be gravely to misunderstand the tenor of the Board’s conclusions,” thereport began, then emphatically added: “Scientology is evil, its techniquesevil, its practice a serious threat to the community, medically, morally andsocially; and its adherents sadly deluded and often mentally ill.” The reportadmitted that there were “transient gains” realized by some of the religion’sadherents, but said that the organization plays on those gains in order toproduce “a subservience amounting almost to mental enslavement.” As for Hubbardhimself, the board described him as “a man of restless energy” who is“constantly experimenting and speculating, and equally constantly he confusesthe two.” “Some of his claims are that … he has been up in the Van Allen Belt,that he has been on the planet Venus where he inspected an implant station, andthat he has been to Heaven. He even recommends a protein formula for feedingnon-breast fed babies—a mixture of boiled barley and corn syrup—stating that he‘picked it up in Roman days.’ ” Although Hubbard has “an insensate hostility” topsychiatrists and people in the field of mental health, the report noted, he ishimself “mentally abnormal,” evincing a “persecution complex” and “an imposingaggregation of symptoms which, in psychiatric circles, are strongly indicativeof a condition of paranoid schizophrenia with delusions of grandeur—symptomscommon to dictators.” The report led to a ban of Scientology in two Australianstates,3 and prompted similar inquiries in New Zealand, Britain, and SouthAfrica. Hubbard believed that the US Food and Drug Administration, along withthe FBI and CIA, were feeding slanderous information about the church to variousgovernments.In the midst of all this upheaval, in February 1966 Hubbard finally declaredanother “first Clear.” This time it was John McMaster, a dapper, blond SouthAfrican, in his mid-thirties, who was the director of the Hubbard GuidanceCenter at the church’s Saint Hill headquarters. Charming, ascetic, andwell-spoken, McMaster had dropped out of medical school to become an auditor. Heimmediately proved to be a far more urbane representative of Scientology thanHubbard. His wry manner made him a welcome guest on talk shows and on thelecture circuit, where he portrayed Scientology as a cool and nonthreateningroute to self-realization. Suddenly the idea of going Clear began to catch on.McMaster adopted a clerical outfit that befitted his designation as the church’sunofficial ambassador to the United Nations. At one point, Hubbard designatedhim Scientology’s first “pope.” It was a matter of puzzlement to Hubbard’sclosest associates, given Hubbard’s disparagement of homosexuals in his books,that he would enlist a person to serve as the church’s representative who wasobviously gay. “He was very pronounced in his affect,” one of Hubbard’s medicalofficers remembered. But Hubbard’s relationship to homosexuality was apparentlymore complicated in life than in theory.CONVINCED THAT the British, American, and Soviet governments were interested ingaining control of Scientology’s secrets in order to use them for evilintentions, Hubbard began looking for a safe harbor—ideally, a country that hecould rule over. England had taken steps to “curb the growth” of Scientology,and Hubbard took the hint. He also suffered from the damp weather. “I had beenill with pneumonia for the third time in England and on the suggestion of mydoctor was seeking a warmer climate for a short while in order to recover,” hesaid, in an unprompted explanation to the CIA. He resigned as Executive Directorof the Church of Scientology and sold his interests in the Hubbard Associationof Scientologists International, although he maintained actual control of theorganization through his innumerable telexes. He journeyed to Rhodesia, theSouth African republic that had recently declared its independence from theUnited Kingdom (it later became Zimbabwe). Isolated, diplomatically spurned, andsubject to international sanctions, the Rhodesian government served a clique ofwhite colonists who ruled over an insurgent black majority. To Hubbard, Rhodesiaseemed ripe for a takeover. He felt a kinship with the republic’s dashing andflamboyant founder, Cecil John Rhodes, who also had red hair and a taste forswashbuckling adventure. Hubbard believed he might have been Rhodes in aprevious life, although it’s unclear whether he knew that Rhodes was homosexual.Hubbard had a fantasy that he would be welcomed in Rhodesia, that the blackpopulation would embrace him like a brother, and that eventually he would becomeits leader, issuing passports and his own currency. However, the current primeminister, Ian Smith, was desperately trying to negotiate a settlement with theblack nationalist movement that would preserve white-minority rule. Hubbardthoughtfully wrote up a constitution for the government that he claimed wouldaccomplish just that, but he couldn’t get anyone to take it seriously.While Hubbard talked about his big plans for developing the country, thegovernment became increasingly suspicious of his motives and his resources.Ultimately, Hubbard’s visa was not renewed. “He told me Ian Smith was going tobe shot because he was a ‘Suppressive,’ ” John McMaster said. “The real reasonthat Hubbard was kicked out of Rhodesia was that his cheques bounced.”Hubbard returned to England with a new scheme. If the world’s governments werelining up against him, he would put himself beyond reach. Scientologists werewhispering about a clandestine “sea project” that their leader was planning. Hequietly began acquiring a small fleet of oceangoing vessels. Then he disappearedagain.This time, he went to Tangier, the Moroccan city on the Strait of Gibraltar,which was a famous hangout for hipsters and artists. There he began his researchon Operating Thetan Level Three (OT III), his “Wall of Fire.” Mary Sue and thechildren remained in England, but Hubbard wrote to her daily, complaining of abarking dog that was interrupting his work, and various ailments—a bad back, anda lung problem that emerged from a lingering cold. He admitted that he was“drinking lots of rum” and taking drugs—“pinks and grays”—while he was doing hisresearch. He would sign off on the letters, “Your Sugie.” Hubbard stayed only amonth in Tangier before moving to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, where one ofhis followers found him deeply depressed and surrounded by pills of all kinds.“I want to die,” he said. Alarmed, Mary Sue flew down to take care of him.In September 1967, Hubbard made a recording for his followers to explain hisabsence and inform them of important discoveries in his OT III research. “Allthis recent career has been relatively hard on this poor body,” he relates.“I’ve broken its back, broken its knee, and now I have a broken arm, because ofthe strenuousness of these particular adventures. One wonders then, well, if heis in such good shape what is he doing breaking up his body? Well, that is thetrouble. I have great difficulty getting down to the small power level of abody.”He also notes that he had directed Mary Sue to find out who was behind theattacks on Scientology that were turning the governments against theorganization. Mary Sue had hired “several professional intelligence agents,” whouncovered a conspiracy. “Our enemies on this planet are less than twelve men,”Hubbard discloses. “They own and control newspaper chains and they are oddlyenough directors in all the mental health groups in the world.” Their plan wasto “use mental health, which is to say psychiatric electric shock and prefrontallobotomy, to remove from their path any political dissenters.” For the firsttime, he openly talks about the Sea Organization, or Sea Org, an elite group whowould form the committed inner core of the religion, Hubbard’s disciples, aScientology clergy.HANA STRACHAN (now Hana Eltringham Whitfield) was one of the first youngrecruits admitted into the Sea Org. Her deranged and manipulative mother was afollower of Helena Blavatsky, the nineteenth-century spiritualist who was thefounder of the Theosophical Society. When Hana was about fifteen, she learnedthat Blavatsky had prophesied a new race that would arise in the Americas in the1950s; Hana was under the impression that it would be led by a man with redhair.Hana escaped her traumatic family situation to become a nurse in Johannesburg,South Africa. A medical student there gave her a copy of Dianetics. It madeimmediate sense to her. She went to the local organization and said she wantedto learn more. “There’s a course starting tonight,” she was told. In the hallwayof the office Hana noticed a photograph of Hubbard standing outside the SaintHill headquarters. She was transfixed by his red hair. This must be the manBlavatsky was talking about, she decided. “That sealed it for me,” she said. Shemoved to Saint Hill and became Clear #60. For three weeks she was in a state ofeuphoria, feeling slightly detached from her environment and her body. “This iswho we were in eons past,” she thought. She was convinced that Hubbard was areturned savior who would bring all humanity to an enlightened state.Slender and stately, Hana was one of the first thirty-five Sea Org recruits. Themission of the Sea Org, according to the contract she signed, is “to get ETHICSIN on this PLANET AND THE UNIVERSE.” She agreed to “subscribe to the discipline,mores and conditions of this group.… THEREFORE, I CONTRACT MYSELF TO THE SEAORGANIZATION FOR THE NEXT BILLION YEARS.”4Hana married another Sea Org member, an American named Guy Eltringham, but theywere separated when Hubbard ordered her to Las Palmas, where he was refitting anexhausted fishing trawler called the Avon River. The decks and the hold werecoated with decades of fish oil that had to be scraped away. During the twomonths the Avon River was in dry dock, Hubbard would often linger for dinnerwith his Sea Org crew, and afterward he would sit on the deck and regale themwith stories. Hubbard’s depression had lifted and he seemed completely incontrol—relaxed and confident, even jovial. The crew were mainly drinkingSpanish wines, but Hubbard favored rum and Coke—an eighth of a glass of Coke andseven-eighths rum—one after another through the evening. The heavens seemed veryclose in the dark harbor. Hubbard would point to the sky and say, “That is wherethe Fifth Invaders came from. They’re the bad guys, they’re the ones who put ushere.” He said he could actually spot their spaceships crossing in front of thestars, and he would salute them as they passed overhead, just to let them knowthat they had been seen.During a session with her auditor, Hana revealed the story of Madame Blavatsky’sprophecy of the red-haired man. Soon afterward, Hubbard came up on deck and gaveher an intense look. From that point on, she became his favorite. He appointedher the first female Sea Org lieutenant. That day, she had a photograph made ofherself in her Sea Org uniform—white shirt, dark tie and jacket, with a lanyardover one shoulder. She is young and elegant, her blond hair pulled back in aponytail. After that, she rose through the Sea Org ranks with astonishing speed,often wondering if the revelation about the red-haired man was responsible forher rapid promotions.Hubbard would drive over from his villa in Las Palmas to inspect the work on theAvon River. The lower holds of the ship were converted into offices and berthingspaces; new equipment—including radar and a gyrocompass—were installed, thescrew replaced, and the hydraulic system completely overhauled. Theinexperienced Sea Org members did most of the work, although Spanish laborersdid the welding and sandblasting. Whenever Hubbard spotted something wrong, hewould be instantly transformed from the jovial and avuncular figure the crewadored into a raging, implacable tyrant. Hana, who was serving asmaster-at-arms, would dread seeing the “Commodore”—as Hubbard titledhimself—arrive, since she felt responsible if anything went wrong. One day, whenthe Spanish workmen were painting a rust coat on the hull of the ship, shespotted Hubbard walking across the beach with his chief officer and his firstmate, smoking and chatting happily. Then he suddenly stopped. His eyes went intoslits and he began bellowing, “The rollers! The rollers!” Puzzled, Hana leanedover the side of the ship, then saw what had caught Hubbard’s attention: tinythreads poking through the paint, which had been left by the cheap rollers thatthe workmen were using. “As those threads decomposed, they would leave littleapertures for seawater to leak behind the rust coating,” she realized. “Itdestroyed the integrity of the entire rust coating, and that’s what Hubbard wasscreaming about as he lumbered toward the ship. And what amazed me was that hesaw it at forty to sixty feet away from the ship. Later on, I walked thatdistance from the ship to see if I could see those little hairs coming out ofthe rust coat. There was no way I could see them. That added to my feeling ofwonder and mystique about Hubbard.”IN TRUTH, Hubbard had very poor eyesight. Before the war, both the Naval Academyand the Naval Reserve had rejected him because of his vision, and all during thewar he wore glasses. In 1951, when he was being evaluated for a medicaldisability, his vision tested at 20/200 for each eye, correctable to 20/20 withglasses, much the same as it had been before the war. The examiner noted, “Eyestire easily, has worn all types of glasses but claims he sees just as wellwithout as with glasses.” Was that even possible? Eyesight does change over theyears, but Hubbard’s eyes were astigmatic—meaning they were more football-shapedthan round—and not likely to have improved, certainly not dramatically. And yetmany of Hubbard’s associates testify to his keen eyesight. Without glasses,Hubbard would have been legally blind; perhaps that’s what he was referring towhen he said he had cured himself of blindness after the war. But, clearly hiseye examination showed different results.Hubbard had written in Dianetics that the eyesight of a Clear gradually improvesto optimum perception. And yet, he admitted elsewhere that his vision was so badin the postwar years that he could scarcely see his typewriter to write. He woreglasses and early versions of contact lenses. Through the use of Dianeticprocessing, he says, his eyes began to change. Many noticed that Hubbard had ahabit of squinting, which has the effect of pressing astigmatic eyeballs into arounder shape, which might momentarily improve his vision. He theorized that“astigmatism, a distortion of image, is only an anxiety to alter the image.” Oneday, for instance, he was reading an American Medical Association report andcouldn’t make it out at all. He thought he might have to resort to using amagnifying glass. Then he realized that the reason he couldn’t read it was thathe wasn’t willing to confront what it said. “I threw it aside, picked up a noveland the print was perfect.”Hubbard would sometimes chastise members of his crew about their dependence oneyeglasses, which he said were an admission of “overts”—transgressions againstthe group. One night as the fleet was sailing in the Caribbean, he looked at theyoung woman serving him dinner, Tracy Ekstrand, whose glasses were sliding downher nose in the tropical heat. “You’re doing yourself an aesthetic disservice,”he pronounced. She was mortified and stopped wearing glasses that night.Although she was still able to move from room to room and serve meals, hervision remained quite blurred. Some weeks later, as Hubbard was retiring for thenight, he looked at her again. He held up his pack of cigarettes a foot in frontof her face and asked if she could read the bold capital letters: “KOOL.”Flustered by the personal attention from the Commodore, Ekstrand mumbled thename of the cigarettes. “There’s been a shift!” he declared triumphantly, thenwent to bed. Ekstrand was shaken. “I remained outside his door for some minutes,dumbfounded and unsure how to react,” she recalled. “This time there was noquestion. He was wrong. He was imagining improvement and success withScientology where there had been none.”All of Hubbard’s senses were painfully acute. Each day, every room he inhabitedhad to be dusted to the point that it would pass a white-glove test. He wasfanatically clean but also hypersensitive to soap, so that his clothes had to berinsed up to fifteen times, and even then he would complain that he could smellthe detergent. His chef had to switch from cooking on stainless steel toCorningware because Hubbard complained of the taste of metal in his food. Thesestories were traded among his disciples as more evidence of his superhumanpowers of discernment.ACCORDING TO SEVERAL Sea Org members, while he was in Las Palmas, Hubbard fellin love with another woman—Yvonne Gillham, the ship’s public relations officer.(She would later go on to start the Celebrity Centre in Hollywood.) She had awide smile, large hazel eyes, and a short pixie haircut, bearing a resemblanceto Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music. Gillham combined a down-to-earthpersonality with a touch of class that came from growing up in the high societyof Queensland, Australia. Inevitably, Hubbard demanded that she accompany him onthe high seas. Gillham had three young children at Saint Hill, and she had onlyjoined the Sea Org on Hubbard’s pledge that they could stay with her, butHubbard’s desire for her had become a prison, one that she was too loyal toescape.[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_008_r1.jpg]Yvonne Gillham in a head shot she used during her modeling career, circa 1952Hubbard was fifty-six years old in the fall of 1967, when he set sail with hisyouthful crew. There was no destination or purpose other than to wander. Hubbardwas by now portly, ruddy-faced, and jowly; his swept-back, once-red hair hadturned strawberry blond. His eyes, which have been described as blue or green byvarious observers, were actually gray, like seawater, casting an odd flatnessover his aspect. Two strong lines transected his face: a deep furrow between hiseyebrows, matching the notch below his nose and the cleft in his chin, and hisduckbill lips, which were his most prominent feature. Once aboard, he dressed invarious naval uniforms befitting his self-appointed station as Commodore of thefleet, with lots of braid and crossed anchors on his cap.There were three ships in Hubbard’s navy. In addition to the Avon River, therewas a schooner called the Enchanter, and the 3,200-ton flagship, a flat-bottomcattle ferry originally called the Royal Scotsman, which was renamed the RoyalScotman because of a clerical error in the registration. The smokestack wasemblazoned with the initials “LRH.”Hubbard spent most of his time in the air-conditioned captain’s cabin on thepromenade deck of the Royal Scotman, surrounded by windows to take in the oceanvistas. He rarely drank on the ship, except perhaps to take the chill off on acold night on the bridge. Drugs were nowhere in evidence. His days were largelysolitary, passed in auditing himself and writing policy papers. His office onthe top deck was called the Research Room. It was behind a pair of highlypolished wooden doors with brass handles. The floor was a bright red linoleumcovered with Oriental rugs; there was a massive mahogany desk and a huge mirrorabove a fireplace. Crew members passing by on the upper deck could see himwriting with his usual rapidity on foolscap, using a green pen for policybulletins and a red one for the “tech”—that is, his vast corpus of courseworkand procedures that comprised Scientology’s spiritual technology. His restlessleg would be jiggling as his hand raced across the page, faultlessly, inhandsome, legible script. For other writing, he turned back to his typewriter.“I think he was doing automatic writing,” said Jim Dincalci, one of his medicalofficers. “The pages would be flying. When he came out of it, he would blink hiseyes, as if coming awake, and he did this thing with his lips, smacking.”Hubbard and Mary Sue would dine in his office between eight and ten p.m.Sometime after three in the morning, Dincalci would give Hubbard a massage andhe would go to sleep. After that, everyone on the ship had to be quiet untilHubbard awakened, sometime before noon, and remain absolutely mute while he wasauditing himself on the E-Meter.In Hubbard’s opinion, the device operated just below the level of consciousawareness; it somehow knew what you were thinking before you did. It was eerilycompelling. Anything that registered on the meter was seen as being significant.The trick was divining what the needle was saying. Sometimes the reaction was soviolent that the needle would pound back and forth like a berserk windshieldwiper—you could hear it snapping against the pins at either end. Hubbard calledthis a “rock slam.” Anyone who registered such a reaction was deemed psychoticand certain to have committed crimes against Scientology; if that person was inthe Sea Org, he would be punished automatically, the crime to be sorted outlater.After initially resisting the concept of past lives, Hubbard became passionatelyinterested in the subject. “We Come Back” was the motto of the Sea Org. Hubbardbegan recalling many of his own previous existences, which the E-Metervalidated. He claimed to have been a contemporary of Machiavelli’s, and he wasstill upset that the author of The Prince stole his line “The end justifies themeans.” He said he had been a marshal to Joan of Arc and Tamburlaine’s wife. Hetold stories about driving a race car in the alien Marcab civilization millionsof years before. He came to believe that in some of his past lives on thisplanet, he had buried treasure in various locations, so he launched anexpedition to unearth his ancient hoards. He called it the Mission into Time. Heselected a small crew to go on the Avon River. Because he wanted to keep themission secret, he had two long rafts fashioned, which could be rowed ashoreunder cover of darkness and pulled up on the beach near where he imagined hisancient treasure was buried. When Hana Eltringham saw she wasn’t on the list,she wrote Hubbard, pleading to be included, saying she would be willing toperform any duty. To her surprise, Hubbard appointed her chief officer.One very dark, overcast night in 1968, the Avon River dropped anchor on thewestern coast of Sicily, in the bay of Castellammare del Golfo, beside a steeppromontory topped by an ancient watchtower. Hubbard gave his “missionaires” atreasure map he had drawn up based on his past-life recollections. The crew setout in one of the rafts toward the rocky shoreline, lugging ropes, shovels, andmetal detectors. Giggling and tripping over each other, they scrambled up aten-foot cliff. It was so dark they couldn’t see more than a foot in front oftheir faces. Each had a hand on another’s shoulder as they picked their waythrough stands of cactus along the rocky outcropping. At one point, the leaderof the expedition bumped into a cow. The cow started mooing, then a dog barked,and a light went on in a house nearby. Everyone stood dead still until the scenequieted down. Finally, the clouds parted enough for the moon to shine through.The missionaires found some old bricks they thought might have been the ruins ofa castle beside the watchtower. The metal detectors found nothing.Hubbard decided to come along the next day to inspect the site himself. “Yes,yes, this is the place!” he said excitedly. He explained the absence of treasureby saying that it must have been hidden in a portion of the ruined castle thathad fallen into the sea.The expedition moved on to Sardinia, where Hubbard claimed to have had an affairwith the priestess in a temple—“liaisons in the moonlight,” he told hisenchanted missionaires—when he was a Carthaginian sailor. “We had a lot ofgood-looking girls in Carthage but they didn’t come up to her.” The Avon Rivernext stopped in Calabria, on the toe of Italy, where Hubbard had buried gold inhis days as a tax collector in the Roman Empire. None was found, however.Near Tunis, where the missionaires hoped to dive on the ruins of an ancientunderwater city, Hubbard found fault with the captain of the Avon River, Joe vanStaden, and booted him off the ship. Eltringham was sitting at her desk on the’tween deck when Hubbard called her into his office and told her she was the newcaptain of the four-hundred-ton trawler, starting in the morning. Eltringhamwent back to her desk and put her head in her hands. She was twenty-six yearsold. Everything she knew about sailing she had learned from Hubbard. To hiscredit, he had been a good teacher. He had taken a dozen members of the originalSea Org crew and taught them the semaphore code, how to navigate using asextant, and basic laws of the sea. But she knew nothing about running theengine room, or operating the electronics on the bridge, or docking a ship. Halfan hour later, Hubbard stuck his head out of his office and beckoned to her. Hewas holding an E-Meter. Standing in the doorway where everyone could see them,Hubbard handed her the cans. Then he screwed up his eyes and demanded, “Recall atime you were last a captain.” As Eltringham closed her eyes and began tofree-associate, Hubbard watched the needle on the E-Meter.“What’s that?” he asked, when the needle suddenly dropped.“That was sometime on a ship somewhere and the ship was sinking,” Eltringhamresponded.“Okay, go back earlier.” A moment later, he asked her again, “What’s that?”“That’s just a lot of confusion. I’m in a cabin with a lot of other people.Something urgent is going on.”Hubbard asked her to talk more about it. Eltringham began to see the incidentmore clearly. “We were in some kind of spaceship,” she said. “We were underattack and—oh my God!—I can see a planet down there! And the planet’s on fire!And something is shooting at us and—oh my God!—the spaceship exploded!”Hubbard asked her to tell the story several more times to destimulate theincident. Then he asked Eltringham how she was feeling.“I’m fine, sir.”Hubbard screwed up his eyes again. “Do you have any other thoughts about it?”Eltringham realized that he was looking for a floating needle, but she wasn’table to give it to him.“Okay, one more question. Are you a loyal officer?”“I don’t know what you mean by that,” Eltringham said. “I’m loyal to you, andI’m an officer.”Hubbard said, “All right, that’s as far as we’ll go this time.”Eltringham walked up on the deck and tried to take in what Hubbard meant.Suddenly it came to her. Hubbard wasn’t talking about the present. He wasreferring to the time in her visualization. Some catastrophe must have happened.Eltringham realized that it must have been her planet that was being attacked,and she had been trying to save it.A few minutes later, Hubbard came up on deck and stood beside her. She turned tohim and said, “Yep, you’re right, sir. I was a loyal officer. I am.”Hubbard beamed.THE AVON RIVER WAS traveling down the east side of Corsica when Hubbard gatheredhis crew and read them a new revelation. Nearby, in the north of Corsica, therewas an underground space station, he said. He even provided the coordinates.There, a secret doorway would open by a palm print on the lock—but only oneperson’s hand would do the trick. Hubbard smiled suggestively, without sayingwhose hand that would be. The rock face would slide open, revealing an immensecavern harboring a mother ship and hundreds of smaller craft, all fueled andready to go.The space station would remain undiscovered, however. Word arrived that theRoyal Scotman had run into trouble with the port authorities in Valencia, whereHubbard had hoped to make a permanent base. He furiously abandoned theexpedition and ordered the Avon River to make haste to Valencia before the RoyalScotman was forcibly expelled from the Spanish harbor. The crew was bitterlydisappointed that they would miss uncovering the space station. “If there’stime, we’ll come back,” Hubbard promised.After making amends with the port captain in Valencia, Hubbard threw a party toreport on the Mission into Time. He was loud and affected, in what Eltringhamprivately called his “full pantomime mode.” Such moments made her cringe. Shehid in the back of the crowd. She genuinely revered Hubbard, but when he wasstrutting in front of his acolytes, he could become comically self-important, aparody of himself. His eyes rolled, his body language was inappropriate andweird, and his hands flew around meaninglessly in odd directions. Sometimes hespoke with a British accent or a Scottish brogue. In her opinion, hisperformance was ridiculous, but also disturbing. If the man she regarded as asavior was a “nut case,” what did that say about his teachings? What did it sayabout her, that she idolized him while at the same time harboring these illicitfeelings of shame? No one else seemed to share these warring perceptions. Shefelt very much alone.Hubbard regaled the crowd with the story of his romance with the templepriestess in Sardinia when he was a Carthaginian sailor. “The girl would say,‘Hey, how are YOU?’ and all the other guys didn’t stand a chance for a while. Ifyou’ve got enough war vessels and you’re making enough dough, girls usually saythis.”He said he had recently remembered a secret passageway into the temple.“Missions were sent ashore to survey and map the area to see if they couldn’tdiscover this old secret entrance to the temple.” If they found it, that wouldprove the truthfulness of his past-life recollections, what he called the “wholetrack memory.”“And now,” he said, “I’m going to call on Hana Eltringham to tell you whether ornot it was a positive result.”Mortified, Eltringham stood in front of her colleagues and ratified Hubbard’sfindings. “We did find the tunnel,” she said, mentioning a ditch that themissionaires had found, which had a tile base. “So that was totally proven andaccurate.”THE ANTICIPATION SURROUNDING the release of OT III was intense, so when Hubbardfinally made it available to a select group of Sea Org members, in March 1968aboard the Royal Scotman in Valencia, a thrill radiated through the entire crew.The saga of Hubbard’s research in Tangier and Las Palmas led them to think thatthis was the breakthrough that would lead to the salvation of the planet.They—the Sea Org—would be the vanguard of this movement, newly empowered by therevelations that Hubbard promised.In a lecture aboard the ship, Hubbard said that in researching OT III, he haduncovered two “incidents”—which, for him, meant implants—that prevented thetansfrom being free. Incident One was a kind of Garden of Eden fall from grace thatoccurred four quadrillion years ago, which is when Hubbard dates the origin ofthe universe. Before Incident One, thetans were in a pure, godlike state.Suddenly, there was a loud snap and a flood of light. A chariot appeared,trailed by a trumpeting cherub; then darkness. This incident marked the momentwhen thetans became separated from their original static condition and createdthe physical universe of matter, energy, space, and time (MEST). In the process,they lost awareness of their immortality.Incident Two is central to the OT III saga. This one took place seventy-fivemillion years ago in the Galactic Confederacy, which was composed of seventy-sixplanets and twenty-six stars. “The world we live in now replicates thecivilization of that period,” Hubbard said. “People at that particular time andplace were walking around in clothes which looked very remarkably like theclothes they wear this very minute.… The cars they drove looked exactly thesame, and the trains they ran looked the same, and the boats they had looked thesame. Circa nineteen-fifty, nineteen-sixty.”A tyrannical overlord named Xenu ruled the Confederacy. “He was a Suppressive toend all Suppressives,” Hubbard told his followers. Xenu had been chosen by akind of Praetorian guard called the Loyal Officers, but they realized that theirleader was wicked and they decided to remove him. Xenu had other plans, Hubbardsaid. “He took the last moments he had in office to really goof the floof.” Xenuand a few evil conspirators—mainly psychiatrists—fed false information to thepopulation to draw them into centers where Xenu’s troops could destroy them.“One of the mechanisms they used was to tell them to come in for an income-taxinvestigation,” Hubbard related. “So in they went, and the troops startedslaughtering them.” The preferred method was to shoot a needle into a lung,paralyzing the thetan with an injection of frozen alcohol and glycol. The frozenbodies were packed into boxes and loaded onto space planes, which resembled theDC-8 jetliner. “No difference—except the DC-8 had fans—propellers—on it and thespace plane didn’t.” In this fashion, billions of thetans were transported toTeegeeack, the planet now called Earth, where they were dropped into volcanoesand then blown up with hydrogen bombs.Thetans are immortal, however. Freed from their corporeal incarnations, theyfloated along on the powerful winds created by the explosion. Then they weretrapped in an electronic ribbon and placed in front of a “three-D, supercolossal motion picture” for thirty-six days, during which time they weresubjected to images called R6 implants. “These pictures contain God, the Devil,angels, space opera, theaters, helicopters, a constant spinning, a spinningdancer, trains and various scenes very like modern England. You name it, it’s inthis implant.” The implant included all world religions and “a motion picturestudio” complete with screenwriters.Xenu didn’t have much time to gloat over his victory. Some Loyal Officersremained, scattered around the galaxy. There was a civil war, and within a year,the Loyal Officers had captured Xenu and locked him up in an electrified wirecage buried in a mountain. “He is not likely ever to get out,” Hubbard said.Because Teegeeack was a dumping ground for thetans, it became known as thePrison Planet, “the planet of ill repute.” The Galactic Confederacy abandonedthe area, although various invaders have appeared throughout the millennia. Butthese free-floating thetans remain behind. They are the souls of people who havebeen dead for seventy-five million years. They attach themselves to livingpeople because they no longer have free will. There can be millions of themclustered inside a single person’s body. Auditing for Scientologists at OT IIIand above would now focus on eliminating the “body thetans”—or BTs—that stand inthe way of spiritual progress.More than individual salvation was at stake. Hubbard said that the Prison Planethad been civilized many times in the past, but it always arrived at the sameend: utter annihilation. No matter how sophisticated mankind became, there was atrigger implanted in the imprisoned thetans that led them to blow themselves topieces before they could escape their fate and go on to higher levels ofexistence. The goal of Scientology was to “clear the planet” and save humanityfrom its endless cycle of self-destruction.Hubbard never really explained how he came by these revelations. “We won’t gointo that,” he told the crew, saying only that he was fortunate to have somehowescaped the cataclysm so many eons ago. “You are the chosen,” he told them. “Youare the Loyal Officers. We made the agreement way back when that we would allget together again. This time no one is going to stop us.”Eltringham and two dozen Sea Org members had the honor of being the very firstgroup to view the OT III materials. They went in one by one to read thedocuments. When she came to the part about the Loyal Officers, Eltringhamimmediately understood that this was what Hubbard had been talking about: sheinstinctively felt that she had been among them. At the same time, the accountseemed incredible to her, bizarre and completely unfathomable.Her task now was to take the materials into her cabin, along with an E-Meter,and audit herself to discover and expel body thetans. Once they were exposed andconfronted, Hubbard promised, they would take flight, “lickety-split.” She beganeach day with a session, but she couldn’t locate any BTs. At the end of the weekshe turned in her folder and asked for help. She went through review auditing,but it was no use. She began to worry that she was unauditable, what Hubbardcalled a Dog Case or a Degraded Being—someone who had committed so many misdeedsas to be beyond help. It was all her fault.Despite the fact that he was only fourteen, Quentin—LRH’s heir apparent—wasamong the first to be initiated into the OT III mysteries. Everyone on the shipknew what was happening, and people would hover near the cabin where thematerials were held to see the expression on the faces of those who had beenexposed to it. When Quentin emerged, he was pale, and he threw up violently.After that, he was never as sunny as he used to be.TO MAKE SURE his orders were carried out, Hubbard created the Commodore’sMessengers Organization. In the beginning, the Messengers were four youngteenage girls, including Yvonne Gillham’s two daughters, Terri and Janis, whowere thirteen and eleven years old; Annie Tidman, twelve; and, briefly,Hubbard’s youngest daughter, Suzette, who was thirteen at the time. Soon,several more teenage girls joined them, and Suzette went to work on the decks.Two of the girls were always posted outside Hubbard’s office, waiting to takehis handwritten directives to the mimeograph machine or deliver his orders inperson. He instructed them to parrot his exact words and tone of voice when theywere delivering one of his directives—to inform the captain what time to setsail, for instance, or to tell a member of the crew he was “a fucking asshole”if he had displeased him. Hubbard allowed them to create their own uniforms, soin warmer climates they attired themselves in white hot pants, halter tops, andplatform shoes. When the Commodore moved around the ship, one or more Messengerstrailed behind him, carrying his hat and an ashtray, lighting his cigarettes,and quickly moving a chair into place if he started to sit down. People lived infear of Hubbard’s teenage minions. They had to call the Messenger “sir” even ifshe was a twelve-year-old girl. (That practice has continued in the Sea Org. Allsenior officials are referred to as “sir,” regardless of gender.) “They held thepower of God in their little hands, their little lips,” Eltringham recalled.The relationship between Hubbard and these girls was intimate but not overtlysexual. They prepared his bath when he retired and would sit outside his roomuntil he awakened and called out, “Messenger!” They would help him out of bed,light his cigarette, run his shower, prepare his toiletries, and help him dress.Some of the children had parents on the ship, others were there alone, but ineither case Hubbard was their primary caretaker—and vice versa. When the girlsbecame old enough to start wearing makeup, Hubbard was the one who showed themhow to apply it. He also helped them do their hair.While he was on the ship, Hubbard was working out a code of Scientology ethics.He began with the idea that man is basically good. Even a criminal leaves cluesto his crime, because he wishes for someone to stop his unethical behavior,Hubbard theorized. Similarly, a person who has accidentally hurt himself orgotten ill is “putting ethics in on himself” in order to lessen the damage hedoes to others or to his environment. These were testaments to the basic longingof all people to live decent, worthy lives.Good and evil actions can be judged only by understanding what Hubbard termedthe Eight Dynamics. The First Dynamic is the Self and its urge toward existence.The Second Dynamic is Sex, which includes the sexual act as well as the familyunit. The Third Dynamic is the Group—any school, or class, organization, city,or nation. The Fourth Dynamic is Mankind. The Fifth Dynamic is the urge towardexistence of all living creatures, including vegetables and grass—“anythingdirectly and intimately motivated by life.” The Sixth Dynamic is the matter,energy, space, and time that compose the reality we live in. The Seventh Dynamicis the Spiritual, which must be obtained before expanding into the EighthDynamic, which is called Infinity or God. The Scientology mantra for judgingethical behavior is “the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics”—aformula that can excuse quite a number of crimes.Every individual or group moves through stages, which Hubbard calls EthicsConditions, that incline toward either survival or collapse. They range from thehighest state, Power, to the lowest, Confusion. The way to determine whatcondition one is in at any given moment is through statistics, compiled eachThursday at two p.m. For a Scientology church, the relevant statistic might behow much money it is bringing in. The “org” that brings in less money week afterweek is in a condition of Non-Existence, which, plotted on a graph, isrepresented as a steeply plummeting line. A level or slightly declining lineindicates a condition of Emergency. Slightly up is Normal; sharply up isAffluence. Every Scientology organization, and every member of its staff,henceforth would be judged by the implacable weekly statistics. Hubbard warnedhis charges, “You have to establish an ethics presence hard. Otherwise, you’rejust gonna be wrapped around a telegraph pole.”The years at sea were critical ones for the future of Scientology. Even asHubbard was inventing the doctrine, each of his decisions and actions wouldbecome enshrined in Scientology lore as something to be emulated—his cigarettesmoking, for instance, which is still a feature of the church’s culture at theupper levels, as are his 1950s habits of speech, his casual misogyny, hisaversion to perfume and scented deodorants, and his love of cars and motorcyclesand Rolex watches. More significant is the legacy of his belittling behaviortoward subordinates and his paranoia about the government. Such traits stampedthe religion as an extremely secretive and sometimes hostile organization thatsaw enemies on every corner.Because Hubbard viewed the world that way, he awakened suspicion that there mustbe something very dangerous about Scientology. One by one, ports began turningaway the fleet. It had begun with Gibraltar in 1967, when the ship was refusedassistance during a heavy storm in the strait. England banned foreignScientologists from entering the country for study in July 1968 and declaredHubbard an undesirable alien. Hubbard took out his frustration on his crew. Heassigned Yvonne Gillham a condition of Non-Existence and reduced her to a“swamper,” which he defined as “one who cleans up.” Her hands became raw andgnarled. “She was like Cinderella,” a friend recalled, “always scrubbing.”While the ships were docked in Valencia, a storm arose. Hubbard happened to beaboard the Avon River when he noticed that the Royal Scotman had torn free fromone of its mooring lines. He screamed that someone should hoist the anchor andstart the engines, but before the crew reacted, the big ship crashed against thedock, damaging its prop. Although the ship was not badly damaged, Hubbardassigned the crew and the Royal Scotman itself to a condition of Liability,which is below Non-Existence on his ethics scale. Hubbard stayed aboard the AvonRiver and steamed off to Marseilles until the Royal Scotman was returned tofavor. Mary Sue was made the captain and ordered to retrain the crew and spruceup the ship to an acceptable state. No one could bathe or change clothes formonths. The crew wore dirty gray rags on their left arms, which signaled theirdegraded status. Even Mary Sue’s snappish Corgi, Vixie, had a rag around itscollar, and the ship itself wore a bracelet of gray tarpaulins around itsfunnel. An Ethics Officer walked the decks actually swinging a mace.Despite the squalid conditions, Mary Sue ran the ship with a minimum ofhysteria, earning her the respect and loyalty of many aboard. Without Hubbard,the mood lightened. Mary Sue used to have parties in her cabin with CandySwanson, the children’s tutor, and two men they were sweet on. They danced toJimi Hendrix records. But when Hubbard returned, the party was over.A YOUNG MAN with a gift for languages named Belkacem Ferradj joined the Sea Orgwhen the ship docked briefly in Algiers in 1968. Hubbard, surrounded by hisMessengers, had made an immediate impression on Ferradj. He was dressed like anadmiral, and he spoke with a broad American accent. A golden glow seemed toemanate from his large head. Mary Sue struck Ferradj as “gorgeous,” with long,curly hair and piercing eyes, but he thought she was “the most secretive personin the world.” When the ship sailed in July, Ferradj was aboard, having signedhis billion-year contract with the Sea Org.Ferradj became close to Hubbard’s sixteen-year-old daughter, Diana. She haddeveloped into a glamorous young woman, with flowing red hair and pale skinshowered with freckles. She played the grand piano in the family dining room onthe ship. Some saw her as imperious, a princess, but Ferradj, who was four yearsolder than Diana, was smitten. When Hubbard found out about the relationship, hesummoned Ferradj to the poop deck. Ferradj said Hubbard greeted him with a blowto the jaw. “I hit the bulkhead of the ship and slumped to the deck,” herecalled. “I don’t know if it was because I was an Arab or what. I left indisgrace.”When Otto Roos, a Sea Org executive from Holland, failed to lash a steel cableto a bollard on the dock during a terrible storm in Tunisia, Hubbard ordered himthrown from the ship’s bridge into the sea, a height of about four stories. HanaEltringham wrote a concerned report to Hubbard that night, explaining that thestorm had been so furious that Roos simply couldn’t hang on when trying tosecure the ship. The report was returned to her with the comment “Never questionLRH.”5Roos survived his punishment, only to set a dismal precedent. After that,overboardings became routine, but mostly from the lower poop deck. Nearly everymorning, when the crew was mustered, there would be a list of those sentenced togo over the side, even in rough seas. They would be fished out and hauled backonboard through the old cattle doors that led to the hold. The overboardingscontributed to the decision of the Greek government to expel the Scientologycrew from Corfu in March 1969. That didn’t stop the practice. None exceptHubbard family members were spared. John McMaster, the second “first Clear,” wastossed over the side six times, breaking his shoulder on the last occasion. Heleft the church not long afterward. Eltringham had to stand with Hubbard and hisaides on the deck when the punishments were meted out. If the crewman seemedinsufficiently cowed by the prospect, Hubbard would have his hands and feetbound. Whitfield remembered one American woman, Julia Lewis Salmen, sixty yearsold, a longtime Scientology executive, who was bound and blindfolded beforebeing thrown overboard. “She screamed all the way down,” Eltringham said. “Whenthe sound stopped, Hubbard ordered a deck hand to jump in after her. Had he not,I think Julia may have drowned.”Hubbard chose a different punishment for another of the older members of thecrew, Charlie Reisdorf. He and two other Sea Org crew were made to race eachother around the rough, splintery decks while pushing peanuts with their noses.“They all had raw, bleeding noses, leaving a trail of blood behind them,” asenior auditor recalled. The entire crew was ordered to watch the spectacle.“Reisdorf was in his late fifties, probably. His two daughters were Messengers;they were eleven or twelve at the time, and his wife was there also. It was hardto say which was worse to watch: this old guy with a bleeding nose or his wifeand kids sobbing and crying and being forced to watch this. Hubbard was standingthere, calling the shots, yelling, ‘Faster, faster!’ ”Hubbard increasingly turned his wrath on children, who were becoming a nuisanceon the ship. He thought that they were best raised away from their parents, whowere “counter-intention” to their children. As a result, he became theironly—stern as well as neglectful—parent. Children who committed minorinfractions, such as laughing inappropriately or failing to remember aScientology term, would be made to climb to the crow’s nest, at the top of themast, four stories high, and spend the night, or sent to the hold and made tochip rust. A rambunctious four-year-old boy named Derek Greene, an adopted blackchild, had taken a Rolex watch belonging to a wealthy member of the Sea Org anddropped it overboard. Hubbard ordered him confined in the chain locker, a closedcontainer where the massive anchor chain is stored. It was dark, damp, and cold.There was a danger that the child could be mutilated if the anchor wasaccidentally lowered or slipped. Although he was fed, he was not given blanketsor allowed to go to the bathroom. He stayed sitting on the chain for two daysand nights. The crew could hear the boy crying. His mother pleaded with Hubbardto let him out, but Hubbard reminded her of the Scientology axiom that childrenare actually adults in small bodies, and equally responsible for their behavior.Other young children were sentenced to the locker for infractions—such aschewing up a telex—for as long as three weeks. Hubbard ruled that they wereSuppressive Persons. One little girl, a deaf mute, was placed in the locker fora week because Hubbard thought it might cure her deafness.Hubbard explained to Hana Eltringham that the punishments were meant to raisethe level of “confront” in order to deal with the evil in the universe. Onemember of Eltringham’s crew on the Avon River, Terry Dickinson, a jocularAustralian electrician, made the mistake of failing to order a part for theship-to-shore radio. Hubbard sent a handwritten note to Eltringham ordering herto keep Dickinson awake until the part arrived and the radio was properlyinstalled. If the crewman fell asleep, he would be expelled. Eltringham guiltilycarried out the order, but she knew the hapless Dickinson couldn’t make it onhis own, so she stayed awake with him for five days and nights, pouring coffeedown his throat, walking him up and down the beach, and consoling him as he weptand said he couldn’t take it anymore. Eltringham believed she was savingDickinson’s soul, as well as her own, but he left shortly after that incident,“a broken man.” Later, Hubbard wrote a note explaining that Dickinson “did nothave the confront to see this through.”“You would say to yourself, ‘Why didn’t you do anything? Why didn’t you speakout?’ ” Eltringham later remarked. “You see, I was a true believer. I believedthat Hubbard knew what he was doing. I, unfortunately, believed that he knewwhat it was going to take to help everyone in the world and that, even though Ididn’t understand, it was my duty to follow and support what he was doing. Noneof us spoke out. None of us did anything.”IN THE SHIP’S LOG of December 8, 1968, Hubbard mentions an organization he callsSMERSH, a name taken from James Bond novels. Hubbard describes it as a “hiddengovernment…that aspired to world domination!” Psychiatry is the dominating forcebehind this sinister institution. “Recently a check showed that we had neverseen or heard of an ‘insane’ person who had not been in their hands,” Hubbardwrites. “And the question arises, is there any insanity at all? That is notmanufactured by them?” He said that SMERSH had made one big mistake, however; itattacked Scientology. He vowed revenge.Hubbard had been wooing a young Florida woman, Elizabeth Gablehouse, to join theSea Org. She had come from a prominent family in Tallahassee, Florida, and hadstudied in Europe. She spoke French, German, and Spanish. She had admirablesocial skills; moreover, she was a redhead, always a stamp of pre-eminence inHubbard’s book. Finally, Kit agreed to join the Royal Scotman in 1969, just asthe ship was being expelled from Corfu. She was soon appointed to the“Missionaires Elite Unit.” Hubbard already had an assignment in mind for her.Hubbard set a course for Cagliari, on the Italian island of Sardinia. On theway, he personally tutored her in his plan to take over the World Federation forMental Health, which was headquartered in Geneva. Hubbard had learned that theorganization had never bothered to actually incorporate itself in Switzerland.His grand idea was to set up an office in Bern, the capital, posing as anAmerican delegation of the WFMH bent on reforming the organization from within.The true scheme was to establish a presence in the country long enough toincorporate as the WFMH; and then, posing as the actual mental healthorganization, go to the United Nations with a plan for enforced euthanization ofthe “useless or unfixable” elements of society. Hubbard predicted that theoutcry that would surely follow would turn the world against the WFMH. It wouldbe a powerful strike against his most formidable enemy, SMERSH.All the way to Sardinia Hubbard drilled Kit in the history of the healthorganization, its former presidents, and the policies it supported, such aselectroshock therapy. Kit didn’t need to be persuaded about the dangers of thatpractice; her own mother had been subjected to electroshock in the 1940s,without her consent, as treatment for postpartum depression. After that, hermother suffered from amnesia and a fear of change and losing control.By the time the Royal Scotman docked in Cagliari, Kit was well schooled. She andanother Sea Org member, Mary Pat Shelley, a trained Shakespearian actress fromCincinnati, traveled to Bern. They set up an office, purchased furniture, andcovered the walls with phony certificates. They had business cards andstationery printed. Then they filed papers for incorporation as the WorldFederation for Mental Health.Soon after that, they received a call from the Federal Office of Public Healthin Switzerland demanding to know what they were up to. The two women wereinvited to explain themselves to the director himself.Kit and Marjorie were both in their early twenties. They dressed in dowdyclothes and put powder in their hair to make themselves appear older. When theyarrived at the office, they were shown to a conference room with about ten otherpeople, including the director, a stenographer, and several lawyers. Mary Pat’shands were trembling as Kit brazenly presented their case for taking over theWFMH. She claimed that the organization had long been misrepresenting itself;for instance, was the director aware that the WFMH never even bothered toincorporate in Switzerland? He was not. Nor was he a fan of some of the policiesthat the women said that WFMH championed, such as euthanasia. By the end of themeeting, the director seemed persuaded. “I like how you Americans work!” he saidenthusiastically.The women emerged from the meeting elated, but the response to their telex toHubbard surprised them. He ordered them back to the ship, “for your protection.”As soon as they returned to Cagliari, Hubbard cast off lines and set a coursethrough the Strait of Gibraltar for open water. He even changed the names of hisships, in order to erase the connections with Scientology. The Enchanter becamethe Diana, the Avon River became the Athena, and the flagship Royal Scotmanturned into the Apollo. All were registered with Panamanian credentials asbelonging to the Operation and Transport Corporation. The Apollo was now billedas “the pride of the Panamanian fleet,” “a floating school of philosophy,” and“the sanest space on the planet.”Hubbard was convinced that the Swiss authorities had laid a trap: they wouldarrest Kit and Mary Pat and force them to testify and expose his whole scheme.For months, he was afraid to touch land. The ship drifted aimlessly in theAtlantic; the crew was forced to live on its stores, and soon they were down tohalf-rations. Near Madeira, they were caught up in a fierce tropical storm,which threatened to swamp the Apollo. Immense waves swept over the funnel andshattered the two-inch-thick windows of the dining room. Water gushed into theengine room, where the seasick officer on watch tied a bucket around his neck.Terrified Messengers hauled themselves along the rails of the wildly pitchingdeck trying to deliver communications to the bridge; at times the nose of theship was pointed directly down into the sea. The storm lasted ten days,propelling the ship eight hundred miles north, all the way to the Azores.[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_009_r1.jpg]Portuguese postcard of the ApolloLooking for a safe port, Hubbard turned toward Morocco. He thought that an Arabcountry might be safer and less conspicuous for the Scientology fleet, which hadgained too much unfavorable attention in European ports. In October 1969, hedropped anchor in Safi, near Marrakesh. At last the crew, shaken and hungry,could take on stores. Hubbard began sizing up the country as a possibleScientology homeland. He picked Kit Gablehouse and Richard Wrigley, anotherredhead, to lead an exploratory mission to the capital, Rabat. The only orderthey got from Hubbard was to “secure Morocco.”Wrigley and Gablehouse set up in the Hôtel La Tour Hassan, where diplomatstypically stayed. Wrigley became friendly with an African envoy and drifted offto the Ivory Coast, leaving Kit to secure Morocco by herself. She established anoffice titled the American Institute of Human Engineering and Development, andsold a project to develop hydroponic farming to the Moroccan government. Thatproject went nowhere, but it gave her legitimate cover. With her social skills,she soon found herself hobnobbing with the royal palace’s inner circles—inparticular, she made friends among some high-ranking military officers,including a tall, handsome intelligence officer named Colonel Allam.As it happened, Colonel Allam and Kit shared a birthday, May 17, so she foundherself invited to a soiree at the governor’s palace in Marrakesh. In the middleof the party, there was a great stir caused by the arrival of General MohammedOufkir, the truculent minister of the interior. General Oufkir cast a longshadow over the nation, which had long been terrorized by the tyrannical rule ofKing Hassan II. Kit immediately sized him up as a shady figure—tall,hollow-cheeked, his eyes hidden by dark glasses, the blood of so many of hiscountrymen on his hands.Her Moroccan friends bluntly warned Kit to keep her distance from the military,but Hubbard was pressing her to do the very opposite. He and Mary Sue rented avilla in Tangier. Mary Sue was thrilled; she hated being cooped up aboard ship.The prospect of taking over Morocco began to seem not so far-fetched.For most of the next year, Kit lived in Rabat, reporting to the Apollo everycouple of months. In July 1971, Colonel Allam invited her and two otherScientologists to watch a war-games exercise on the occasion of the king’sforty-second birthday. The games, which were held at the king’s summer palace inSkhirat, were a panoramic fantasia of Berber tribesmen on camels, followed byinfantry formations and tank manuevers. The audience sat in tents and nibbled onendless hors d’oeuvres, and the pretty Scientology girls fended off advancesfrom the Moroccan brass. They played poker with the generals to pass the time.Everything went smoothly, but suddenly, in the middle of the airshow portion ofthe exercise, two fighter aircraft emerged from a cloud and dropped out offormation, flying low over the panicked crowd. They trained their guns on theking’s tent, which was next to where Kit and the other Scientologists weresitting. Simultaneously, a thousand military cadets stormed the palace. Ahundred people were killed in the coup attempt. The king escaped by hiding inthe toilet. Kit and her companions were quickly shuttled back to their hotel.Unnerved, they turned on the television to see what had happened, only to watchthe generals they had been sitting with lined up against a wall and shot. Thecoup attempt quickly fell apart. King Hassan fled to France and left the countryin charge of General Oufkir, who was also given the post of minister of defense.There was no one else the king trusted. He was convinced that the CIA wasdetermined to oust him.Even in this chaotic and dangerous situation, Hubbard saw an opportunity. Heproposed the creation of an elite guard to protect the king. He ordered Kit toinstruct General Oufkir in the use of E-Meters as lie detectors in order todetermine which members of the government had been a part of the rebel forcesand root out subversion. She refused; her own sources told her it was far toodangerous, not only for her, but for everyone involved. Hubbard ordered her backto the ship and put her in charge of the snack bar. He sent another team, andthey quickly began to uncover the plotters. Colonel Allam was marched out to thedesert and shot, along with dozens of others.When King Hassan II returned from France, in 1972, a squadron of Moroccanfighter jets accompanied his passenger jet. As soon as they left Frenchairspace, however, one of the escort jets began firing on the king’s aircraft.The king, who was also a pilot, immediately grasped what was happening. He racedinto the cockpit and seized control. “Stop firing! The tyrant is dead!” heshouted into the radio. Then he flew the jet on to Morocco.That night, the architect of the coup was revealed: General Oufkir. It wasannounced that he had committed “suicide,” although his body was riddled withbullets.The shaken king turned his attention to the Scientologists. He had longsuspected that Scientology was a CIA front—a rumor that was spreading all overthe Mediterranean. There was also gossip that the Apollo was involved in drugtrafficking and prostitution, or that it was part of a pornography ring. InDecember 1972, the Scientologists were expelled from the country, leaving atrail of confusion and recrimination behind them.6PAULETTE COOPER WAS studying comparative religion for a summer at Harvard in thelate 1960s when she became interested in Scientology, which was gainingattention. “A friend came to me and said he had joined Scientology anddiscovered he was Jesus Christ,” she recalled. She decided to go undercover tosee what the church was about. “I didn’t like what I saw,” she said. TheScientologists she encountered seemed to be in a kind of trance. When she lookedinto the claims that the church was making, she found many of them false orimpossible to substantiate. “I lost my parents in Auschwitz,” Cooper said,explaining her motivation in deciding to write about Scientology at a time whenthere had been very little published and those who criticized the church cameunder concentrated legal and personal attacks. A slender, soft-spoken woman,Cooper published her first article in Queen, a British magazine, in 1970. “I gotdeath threats,” she said. The church filed suit against her. She refused to besilent. “I thought if, in the nineteen-thirties people had been more outspoken,maybe my parents would have lived.” The following year, Cooper published a book,The Scandal of Scientology, that broadly attacked the teachings of Hubbard,revealing among other things that Hubbard had misrepresented his credentials andthat defectors claimed to have been financially ripped off and harassed if theytried to speak out.Soon after her book came out, Cooper received a visit from Ron and SaraHubbard’s daughter, Alexis, who was then studying at Smith College. Cooper haddemanded that Alexis bring substantial identification to prove who she was, butwhen she opened the door, she drew a breath. It was as if Hubbard had beenreincarnated as a freckled, twenty-two-year-old woman. Alexis asked Cooperwhether or not she was legitimate. In her social circle, illegitimacy was aterrible stigma. Cooper was able to show her Ron and Sara’s marriagecertificate.Alexis had been to Hawaii over the Christmas holidays to visit her mother. Whenshe returned to college, she learned that there was a man who had been waitingto see her for four days. He identified himself as an FBI agent and said he hadseveral pages of a letter he was required to read aloud to her. The letter saidthat Alexis was illegitimate. It was clearly written by Hubbard. “Your motherwas with me as a secretary in Savannah in late 1948,” the letter stated. He saidhe had to fire Sara because she was a “street-walker” and a Nazi spy. “In July1949 I was in Elizabeth, New Jersey, writing a movie,” the letter continues.“She turned up destitute and pregnant.” Out of the goodness of his heart,Hubbard said, he had taken Sara in, to see her “through her trouble.” Weirdly,the letter was signed, “Your good friend, J. Edgar Hoover.”After The Scandal of Scientology, Cooper’s life turned into a nightmare. She wasfollowed; her phone was tapped; she was sued nineteen times. Her name andtelephone number were written on the stalls in public men’s rooms. One day, whenCooper was out of town, her cousin, who was staying in her New York apartment,opened the door for a delivery from a florist. The deliveryman took a gun fromthe bouquet, put it to her temple, and pulled the trigger. When the gun didn’tfire, he attempted to strangle her. Cooper’s cousin screamed and the assailantfled. Cooper then moved to an apartment building with a doorman, but soon afterthat her three hundred neighbors received letters saying that she was aprostitute with venereal disease who molested children. A woman impersonatingCooper voiced threats against Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and PresidentGerald Ford at a Laundromat, while a Scientologist who happened to be presentnotified the FBI. Two members from the Guardian’s office broke into Cooper’spsychiatrist’s office and stole her files, then sent copies to her adoptiveparents. Cooper was charged with mailing bomb threats to the Church ofScientology. In the courtroom, the prosecutor produced a threatening letter withher fingerprint on it, and Cooper fainted. (Later, she remembered signing apetition, which may have had a blank page underneath it.) In May 1973, Cooperwas indicted by the US Attorney’s office for mailing the threats and then lyingabout it before the grand jury.IF THE RUMORS about Hubbard were true—that he had created a religion only inorder to get rich—he had long since accomplished that goal. One of hisdisaffected lieutenants later claimed that Hubbard had admitted to “aninsatiable lust for power and money.” He hectored his adherents on this subject.“MAKE MONEY,” he demanded in a 1972 policy letter. “MAKE MORE MONEY. MAKE OTHERSPRODUCE SO AS TO MAKE MONEY.” In order to siphon money into Hubbard’s personalaccounts, a number of front organizations were established, including theReligious Research Foundation, which was incorporated in Liberia. In themid-seventies that single foundation had an account in Switzerland containingmore than $300 million. At one point, panicked that Switzerland was going tomake a change in its tax laws, Hubbard ordered his medical officer, KimaDouglas, to move those funds from Switzerland to Lichtenstein. She describedstacks of cash sitting in the bank vault, mostly hundred-dollar bills, four feethigh and three to four feet wide, one pile in Hubbard’s name, the other in thechurch’s. “Church’s was bigger but his was big too,” she told Hubbard’sbiographer Russell Miller. L. Ron Hubbard, Jr., remembered shoeboxes full ofmoney in his father’s closet. He later testified that Hubbard habitually kept“great chunks of cash” within easy reach, “so that if there was any problem hecould just take off right out the window.”“Making money, I think, to Hubbard was paramount,” Hana Eltringham laterspeculated. “He wasn’t that interested in it for himself. He did have perks, hedid have his cars, his motorbikes, his books, his good food, and things likethat, and eventually he had his villas and he had his estates and so on, but themoney that he wanted predominantly was for power.”For all his wealth, Hubbard spent much of his time in his cabin alone, auditinghimself on the E-Meter and developing his spiritual technology. He may have beengrandiose and delusional, but the endless stream of policy letters and trainingroutines that poured from his typewriter hour after hour, day after day, atteststo his obsession with the notion of creating a step-by-step pathway to universalsalvation. If it was all a con, why would he bother?Hubbard and Mary Sue slept in separate staterooms. In the opinion of members oftheir household staff and others, by the time they boarded ship, Hubbard hadlost interest in Mary Sue sexually. Yvonne Gillham had managed to get herselfposted on another ship, out of range of Hubbard’s longing and Mary Sue’s wrath.For the most part, the Commodore left his female crew members alone. Oneexception was a tall, slender woman from Oregon. She approached Hana Eltringhamwith a big smile on her face and confessed that she was having an affair withHubbard. Soon after that, Hubbard busted the woman down to deckhand and assignedEltringham to audit her. The woman would weep through the session. Eltringhamwould dutifully pass along the auditing files to Hubbard for review. “I couldhear him chortling,” she recalled.The situation was much less restrained belowdecks. The Sea Org members wereyoung and vigorous; sexual escapades were routine, and marriages quite fluid.Hubbard seemed to be oblivious, but Mary Sue was increasingly scandalized. Whenshe learned that a crew member, who was nineteen or twenty, had slept with afifteen-year-old girl on the ship, she got a dagger out of her cabin and held itagainst his throat and told him he had to be off the ship in two hours or else.In 1971, on New Year’s Eve, there was a drunken orgy of historic proportions.“Maybe a hundred Sea Org members were having sex everywhere from the topsideboatdecks to the lowest holds of the ship,” one of the participants recalled.Mary Sue had had enough. With two attractive teenage daughters of her own on theship, she started cracking down on premarital sex. Hubbard observed that 1972was a leap year, and said that any woman on the ship could propose to any man,leading to a sudden rash of weddings. Hubbard had forbidden babies on board, butso many women were getting pregnant that he began permitting the children tostay, rather than sending their parents to another post. The baby boomeventually prompted Hubbard to order that no one could get pregnant without hispermission; according to several Sea Org members, any woman disobeying hiscommand would be “off-loaded” to another Scientology organization or flown toNew York for an abortion.7WORD ARRIVED while the Apollo was in dry dock in Portugal that the Frenchgovernment was going to indict the Church of Scientology for fraud, with Hubbardnamed as a conspirator (he would eventually be convicted in absentia andsentenced to four years in prison). Hubbard flew to New York the very next day.Few crew members knew where he was. Jim Dincalci, his medical officer, and PaulPreston, a former Green Beret who acted as Hubbard’s bodyguard, joined him andset up housekeeping in Queens.It was an odd interlude. Abruptly freed from the daily responsibility of runningthe ship, training executives, and overseeing the entire Scientology enterprise,Hubbard suddenly had time on his hands. He spent it watching television andreading novels. Dincalci was designated to be the chef, which meant that fishsticks and pasta were on the menu until Dincalci learned how to expand hisrepertoire. He studied Adelle Davis’s popular health food book Let’s Get Well.Hubbard began to gain energy and lose weight. He would go for walks around theneighborhood, but always in a clownish disguise—a wig, a hat, and glasses withno prescription. Hubbard thought he was being nondescript, but Dincalci heardthe comments the kids were making about how goofy he looked.Dincalci had long since come to the conclusion that Hubbard was not an OperatingThetan. He was obese and weird and he failed to exhibit any of the extraordinarypowers that are supposed to be a part of the OT arsenal. Moreover, he was undersiege by various countries. Why couldn’t he simply set things straight? Wasn’the supposed to be in control of his environment? How could he be so persecutedand powerless? What was he doing hiding out in Queens, wearing a wig andwatching television when the planet needed salvation? At one point, Hubbard wastalking about how pleasant it used to be to sit on a cloud, but now hecomplained to Dincalci, “I’m PTS to nations.” He meant that he was a PotentialTrouble Source because entire countries were dysfunctional and suppressive.Dincalci thought, “Oh, that explains it,” but then it didn’t, really.During the ten months Hubbard was in hiding in Queens, he began plotting anotherway to destroy SMERSH. His escapade to take over the World Federation for MentalHealth had been foiled, he believed, by those sinister forces. One day, Hubbardsurprised Dincalci by asking him for the names of Snow White’s Seven Dwarfs.Dincalci dutifully trotted to the library to look them up. He wouldn’t learn thereal significance of Snow White for some time. Hubbard had set in motion anoperation so daring and dangerous that it threatened to destroy Scientologyforever.On April 20, 1973, Hubbard wrote a secret order, “Snow White Program,” in whichhe noted a dangerous trend in the gradual reduction since 1967 of countriesavailable to Scientology. He put the blame on the American and Britishgovernments, which he said were spreading false allegations against the church.He proposed to swamp the countries that had turned against the church in a vastcampaign of litigation with the aim of expunging defamatory files and leavingHubbard and the Apollo “free to frequent all western ports and nations withoutthreat.”In Hubbard’s absence, Mary Sue exerted increased control over the church’soperations. Hubbard had already appointed her the head of the Guardian’s Office,a special unit with a broad mandate to protect the religion. Among its otherduties, the GO functioned as an intelligence agency, gathering information oncritics and government agencies around the world, generating lawsuits tointimidate opponents, and waging an unremitting campaign against mental healthprofessionals. It was the GO that Hubbard tasked with Snow White. Under MarySue’s direction, the GO infiltrated government offices around the world, lookingfor damning files on the church. Within the next few years, as many as fivethousand Scientologists were covertly placed in 136 government agenciesworldwide. Project Grumpy, for instance, covered Germany, where the Guardian’sOffice was set up to infiltrate Interpol as well as German police andimmigration authorities. In addition, there was a scheme to accuse Germancritics of the church of committing genocide. Project Sleepy was to clear filesin Austria; Happy was for Denmark, Bashful for Belgium, and Dopey for Italy.There were also Projects Mirror, Apple, Reflection, and so on, all drawn fromelements of the fairy tale. Projects Witch and Stepmother both targeted the UK,the source of Scientology’s immigration problems.Project Hunter was the United States, where Scientologists penetrated the IRS,the Justice, Treasury, and Labor Departments, the Federal Trade Commission, andthe Drug Enforcement Administration, as well as foreign embassies andconsulates; private companies and organizations, such as the American MedicalAssociation, the American Psychiatric Association, and the Better BusinessBureau; and newspapers—including the St. Petersburg Times, the Clearwater Sun,and the Washington Post—that were critical of the religion. In an evidentattempt at blackmail, they stole the Los Angeles IRS intelligence files ofcelebrities and political figures, including California governor Jerry Brown,Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley, and Frank Sinatra. Nothing in American historycan compare with the scale of the domestic espionage of Operation Snow White.IN SEPTEMBER 1973, learning that he was not going to be extradited to Franceafter all, Hubbard returned to Lisbon, where the Apollo was in dry dock. Heamused himself by going off on photo expeditions in Portugal, with hisMessengers acting as porters. Then, in December, the Apollo lifted anchor andheaded to the warmer climate of the Canary Islands. One day in Tenerife, Hubbarddecided to take his Harley-Davidson motorcycle out for a spin on the twistymountain roads. Miles away, in the lush volcanic landscape, the Harley hit apatch of oil or mud and crashed. Hubbard broke his arm and several ribs. Somehowhe managed to right his bike and make his way back to the ship.Some members of the Sea Org cite the motorcycle accident as the moment whenScientology changed course and sailed toward a darker horizon. Hubbard was interrible pain, but he was fearful of doctors and refused to go to the hospital.Dincalci and the ship’s other medical officer, Kima Douglas, neither of whom hada medical degree, attempted to treat him. They strapped Hubbard’s injured arm tohis side and wrapped his broken ribs, then sat him in a velvet reading chair,which he rarely left for the next six weeks, day or night.The whole ship could hear him cursing and screaming and throwing plates andthings against the wall with his one good arm. He was in too much discomfort tosleep for more than a couple of hours at a time, so the ranting and moaning wenton almost nonstop. The medical officers had persuaded him to let a local doctorcome aboard with a kind of primitive X-ray machine, which confirmed the brokenbones. The doctor left Dincalci a prescription for pain pills. The first timeDincalci gave Hubbard the pain pills, however, Hubbard panicked and said thatthey had slowed down his heart. “You’re trying to kill me!” he shouted.Dincalci, who looked upon Hubbard as a father, both spiritually and emotionally,was devastated. Hubbard ordered him “beached”—dropped off in Madeira, thedistant Portuguese atoll, where he remained for a year.Other members of the Sea Org were having a hard time coping with the blatantcontradiction between Hubbard’s legend and the crabby, disconsolate figurehowling in his stateroom. “If he is who he says he is, why does he have solittle staying power?” Hana Eltringham wondered. “He has a motorcycle accident,he doesn’t recover quickly, and he doesn’t use Scientology techniques onhimself.”By now, Eltringham had been promoted to Deputy Commodore, the highest post inthe Sea Org after Hubbard himself. She had been off the ship for a couple ofyears, in Los Angeles, running the Advanced Orgs—the divisions responsible forproducing Operating Thetans—and setting up a liaison office to supply theScientology fleet. During that period, she began experiencing cripplingheadaches. Some days she was unable to work at all. She couldn’t even lie downbecause the pressure from the pillow was unbearable. The vibration of footstepsin the hall outside her room made the pain excruciating. She thought if shecould only discover the body thetans that she must be harboring she could easeher misery. Every day, hour after hour, she audited herself on the E-Meter,probing for some stirring or a sign of recognition. Hubbard himself was her casesupervisor, which made her anxiety all the greater. Despite her rank, she, too,worried about being beached or punished. Even worse, according to Hubbard’sdictates, she alone was responsible for her pain. So why was she doing this toherself?Then, one day in her auditing, she felt something. A kind of “flicker.” Was it aBT? She decided that it must be. An immense feeling of relief washed over her.Soon after that, she discovered more BTs—eventually, hundreds, thousands.Sometimes there was a feeling of lightness or of floating when the BT wasexpelled. Other times, Eltringham exteriorized from her body. But the headachesremained. Then something new arrived: quarrelsome voices inside her head. Atfirst the voices were faint, but they grew louder and more insistent. Eltringhamworried that she was going insane.When she returned to the Apollo, she was shocked by the hellish changes that hadtaken place. In January 1974, Hubbard issued Flag Order 3434RB, creating theRehabilitation Project Force. The stated goal was to rehabilitate Sea Orgmembers whose statistics were down or who might be harboring subversive thoughtsagainst Hubbard or his technology. Because the RPF provided a second chance forthose who might otherwise be fired, Hubbard saw it as an enlightened managementtechnique, the sole purpose of which was “redemption.” When Eltringham cameaboard, she found dozens of crew members housed in the old cattle holdbelowdecks, illuminated by a single lightbulb, sleeping on stained mattresses onthe floor. They were dressed in black overalls, called boiler suits, andforbidden to speak to anyone outside their group. They ate using their handsfrom a bucket of table scraps, shoveling the food into their mouths as if theywere starving.Despite the confusion and the harsh punishment, there were many Sea Org memberswho experienced their days on the Apollo as a time of incomparable adventure,filled with a sense of mission and an esprit de corps they would never againrecapture. Although Hubbard could be terrifying and irrational, and comicallypompous, he still held his followers in thrall. Those who were close to him sawa generous and caring leader who used his gigantic personality to keep his ship,his fleet, his organization, and his religion on track. Karen de la Carriere, ayoung British auditor, remembers watching Hubbard in his office screaming at oneof the crew; when that person left, cowering, Hubbard swiveled in his chair andgave Karen a big wink. “He was in total control,” she realized. “It was alltheatrical to create a desired effect.”Hubbard developed many of the basic Scientology techniques aboard the Apollo. Inone instance, de la Carriere was having no luck auditing a wealthy Scientologistwith a long drug history, who kept falling asleep during their sessions. Hubbardtheorized that the LSD he had taken must still be in his system; perhaps thedrugs could be sweated out by putting him to work swabbing the decks. After sixweeks, he was a changed man. De la Carriere says that was the beginning of theScientology drug-treatment program, called the Purification Rundown.A strapping crewman named Bruce Welch had what other crew members diagnosed as anervous breakdown or a psychotic episode. In Scientology terms, he had gone“Type III.” He had a crush on one of the ship’s young women, and when he learnedshe was engaged, he went berserk. According to de la Carriere, Welch got abutcher knife from the pantry and threatened to kill Hubbard and other membersof the crew. There were no designated security procedures or personnel trainedto handle such a case. It took four crewmen to eventually subdue Welch andwrestle him into a cabin in the forecastle, the storage area above the bow, awayfrom most of the crew, where he screamed continuously. There was a metal bedwith a mattress, and a metal cabinet, but Welch managed to tear them apart withhis bare hands and shove the pieces through the porthole.A young Australian named Mike Rinder (who would eventually become the church’schief spokesperson) had just arrived aboard the Apollo and was given theassignment of guarding Welch’s cabin. He sat on a trunk in the hallway,listening to Welch shouting, “Bring the Commodore here! I want the Commodoreright now!” Then Welch would yank on the door, which was locked and lashed tothe bulkhead with sturdy ropes. Several times, Rinder recalled, Welch beat upother members of the crew when he was escorted to the bathroom or given hismeals.Hubbard saw Welch’s rampage as an opportunity to experiment with the problem ofacute mental breakdown. Total silence was enforced on the forecastle deck sothat Welch would have nothing to stimulate him. Three times a day, Hubbard wouldwrite Welch a note, asking about his well-being. According to de la Carriere,Welch’s response might be, “You’re the devil incarnate. I’m going to enjoyplunging the knife in you.” Hubbard would respond that he understood, and by theway was there any special food that the chef could prepare for him? In this way,Welch’s rage began to subside. He allowed an auditor to visit him each day.After two weeks, the door to Welch’s cabin was unlocked and he emerged, sereneand apparently cured.“I have made a technical discovery which possibly ranks with the majordiscoveries of the twentieth century,” Hubbard boasted in one of his bulletins.“It is called the Introspection Rundown.” He explained that the psychotic breakhad long bedeviled psychiatry, which had attempted to treat it with drugs,lobotomies, and shock treatments. The key, Hubbard had discovered in histreatment of Welch, was to learn what had caused the person to “introspect”before his breakdown. “THIS MEANS THE LAST REASON TO HAVE PSYCHIATRY AROUND ISGONE,” Hubbard declared. “The psychotic break, the last of the ‘unsolvable’conditions that can trap a person, has been solved.… You have in your hands thetool to take over mental therapy in full.”Hubbard’s recipe for curing psychosis was to isolate the subject, with theattendants “completely muzzled (no speech).” By discovering the last severeconflict that triggered the episode, and then helping the subject discharge theemotions surrounding it, the auditor can begin to untangle the mental knots thathave thrown the subject into his present state of wrestling with “the mystery ofsome incorrectly designated error.” The subject should be given vitamins,especially Vitamin B, along with calcium and magnesium, in order to restore hisphysical well-being. He should be examined on the E-Meter for discordant momentsin his life, such as someone accusing him of something he hadn’t done, or beingtold he was a Potential Trouble Source when he wasn’t, or having his identityquestioned. These steps are simple, Hubbard said, but “its results are magicalin effectiveness.” The goal is to take the highly introverted personality, whois trapped in an endless loop of self-criticism, and bring him out of himself.The subject should be able to look at the world once again and see it as “quitereal and quite bright.”“Do it flawlessly and we will all win,” Hubbard promised.“THIS PLANET IS OURS.”The Apollo crew were in awe of their leader. They had seen the transformationwith their own eyes. “A madman was made sane on the high seas,” de la Carrieresaid. “To do that, you have got to have a certain amount of greatness.”ONCE A WEEK, there was a movie night on the aft deck, with a recently releasedfilm flown in. Popcorn was made, a screen erected, and when everyone was settledHubbard would descend from the prom deck, resplendent in his Commodore’suniform, with Mary Sue and the children in tow.In the interest of public relations, Hubbard staged free concerts at variousports of call, using the ship’s ragtag band, the Apollo Stars. He wanted to“revolutionize music,” and composed original songs for the band to play. Hestarted a modern dance troupe as well. Quentin wanted to join the dancers, buthis father sternly told him that he had other plans for him. By 1974, Hubbardhad decided that his two oldest children by Mary Sue—Diana, twenty-two, andQuentin, twenty—were to take over the major management and technology functionsof Scientology. Diana was enthusiastic—she had been the Lieutenant Commandersince the age of sixteen and was often at her father’s side—but everyone knewthat Quentin’s great ambition was to fly. His cabin was full of model airplanes,suspended from the ceiling with dental floss, and books about flying. He wasoften seen weaving along the deck with his arms outstretched, making enginenoises, completely absorbed in being a plane.Jim Dincalci, the medical officer who was still beached in Madeira, learned thatthe Apollo was headed in his direction. By now, he had made friends with many ofthe local people, and he was surprised to learn from them that the Apollo waswidely suspected of being a spy ship for the CIA.8 He sent telexes warning theship that it would be better to avoid Madeira, but Hubbard came anyway. Soonafter the Apollo docked, a mob arrived and began stoning the ship. Hubbardordered fire hoses turned on the crowd, which further infuriated them. Therewere motorcycles belonging to crew members and two of Hubbard’s cars which hadbeen offloaded onto the pier; the mob shoved them all into the harbor, thenloosened the moorings so that the ship drifted offshore. Mary Sue and some othermembers of the ship’s company were stranded in town and had to be rescued by thelocal authorities.Quentin returned to the ship in bad shape. He had taken an overdose of pills ina failed suicide attempt. After his stomach was pumped at a local hospital, hewas brought back to the ship, pale and weak, and put in isolation in his cabin,guarded night and day, becoming the second person to undergo the IntrospectionRundown. Suzette was the only one to visit him. He looked like a broken doll.Quentin was now twenty years old, popular and free-spirited, but in many waysstill a soft-spoken, dreamy boy. Although he was small like his mother, and hadher coloring, in other respects he bore a strong resemblance to his father. Hisfacial features were almost an exact match: almond-shaped eyes under low,reddish brows; protuberant lips; and a deep cleft in the chin. Even thoughQuentin became one of the highest-rated auditors in the Sea Org, his father wasconstantly disappointed in his performance. “You have to improve,” he barked atQuentin in front of the other auditors. “It doesn’t matter that you’re aHubbard.” Quentin would sit there and smile, seemingly unfazed, as the otherscringed for him. Privately, he confided, “Daddy doesn’t love me anymore.”Eventually, Hubbard sentenced Quentin to the Rehabilitation Project Force. His“twin” on the RPF was Monica Pignotti, an auditor in training at age twenty-one.As they practiced auditing each other, they became close. Quentin sneaked somepeanut butter from the family pantry and shared it with Monica. They made upskits and played with his tape recorder. They never became intimate. Quentintold her that he had once become sexually involved with a woman, but when hisfather found out, she was sent off the ship. He knew that people regarded him asa homosexual, he said, but that was only something he told other women on theship who were after him because he was Hubbard’s son.[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_010_r1.jpg]Quentin Hubbard, circa 1973HUBBARD SET a new course: due west, toward America. The destination wasCharleston, South Carolina. The crew were thrilled that they would be returningto the States, only to be crestfallen when a message arrived from the Guardian’sOffice, just as the ship was approaching port, alerting Mary Sue that agentsfrom US Customs, Immigration, Coast Guard, DEA, and US Marshals were waiting forthem to dock, plus 180 IRS agents waiting to impound the ship. The federalagents had a subpoena to depose Hubbard in a civil tax case in Hawaii. AScientologist on shore realized what was happening when he was blocked fromentering the dock area. He sent a pizza to a radio operator with a messageinside to send to the ship. Hubbard was just five miles offshore, but hesuddenly broadcasted a new course over the radio—due north for Halifax, NovaScotia—then turned sharply south and headed to the Bahamas.Hubbard was sixty-four years old in 1975, as the Apollo began itscircumnavigation of the Caribbean. He weighed 260 pounds. He was stillmeticulously groomed, but his teeth and fingers were darkly stained fromconstant smoking. He was on the run from the courts, fearful of beingdiscovered, marked by age, and visibly in decline. In Curaçao, he suffered asmall stroke and spent several weeks in a local hospital. It was becoming clearthat life at sea posed a real danger for a man in such frail health. His crewrationalized his obvious decline by saying that his body was battered by theresearch he was undertaking and the volumes of suppression aimed at him. “He’srisking his life for us,” they told each other.By now the rumor about the CIA spy ship had spread all over the Caribbean,making the Scientologists unwelcome or at least under suspicion everywhere theywent. They were kicked out of Barbados, Curaçao, and Jamaica. Moreover, the Araboil embargo had sent the price of fuel skyrocketing, so the roving life wasgetting too expensive to support. It was time to come ashore.FROM THE APOLLO, Hubbard sent a couple of delegations to locate a land base forScientology—specifically, a town that the church could take over. One teamarrived in the Florida retirement community of Clearwater—a resonant name forScientologists—to look over a dowdy downtown hotel called the Fort Harrison,which had earned a place in popular history when Mick Jagger wrote the lyricsfor “Satisfaction” beside the swimming pool in 1965. Hubbard purchased the FortHarrison and a bank building across the street using a false front called theUnited Churches of Florida, which he calculated would not disturb the staidmoral climate of the conservative community. When the mayor of Clearwater,Gabriel Cazares, raised questions about the extraordinary security that suddenlyappeared around the church buildings, Guardian’s Office operatives tried toframe him in a staged hit-and-run accident and planted false marriage documentsin Tijuana, Mexico, to make it appear that Cazares was a bigamist. Severalmonths passed before the flabbergasted citizens discovered that Clearwater hadbecome the Flag Land Base for the Church of Scientology. (Scientologists wouldsimply call it Flag.)Hubbard had been keeping a low profile in a condominium nearby, but in January1976 his tailor leaked the news to a St. Petersburg Times reporter that theleader of Scientology was in town. As soon as Hubbard heard this, he grabbedtwenty-five thousand dollars in cash, collected Kima Douglas, his medicalofficer, and her husband, Michael, and lit out in his Cadillac for Orlando. Thenext day, he announced that they were going to his old hideout in Queens. TheCadillac was too conspicuous, so he sent Michael out to buy a nondescript Chevyhatchback. The trip to New York took three days, with Hubbard smokingcontinuously in the backseat and crying, “There they are! They’re after us!”every time he saw a police car. When they finally arrived, Kima judged Queenstoo depressing, so they turned around and went to Washington, DC.Meanwhile, agents from the Guardian’s Office raced to Southern California tolook for remote properties where Hubbard could operate more discreetly. Soon,Hubbard and Mary Sue, along with her Tibetan terriers, Yama and Tashi, set up intheir new quarters on three large properties in La Quinta, California, a deserttown south of Palm Springs. Hubbard grew a goatee and let his hair hang down tohis shoulders. “He looked like Wild Bill Hickok,” one Sea Org member recalled.He kept a hopped-up Plymouth and half a million dollars in cash ready for aquick getaway.Left behind in Clearwater, and without his father hovering over him, Quentinbecame freer and more assertive. He befriended an older Scientologist from NewZealand, Grace Alpe, who arrived at Flag Base with terminal cancer. “She lookedlike a witch, with gray hair and a hooked nose, like she was in a hauntedhouse,” said Karen de la Carriere, who was Alpe’s auditor. During auditingsessions Alpe would just rock back and forth, crying, “I’m going to die! I’mgoing to die!” Everyone kept a distance from the woman, except Quentin, who tookover her case. He actually let her move into his room and sleep in his bed,while he slept on the floor. Then he made a catastrophic mistake.Dennis Erlich, the chief “cramming officer” at Flag, who supervised theupper-level auditors, noted jarring disparities between Quentin’s upbeat reportson Alpe and her glaring lack of progress. Erlich called Quentin in for ameeting. “Quentin, or ‘Q’ as his friends called him, was 22 at the time,” Erlichlater wrote. “He looked 15 and acted 5.” During the interview, Quentincontinually zoomed his hand through the air and made airplane noises. He calmlytold Erlich that he had falsely reported the results. “I think a lot of myfather’s stuff doesn’t work,” he said. “So I false report whenever I need to.Personally, I think my father’s crazy.”Not only was Quentin the founder’s son, he was also one of the highest-rankedauditors in the church, and yet he had committed an unpardonable offense. Erlichhad no choice but to tell him that he would have to surrender all of histraining certificates and start the entire Scientology series all overagain—years of work. Quentin seemed completely nonchalant.What happened after this is full of contradiction and mystery. Tracy Ekstrand,who was Quentin’s steward, set a cookie on his bedside table that evening. Itwas still there the next night. The bed had not been slept in. Erlich wasexpecting Quentin to show up to go over his new training program, but he didn’tappear that day or the next. Word went out that Quentin had “blown”—in otherwords, he had fled. He left a confused note, full of references to UFOs, sayingthat he was going to Area 51, the secret airbase north of Las Vegas, Nevada,where the CIA has developed spy planes; in popular culture, Area 51 was said tobe where an alien spacecraft was stored. Quentin had only just learned to drivea car, in the parking garage of the condominium, where he accidentally ran intothe wall with such force that the entire building registered the shock. He wasscarcely qualified to drive all the way across the country by himself. Quentinhad repeatedly requested a leave to take flying lessons, but Hubbard wasconvinced that Quentin couldn’t be trusted to fly a plane under anycircumstances.Frantic, Mary Sue dispatched three hundred Guardian’s Office operatives to findhim. Weeks passed, as the Scientologists checked hotels and flying schools inmultiple states. A cover story was put out that Quentin had been given flyinglessons as a present from his parents, and he was driving to California tofulfill his lifelong ambition.Quentin was indeed headed for Nevada. It was one of the very few times in hislife when he was on his own and free. He stopped in St. Louis on his drive westand took a VIP tour of the giant aerospace manufacturer McDonnell Douglas. Hewas enthralled by the display of aircraft and artifacts of the Mercury andGemini space programs; he even got a ride in one of the company’s business jets.“He was so happy,” Cindy Mallien, who had lunch with him that afternoon,recalled. “He was just beaming.”But only a few days later, Las Vegas police were trying to identify a slightyoung man with blond hair and a reddish moustache who had been discoveredcomatose in a car parked on Sunset Road facing the end of the runway of McCarranAirport. He was naked. He was five feet one inch tall, and weighed just over ahundred pounds. There were no identifying marks on his body and no personalidentification. The license plates had been removed. The engine of the whitePontiac was still running when he was discovered. The windows were rolled up,and a vacuum tube led from the exhaust through the passenger’s vent window. Twoweeks later, on November 12, 1976, the young man died without regainingconsciousness. Las Vegas police were finally able to connect the Pontiac withQuentin through a Florida smog sticker and the vehicle identification number.An agent from the Guardian’s Office came into Hubbard’s office in La Quinta ashe was having breakfast and handed him the report on Quentin’s death. “Thatlittle shit has done it to me again!” Hubbard cried. He threw the report at KimaDouglas and ordered her to read it. The report said Quentin had died ofasphyxiation of carbon monoxide. It also noted that there was semen in hisrectum. When Hubbard told Mary Sue that Quentin was dead, she screamed for tenminutes. For months, she was disconsolate, hiding behind dark glasses. Everyoneknew that Quentin was her favorite.A spokesman for the church said that Quentin had been on vacation. Meantime,Mary Sue arranged for three further autopsies to be performed. In the last one,the cause of death was said to be unknown. She put out the word that he had diedof encephalitis. Hubbard himself was convinced that Quentin was murdered as away of getting at him.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Harriet Whitehead, an anthropologist who conducted fieldwork in Scientology inthe United States and the United Kingdom between 1969 and 1971, writes of the“fundamental kinship” between psychotherapy and religion. “The cosmologicalsystem that surrounds a renunciatory discipline cannot for long remain‘secular,’ that is, finite and this-worldly, in its orientation,” she writes.“This is one of the reasons … secular therapeutic doctrines often develop areligious or mystical cast.” Although Freud was a nonreligious Jew, thetechniques of analysis he developed may have had their roots in certain mysticalpractices rooted in the kabbalah, such as the interpretation of dreams and theuse of free association to uncover hidden motivations. Jung subsequently steeredpsychoanalysis into deeply spiritual waters—a course, as Whitehead points out,that parallels the evolution of Dianetics into Scientology: “It would thus befacile to dismiss the promulgation of a quasi-empirical supernaturalism in theDianetics movement as simply the product of amateur theorizing by a spinner oftales, when Hubbard’s predecessors who established the framework within whichpsychotherapy, amateur and otherwise, would subsequently develop, did hardly anybetter” (Whitehead, Renunciation and Reformulation, pp. 27–8).2 A federal district court eventually allowed E-Meters to be used for “bona fidereligious counseling,” but ordered that each device bear a warning that “theE-Meter is not medically or scientifically useful for the diagnosis, treatmentor prevention of any disease. It is not medically or scientifically capable ofimproving the health or bodily functions of anyone” (Amended Order of USDistrict Court for the District of Columbia, No.71–2064, Mar. 1, 1973).3 The ban was repealed in 1973.4 According to the church, “The first Sea Organization members formulated aone-billion-year pledge to symbolize their eternal commitment to the religionand it is still signed by all members today. It is a symbolic document which,similar to vows of dedication in other faiths and orders, serves to signify anindividual’s eternal commitment to the goals, purposes and principles of theScientology religion.”5 The church explained, “As it became a matter of tradition among the crewmembers at that time having adopted the practice of overboarding, Mr. Hubbardset forth rules in October of 1968 to ensure it was conducted safely inattaining the spiritual benefit intended. To that end, given that it was anecclesiastical penance, the procedure includes the Chaplain making the followingstatement as part of the observance: ‘We commit your sins and errors to thewaves and trust you will arise a better thetan.’ ”6 The church denies that Scientologists worked with General Oufkir’s men or usedthe E-Meter to provide security checking for the Moroccan government.7 The church supplied me with a number of affidavits from former Sea Org memberssaying that they had not been forced to terminate their pregnancies.8 The CIA at the time was taking note of Hubbard, mainly through newspaperclippings. “There is no indication that HUBBARD or members of his organizationhave been engaged in intelligence or security matters,” an agency dispatchnotes. “Rather, HUBBARD appears to be a shrewd businessman who has parlayed hisScientology ‘religion’ into a multi-million dollar business by taking advantageof that portion of society prone to fall for such gimmicks” (“Scientology/L. RonHUBBARD,” CIA dispatch, Mar. 18, 1971)."},{"pageContent":"[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_011_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"4[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_L02_r1.jpg]THE FAITH FACTORYDespite its reputation for carnality and narcissism, Los Angeles has always beena spawning ground for new religions. In 1906, a one-eyed black preacher namedWilliam Seymour set up a church in a livery stable on Azusa Street and began arevival that lasted for three years. Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims came tohear his message. Stigmatized as Holy Rollers and decried because of theirinterracial worship, Seymour’s followers gave birth to the Pentecostal movement,which quickly spread across the world, becoming an enduring force in modernChristianity. In 1912, a theosophist colony called Krotona took root just belowthe current Hollywood sign, where the hills were said to be “magneticallyimpregnated.” An organization called Mighty I AM Presence began in Los Angelesand expanded all across America, gaining about a million followers by 1938. Thefounders were Guy and Edna Ballard, who claimed to be able to communicate with“ascended masters.” Guy wrote a popular book titled Unveiled Mysteries, in whichhe related his travels through the stratosphere, visiting great cities ofantiquity and unearthing buried loot—much as Hubbard attempted to do severaldecades later. Writers William Butler Yeats, D. H. Lawrence, ChristopherIsherwood, and Aldous Huxley passed through the city, all drawn by itsreputation as a center for spiritual innovation.One of the most famous preachers in American history, Aimee Semple McPherson,built the Angelus Temple near Echo Park in 1923, where she marriedPentecostalism with Hollywood theatricality. She created sets for her sermons ona stage designed for her by Charlie Chaplin, who may have been one of her secretHollywood paramours (Milton Berle claimed to be another). Anticipating the garbof Hubbard and the Sea Org, McPherson liked to dress in an admiral’s uniform,while her disciples wore nautical outfits. As a teenager, Anthony Quinn playedthe saxophone in the church and translated for Sister Aimee when she preached inMexican neighborhoods. After he became a movie star, Quinn would compare her tothe great actresses he worked with, including Ingrid Bergman and KatharineHepburn. “They all fell short of that first electric shock Aimee SempleMcPherson produced in me.”And so when the Church of Scientology was officially founded in Los Angeles, inFebruary 1954, by several of Hubbard’s devoted followers, there was already ahistory of religious celebrities and celebrity religions. The cultivation offamous people—or people who aspired to be famous—was a feature of Hubbard’sgrand design. He foresaw that the best way of promoting Scientology as a ladderto enlightenment was to court celebrities, whom he defined as “any personimportant enough in his field or an opinion leader or his entourage, businessassociates, family or friends with particular attention to the arts, sports andmanagement and government.” It was not surprising that Hubbard would hire as hispersonal assistant Richard de Mille, son of the legendary producer and directorCecil B. DeMille, who had started Paramount Pictures and was in some waysresponsible for the creation of Hollywood itself.In 1955, a year after the church’s founding, an editorial in Ability, apublication affiliated with the church, urged Scientologists to recruitcelebrities. A long list of desirable prospects followed, including MarleneDietrich, Walt Disney, Jackie Gleason, John Ford, Bob Hope, and Howard Hughes.“If you want one of these celebrities as your game, write us at once so thenotable will be yours to hunt without interference,” the editorial promised. “Ifyou bring one of them home you will get a small plaque as your reward.” AuthorWilliam Burroughs and actor Stephen Boyd were drawn into the church in its earlydays. Scientology was a religion rather perfectly calibrated for its time andplace, since American culture, and soon the rest of the world, was bendingincreasingly toward the worship of celebrity, with Hollywood as its chiefshrine. At the end of the sixties, the church established its first CelebrityCentre, in Hollywood. (There are now satellites in Paris, Vienna, Düsseldorf,Munich, Florence, London, New York, Las Vegas, and Nashville.) The object was to“make celebrities even better known and to help their careers with Scientology,”Hubbard wrote. “By accomplishing this Major Target I know that Celebrity Centrescan take over the whole acting-artists world.”Hubbard was particularly interested in stars whose careers had crested but stillhad enough luster that they could be rehabilitated and made into icons ofScientology. The prototype was Gloria Swanson, one of the greatest stars of thesilent movie era, who personified the lavish glamour of that era. Although shenever regained the international fame she had known before the talkies, shecontinued acting on television and in occasional movies—most memorably, as NormaDesmond in the 1950 classic Sunset Boulevard. Hubbard’s top auditor, PeggyConway, a South African entertainer, ardently cultivated Swanson, calling her“My Adorable Glory,” in her many letters to the star, although she saves herhighest praise for Hubbard, who was also her auditor: “The Master did his Sundaybest on me,” she wrote Swanson in 1956. “He never went to bed—we talked theclock around—day after day—night after night—I was six thousand light yearsabove Arcturus—what a genius is our Great Red Father!”A constant stream of aspiring young actors, writers, and directors came toHollywood with common dreams, trying to leverage whatever ability or looks theymight have in a market already overwhelmed by beautiful and talented andchronically unemployed young people. Many of them were rather poorlyeducated—they had left school to gamble on stardom—but they were smart,talented, and desperately ambitious. Scientology promised these neophytes anentry into the gated community of celebrity. The church claimed to have a methodfor getting ahead; just as enticing was the whispered assertion that a networkof Scientologists existed at the upper levels of the entertainment industryeager to advance like-minded believers—a claim that never had much to supportit, but was not entirely untrue. Scientology was a small but growing subculturein the Hollywood studios.Kirstie Alley was an aspiring actress from Wichita who left the University ofKansas in her sophomore year, then struggled with an addiction to cocaine. Shesays that a single auditing session cured her habit. “Without Scientology, Iwould be dead,” she declared. The testimonials of such celebrities would leadmany curious seekers to follow their example. Posters with the faces oftelevision and movie stars were placed outside Scientology churches andmissions, saying, “I AM A SCIENTOLOGIST…COME IN AND FIND OUT WHY.” In theHollywood trade magazine Variety, Scientology offered courses promising to helpneophyte actors “increase your self-confidence” and “make it in the industry.”Scientologists stood outside Central Casting, where actors sign up for roles asextras, passing out flyers for workshops on how to find an agent or get into theScreen Actors Guild. Courses at the Celebrity Centre focused on communicationand self-presentation skills, which were especially prized in the entertainmentindustry. The drills and training routines would have felt somewhat familiar toanyone who had done scene work in an acting class. Many actors, at once insecurebut competitive by nature, were looking for an advantage, which Scientologypromised to give them. The fact that anyone was interested in them at all musthave come as a welcome surprise.Others who passed through Scientology at the same time as Paul Haggis wereactors Tom Berenger, Christopher Reeve, and Anne Francis; and musicians LouRawls, Leonard Cohen, Sonny Bono, and Gordon Lightfoot. None stayed long. JerrySeinfeld took a communication course, which he still credits with helping him asa comedian. Elvis Presley bought some books as well as some services he neveractually availed himself of. Rock Hudson visited the Celebrity Centre butstormed out when his auditor had the nerve to tell him he couldn’t leave untilhe finished with his session, although the matinee idol had run out of time onhis parking meter. The exemplary figure that Hubbard sought eluded capture.VERY EARLY ONE MORNING in July 1977, the FBI, having been tipped off aboutOperation Snow White, carried out raids on Scientology offices in Los Angelesand Washington, DC, carting off nearly fifty thousand documents. One of thefiles was titled “Operation Freakout.” It concerned the treatment of PauletteCooper, the journalist who had published an exposé of Scientology, The Scandalof Scientology, six years earlier.After having been indicted for perjury and making bomb threats againstScientology, Cooper had gone into a deep depression. She stopped eating. At onepoint, she weighed just eighty-three pounds. She considered suicide. Finally,she persuaded a doctor to give her sodium pentothal, or “truth serum,” andquestion her under the anesthesia. The government was sufficiently impressedthat the prosecutor dropped the case against her, but her reputation was ruined,she was broke, and her health was uncertain.The day after the FBI raid on the Scientology headquarters, Cooper was flyingback from Africa, on assignment for a travel magazine, when she read a story inthe International Herald Tribune about the raid. One of the files the federalagents discovered was titled “Operation Freakout.” The goal of the operation wasto get Cooper “incarcerated in a mental institution or jail.”One of the doors the federal agents opened during the raid in Los Angeles led tothe darkened basement of the old Cedars of Lebanon Hospital on Fountain Avenue,newly christened as Scientology’s Advanced Org building. There were no lights,so the heavily armed agents made their way down the stairs with flashlights.They found a warren of small cubicles, each occupied by half a dozen peopledressed in black boiler suits and wearing filthy rags around their arms toindicate their degraded status. Altogether, about 120 people were huddled in thepitch-black basement, serving time in the Rehabilitation Project Force. Theranks of the RPF had expanded along with the church’s need for cheap labor torenovate its recently purchased buildings in Hollywood. The federal agents hadno idea what they were seeing. Within moments, a representative of the church’sGuardian’s Office arrived and began shouting at the agents that they wereexceeding the limits of their search warrants. Seeing that the Sea Org membersposed no threat to them, the agents shrugged and moved on.It is instructive to realize that none of the Sea Org members consigned to theRPF dungeon took the opportunity to escape. If the FBI had bothered tointerrogate them, it’s unlikely that any of them would have said that they werethere against their will. Most of them believed that they were there by mistake,or that they deserved their punishment and would benefit by the work and studythey were prescribed. Even those who had been physically forced into the RPFwere not inclined to leave. Despite federal laws against human trafficking andunlawful imprisonment, the FBI never opened the door on the RPF again.Jesse Prince, one of the very few black members of the Sea Org, was among thosebeing punished. He had been attracted to Scientology by the beautiful girls andthe promise of superhuman powers. He recalls being told he would learn tolevitate, travel through time, control the thoughts of others, and have totalcommand over the material universe. In 1976, when he signed up for the Sea Org,Scientology had just purchased the Cedars of Lebanon Hospital, part of thereal-estate empire that the church was acquiring in Hollywood, along with theChâteau Élysée and the old Wilcox Hotel, which functioned as Sea Org berthing.The hospital was a mess; there were leftover medical devices and body parts inlaboratory jars; there was even a corpse in the basement morgue. The Sea Orgcrew slaved to convert the hospital into a dormitory and offices. One nightPrince was awakened after an hour of sleep and ordered to report to a superior,who chewed him out for slacking off. Prince had had enough. “Fuck you, I’m outtahere,” he said. His superior told him he wasn’t going anywhere. “He snapped hisfingers and six people came and put me in a room,” Prince recalled. “I wasliterally incarcerated.” It was March 1977. Prince was placed in the RPF withtwo hundred other Sea Org members, doing heavy labor and studying Hubbard’sspiritual technology. He would be held there for eighteen months. “They told methe only way to get out is to learn this tech to a ‘T’ and then be able to applyit.”The question posed by Prince’s experience in the RPF is whether or not he wasbrainwashed. It is a charge often leveled at Scientologists, although socialscientists have long been at war with each other over whether such a phenomenonis even possible. The decade of the 1950s, when Scientology was born, was a timeof extreme concern—even hysteria—about mind control. Robert Jay Lifton, a youngAmerican psychiatrist, began studying victims of what Chinese Communists called“thought reform,” which they were carrying out in prisons and revolutionaryuniversities during the Maoist era; it was one of the greatest efforts tomanipulate human behavior ever attempted. In 1949, a number of Americans andEuropeans who had been imprisoned during the Maoist revolution emerged fromtheir cells apparently converted to Communism. Then, during the Korean War,several United Nations soldiers captured by Chinese troops defected to theenemy. Some American soldiers among them went on camera to denounce capitalismand imperialism with apparent sincerity. It was a stunning ideological betrayal.To explain this phenomenon, an American journalist and CIA operative, EdwardHunter, coined the term “brainwashing.” Hunter described robotic agents withglassy eyes, like zombies or the products of demon possession. A popular novel,The Manchurian Candidate, published in 1959, and a film of the same name thatcame out three years later, capitalized on this conception of brainwashing asbeing the total surrender of free will through coercive forms of persuasion.Lifton’s early work on thought reform has become the basis for much of thescholarship on the subject since then. Lifton defined thought reform as havingtwo basic elements: confession, which is the renunciation of past “evil,” andre-education, which in China meant refashioning an individual in the Communistimage. “Behind ideological totalism lies the ever-present human quest for theomnipotent guide—for the supernatural force, political party, philosophicalideas, great leader, or precise science—that will bring ultimate solidarity toall men and eliminate the terror of death and nothingness,” Lifton observes. Infacing the commonplace charge that psychiatry, or the Marines, or Catholicschools all engage in forms of brainwashing, Lifton developed a set of criteriato identify a totalistic environment, and contrasted these with more-openapproaches to reshaping human behavior.The totalist paradigm begins with shutting off the individual’s access to theoutside world, so that his perceptions of reality can be manipulated withoutinterference. The goal at this stage is to provoke expectable patterns ofbehavior that will appear to arise spontaneously, adding to the impression ofomniscience on the part of the controlling group. Those who are involved in themanipulation are guided by a sense of higher purpose that permits them—actually,compels them—to set aside ordinary feelings of human decency in order toaccomplish their great mission. Those who are being manipulated may come toendorse the goals and means of the group—as Prince did—or simply abandon thewill to resist. In either case, the individual is robbed of the chance forindependent action or self-expression.Because the moral climate is entirely controlled by the group, the “sins” thatone is made to confess function as pledges of loyalty to the ideals of themovement. The repetitive nature of these confessions inevitably turns them intoperformances. When the treasury of real sins is emptied, new ones may be coinedto satisfy the incessant demands of the inquisitors. In Scientology, one canconveniently reach into previous existences to produce an endless supply ofmisdeeds. Lifton points out that in totalist hands, confession is used toexploit vulnerabilities, rather than to provide the solace or forgiveness thattherapy and religion seek to provide. The paradoxical result can be the oppositeof total exposure: secrets proliferate, and doubts about the movement gounderground.The dogma of the group is promoted as scientifically incontestable—in fact,truer than anything any human being has ever experienced. Resistance is not justimmoral; it is illogical and unscientific. In order to support this notion,language is constricted by what Lifton calls the “thought-terminating cliché.”“The most far-reaching and complex of human problems are compressed into brief,highly reductive, definitive-sounding phrases, easily memorized and easilyexpressed,” he writes. “These become the start and finish of any ideologicalanalysis.” For instance, the Chinese Communists dismissed the quest forindividual expression and the exploration of alternative ideas as examples of“bourgeois mentality.” In Scientology, terms such as “Suppressive Person” and“Potential Trouble Source” play a similar role of declaring allegiance to thegroup and pushing discussion off the table. The Chinese Communists divided theworld into the “people” (the peasantry, the petite bourgeoisie) and the“reactionaries” or “lackeys of imperialism” (landlords and capitalists), whowere essentially non-people. In a similar manner, Hubbard distinguished betweenScientologists and “wogs.” The word is a derogatory artifact of Britishimperialism, when it was used to describe dark-skinned peoples, especially SouthAsians. Hubbard appropriated the slur, which he said stood for “worthy Orientalgentleman.” To him, a wog represented “a common, ordinary, run-of-the-mill,garden-variety humanoid”—an individual who is not present as a spirit. Those whoare within the group are made to strive for a condition of perfection that isunattainable—the ideal Communist state, for instance, or the clearing of theplanet by Scientology.When a preclear voices a criticism of Scientology or expresses a desire to leavethe church, the auditor’s response is to discover the “crimes” that the clienthas committed against the group. In Scientology jargon, those crimes are called“overts and withholds.” An overt is an action taken against the moral code ofthe group, and a withhold is an overt action that the person is refusing toacknowledge. Hubbard explained that the only reason a person would want to leaveScientology is because he has committed a crime against the group.Paradoxically, this is because humanity is basically good; he wants to separatehimself from the others in order to protect the group from his own bad behavior.In order to save the preclear from his self-destructive thoughts, the E-Meter isused in a security check (sec-check) to probe for other thoughts or actions. Forextreme cases, Hubbard developed what he called the Johannesburg ConfessionalList. The questions include:Have you ever stolen anything?Have you ever blackmailed anybody?Have you ever been involved in an abortion?There are further questions asking if the respondent has ever sold drugs,committed adultery, practiced homosexuality, had sex with a family member or aperson of another race. It winds up by inquiring:Have you ever had unkind thoughts about LRH?Are you upset about this Confessional List?The result of the sec-check procedure is that the person expressing doubts aboutthe church is steered into thinking about his own faults that led him toquestion Scientology in the first place. In the Chinese Communist example,Lifton points out, the combination of enforced logic and clichéd discoursecreates a kind of melodrama, in which formulaic thoughts and handicappedlanguage substitute for real emotions and complex understandings of humannature. Once inside the powerful logic of the group, one drifts further andfurther from the shore of common understanding.According to Lifton, factors such as these award the group life-and-deathauthority over individual members. And yet, despite the Communists’ absolutecontrol of the environment, of the forty victims that Lifton studied, only threewere “apparent converts” to the ideology. That figure has been used to discreditthe notion of brainwashing, although Lifton himself later said that he wasimpressed by the extent to which minds could be altered and “truth blurred tothe point of near extinction.”The CIA, alarmed by the reputed success of Chinese indoctrination, started itsown research into mind control, through a program called MKUltra. In themid-1950s, the agency began funding Dr. Ewen Cameron, a Scottish-born Americancitizen who was then directing the Allan Memorial Institute at McGill Universityin Montreal. Cameron was one of the most eminent psychiatrists of his time:earlier in his career, he had been a part of the Nuremberg tribunal thatexamined the atrocious human experiments of Nazi doctors; later he becamepresident of the American Psychiatric Association, the Canadian PsychiatricAssociation, and—when the CIA stumbled onto his work—president of the WorldPsychiatric Association. Cameron hoped to cure mental illness by eliminatingpainful memories and reordering the personality through positive suggestion. Theagency’s goal was somewhat different, of course; the stated reason was touncover effective methods of mind control and then train American soldiers inways of resisting such efforts. The CIA eventually destroyed the files of theMKUltra program, saying that it had acquired no useful information, but the realintention of the agency may have been to learn scientific ways of extractinginformation from unwilling subjects. (After 9/11, documents emerging from theGuantánamo Bay Naval Base showed that the methods used by US interrogators toquestion al-Qaeda suspects were based on Chinese Communist techniques.)The methods that Cameron used to erase his patients’ memories certainly meet thedefinition of torture. Electroshock therapy was administered to break the“patterns” of personality; up to 360 shocks were administered in a single monthin order to make the subject hyper-suggestible. On top of that, powerfuldrugs—uppers, downers, and hallucinogens—were fed to the incapacitated patientsto increase their disorientation. According to author Naomi Klein, who wroteabout these experiments in The Shock Doctrine, when Cameron finally believed hehad achieved the desired blank slate, he placed the patients in isolation andplayed tape-recorded messages of positive reinforcement, such as “You are a goodmother and wife and people enjoy your company.” Some patients were put into aninsulin coma to keep them from resisting; in that state they were forced tolisten to such mantras up to twenty hours a day. In one case, Cameron played amessage continuously for more than a hundred days.Cameron was a perfect archetype for the evil that science has done in the nameof mental health, and in the minds of many Scientologists, his work justifiesthe campaign the church has waged against psychiatry. It is intriguing tocompare these actual experiments with Hubbard’s mythic vision of Xenu and the R6implants, in which the disembodied thetans were forced to sit in front of moviescreens for thirty-six days of programming at the hands of psychiatrists.Although it is unlikely that Hubbard would have known about MKUltra when it wasgoing on, he had become fascinated by the mind-control scare. In 1955, hedistributed a pamphlet, which he probably wrote, called “Brain-Washing: ASynthesis of the Russian Textbook on Psychopolitics.” For some formerScientologists, “Brain-Washing” provides a codex for Hubbard’s grand scheme.There is an eerie mirroring of the techniques described in the pamphlet and someScientology practices, especially those put into effect in the RPF.The pamphlet opens with what is claimed to be a purloined speech given byLavrenti Beria, the head of the Soviet secret police under Joseph Stalin, toAmerican students studying at Lenin University, on the subject of“psycho-politics.” The term is defined as “[t]he art and science of assertingand maintaining dominion over the thoughts and loyalties of individuals,bureaus, and masses, and the effecting of the conquest of enemy nations through‘mental healing.’ ”The text specifies how to realign the goals of the individual with those of thegroup. The first task is to undermine the ability of the person to act and totrust himself. Next, his loyalty to his family is destroyed by breaking theeconomic dependency of the family unit, lessening the value of marriage, andturning over the raising of children to the State or the group. The individual’strust and affection for his friends is shattered by anonymous reports to theauthorities, supposedly from people close to him. Ultimately, all otheremotional claims on the person have been broken; only the State or the groupremains. “A psychopolitician must work hard to produce the maximum chaos in thefields of ‘mental healing,’ ” Beria says in his introductory speech. “You mustlabour until we have dominion over the minds and bodies of every importantperson in your nation.”FROM THE PERSPECTIVE of those social scientists who believe that brainwashing isa myth or a fraud that has been used to denigrate new religious movements,including Scientology, Jesse Prince must already have been a convert, or closeto one, before he went into the RPF. Although he says he was attracted to thechurch largely because of the girls, he was aware of the rigors of the Sea Orgbefore he joined it. Perhaps, like the three victims of Chinese Communistthought reform that Lifton termed “apparent converts,” Prince was predisposed tobe a part of a totalitarian movement because of his own psychological need toconform, or to be a part of a polarized system that separates all humanity intothe saved and the damned. Such persons, the theory goes, are reared in eitherchaotic or extremely authoritarian homes. They have conflicted images ofthemselves as being at once extremely good and extremely bad. This isparticularly true in adolescence, when identities are still volatile. Princedidn’t need to be brainwashed, the theory goes; he was actively looking for atotalistic organization that accommodated his polarized personality.Some incidents in Prince’s background support this hypothesis. Although hisupbringing was “tumultuous”—his mother died when he was ten—Prince maintainedclose and loving relationships with his father and his three younger siblings.After his mother died, however, he began experiencing bouts of total bodyparalysis accompanied by a sense of falling—“like jumping off the Grand Canyon.”The feeling was of helpless, abject terror. Then, suddenly, he would be outsidehis body, as if a parachute had opened, and he could observe himself sleeping inhis bed. The intensity of these experiences made them absolutely real to him,but he decided not to talk about them because “if you bring that up, you go tothe crazy house.” Prince now sees those episodes of body paralysis as severeanxiety attacks, but they prepared him to accept the truthfulness of theparanormal powers that Scientology claimed to provide.Brainwashing theory, on the other hand, proposes that strenuous influencetechniques can overwhelm and actually convert an individual to a whollydifferent perspective, regardless of his background or pre-existing charactertraits, almost like an addiction to a powerful drug can create an overpoweringdependency that can transform an otherwise stable personality. Stripping away aperson’s prior convictions leaves him hungry for new ones. Through endlessrounds of confession and the constant, disarmingly unpredictable fluctuationsbetween leniency and assault, love and castigation, the individual is brokenloose from his previous identity and made into a valued and trusted member ofthe group. To keep alienated members in the fold, “exit costs”—such as financialpenalties, physical threats, and the loss of community—make the prospect ofleaving more painful than staying.Whether Prince was brainwashed, as he believes, or spiritually enlightened, asthe church would have it, his thinking did change over the year and a half hespent in the RPF. In order to move out of the RPF, a member has to have a“cognition” that he is a Suppressive Person; only then can he begin to deal withthe “crimes” that he committed that caused him to be confined in the RPF in thefirst place. During his many hours of auditing, Prince later related, “You justkinda get sprinkles of little things that seem interesting, sprinkles ofsomething that’s insightful. And then you’re constantly audited and in a highlysuggestible state … like being pulled along very slightly to the point where nowI might as well just be here and see what this is about now. Maybe it’s not sobad, you know?”ONE OF JESSE PRINCE’S COMPANIONS in RPF was Spanky Taylor, an old friend of PaulHaggis’s from his early days in Scientology. She had become close to Paul andDiane soon after they arrived in Los Angeles. She called him “Paulie,” and hadhelped him market some of his early scripts when he was still trying to breakout of cartoons. From the beginning, she had seen his talent; her own talent washelping others realize theirs.“Spanky” was a schoolyard nickname for Sylvia, but it had such a teasing twistthat she could never escape it. She was the child of Mexican American laborersin San Jose. When she was fourteen, she became a fan of a local cover bandcalled People!, which included several Scientologists. She began helping thegroup with concert promotion, and soon she was working with some of the othergreat bands coming out of the Bay Area, such as Creedence Clearwater Revival andBig Brother and the Holding Company. Scientology was just another expression ofthe political and cultural upheaval of the times. Even members of the GratefulDead were drawn into Scientology, which promised mystical experiences withouthallucinogens. Albert Ribisi, the keyboard player for People!, introduced Spankyto the church. She joined the staff at the Santa Clara mission when she wasfifteen.She was a cheerful young woman with warm brown eyes who called everyone “honey.”Because of her experience with promotion, she was posted to the CelebrityCentre. The place was constantly buzzing with activity—tie-dyeing, fencing,poetry readings—and she loved it. Famous people were always passing through,which added to the sense that something fun and important was happening here.Spanky inevitably came to the notice of Yvonne Gillham, who had created theCelebrity Centre in 1969, after gaining Hubbard’s permission to go to LA andescape the tension of his romantic pursuit of her. Gillham came to look uponSpanky almost as an extension of herself, with the same easy, natural flair fordealing with people. Even though Spanky was still a teenager, Gillham arrangedfor her to take care of some of the most important figures associated with thechurch.One celebrity quickly took precedence. John Travolta was in Mexico making hisfirst film, The Devil’s Rain, a cheap horror movie starring Ernest Borgnine andWilliam Shatner. He got to be friends with Joan Prather, a promising youngactress and dancer, who was one of the few cast members his age. “He glommedonto me from day one,” she said. “He was extremely unhappy and not doing well.”Prather began talking about how much Scientology had helped her. Actors areoften asked to get in touch with feelings that can be quite devastating.“Dianetics offered a tool to get to one’s raw emotions without going completelybonkers,” she observed.“It sounded really interesting, so I brought up certain things about my case andasked if that could be handled,” Travolta later recalled. “And she said itcould. I said, ‘Come on … could THAT be handled? You know, I couldn’t believeit.” Prather gave him a copy of Dianetics. It helped with his bouts ofdepression and insomnia. “Sometimes people say the most incredible things in theworld to me that last year would make me suicidal,” he observed. On anotheroccasion he remarked, “Before Dianetics, if people said negative things to me orabout me, I would cave in easily. Being a man, that wasn’t a very appealingquality. Some people would say, ‘The boy is too sensitive.’ But many times I hadsuppressive people around me who would cave me in on purpose. I was sort of likea minefield.”Prather also counseled him using some of the basic processes of Scientology. “Iwent outside my body,” Travolta later said. “It was like the body was sort of onits own and I was outside walking round it. I got real frightened, and she said,‘Oh my goodness, you’ve gone exterior.’ ”When he returned to Los Angeles, Travolta began taking the Hubbard QualifiedScientologist Course at the Celebrity Centre with about 150 other students. Heconfided to the teacher, Sandy Kent, that he was about to audition for atelevision show, Welcome Back, Kotter. After roll call, Kent instructed everyoneto point in the direction of ABC Studios and telepathically communicate theinstruction: “We want John Travolta for the part.” At the next meeting, Travoltarevealed he had gotten the role of Vinnie Barbarino—the part that would soonmake him famous. “My career immediately took off,” Travolta boasted in a churchpublication. “I would say Scientology put me in the big time.”Gillham adored Travolta and constantly told him he was going to be a star. Toprove it, she gave him Spanky.Although Travolta craved fame, he was taken aback by the clamor that came alongwith it. Spanky managed his relationship with his fans. She went to the tapingsof his television show, accompanied him to his many public appearances, andpersuaded Paramount Pictures to buy a large block of Scientology auditing forhis birthday. She was his liaison with the church—in Scientology language, histerminal (“any person who receives, relays or sends communications”). She alsobecame a conduit between the rising young star and other Scientologists in theindustry, such as Paul Haggis, who gave Spanky a spec script for Welcome Back,Kotter to pass on to Travolta (it was never made).Travolta generously credited the church for advancing his career and giving himthe poise to handle his burgeoning celebrity. “You always have the fear,‘Success is terrific now, but will it last forever?’ ” he observed in oneinterview. “When you hit it quickly, you don’t know where it will go.…Scientology makes it all a lot saner.” He introduced a number of fellow actorsto Scientology, including Forest Whitaker, Tom Berenger, and Patrick Swayze, aswell as the great Russian dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov. (Travolta’s friendPriscilla Presley was the only one who actually stuck with the church.) SpankyTaylor was a visible reminder of Travolta’s increasing devotion to Scientology,as well as the church’s investment in his fame, which could be jeopardized bythe indiscreet behavior of a talented but entitled movie star.When the FBI raid on the Church of Scientology took place on July 8, 1977,Taylor was six months pregnant and living with her husband, Norman, in thesqualid Wilcox Hotel. Norm was an executive in the legal bureau. Early on themorning of the raid, he frantically called Spanky and told her to get over toYvonne’s office right away to get the loaded gun she had been given by a friend,which she kept in her desk. By the time Taylor arrived, there were FBI agentseverywhere—more than 150 of them at two Scientology buildings, the Advanced Organd Château Élysée. It was the largest FBI raid in history, and it went on allday and night. They brought battering rams and sledgehammers to break the locksand knock down walls. In addition to the 200,000 documents they were cartingoff—many of them purloined by Guardian’s Office operatives from governmentworkplaces—they found burglar tools and eavesdropping equipment. Taylordutifully made her way through the chaos to Yvonne’s office and slipped the guninto her purse. She didn’t allow herself to think how crazy it was to becarrying a weapon past all these lawmen.Outside the gates, reporters were clamoring to get in. Just then, a school buspulled up, full of kids from a religion class at the Pacific Palisades highschool. Taylor recalled with alarm that they were coming to take a tour that shehad previously arranged. The wide-eyed teens watched as Taylor explained to theteacher that this wasn’t the best time for the tour. (They never rescheduled.)Within the church, the explanation for the raid was that some Scientologistswere being charged with stealing the Xerox paper they used when they had copiedthe reports on the church in government files—in other words, it was justanother example of jackbooted government goons twisting the Constitution inorder to crack down on religious freedom. But when the indictments came out thefollowing year, the scale of Operation Snow White was plainly exposed. ElevenScientology executives, including Mary Sue Hubbard, were indicted in OperationSnow White. Her husband was named as an unindicted co-conspirator, although ithad arisen from his original plan.Saturday Night Fever premiered at Grauman’s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood inDecember. Travolta had spent five months training for the film, running twomiles a day and dancing three hours a night. He recognized the opportunity thatthe film provided, and he supplied a singular, electrifying performance. Butwhen he walked down the red carpet past the fusillade of camera flashes, helooked dazed. “When I got out of the limo in front of Grauman’s, I wasdumbfounded, I didn’t know how to take it,” he said in a televised interview atthe after-party. “It was like a fantasy, it was like a dream tonight.” He wastwenty-three years old, now an international star. He was also the mostconspicuous Scientologist in the world, after only L. Ron Hubbard himself. Andwho is to say that Scientology didn’t help make his dreams come true?YVONNE GILLHAM HAD fallen ill. She complained of headaches and was losingweight. She wanted desperately to go to Flag, where she could get theupper-level auditing she thought could cure her, but she was told there wasn’tmoney for that. Instead, she was sent on a mission to Mexico with her husband,Heber Jentzsch, an actor and musician who later became president of the church,a largely ceremonial post. They had married five years earlier. On her fiftiethbirthday, October 20, 1977, while still in Mexico, Yvonne suffered a stroke.Jentzsch sent her back to Los Angeles, while he completed the tour. After that,her daughter Janis, one of Hubbard’s original Messengers, received a beautifulsuitcase from her. Inside there was a letter, but it made no sense. Janis triedto find out what was wrong, but no one would say. Her sister, Terri, went to theSea Org berthing and found Yvonne lying in her room unattended. Finally, she wassent to a hospital, where doctors found a tumor in her brain, which had causedthe stroke in the first place. It would have been operable if she had come tothem sooner, the doctors said.Desperate to get Gillham the auditing she still thought she needed, Taylor wentto the financial banking officer and begged her for the funds to send her friendto Flag. “If she wants to go to Flag, she can take the fucking Greyhound,” theofficer responded.“You’re Yvonne’s assassin!” Taylor shouted.For her impertinence, Taylor was sentenced to RPF. Her new baby daughter,Vanessa, was taken away and placed in the Child Care Org, the Scientologynursery. There were thirty infants crammed into a small apartment withwall-to-wall cribs, with one nanny for every twelve children. It was dark anddank and the children were rarely, if ever, taken outside.When she got the news, Taylor cried, “You can’t do that now!” She was thinkingof Travolta. He had just called her the day before, saying that he was arrivingon an Air France flight after his appearance at a film festival in Deauville,where he was promoting Saturday Night Fever. Despite his triumph, Travoltaappeared depressed and withdrawn. During the filming of Saturday Night Fever hisgirlfriend, Diana Hyland, had died in his arms. She was two decades older thanhe—she played his mother in a made-for-TV movie, The Boy in the PlasticBubble—and had already had a double mastectomy when they met. Their romance wasdoomed when her cancer recurred. Taylor had helped Travolta through that periodof grief, but now his mother, the most important figure in his life, had alsodeveloped cancer. Travolta asked Taylor if she would pick him up at the airport.She promised him, “Wild horses wouldn’t keep me from being there!”The church officials now told Taylor that someone else would meet Travolta.Taylor knew the star would feel surprised and betrayed. He had come to rely onher, both as an unpaid assistant and for emotional support. He would immediatelysuspect that something terrible had happened and worry about her. Taylor wasmortified to think that she would be the cause of his discomfort.The RPF had moved out of the basement up to the top floor of the old V-shapedbuilding that formerly housed the Cedars of Lebanon Hospital. Nearly two hundredpeople were crammed by the dozen into old patient rooms in bunks stacked threehigh. Because of the overcrowding, Taylor was given a soggy mattress on theroof. It was cold. She could hear the traffic on Sunset Boulevard only a blockaway. She had a view of the Hollywood Hills and the endless lights of thewakeful city, which was throbbing all around her. So many young people like herhad been pulled into the matrix of Hollywood glamour and fame, even if theywould never enjoy it themselves. And now, here she was, in the heart ofit—isolated, trapped, humiliated, an unnoticed speck on a rooftop. Who couldbelieve that a person could be so lost in the middle of so much life?Moreover, she was pregnant again. It happened a few weeks after she entered RPF,during a brief marital visit from her husband. There was no maternal care or anyeasing of the intensely physical work she was made to do with the other“RPF’ers,” as they called themselves. For one two-week stretch, they wereputting in thirty hours at a stretch with only three hours off. Like everyoneelse, Taylor ate slop from a bucket—table scraps or rice and beans. After sixmonths on this diet she still wasn’t showing her pregnancy; indeed, she waslosing weight. She worried that she was going to lose the baby.A pair of missionaires came to see Taylor one day with a strange request. Theywere thinking about how to reward the RPF’ers for having done the renovations tothe Advanced Org building, which were now almost complete. “We would like you toarrange a private screening of Saturday Night Fever,” they told her.Of course, no one in the RPF had been able to see the movie, despite the factthat it was an international sensation. Getting to Travolta wasn’t easy,however. He was now the top box-office star in the world. Playboy called him“America’s newest sex symbol.” The church hierarchy was worried that he was alsodrifting away from Scientology. A screening of his movie would underscore hiscommitment to the religion at a moment when that seemed in doubt.As the church’s liaison to Travolta, Taylor was the obvious person to make thearrangements.“First of all, I can’t use the phone,” Taylor told the missionaires. “Secondly,I can’t leave the building. Maybe you’d like a Beatles reunion while you’reasking for that.”“We just think you could take care of this,” they replied.Taylor had to figure out a way to get a print of the film from Travolta withouthaving to explain why she had failed to pick him up at the airport and thendisappeared from his life for months, without a word. A couple of days later,the missionaires arranged for her to use a pay phone on one of the lower floorsof the building. Taylor called Kate Edwards, Travolta’s creative director at thetime.“Spanky! Where are you?” Edwards cried. Travolta and his production company hadbeen looking for her frantically.“Honey, I can’t really talk,” Taylor said. She told Edwards that she was in theLos Angeles complex. “I’ve been specially selected to do a program that willhelp me,” she explained vaguely. She said she had an urgent favor to ask—a printof the film.That was a problem. The movie was being shown around the world and all theprints were out. The only one available was Travolta’s personal copy, butEdwards said she would make the request. “Johnny said if you ever called andneeded something, just do it,” Edwards assured her.“You can’t tell John about this call!” Taylor said.“I’m going to have to tell him,” Edwards replied. “I’m going to have to ask himto borrow it.”The next time Taylor was allowed to call, Edwards told her that Travolta hadagreed to loan Taylor the print, under one condition: that he could see her. Themissionaires conferred with their superiors. They decided that as long as Taylorgot the print, she could meet Travolta for dinner on the Sunday night after thescreening.1Travolta followed up by sending flowers, which were delivered to Taylor in RPF.The screening took place on Saturday night in Scientology’s Lebanon Hall. It wasa high point for everyone, all the more so because it was followed by a discodance. Across the country similar dances were taking place, inspired byTravolta’s passionate performance.Taylor wouldn’t be a part of it, however. As soon as the movie was over and thecredits were rolling, several Scientology executives, including Yvonne’s formerhusband, Heber Jentzsch, escorted Taylor to an office and told her to callTravolta and cancel their date for dinner the following night.“I can’t do that!” Taylor said.“There have been all sorts of efforts to recover him, and we can’t let you getin the way of that,” Jentzsch told her. “Call him right now.”“It’s after midnight!”Travolta was furious when he heard what she had to say. “We had a deal!” hesaid.“I know, I’m sorry.”“How could you do this?” he demanded. “How could you leave your baby?” For thefirst time in their relationship, he raised his voice. “My mother died, and youweren’t there!”Taylor began to bawl so hard she couldn’t speak. She recalled that Travolta wasasking questions she couldn’t answer, questions she had been afraid to poseherself. He seemed to know what she was going through. “Unless you killedsomebody, which I don’t think you did, there’s no reason for you to be where youare,” Travolta told her. He had never said an unkind word to her in their entirerelationship, and his frankness was devastating.“I’m doing this so I can be better!” Taylor sobbed. “So I can help you more.”Meanwhile, Jentzsch was jabbing his finger at her and mouthing the order to hangup the phone. She quickly said good-bye and set the phone in the cradle. Thenshe was escorted back to RPF.All that night she cried and cried, but when the sun came up, she was floodedwith clarity. “I am so fucking out of here!” she decided. “I don’t know how, butI’m getting out.”It wasn’t obvious how she could escape. She had been placed in RPF in March; nowit was September. There hadn’t been time to plan because she was workingconstantly. She didn’t know where to turn. It didn’t occur to her to call herparents because she was so apprehensive that she might bring shame onScientology if anybody knew what had happened to her. In any case, she wasforbidden to speak to anyone outside the RPF, even to other Sea Org members. Andeven if she did escape, she realized, she actually knew very little about whatwas going on in the world. Since she had joined Scientology at the age offourteen, she had never read a book that hadn’t been written by L. Ron Hubbard.Taylor managed to slip away to visit her ten-month-old daughter in the ChildCare Org across the street. To her horror, she discovered that Vanessa hadcontracted whooping cough, which is highly contagious and occasionally fatal.The baby’s eyes were welded shut with mucus, and her diaper was wet—in fact, herwhole crib was soaking. She was covered with fruit flies. Taylor recoiled. Theprospect of losing both her unborn baby and her daughter seemed very likely.She finally conceived a plan. Explaining to her guards that she had to telephonethe doctor, she managed a brief call to Travolta’s office and asked Kate Edwardsto meet her the next day at a certain time, giving the address of the Child CareOrg. She hung up without even hearing Edwards’s response.The next day she was allowed a brief visit to the nursery. Taylor put an extradiaper in her purse. She had four dimes, all the money she had in the world, anda toothbrush. Fortunately, Edwards arrived, right on time.Taylor explained to her Scientology escort that Edwards was her sister-in-lawwho had come to take Vanessa to the doctor.“Is this approved?” he asked.“Oh, absolutely!” Taylor opened Edwards’s door and handed her the baby. Edwardsstared in bewilderment as Taylor loudly told her to call as soon as she foundout what the doctor said. Then, under her breath, she added, “Kate, when I shutthis door, please drive away as quickly as you can.” Edwards nodded, then Taylorjumped in. Edwards hit the gas.“Spanky, no!” the escort cried.Taylor hadn’t planned any further than this.She was still dressed in a man’s black boiler suit, with the sleeves and legsrolled up. Edwards fetched some clothes from her mother that would fit Taylor’semaciated frame and picked up some diapers for Vanessa, then checked them in tothe Tropicana Hotel on Santa Monica Boulevard. Taylor finally called her husbandin the Guardian’s Office. Another executive picked up the line. “Spanky! They’relooking for you everywhere! Where are you?” he demanded.“I want to talk to Norm,” she said.“You need to come back!”Taylor said she would call back at eleven that night. This time, her husbandanswered.“Are they there?” Taylor asked him.“Yes.”She hung up. After an hour or two, she called again. He said he was alone. Shetold him she was out of the church and not going back. The baby was safe, shesaid. Norm wanted to meet, and Spanky finally told him where she was. Sherealized their marriage was probably over, but she felt she owed him that. Normcame over to the Tropicana and they spoke for several hours.The next morning at nine there was a knock on the door of Taylor’s hotel room.Three Sea Org executives were there to haul her back to RPF.Taylor still believed in the revelations of her religion. She worried that hersalvation was at stake. But she was also gripped with fear that her baby and herunborn child were in mortal danger.At first, she was firm in telling the men that she wasn’t coming back. “If youlay a hand on me or my child, I’m filing charges!” she cried. They assured herthey just wanted to talk. They told her that they hated to see her be declared aSuppressive Person. She would be cut off from any other Scientologist—nearlyeveryone she knew. There was a proper way to “route out,” they reminded her.Eventually, Taylor agreed to return to the office to file the paperwork thatwould allow her to leave the Sea Org on good terms and still be a Scientologist.As part of the routing process, Taylor was given a confession to sign detailingall the “crimes” she had committed. She glanced at the document. Some of theactions cited were drawn from her preclear folders, things she had confessed toher auditors that were supposed to remain confidential. She knew how it worked;she says she had once been assigned to go through members’ folders and circleany “evil intentions” toward Scientology. Sexual indiscretions or illegal actswere always highlighted. These would be forwarded to the Guardian’s Office to beused against anyone who threatened to subvert the church. If the crimes weren’tsufficiently damning, Taylor came to learn, scandalous material would simply bemanufactured. She signed her confession without really reading it. Later, shewas given her bill.The theory of the “freeloader’s tab” is that people who join the Sea Org don’thave to pay for the cost of auditing and the coursework to move up the Bridge.The truth is that there is never much time to take advantage of suchinstruction. Taylor had been in the Sea Org for seven years, however, and thebill for the services she might have taken amounted to more than $100,000.Just before she left the office, the executive handling her case was called awayfor a moment. Taylor took her confession off his desk and stuffed it in herpurse. When she finally left the building, she tore it to pieces.WHEN HUBBARD FOUND OUT Yvonne Gillham was dying, he sent her a telex asking ifshe wanted to keep her body or move on to the next cycle. She decided it wouldbe quicker just to let go, but she still wanted the auditing. Hubbard agreed tolet her travel to Clearwater, to do an “end of cycle on her hats”—meaning thatshe would brief her successor at the Celebrity Centre before she died.Hana Eltringham was stationed at Flag, and she was shocked at the sight of herdear friend. Yvonne was dizzy and frequently lost her balance, and her thoughtstrailed away. She refused to take pain medication because it would interferewith her auditing. She tearfully blamed herself for the terrible “overt” ofdying and deserting Hubbard. She was desperate to see her children, to saygood-bye, but they were kept away.Hubbard designated Elizabeth Gablehouse, one of Yvonne’s closest friends, totalk to her about the celebrities in her care—who was a reliable speaker, whowas good at recruiting other celebrities. Yvonne talked about variouspeople—some television actors, a Mexican pop singer, the producer Don Simpson,Karen Black, Chick Corea, and Paul Haggis, among others—but she was particularlyworried about Travolta. “Please help him. He’s especially sensitive,” she said.She advised Gablehouse to deal with the celebrities the same way she treatedHubbard—very delicately, and with an open mind. Gillham died in January 1978.Spanky Taylor’s son, Travis, was born that March, weighing less than threepounds, although he was carried to full term. (Both of Taylor’s children arealive and healthy today.)Many former Sea Org members found their departure from the church to be tangledin confusion, panic, grief, and conflicting loyalties. Many still cling to arelationship with the church, sometimes for years, like Taylor, or for the restof their lives. The coda to Taylor’s story is that a year after leaving the SeaOrg, she traveled to Houston to meet with Travolta. He was filming Urban Cowboyat the time. On her own initiative, she came to “recover” him for the church.She had heard that he was having problems in his life, and she worried that herown troubles had prevented him from turning to the church for help. It was alsopossible that if she brought Travolta back into the fold, her standing in thechurch would be improved.Like most celebrities, Travolta had been shielded from the church’s innerworkings. The scandals that periodically erupted in the press about Hubbard’sbiography, or his disappearance, or the church’s use of private investigatorsand the courts to harass critics—these things rarely touched the awareness ofScientology luminaries. Many simply didn’t want to hear about the problemsinside their organization. It was easy enough to chalk such revelations up toreligious persecution or yellow journalism. “There are two sides to the story,but I don’t know both sides,” Travolta blithely said when he was asked aboutOperation Snow White. “I’m not involved with that.” In any case, for someonelike Travolta, who was so publicly associated with the church, it would be hardto just walk away. He had been asked to declare himself publicly, and he haddone so, again and again.The star was staying in a private house in Houston. He and Taylor met in theevening, after dinner, over a plate of chocolate-chip cookies that she hadbrought. She explained that she had left the Sea Org and was with her childrennow, then quickly changed the subject and asked about him. He described theproblems he was having.Former Scientologists have given conflicting accounts of Travolta’s stressfulrelationship with the church at that time. The church hierarchy was desperatelyconcerned that their most valuable member would be revealed as gay; at the sametime, the hierarchy was prepared to use that against him. Bill Franks, thechurch’s former executive director, told Time magazine that Travolta was worriedthat if he defected, the church would expose his sexual identity. Jesse Princehas stated that Travolta was threatening to marry a man, although that wasn’t alegal option at the time. In Franks’s opinion, the church had Travolta trapped.At one point, the star sought assurance from Franks that his private confessionswouldn’t be used against him. “My sessions are protected, right?” he askedFranks. In truth, intelligence officers inside the church had already beendirected to gather material—called a Dead Agent pack—that would be used againstTravolta if he turned.In Houston, however, Travolta told Taylor that he didn’t really feel that heneeded to be recovered—he was just taking a break. However, Taylor did persuadehim to buy a costly package of auditing so that he could get back on the Bridge.He had stopped his coursework after completing OT III.After that, Taylor received a letter from Hubbard saying, “Well done.” Thefounder asked if there was anything she needed. She asked nothing for herself,but begged Hubbard to do a “Folder Error Summary” on Travolta, in which thefounder would personally review all the star’s auditing over the years to spotany mistakes—a tremendous honor for any Scientologist. A Messenger assured herthat it would be done.Not long afterward, however, Travolta stopped talking to Taylor. She got a callfrom Priscilla Presley, who asked what was going on. Presley had run intoTravolta and he said that they should get together. “I’ll call Spanky,” Presleyhad told him.“No, don’t go through Spanky,” Travolta said.When Spanky heard this, she realized she had been declared a Suppressive Person.Nobody had bothered to tell her, but from now on, no Scientologist would beallowed to talk to her.Taylor never tried to speak to Paul Haggis again, worried that she mightcompromise his relationship to the church. For his part, Haggis had no idea whathad happened to Spanky. He wondered why she had just disappeared. ButScientologists were always drifting in and out of his life. Sea Org members,even friends like Spanky, might be suddenly posted somewhere else withoutexplanation, or assigned to Clearwater for advanced training, or sent to asecret Sea Org base where they were rarely in contact with the outside world.That might explain her absence. He didn’t inquire. He readily identified withthe church’s narrative that Scientology was being victimized by an intolerantand uncomprehending press, self-serving politicians, careerist bureaucrats, andreactionary police agencies looking for headlines. By publicly defendingScientology, he took on the great burden of scorn and ridicule routinelydirected at the church; and in that way, he also allied himself with persecutedminorities everywhere: he was one of them.If he had known that his friend had been declared a Suppressive, Haggis wouldhave had a difficult choice to make. It was one he would face soon in any case.In 1983, Haggis’s writing partner on the TV series Diff’rent Strokes, HowardMeyers, who was also a Scientologist, decided to follow a splinter group led byDavid Mayo, who had been one of the highest officials in the church. Haggis toldMeyers that he couldn’t work with him anymore. Because Meyers was the seniorwriter on the show, Haggis resigned and went looking for other work.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Travolta’s attorney denies there was an agreement to visit Spanky in exchangefor his personal copy of Saturday Night Fever."},{"pageContent":"5[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_L02_r1.jpg]DROPPING THE BODYHubbard never lost his interest in being a movie director. He wrote innumerablescripts for Scientology training films, but he still thought he could take overHollywood. He had particularly high hopes for one script, “Revolt in the Stars,”that was based on one of his novels. Inspired by the thunderous success of StarWars, Hubbard worked on the script in 1979 with the legendary acting teacherMilton Katselas with the aim of having it made into a feature film.A journeyman theater and film director before taking over the Beverly HillsPlayhouse, Katselas had directed the 1972 film Butterflies Are Free, starringGoldie Hawn and Edward Albert (Eileen Heckart won an Oscar for Best Actress in aSupporting Role). He was a vital link to the Hollywood celebrity machine thatScientology depended upon. The list of his protégés included Al Pacino, GoldieHawn, George C. Scott, Alec Baldwin, Ted Danson, Michelle Pfeiffer, GeneHackman, George Clooney, and many other now-familiar names. His invitation-onlySaturday master class was seen by many young actors as a portal to stardom. Heattained OT V status and was one of the most profitable sources of recruits forthe church, receiving in return a ten percent commission on the moneycontributed by his students. At one point, Katselas asked if he could join theSea Org, but Hubbard told him it was more important to continue doing what hewas doing.When Katselas and Hubbard finished the script of “Revolt in the Stars,” Hubbarddispatched one of his top Messengers, Elizabeth Gablehouse, to Hollywood to makea deal. After the Moroccan adventure, Hubbard had appointed her his PersonalPublic Relations Officer. Gablehouse came from a moneyed background, and sheknew how to talk about finances. She shopped the script around and found a buyerwilling to offer $10 million—which, at the time, would have been the highestprice ever paid for a script, she was told. The Guardian’s Office becamesuspicious and investigated the buyers, who they learned were Mormons. Hubbardfigured that the only reason Mormons would buy it was to put it on the shelf.Gablehouse wound up being sent to the RPF, and when she balked at that, she wasdemoted even further—to the RPF’s RPF, alone, in the furnace room under theparking garage of the Clearwater base. The script never did get made into afilm.Hubbard’s location was a deep secret. Scientologists who asked were told he was“over the rainbow.” Meantime, a full-fledged movie studio, the Cine Org, was setup in a barn at Hubbard’s La Quinta hideaway. With his usual brio, Hubbardassumed that he was fully capable of writing, producing, and directing his ownmaterial, but his novice staff often frustrated him. He would do scenes over andover again, exhausting everyone, but he was rarely satisfied with the outcome.He walked around the set bellowing orders through a bullhorn, sometimes right inthe face of a humiliated staff member.Hubbard was becoming increasingly cranky and confused. He slept with guardsoutside his door, hiding in the tamarind trees that flanked his cottage. Onemorning he accused the Messenger outside his door of abandoning his post.“Someone came in and exchanged my left boot for a boot half a size smaller,” hesaid. “They even scuffed it up to make it look the same. Someone is trying tomake me think I’m crazy.”IN AN EFFORT to lighten the mood, several of the crew made up a comic skit andgave a video of it to Hubbard. He was offended; he was sure they were mockinghim. “He was shouting at the TV,” one of his executives recalled. “He sent theMessengers to find the names of everyone involved.”One of the perpetrators of the skit was a cocky young camera operator namedDavid Miscavige. Only seventeen years old, Miscavige had already been marked asa rocket within the church. He spent his early years in Willingboro, New Jersey,a suburb of Philadelphia; it was one of the mass-produced Levittowns built inAmerica after World War II. He and his older brother, Ronnie, played football ina children’s league for a team called the Pennypacker Park Patriots. Despite hisathleticism, David was handicapped by his diminutive size and severe bouts ofasthma, which caused numerous trips to the emergency room.His father, Ron Miscavige, a salesman at various times of cookware, china,insurance, and cosmetics, was the first in the family to be drawn to the work ofHubbard. Frustrated with the ineffective treatment his son was getting for hisasthma, Ron took David to a Dianetics counselor. “I experienced a miracle,”David later declared, “and as a result I decided to devote my life to thereligion.” But in fact asthma continued to afflict him, and his disease was atthe center of the Miscavige family drama.Soon Ron and his wife, Loretta, and their four children were getting auditing atthe Scientology mission in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Ronnie Junior was the oldestof the children, followed by the twins, David and Denise, and the youngest,Laurie. In 1972, the family moved to England in order to take advanced coursesat the church’s worldwide headquarters at Saint Hill. At the age of twelve,David became one of the youngest auditors in the history of the church—“theWonder Kid,” he was called.The following year, in June, Ron and Loretta had to return to the United Statesfor a couple of weeks. They needed someone to take care of David while they andthe other children were gone. There was another American studying at Saint Hill,Ervin Scott, whose wife was also afflicted with asthma. His memory is that heagreed to let the boy stay with him. He recalls that in the first encounterDavid’s parents, along with his twin sister, met with him before they left.Scott immediately liked the family. The father was “wonderful and bright,” themother was “very beautiful, with high affinity,” and the daughter was “thecutest thing.” David, however, sat at the end of the couch, unsmiling, with hisarms crossed. The family wanted to make sure that Scott knew what to do in caseof an intense asthma attack. “They said, ‘We have to warn you about Dave,’ ”Scott recalled. “ ‘David has episodes, very unusual episodes.’ ” The parentsexplained that Dave became extremely angry when he was suffering an asthmaseizure. “Then they said, starting with the husband, ‘When these episodes occur,do not touch him!’ The mother reiterated, ‘Yes, please don’t touch him!’ I said,‘What happens?’ They said, ‘David gets very, very violent, and he beats the hellout of you if you touch him.’ And the sister says, ‘Oh my God, he does beat you,really hard!’ ” Again and again, the family members emphasized that David hadbeaten them during an attack.Scott glanced at David, who, he recalls, nodded in agreement. He seemed almostsmug, Scott remembers thinking, “like he was arrogantly proud of kicking theirass.”Scott was puzzled. He had never heard of asthma making a person violent. In hisexperience, a person in the grip of such an attack was frozen with fear. He saidhe would heed the warning, however.The next morning, David moved in. Scott took him shopping and then to a pub,where he bought him a Coke. Scott also got a nonalcoholic drink. They chattedwith some other Scientology auditors and David began to warm up. He seemedpleased to be around auditors, but Scott felt that there was “a certainfalseness” in his behavior.They went back to Scott’s quarters and watched television, then turned in aroundten. Scott placed David in the bed by the window, which was cracked to give himsome fresh air. David went right to sleep. Scott was used to the rattle ofasthmatic breathing, so he soon fell asleep as well.Scott remembers hearing a scream around one o’clock. He jumped up and turned onthe light. David was leaning on the bed with one arm. His face was blue and hiseyes were rolled back. Scott had never seen anything like it. He started totouch him, but drew back and performed a Scientology “assist.” He said, “That’sit, David, come up to present time,” repeating the command twice. David blinkedand then jolted awake. He was still disoriented, so Scott performed anotherScientology exercise, called a locational: “Look at that wall. Look at thatbed.” Slowly, David began to focus. Finally he asked Scott, “Did I hit you?”“No.”“Whew!”David was still groggy and quickly went back to sleep, but Scott was unsettled.He watched the boy for another hour before drifting off again himself.In the morning, David remembered nothing of what had happened during the night.He got ready to take a shower. When he took off his pajama top, Scott did adouble take. He had never seen a thirteen-year-old boy with such muscles. “Thiskid is built like Arnold Schwarzenegger!” he thought. “A young, very smallArnold Schwarzenegger.”While David was in the shower, Scott took a look at the medication on hisnightstand. He remembers seeing two bottles and two inhalers. One of theinhalers was a typical over-the-counter medication, but all the others containedsteroids. Scott had grown up on a farm, and he had used steroids to treat somediseases in animals, but also to build up the muscle mass in cattle. Could thathave had the same effect on Miscavige? (Actually, asthma medications often usecorticosteroids, which do not have the same effect as the anabolic steroids thatweightlifters and athletes employ. Corticosteroids can stunt growth, however,and if Miscavige took them might have contributed to his short stature.) Scottdecided to write a Knowledge Report about what he had seen, which would go tothe Ethics Officer. “Here is a Scientologist, and he’s taking drugs, and he’shaving these very bad episodes of asthmatic attacks, that can and should behandled by auditing.” He also asked for David’s preclear folder, which shouldhave a record of his previous auditing. He was told that David didn’t have a PCfolder. Scott had never heard of a Scientologist without one.Scott worked with David on some of his coursework and training drills. At times,the teenager struck him as highly intelligent, but robotic, and there were someconcepts he couldn’t seem to grasp. For instance, with the most basic E-Meterdrill, which was simply to touch the meter and then let go, Scott recalls thatDavid’s hand was shaking. “David, relax! This is just a drill,” Scott said.David settled down, and they continued the drill, but Scott was troubled. Theboy was supposed to be a qualified auditor but he didn’t seem to be trained atall. According to Scott, David admitted that he had never audited anyone andthat, in fact, he had never even been audited himself. “Auditing is forweaklings,” he said. In any case, he said, he was Clear from a past life. Scottwrote up another Knowledge Report.The course supervisor was strangely impatient with Scott for taking extra timeto get Dave through the drills. There was something else that was peculiar, too.A photographer kept following David around. Later, Scott learned that aScientology magazine was preparing an article about the youngest auditor tocomplete an internship in the Sea Org. Scott was complicating matters by holdingup David’s progress.Scott remembers that on Monday, David audited a preclear. When he came back tothe room, he seemed agitated, and Scott asked him what was going on. “Thosefucking women!” Scott remembers David exclaiming. “There should be no women inthe Sea Org.” Scott learned that there were three women who were overseeingDavid’s internship at Saint Hill. David’s attitude toward women was deeplytroubling, as Scott noted in yet another Knowledge Report. So far, no one in theEthics Office had responded.That changed a few days later. Scott was called into the Ethics Office and toldthat David had complained that Scott was enturbulating, or upsetting, him andcausing problems because of the abundant reports he was writing. “This kid is anSP,” Scott warned, “and you better handle him.” Then he opened the door toleave. David was standing just outside. His reaction told Scott that he hadoverheard him calling him a Suppressive Person. “He went into total fear,” Scottsaid. That very day, David was moved into another room, and his parents soonreturned from the United States. But David avoided Scott whenever they passedeach other.In August, Scott was sitting out in the yard across from the castle and theauditing rooms on the Saint Hill grounds. He was talking to a friend of his, aNorwegian nurse. Suddenly they heard a young woman wailing. Scott rememberslooking up and seeing David, his face red and the veins visible in his forehead.He had a preclear folder under his arm. Behind him was the crying girl, who washolding her side in apparent pain. According to Scott the nurse exclaimed, “Hebeat up his PC!”Karen de la Carriere was also a young intern at Saint Hill, and she was directedto join the others in the internship room. “They told us that David Miscavigehad struck his PC,” she recalled. “He had been removed from his internship, andwe were not to rumor-monger or gossip about it. We were supposed to just buryit.”David was not done with Scientology, however. At fifteen, he went Clear in hispresent life. On his sixteenth birthday in 1976, “sickened by the decliningmoral situation in schools illustrated by rampant drug use,” he dropped out oftenth grade and formally joined the Sea Org. He began his service in Clearwater;less than a year later, he was transferred to the Commodore’s Messengers inCalifornia, where once again he quickly captured the attention of the churchhierarchy with his energy and commitment. He rose to the position of ChiefCinematographer at the age of seventeen. After the skit that made such a poorimpression on Hubbard, David redeemed himself in the founder’s eyes byrenovating one of his houses and ridding it of fiberglass, which Hubbard said hewas allergic to.David Miscavige filled a spot in Hubbard’s plans that once might have beenoccupied by Quentin, although Miscavige displayed a passion and focus thatQuentin never really possessed. He was tough, tireless, and doctrinaire. DespiteDavid’s youth, Hubbard promoted him to Action Chief, the person in charge ofmaking sure that Hubbard’s directives were strictly and remorselessly carriedout. He ran missions around the world to perform operations that local orgs wereunable to do themselves—at least, not to Hubbard’s satisfaction.1HUBBARD FINISHED WRITING his thousand-page opus, Battlefield Earth, in 1980.(Mitt Romney would name it as his favorite novel.) Hubbard hoped to have thebook made into a major motion picture, so the Executive Director of the church,Bill Franks, approached Travolta about producing and starring in it. Travoltawas excited about the prospect. Suddenly Franks got a call from Miscavigesaying, “Get me John Travolta. I want to meet that guy!” Miscavige began winingand dining the star. “He just moved in and took over Travolta,” Franks recalled.But he says that privately Miscavige was telling him, “The guy is a faggot.We’re going to out him.”Fleeing subpoenas from three grand juries, and pursued by forty-eight lawsuits,all naming the founder, Hubbard slipped away from public view on Valentine’sDay, 1980, in a white Dodge van, with velvet curtains and a daybed. It had beencustomized by John Brousseau, a Sea Org member who took care of all of Hubbard’svehicles. The elaborate escape plan involved ditching the Dodge for an orangeFord. In the meantime, Brousseau purchased another Dodge van for Hubbard,identical to the first. He then cut the original one into pieces and took themto the dump. The Ford was chopped up and dumped as well.Hubbard briefly settled in Newport Beach, California, in a one-bedroom apartmentwith a kitchenette. In the apartment next door were Pat and Annie Broeker, histwo closest aides. Pat, a handsome former rock-and-roll guitar player,enthusiastically adopted the role of an undercover operative, running secreterrands for Hubbard and going to any lengths to keep their location a secret.His wife, Annie, one of the original Commodore’s Messengers, was a shy blonde,totally devoted to Hubbard.Hubbard soon decided that the Newport Beach location was compromised, so thethree of them hit the road. Pat drove a Chevrolet pickup with a forty-footCountry Aire trailer, which mainly contained Hubbard’s wardrobe, and Anniepiloted a luxurious Blue Bird mobile home that John Brousseau had purchased for$120,000 in cash under a false name. The Blue Bird towed a Nissan pickup thatBrousseau had converted into a mobile kitchen. For most of a year, thiscumbersome caravan roamed the Sierras, lighting in parks along the way. At onepoint, Hubbard bought a small ranch with a gold mine, but he didn’t reallysettle down until 1983, on a horse farm in Creston, California, population 270,outside San Luis Obispo, near a spread owned by the country singer Kenny Rogers.He grew a beard and called himself “Jack Farnsworth.”Hubbard had been used to receiving regular shipments of money, but after he tookflight, the entire structure of the church was reorganized, making suchunder-the-table transfers more difficult to disguise. Miscavige ordered that $1million a week be transferred to the founder, but now it had to be done in anominally legal manner. One scheme was to commission screenplays based onHubbard’s innumerable movie ideas. That way, Hubbard could be paid for the“treatment”—about $100,000 for each idea. Fifty such treatments were prepared.Paul Haggis was one of the writers asked to participate. He received a messagefrom the old man asking him to write a script called “Influencing the Planet.”The script was supposed to demonstrate the range of Hubbard’s efforts to improvecivilization. Haggis co-wrote the script with another Scientologist, SteveJohnstone. “What they wanted was really quite dreadful,” Haggis admitted.Hubbard sent him notes on the draft, but apparently the film was never made.Meanwhile, Miscavige consolidated his position in the church as the essentialconduit to the founder. Miscavige’s title was head of Special Project Ops, amysterious post, and he reported only to Pat Broeker. Miscavige was twenty-threeyears old at the time and Broeker a decade older. As gatekeepers, theydetermined what information reached Hubbard’s ears. Under their regency, some ofHubbard’s most senior executives were booted out—people who might have beenconsidered competitors to Miscavige and Broeker in the future management of thechurch—and replaced by much younger counterparts.Miscavige and Broeker would communicate in code on their pagers. At any hour ofthe night, John Brousseau, who was Miscavige’s driver, would take him to one ofthe several designated pay telephone booths between Los Angeles and RiversideCounty to wait for a call revealing the rendezvous point. It was usually aparking lot somewhere. The drivers of the two men would wait while Miscavige andBroeker talked, sometimes for hours.Gale Irwin, who had been on the Apollo when she was sixteen years old and hadrisen to being the head of the Commodore’s Messengers Org, began to wonder whatwas going on. Hubbard’s dispatches had become increasingly paranoid, and hisonly line of communication to the outside world was through these two ambitiousyoung men. Nearly every one of the original Messengers who had joined Hubbard onthe Apollo had been purged. David Mayo, who was Hubbard’s personal auditor, hadalso been shut off from contact. He, too, became suspicious of Miscavige andordered him to be security-checked, but Miscavige refused this direct order froma superior. Gale Irwin says she confronted him, and Miscavige knocked her to theground with a flying tackle. (The church denies all charges of Miscavige’sabuse.)Brousseau got a call from Irwin. She was agitated. She told him that Miscavigehad gone psychotic. She said she had to contact Pat Broeker right away for ameeting. When Brousseau asked to talk to Miscavige, Irwin began shouting ordersat him, saying that Miscavige was raving and had to be restrained. In no waycould Brousseau talk to him! He must arrange the meeting with Broekerimmediately!Brousseau drove her to a prearranged pay phone outside a Denny’s restaurant inSan Bernardino, which was used only for emergencies. As they waited for the callfrom Broeker’s driver, a black Dodge van came barreling into the parking lot andslammed to a halt between Brousseau’s car and the phone booth. The doors blewopen and half a dozen men spilled out of the van, including David Miscavige.Irwin says that Miscavige used a tire iron to pummel the pay phone, without mucheffect. Finally he was able to yank the receiver off the cable. Miscavigeordered Irwin into the van, and she meekly acquiesced.With this action, the coup was accomplished: Miscavige and Broeker were nowfully and defiantly in control of Scientology. The founder was isolated, cagedby his notoriety and paranoia. No one knew if the orders coming from over therainbow were from Hubbard or his lieutenants, but now it no longer mattered.Irwin was busted. A year later, in 1984, Miscavige declared her a SuppressivePerson, which would happen to nearly every one of the original Messengers, themost trusted circle of Hubbard’s advisers. David Mayo was sent to the RPF. Hewas made to run around a pole in the searing desert heat for twelve hours a day,until his teeth fell out.There was one last obstacle that Miscavige had to remove. In 1979, as a resultof the FBI raid, Mary Sue had been charged and convicted of conspiracy, alongwith ten other Scientology executives, and sentenced to five years in prison,despite the evidence that her health was in decline. She suffered from chronicpancreatitis, a painful condition that made it difficult to digest food. “Shewas frail and thin and completely oblivious to anything she had done wrong,”recalled a Scientologist who escorted her into the back door of the courthousein Washington. “She said, ‘I don’t want to be photographed.’ That was moreimportant to her than the fact that she was going to jail for five years.”While her case was on appeal, Mary Sue was placed in a comfortable house in LosAngeles, well away from Hubbard. She posed a dilemma for the church, andparticularly for her husband. Hubbard was concerned that he might be indicted bya grand jury in New York that was looking into the church’s harassment ofPaulette Cooper, the journalist who had written The Scandal of Scientology. IfMary Sue were sufficiently alienated to implicate Hubbard, Scientology would bedevastated. Hubbard dictated frequent letters telling her what to say toprosecutors; the letters would be read to her and then destroyed. A crew ofMessengers spent weeks sorting through all the orders and correspondencerelating to Operation Snow White and other possible criminal activity that theFBI had not seized, making sure that Hubbard’s name was excised from any damningevidence.Mary Sue still commanded the loyalty and affection of many Scientologists whosaw her as a martyr. Moreover, she refused to divorce Hubbard or to resign herposition as head of the Guardian’s Office. The sprawling intelligence apparatusthat she built still operated in secret, behind locked doors. The Commodore’sMessengers Org and the Guardian’s Office were parallel and sometimes competingarms of their founders, and they had often struggled for power, in a kind ofbureaucratic marital spat. Now that Miscavige was fully in control of the CMO,he concluded that the GO had to be ripped out of Mary Sue’s grasp—but withoutupsetting her to the point that she sought revenge.In the spring of 1981, a delegation of Commodore’s Messengers—includingMiscavige and Bill Franks—went to meet Mary Sue at a conference room in theWestin Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles. Each of them wore a hidden microphone.Miscavige’s audacious plan was to seize control of the GO and place it undercontrol of the Messengers, who numbered only about fifty at the time. Severalthousand Guardians were still working for Mary Sue. She had treated them kindly,paying them decent wages and allowing them to live in private homes. Most ofthem remained loyal to her and thought that she was being made a scapegoat. Theywould have to be purged.Mary Sue received the delegation of Messengers coolly. Her case was still onappeal, but the outcome was clear: she was taking the fall for a program thatHubbard, after all, had put in motion. She understood the influence she stillwielded in the church and the threat she represented. She demanded to deal withHubbard himself, but Miscavige refused. He controlled access to the church’sfounder so thoroughly that even his wife couldn’t talk to him. Indeed, theyhadn’t spoken in more than a year. Mary Sue cursed Miscavige and threatened tothrow a heavy ashtray at him. But her negotiating position was not strong,unless she was willing to betray everything she had worked to build with the manshe still believed was a savior.It must have been galling for her to negotiate with Miscavige, who wastwenty-one at the time—the age Mary Sue was when she married Hubbard. Privately,she called him “Little Napoleon.” In exchange for her resignation from the GO,the Messengers offered a house and a financial settlement. Mary Sue hadsubstantial legal bills and no other means of support. Under the guise of havingto sort out the messes that would be left behind in the wake of her resignation,Miscavige went over a number of different subjects, even including a couple ofmurders that were alleged to have been committed by a member of the GO office inLondon. He wanted Mary Sue on tape, confessing to other crimes, which could thenbe fed to the government. This was done, Bill Franks asserts, with Hubbard’sknowledge: “Hubbard wanted her out of the way. He wanted all guns pointed at herso he could go about his old age without worrying about being thrown in jail.”Mary Sue lost her last appeal. She began serving a five-year sentence inLexington, Kentucky, in January 1983. Hubbard never visited her in prison. Herletters went unanswered. “I don’t believe he’s getting them,” she laterreasoned. Mary Sue was released after serving one year. She never saw herhusband again.MANY PEOPLE WHO JOINED the church under Hubbard would later contend thatMiscavige’s machinations were opposed to the will of the founder. But there isevidence that Miscavige was acting on Hubbard’s direct orders. Jesse Prince saysthat when Hubbard was angry at someone he would command Miscavige to hit or spiton them, then report back when he had done so. Larry Brennan, who was a memberof the church’s Watchdog Committee in charge of dealing with legal affairs, hadseen how a minor infraction could be inflated into a major offense thatjustified the most severe penalty. There were no mistakes; there were onlycrimes. Every action was intended. This logic brooked no defense.Once a week, after Hubbard disappeared, Brennan had to drive ninety milessoutheast of Los Angeles to the little town of Hemet in order to write upconfidential reports to be sent to the missing leader. The church operated asecret base there in a former resort known as Gilman Hot Springs. Two Sea Orgbases are located on the old Gilman resort, Gold and Int. Gold Base is namedafter Golden Era Productions, the lavishly equipped film and recording studioset up by Hubbard to make his movies and produce Scientology materials. Int.Base is the church’s international headquarters. On the north side of thehighway, nestled against the dry hills, is Bonnie View, the house that Hubbardhoped one day to live in. Miscavige keeps an office on the property. FewScientologists, and almost no one outside of the church, knew of its existence.The local community was told that the bankrupt property on California Highway 79had been purchased in 1978 by the “Scottish Highland Quietude Club.” Most of theSea Org members on the base had no idea where they were; they had beentransported there overnight from the former base at La Quinta in a deliberatelycircuitous route.Gold Base was the only place deemed secure enough for Brennan to send hisdispatches. Brennan says that in late 1982 he witnessed Miscavige abusing threeScientology executives who had made some small error. The three offenders werelined up before their leader. According to Brennan, he punched the first one inthe mouth. The next he slapped hard in the face. He choked the third executiveso hard that Brennan thought the man would black out. No explanation wasoffered. This came at a time when Hubbard was furious that his legal situationleft him in limbo, and he was upset about the church’s finances. Brennan hadaccess to all the correspondence coming from Hubbard to the Watchdog Committee,and he knew that Hubbard was demanding action. “He wanted a head on a pike,”Brennan said.[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_012_r1.jpg]Gold Base, the Scientology compound in Gilman Hot Springs, California. Itincludes Bonnie View (center rear), awaiting Hubbard’s anticipated return fromother realms; the management building (to its right), which houses DavidMiscavige’s offices; and staff apartments (right front).Brennan says that after the beating, the three executives were held as prisonerson the base.3 They were assigned lowly tasks and Sea Org members spat on themwhenever they passed. Later, one of the three men approached Brennan, in tears,worried about what might happen to him. “He had to have great courage just tospeak to me, because they were not allowed to speak unless spoken to,” Brennanrecalled. “I had Hubbard’s orders in my hand to spit on him. I couldn’t do it.”In December 1982, David Miscavige married Michele “Shelly” Barnett, a slightblonde, twenty-one years old. She had been one of the early Commodore’sMessengers on the Apollo. She was quiet, petite, and younger than most of theother Messengers at the time—about twelve when she joined—and a bit overshadowedby the older girls. “She was a sweet, innocent thing thrown into chaos,” one ofher shipmates recalled.John Brousseau was married to Shelly’s older sister, Clarisse, and one day heproposed that the two couples go fishing. Miscavige had never been. They droveup to Lake Hemet, a glacial lake in the mountains above Gold Base. It was abeautiful spring day, the sun was glinting off the water, a mild breeze wasblowing, the wildflowers were out, and birds were singing. Everyone was dressedin shorts or jeans. They had brought sandwiches and sodas for a picnic.Brousseau baited the poles with salmon eggs, and then showed the others how tocast. He said to just let the line sink to the bottom and then sit back andwait. Maybe a trout would take a bite.Brousseau recalls looking over at Miscavige five minutes later. He was visiblyshaking, his veins were bulging. “You got to be kidding me!” he said. “This isit? You just sit here and fucking wait?”Brousseau said that was the general idea.“I can’t stand it!” Brousseau remembers Miscavige saying. “I feel like jumpingin and grabbing a fish with my fucking hands! Or cramming the hook down theirfucking throats!”That was the end of the fishing trip.After Quentin’s suicide and Mary Sue’s prison sentence, the remainder ofHubbard’s family broke apart. His oldest daughter, Diana, had been Hubbard’smain supporter. She and her husband, Jonathan Horwich, lived at Flag Base in theFort Harrison penthouse in Clearwater, with their daughter, Roanne. As herfather became increasingly remote, Diana decided to try her luck as a singer andsongwriter. She released a soft-jazz album titled LifeTimes in 1979, usingnotable Scientologist musicians, including Chick Corea and Stanley Clarke, asbackup. The cover features her in a black dress, lips parted, arms crossed, herpale shoulders hunched, and her waist-length red hair stirring in the breeze.Although the album received little notice, Diana decided to leave her husband,and the Sea Org, and marry John Ryan, a public Scientologist who had producedher record. She moved to Los Angeles to dedicate herself to music. Horwichagreed to the divorce, but he refused to part with Roanne, who was two years oldat the time. Hubbard strongly supported this decision, but Mary Sue was opposed.She wanted her granddaughter to be nearby, and she began agitating for Diana togain custody.Several missions were sent to bargain with Diana, but she was unmoved. Finally,Jesse Prince got the assignment. “It was a do or die mission,” he recalled. Ifhe didn’t succeed in gaining clear custody of Roanne for Horwich, he would besent back to the RPF. For whatever reason, Diana signed the release he put infront of her. Hubbard was thrilled. He rewarded Prince with a leather coat, agold chain, some cash, and an M14 assault rifle.Suzette, Diana’s younger sister, was increasingly disaffected. Quentin’s deathhad been a blow, but the fact that there had been no ceremony afterward—his namewas essentially erased from family history—left her embittered and wary. Shelonged for the warmth of her Saint Hill childhood, when her mother would read toher and her father would laugh and toss her in the air. Those days were longgone. The forces pulling her family apart were far too powerful for her toresist. She wanted nothing more than to walk away and start a family of her own.But that was not so easily done. She had tried to elope with another Sea Orgmember she had met years before, in Washington. “We had fallen in love andwanted to get married and live together for the rest of our lives,” her suitor,Arnaldo Lerma, later said. He flew to Clearwater; they got blood tests and amarriage license. Suzette then confessed the plan in an auditing session. “Shespilled the beans and I got arrested—well, detained,” Lerma said. “I rememberbeing in a room with a chair and a light bulb and two guys outside the door. Iwas interrogated for several hours. I was not struck, hit, or physically abused.However, what I do remember is the deal I was offered: ‘We will give you aguarantee of safe passage out of the state of Florida with all body partsattached if you tell Suzette Hubbard the marriage is off.’ ” Lerma did as he wastold, leaving the church as well. Later, when Hubbard learned about another manSuzette was interested in, he paid him to leave her alone. She was isolated anddesperately lonely.She did finally get married to a Scientologist named Michael Titmus, in 1980,when she was twenty-five, but her father didn’t trust him either. Titmus wassent to RPF and denounced as an infiltrator. Suzette was told to divorce him,which she did; soon after that, she was transferred to Gold Base to work in theHousehold Unit, cleaning rooms and doing the laundry—for David Miscavige, amongothers.IN 1985, with Hubbard in seclusion, the church faced two of its most difficultcourt challenges. In Los Angeles, a former Sea Org member, Lawrence Wollersheim,sought $25 million for emotional distress caused by “brainwashing” and emotionalabuse. He said he had been forced to disconnect from his family and locked foreighteen hours a day in the hold of a ship docked in Long Beach, California,deprived of sleep, and fed only once a day. After attaining OT III status,Wollersheim said, his “core sense of identity” had been shattered. “At OT III,you find out you’re really thousands of individual beings struggling for controlof your body. Aliens left over from space wars that are giving you cancer ormaking you crazy or making you impotent,” he later recalled. “I went psychoticon OT III. I lost a sense of who I was.”In order to substantiate the charges, Wollersheim’s attorney introducedScientology’s most confidential materials—including the OT III secrets—asevidence. At this point, those materials were still unknown to the generalpublic. The loss of Scientology’s chest of secrets was not just a violation ofthe sanctity of its esoteric doctrines; from the church’s perspective, openexamination of these materials represented a copyright infringement and apotential business catastrophe. Those who were traveling up the Bridge would nowknow their destination. The fog of mystery would be dissipated.The Wollersheim suit had been filed in 1980, but Scientology lawyers had beenfrantically dragging it out with writs and motions. An undercover campaign waslaunched to discredit or blackmail Wollersheim’s lawyer, Charles O’Reilly. Hishouse was bugged and his office was infiltrated by a Scientology operative.There was an attempt to trap him or his bodyguards in a compromising situationwith women. The church also harassed the judge in the case, Ronald Swearinger.“I was followed,” the judge later said. “My car tires were slashed. My colliedrowned in my pool.” A former Scientology executive, Vicki Aznaran, latertestified that there was an effort to compromise the judge by setting up hisson, who they heard was gay, with a minor boy.When the case finally came to trial, the church stacked the courtroom with OTVIIs. “They thought OT VIIs could move mountains,” Tory Christman, a former SeaOrg member, said. Although she was only an OT III at the time, she persuadedchurch officials to let her into the room. The Scientologists directed theirintentions toward the judge and the jury, hoping to influence their decisionstelepathically.On a Friday afternoon, the judge announced that the OT III documents would bemade public at nine a.m. the following Monday, on a first-come, first-servebasis. This was the disaster the church had been dreading. When the courthouseopened that Monday, there were fifteen hundred Scientologists lined up. Theyfilled three hallways of the courthouse, and overwhelmed the clerk’s office withrequests to photocopy the documents in order to keep anyone else from gettingtheir hands on the confidential materials. They kept it up until the judgeissued a restraining order at noon, pending a hearing later in the week. Despitethese efforts, the Los Angeles Times managed to get a copy of the OT IIImaterials and published a summary of them.“A major cause of mankind’s problems began 75 million years ago,” the Timesaccount begins. In a studiously neutral tone, the lengthy article revealsScientology’s occult cosmology. The planet Earth, formerly called Teegeeack, waspart of a confederation of planets under the leadership of a despotic rulernamed Xenu. Although the details were sketchy, the secrets that had stunned PaulHaggis were suddenly public knowledge. The jury awarded Wollersheim $30million.3 Worse than the financial loss was the derision that greeted the churchall over the world and the loss of control of its secret doctrines. The churchhas never recovered from the blow.The other court challenge that year involved Julie Christofferson Titchbourne, ayoung defector who had spent her college savings on Scientology counseling. Sheargued that the church had falsely claimed that Scientology would improve herintelligence, creativity, communication skills, and even her eyesight. For thefirst time, much of Hubbard’s biography came under attack. The litigant saidthat Hubbard had been portrayed as a nuclear physicist and civil engineer. Theevidence showed that he attended George Washington University but nevergraduated. In response to Hubbard’s claim that he had cured himself of hisinjuries in the Second World War, the evidence showed he had never been wounded.Other embarrassing revelations came to light. The church stated that Hubbard waspaid less than the average Scientology staff member—at the time, about fifteendollars a week—but witnesses for the plaintiff testified that in one six-monthperiod in 1982, about $34 million had been transferred from the church intoHubbard’s personal bank from a Liberian corporation.4 One former Scientologistdescribed training sessions in which members were hectored and teased oversensitive issues until they were desensitized and would no longer react. In twosuch instances of “bull-baiting,” Christofferson Titchbourne saw theeight-year-old son of the registrar repeatedly put his hands down the front of awoman student’s dress and a female coach unzipping the pants of a male studentand fondling his genitals. The jury seemed most disturbed by testimony thatmembers of the Guardian’s Office had culled the auditing files of members,looking for salacious material that could be used to blackmail potentialdefectors. Christofferson Titchbourne had originally sought a $30,000 refundfrom the church. The jury awarded her $39 million. At the time, that sum couldhave bankrupted Scientology.That evening, Miscavige and other members of the church hierarchy had a gloomymeeting in a condo in Portland, Oregon. One of the executives vowed thatChristofferson Titchbourne would never collect because he was going to kill her.“I don’t care if I get the chair,” he said. “It’s only one lifetime.” There wasa lengthy silence, and then Miscavige said, “No, here’s what we’re going to do.”And on the spot, he came up with the Portland crusade.As many as 12,000 Scientologists came from all over the world in May and June1985 to protest the judgment in what they called the Battle of Portland. Dayafter day they marched around the Multnomah County courthouse, shouting“Religious freedom now!” and carrying banners reading WE SHALL OVERCOME! ChickCorea flew in from Japan to play a concert, along with other musiciansaffiliated with the church, including Al Jarreau, Stanley Clarke, and EdgarWinter. Stevie Wonder phoned in and sang “I Just Called to Say I Love You” asthe crowd cheered.The most notable presence in Portland was John Travolta. It was a decisivemoment in his relationship with the religion. The church had made enormousefforts to persuade him to attend. Two years before the Portland crusade,Travolta had told Rolling Stone that although he still believed in Scientology,he had not had any auditing for the past year and a half. When asked if he wasbeing exploited by the church to promote its cause, he responded, “I’ve beensomething of an ostrich about how it’s used me, because I haven’t investigatedexactly what the organization’s done. One part of me says that if somebody getssome good out of it, maybe it’s all right. The other part of me says that I hopeit uses some taste and discretion. I wish I could defend Scientology better, butI don’t think it even deserves to be defended, in a sense.”But here he was in Portland, unshaven and exhausted, having flown his own planein at midnight for a two-hour visit. “Once in a while you have to stand up forwhat you believe in, and I’m here tonight, I’ve had counseling, I givecounseling, and I don’t want to lose that,” he declared. “And it’s as simple asthat.”The Portland march was one of the greatest triumphs in Scientology’s history,capped by the judge’s declaration of a mistrial. He ruled that ChristoffersonTitchbourne’s lawyers had presented prejudicial arguments to the jury by sayingthat Hubbard was a sociopath and that Scientology was not a religion but aterrorist organization. Church members who had been in Portland would alwaysfeel an ecstatic sense of kinship. (A year and a half later, the church settledwith Christofferson Titchbourne for an undisclosed sum.)FOR YEARS, Hubbard’s declining health was a secret known to few in the upperlevels of the church. Only a handful of his closest followers were allowed tosee him. He had made no clear arrangements for a successor, nor was there anyopen talk of it. There was an unstated belief that Operating Thetans did notgrow frail or lose their mental faculties. Old age and illness were embarrassingrefutations of Scientology’s core beliefs.Death was a subject that Hubbard rarely addressed, assuring Scientologists thatit was of little importance: “If you had an automobile sitting out here on thestreet and you came out totally expecting to find this automobile there and it’sgone, it’s been stolen and so forth, you’d be upset,” he said in 1957,reflecting on the death of one of his close followers. “Well, that’s just aboutthe frame of mind a thetan is usually in when he finds his body dead.” Thethetan has to report to a “between-lives” area, Hubbard later explained, whichfor most of them is the planet Mars. There the thetan is given a “forgetterimplant.” “The implant is very interesting,” Hubbard later wrote. “The preclearis seated before a wheel which contains numbers of pictures. As the wheel turns,these pictures go away from him.… The whole effect is to give him the impressionthat he has no past life.” The thetan is then sent back to Earth to pick up ababy’s body as soon as it is born. “The baby takes its first gasp, why, a thetanusually picks it up.” Sometimes there is a shortage of new bodies, andoccasionally a thetan will follow a pregnant woman around waiting for the momentof delivery so he can pounce. Contrarily, when a body dies, it’s important forthe thetan to be freed as quickly as possible—preferably by cremating the corpseand scattering the ashes in water, so that nothing clings together. “It’s veryconfused, this whole subject of death,” Hubbard observed. “It’s quite funny, asa matter of fact, the amount of this and that that is paid, the amount offlowers and that sort of thing which are shipped around at dead corpses afterthe thetan has shoved off, and so on. It’s very amusing.” He presented himselfas an expert on the subject, claiming he had been pronounced dead but had comeback to life on two or three occasions.Hubbard suffered a severe stroke on January 16, 1986, at the Creston ranch. Herealized that he was in his final days. He summoned Ray Mithoff, one of his mostsenior Messengers, to help him put his affairs in order and administer a “deathassist.” He didn’t ask to see any of his family members; indeed, one of his lastactions was to sign a will reducing their inheritance, except for a provisionfor Mary Sue, who received $1 million, which may have been a part of theagreement that had kept her from testifying against him. He had previouslydisowned his daughter Alexis, an embarrassing reminder of his bigamous marriageto Sara Northrup. Hubbard was in a nightgown, pacing up and down, saying, “Let’sget this over with! My head is hurting!” He signed the will with a shaky hand.Hubbard also proclaimed Flag Order 3879, “The Sea Org & the Future,” in which hepromoted himself to Admiral and retired the rank of Commodore. He instituted anew rank, that of Loyal Officer, after the stalwart members of the GalacticConfederacy who had imprisoned the tyrannical overlord Xenu. Hubbard appointedonly two persons to serve at that level, Pat and Annie Broeker. They were anattractive couple, his closest advisers; he was clearly passing them thescepter. “I’ll be scouting the way and doing the first port survey missions,”Hubbard promised his followers. “We will meet again later.”On Friday evening, January 24, 1986, Hubbard died in the Blue Bird bus that hadserved as his living quarters for the past three years. Ray Mithoff, PatBroeker, and Hubbard’s personal physician, Eugene Denk, were at his side, alongwith a handful of acolytes and employees. His body had suffered the usualinsults of old age, along with the consequences of obesity and a lifetime ofheavy smoking. Dr. Denk had given him injections of Vistaril, a tranquilizer,usually prescribed for anxiety. Whatever powers Scientology was supposed tobestow were no more evident in the death of its founder than they had been inhis life.Late that night, a handful of senior executives and a couple of privateinvestigators drove to a restaurant in Paso Robles, where they were met by PatBroeker, who guided them to the Creston ranch. The site was so secret that noneof the executives, including Miscavige, had ever actually been there. Theyarrived around four in the morning. Earle Cooley, a church attorney, took chargeof the body. At seven thirty that morning, about twelve hours after Hubbard’sdeath, the mortuary in San Luis Obispo was notified. Cooley demanded animmediate cremation, but when the owner of the mortuary saw the name on thedeath certificate, she called the coroner. After learning that Hubbard hadsigned a new will the day before his death, the coroner ordered an autopsy, butCooley was able to produce a document signed by Hubbard stating that an autopsywould violate his religious beliefs. The lawyer did permit the coroner to take ablood sample and fingerprints to verify that the corpse was actually Hubbard.Many questions would be asked, since Hubbard hadn’t been seen in public fornearly six years.There was another problem that had to be dealt with quickly: how to explainHubbard’s death to Scientologists. Broeker and Miscavige came up with a plan:Hubbard didn’t die, he had intentionally “dropped his body” in order to move onto a higher level of existence.Miscavige told one of the other executives he didn’t want to see “any griefbullshit.” Sinar Parman, Hubbard’s former chef, arrived that morning, to helpwith cooking and logistics. He found Annie Broeker sitting on the floor of thecabin, with Miscavige’s wife, Shelly. Annie had obviously been crying.Meanwhile, he noticed Miscavige and Broeker in another room. “They were joking,”he recalled. “They were ecstatic. They’d never been so happy.”That Sunday, Hubbard’s ashes were scattered in the Pacific.The next day, more than two thousand Scientologists gathered in the HollywoodPalladium for a special announcement. The news had been kept quiet until then.Miscavige stepped onto the stage. He was twenty-five years old, wearing hisdouble-breasted Sea Org uniform with a black tie and a gold lanyard over hisright shoulder. For most Scientologists, this was their first introduction tothe man who would dominate the religion in the decades after the founder’sdeath. Short and trim, with brown hair and sharp features, Miscavige announcedto the assembled Scientologists that for the past six years of exile, Hubbardhad been investigating new, higher OT levels. “He has now moved on to the nextlevel,” Miscavige said. “It’s beyond anything any of us has imagined. This levelis, in fact, done in an exterior state. Meaning that it is done completelyexterior from the body.” Someone in the audience whistled in amazement. “At thislevel of OT, the body is nothing more than an impediment, an encumbrance to anyfurther gain as an OT.” The audience began to stir as the realization began tosink in. “Thus—,” Miscavige said, then paused and adjusted the microphone.“Thus, at two thousand hours, Friday, the twenty-fourth of January, A.D. 36[that is, thirty-six years after the publication of Dianetics], L. Ron Hubbarddiscarded the body he had used in this lifetime for seventy-four years, tenmonths, and eleven days.” Miscavige turned to a large photograph of CommodoreHubbard with the waves behind him and began to applaud. “Hip, hip, hooray!” hecried, as the audience echoed him. “Hip, hip, hooray!”MISSIONAIRES HAD BEEN SENT to Scientology centers all over the world tocoordinate the announcement of Hubbard’s death. Afterward, they flew back to LosAngeles and met at the Liberace mansion in West Hollywood, near the churchheadquarters. Most executives in the church naturally assumed that theleadership had already passed to Pat and Annie Broeker, who were the LoyalOfficers, the highest post available. That seemed to be as clear a statement ofthe line of succession as anyone would ever find. Miscavige was not mentioned inthe founder’s final declaration.Jesse Prince was at the gathering, having just returned from delivering the newsto Scientologists in Italy. After his lengthy indoctrination in RPF, Prince hadbecome a trusted member of the Sea Org inner circle. He and Miscavige werefriendly. Prince could tell that he was upset when Miscavige confided thatsomething would have to be done about Pat Broeker. During the memorial serviceat the Hollywood Palladium, Broeker had told the assembled Scientologists thatHubbard had made significant breakthroughs in his research. At that point, thehighest level possible on the Bridge to Total Freedom was OT VII (OT VIII wouldnot be introduced for another two years). Broeker surprised everyone by sayingthat before Hubbard dropped his body, he had completed the OT IX and OT Xlevels. Broeker even held up a handwritten page that he represented as beingfrom OT X. It was a very long string of numbers, which he said was a date. Itwas so far back in time he couldn’t denominate it, except to say it was “twelvedown and fifteen across,” about 180 numerals altogether. “I wanted to show thesignificance, the magnitude of what he’s done,” Broeker had said. The audiencehad tittered in amazement. The little teaser about the OT X materials reinforcedBroeker’s standing as the new leader of the church. Only he knew what lay ahead.Every new religion faces an existential crisis following the death of itscharismatic founder. Through his missionary work, Paul the Apostle keptChristianity alive after the crucifixion of Jesus. Brigham Young rescued theChurch of Latter Day Saints following the murder of Joseph Smith by leading theMormon exodus across the Great Plains into Utah. Religious geniuses arise allthe time, but the historical test falls upon the successor, whose fate is to beforever overshadowed by the founder. Miscavige knew his own talents andlimitations. He didn’t pretend to be a prophet, nor was he skilled in publicrelations. “People think I’m trying to be the leader,” he confided to hisbrother-in-law, John Brousseau. “That’s not my job. I’m the whip.” Otherpossible successors had been purged or had fled the organization, however,leaving only the Broekers as rivals. Neither of them was a match for Miscavige.He angrily told Prince that Pat had made a fool of himself at the Palladium.Prince was surprised. Until that night in the Liberace mansion, he had beenconvinced that Miscavige had no interest in leading the church; now he realizedthat Miscavige felt compelled to remove the Broekers in order to keepScientology from being destroyed. Whatever reservations Miscavige had had aboutseizing power had fallen away.Over the past six years, Pat Broeker and David Miscavige had forged a powerfulalliance. Broeker had been on one side of the gate, controlling all access toHubbard; Miscavige had been on the other, acting as the conduit for the church.Broeker deliberately stayed in the shadows, setting up elaborate drops for themessages that had passed to and from Hubbard’s hideaway, sometimes adoptingdisguises and carrying an Uzi machine gun when he left the ranch. He fanciedhimself a crafty undercover operative. The consequence of his secrecy, however,was that even Scientology insiders knew little about him.[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_013_r1.jpg]David Miscavige speaking at the inauguration of the Church of Scientology inMadrid, 2004Miscavige was also well schooled in intrigue. Although he was still quite ayoung man, he had been running operations for Hubbard for several years, withbrutal efficiency. In order to eliminate Hubbard’s designated successors,however, Miscavige needed a lieutenant with similar qualities of remorselessnessand total commitment.MARK RATHBUN CAME FROM a distinguished but deeply troubled family. His fatherwas a graduate of the US Naval Academy. His artistic mother was the daughter ofHaddon Sundblom, the illustrator who created some of the most enduring images inAmerican commercial history—Aunt Jemima, the Quaker Oats man, and the famousSanta Claus drinking a Coca-Cola beside the Christmas tree. The Rathbun familylived in Marin County, a Bohemian enclave just north of San Francisco. When Markwas a young child, his mother had a series of nervous breakdowns. On five or sixoccasions she received what was the standard treatment of the day, electroshocktherapy. In September 1962, when Mark was five, his mother’s body was foundfloating in San Francisco Bay. Her car was parked on the Golden Gate Bridge.Mark turned into a restless young man. He went to college to study creativewriting but dropped out in order to experience the real world. In 1976 he wasliving in a camp of migrant workers, hoping to become the next Jack London, whenhe learned that his brother Bruce had become catatonic and had been committed toa state hospital in Oregon.Mark hitchhiked to Portland to oversee Bruce’s care. He carried around abackpack full of books on Buddhism and the works of Jiddu Krishnamurti. Althoughit is easy to see in hindsight that the nineteen-year-old Mark Rathbun wasprimed, because of his troubled background and questing philosophy, to become apart of the Church of Scientology, it wasn’t clear to him at the time. Hiscurrent spiritual mentor, Krishnamurti, preached against the idea of messiahs,but he also stated that every individual has the responsibility for discoveringthe causes of his own limitations in order to attain universal spiritual andpsychological freedom. That resonated with Hubbard’s aim of “clearing theplanet.”Psychotherapy had evolved somewhat from the indignities that had been inflictedon their mother; it had moved into pharmacology. But drugs didn’t seem to offera solution to Bruce’s problems; in Mark’s opinion, his brother was just beingwarehoused, held in a chemical straitjacket. Rathbun got a job as a short-ordercook at Dave’s Deli, and each day, when he went to the bus stop in downtownPortland on his way to the hospital, he would pass the Scientology mission onSalmon Street. He would banter with the Scientology recruiters and soon got toknow them by name. One day, he told a recruiter, “I’ve got ten minutes. Whydon’t you give me your best shot?” The Scientologist started pitching theHubbard communications course, which at the time cost fifty dollars. Itimmediately appealed to Rathbun. “The problem is, I’ve only got twenty-fivebucks to my entire name,” he said. The recruiter let him take the course, andthrew in a copy of Dianetics as well.In that first course, Rathbun went exterior. It was completely real to him. Allthe Eastern philosophy he had absorbed had been leading to this moment. Hefinally realized that he was separate from his body. Hadn’t this been the pointof the Buddha’s teachings—to isolate the spirit and end the repetitive cycle oflife and death? From that moment on, Rathbun never looked back. He wastransformed.Another recruiter persuaded Rathbun that he would be better able to deal withhis brother’s problems if he had more training, which he could afford if hejoined the Sea Org. Rathbun signed the billion-year contract in January 1978.5A few months later, Rathbun was sent to work in LA. One night, he was assignedto escort Diane Colletto, the twenty-five-year-old editor of Scientology’sAuditor magazine, from the publications building to the Scientology complex inHollywood where they both lived. It was late at night on August 19, 1978. Dianewas a petite and mousy intellectual, with thick glasses. A diligent worker, shewas often the last to leave the office. On this night, she was frightened.Diane’s husband, John Colletto, a highly trained auditor, had recently beendeclared a Suppressive Person. John had gotten into an argument with churchofficials over a matter of policy. After being declared, he went to visit aScientology chaplain, who could see that he was having a breakdown. He keptcrying and grabbing his head in despair. At that point, he was forcibly detainedin the RPF. He spent several weeks there, but managed to escape. Diane wasordered to disconnect from him. She told the chaplain that John had threatenedher, saying that if he couldn’t have Scientology, then neither could she.Rathbun—a big man, a former college basketball player—knew nothing of this as herode back to the berthing with Diane in her Fiat. She was uncommunicative. Shedrove north on Rampart Boulevard, where the Pubs Org was located, to Sunset, andthen left on Santa Monica Boulevard. It was mid-August, but there was a breezefrom the ocean and the night air was unseasonably cool. As soon as Diane turnedthe corner from North Edgemont Street onto Fountain Avenue, in front of theScientology complex, a pair of headlights on high beam blinded them, then a carrammed into them, pinning Diane’s vehicle against the curb.Rathbun was in shock, but he managed to get out of the passenger side of thecar. They had come to a stop in front of a small house with a picket fence. Hesaw the man in the other car get out and run toward Diane, who was still in thedriver’s seat. Rathbun came around the front of the car, just in time to hear apopping noise and the sound of glass shattering. It was the first time in hislife he had ever heard a gunshot. Jesse Prince, who was in RPF on the seventhfloor, heard the sound and rushed to the windows. People were shouting, “JohnColletto!” Everyone knew immediately what was happening.Rathbun grabbed Colletto, and they spun around in the street. He got Colletto ina headlock, but Colletto pistol-whipped him and Rathbun momentarily lostconsciousness. Both of them tumbled to the ground.When Rathbun recovered, he saw Diane on all fours, crawling on the sidewalk, andColletto running toward her with the gun. Rathbun says he got up and tackledJohn. They crashed through the picket fence and wrestled on the lawn. More shotswere fired. At one point, according to Rathbun, the barrel of the revolver waspressed against the nape of his neck and Colletto pulled the trigger. The gundidn’t fire, but Rathbun went exterior, viewing the scene from twelve feet abovehis body.Colletto broke free and caught up to his wife. He stuck the gun in her ear.Rathbun says he saw what was happening and did a “flying sidekick,” but at thatfatal moment the gun fired.Colletto was knocked to the ground by Rathbun’s blow and the gun skitteredacross the pavement. Rathbun picked it up and tried to fire it at Colletto, butthe chambers were all empty. Colletto got in his car and screeched away.Rathbun went back to Diane. Blood was gurgling and spewing from her mouth. Hethought she was drowning in her own blood. Rathbun took off his shirt and put itunder her head. As he heard the sirens screaming, she died in his arms.6Three days later, John Colletto’s decomposing body was found. He had slashed hiswrists and bled to death on the shoulder of the Ventura Freeway.Because of this incident, Rathbun was singled out for his fearlessness, or whatScientology terms his “high level of confront.” Soon after that, he was sent toLa Quinta, Hubbard’s winter headquarters, where the old man was just thenbuilding up his moviemaking enterprise. Miscavige had appointed Rathbun head ofwhat was known as the “All Clear” unit. The object was to resolve the dozens oflawsuits around the country that had named Hubbard as a defendant. He was alsothe target of grand juries in Tampa, New York, and Washington, DC. Hubbardwanted to be able to return to his moviemaking full-time, but he was afraid toshow himself until he was assured that he wouldn’t be hauled into court. (Hedied before that happened.)Like many Sea Org members on the secret base, Rathbun adopted an alias forsecurity reasons, one that was similar to his real name but that separated himfrom his previous identity; it also made it more difficult for anyone to findhim. Mark became Marty.AS THE NEW CHURCH LEADER, Pat Broeker quickly sought to exert his influence. Hehad a special uniform made up for himself, with solid gold epaulettes, and a“Loyal Officer” flag that was to be flown wherever he was in residence. Heannounced that he was going to issue a new “Grade Chart” on Sea Org Day inClearwater. He justified the alteration of Hubbard’s sacred material with hisown divinations because he claimed to be in telepathic communication with thefounder. His Sea Org Day speech was stymied, however, when he was told thatchurch authorities expected that a government raid would take place if he showedhimself in public. That wasn’t true, but it wasn’t out of the question. Forseveral years, the leaders of the church, including Hubbard, Miscavige, andBroeker, had been targets of an IRS criminal investigation. Church lawyerspersuaded Broeker that while the investigation was still ongoing he shouldconfine himself to another ranch near Creston that Hubbard had purchased.Broeker was content with that arrangement. He seemed more at home with thequarter horses that he so lovingly purchased with the church’s money than he didwith the bureaucrats in the church hierarchy. He continued shopping forexemplary breeding stock even after Hubbard’s death, claiming he was carryingout the founder’s vision. He seemed to think he could run the church from thesidelines.Other than Hubbard’s imprimatur, Broeker had few assets on his side. He had theunfortunate combination of being garrulous without being articulate. Many of theexecutives he had been close to had been forced out of the church or had fled.Even people who didn’t like him, however, were fond of Annie. She was in manyways her husband’s opposite. She was measured where he was goofy and impetuous.Sweet and shy, with a fragile beauty that some compared to the actress JessicaLange, Annie had been born into Scientology and was one of the few originalMessengers who hadn’t been purged. In 1982, Hubbard had made her InspectorGeneral of the Religious Technology Center, the highest post in the churchbureaucracy, in charge of protecting the sanctity of Scientology’s spiritualtechnology. It was a job she was ill suited for, by nature and also bycircumstance, as she was not an auditor, and for years she had been living atthe remote ranch as Hubbard’s caretaker, away from the administration of churchaffairs. In March 1987, Miscavige seized control of the RTC, making himself theChairman of the Board. He downgraded the Inspector General’s post by dividing itinto three parts. His new lieutenant and henchman, Marty Rathbun, became the IGfor Ethics.Still, both Pat and Annie remained untouchable because of Hubbard’s finaldecree. And, most tantalizingly, only Pat seemed to know where the new OTlevels—which he now claimed went all the way up to XV—were hidden. They were hisinsurance. Nothing could be more precious in the world of Scientology—to itsmembers, who sought to gain Hubbard’s final revelations on the Bridge to TotalFreedom, and to the organization, which profited from that journey.At Miscavige’s direction, Rathbun hired a team of private investigators tofollow Broeker and dig into his private life. One of them was a former cop whomet Broeker at a gun show, then began frequenting Broeker’s favorite tavern. Hewould chat him up whenever he came in. They got to be so friendly that atChristmas the ex-cop gave Broeker a cordless phone. Because such phones emit aweak radio signal, Rathbun’s minions were able to record Broeker’s calls. Thedetectives followed him everywhere, but there was no clue as to where the secretOT levels might be hidden.Miscavige still worried that Broeker was holding vital material back. A fewmonths later, he and church attorneys went to the ranch to persuade the Broekersto hand over whatever confidential materials they might have to the church forsafekeeping. While this was going on, a gang of a dozen powerful men assembledby Rathbun surrounded the ranch quarters and hid in the bushes.Inside the ranch house, Miscavige and the lawyers argued that Scientology wouldnever get its tax exemption if the church did not have in its possession itsmost important documents. Miscavige also threatened Broeker with the prospect ofcriminal prosecution. Rathbun had discovered that there was $1.8 million ofHubbard’s funds that Broeker couldn’t account for. Broeker appeared to cave in.He let Rathbun load the file cabinets in the ranch house into a truck. HadBroeker not agreed, Rathbun was prepared to signal his goon squad to storm theplace and seize everything. It took months to sort through the voluminous files,only to find that there was really nothing there—certainly, nothing thatresembled new OT levels.In November 1987, the IRS notified the church that its criminal investigationhad concluded. No charges were filed, but that also reduced the leverageMiscavige had over Broeker. A few months later, Miscavige decided that a finaloperation to retrieve the missing OT levels was in order. This time there wouldbe no subterfuge, no subtle argument. Rathbun brought along a team of armedprivate investigators and off-duty LA cops as muscle, along with several otherchurch executives. One of them found fifty thousand dollars stashed under thekitchen sink.Miscavige concentrated his attention on Annie. He took her to a separate roomand interrogated her as a detective barred the door, preventing her husband fromseeing her. Eventually, Annie admitted that Pat kept a storage locker in nearbyPaso Robles, and she coughed up the key. Rathbun’s team found more files, butnot what they wanted. Rathbun eventually came to the conclusion that there wereno further OT levels—no OT IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV—it was all a bluff onBroeker’s part, a lie that the church would have to live with, since the levelshad been so publicly announced.7In April 1988, Miscavige formally canceled Hubbard’s final directive, Flag Order3879, that had named the Broekers Loyal Officers. Miscavige declared that PatBroeker had fabricated the order, although he produced no evidence tosubstantiate his charge. Broeker’s last claim to the legacy of L. Ron Hubbardwas destroyed. He fled the country, followed by two private detectives, PaulMarrick and Greg Arnold, who claim that they tailed Broeker for the nexttwenty-four years, even to foreign countries. They say they were supervisedpersonally by David Miscavige and paid from church funds. “He lived a veryquiet, normal life, and everybody around him loves him,” Marrick later said ofBroeker. “So that’s his whole story from our perspective.”The same day that Miscavige canceled Hubbard’s order, Annie showed up in aremote re-education camp, in the Soboba Indian Reservation in SouthernCalifornia, that Scientologists called Happy Valley. It had once belonged to anorder of nuns, who left a sign on the gate that said VALLEY OF THE SINGINGHEART. An armed guard stood watch. Dogs were trained to track down anyone whotried to leave.Miscavige was now in complete control.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Miscavige has been circumspect about what missions he actually performed inhis capacity as Action Chief. He once testified: “What is a mission? Okay. Well,you have a situation and a situation is defined as a departure, major departurefrom the ideal scene, and at the bottom of that there’s some Y. Y is defined asan explanation that opens a door to a handling. And if you have actually pulledthe strings on the situation all the way down, you will now have a Y, whichmeans that the situation can be resolved. A mission would take a situation,knowing what the Y is, and therefore knowing what exact handling steps are thuspossible as a result of the door being opened because the Y was found byevaluation, and they would … operate on what is known as a set of missionorders, and the set of mission orders is an exact series of steps, sometimesconsecutive, sometimes not, sometimes they can be done concurrently within eachother.… These mission orders have an exact purpose to be accomplished, exactmajor targets, exact primary targets, exact vital targets, exact operatingtargets; they have listed the means of mission communication, and they have alsolisted the target date for completion.” He did not clarify the situationfurther. (David Miscavige testimony, Bent Corydon v. Church of Scientology, July1990.)2 The church categorically denies all charges of Miscavige’s abuse.3 In 1989, an appellate court reduced the judgment to $2.5 million, which thechurch finally paid in 2002, plus interest, which brought the sum to $8.6million.4 The church claims that Hubbard’s income was generated by his book sales.5 Rathbun was never able to apply those advanced techniques on his brother. In1981, two boys walking their dogs near a vacant lot in Garden Grove, California,discovered Bruce Rathbun’s body buried under a pile of debris. The cause ofdeath was never determined and the case was never resolved(www.ci.garden-grove.ca.us/?q=police/Unsolved/1981/Rathbun[http://www.ci.garden-grove.ca.us/?q=police/Unsolved/1981/Rathbun]).6 The police report confirms Rathbun’s story. “A suspect, tentatively I.D.’d asher husband, fired one shot through the driver’s side of the auto,” the reportstates. “He then forced her vehicle to stop, got out, and became involved in afight with her male companion, during which time he was firing the weapon, a .22caliber (short), 8-shot revolver.… The male companion was able to wrest therevolver from the suspect, at which point the husband fled.” The companion wasidentified as Mark Rathbun. The empty gun was found at the scene (Michael A.Shepherd, County of Los Angeles Case Report, Aug. 19, 1978).7 None of the promised levels has ever been released."},{"pageContent":"6[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_L02_r1.jpg]IN SERVICE TO THE STARSIn 1986, the same year that L. Ron Hubbard died, Paul Haggis appeared on thecover of the church’s Celebrity magazine, marking his entry into the pantheon ofthe Scientology elite. The photo shows Haggis sitting in a director’s chair,holding a coffee cup. He’s clean-shaven, with glasses, wearing a herringbonejacket with a pocket square in the breast pocket and pleated linen slacks,looking like a nerdy Hollywood executive with a lot of money to spend onclothes. The article took note of his rising influence in Hollywood. He hadbroken free of the cartoon ghetto after selling a script to The Love Boat, thenascended through the ranks of network television, writing movies of the week andchildren’s shows before settling into sitcoms. He worked on Diff’rent Strokes,Who’s the Boss? and One Day at a Time. He was now the executive producer of TheFacts of Life, a top-rated Saturday night staple. Celebrity noted, “He is one ofthe few writers in Hollywood who has major credits in all genres: comedy,suspense, human drama, animation.”In the article, Haggis said of Scientology, “What excited me about thetechnology was that you could actually handle life, and your problems, and nothave them handle you.” He added, “I also liked the motto, ‘Scientology makes theable more able.’ ” He credited the church for improving his relationship withhis wife, Diane. “Instead of fighting (we did a lot of that before Scientologyphilosophy) we now talk things out, listen to each other and apply Scientologytechnology to our problems.”Haggis told the magazine that he had recently gone through the PurificationRundown, a program intended to eliminate body toxins that form a “biochemicalbarrier to spiritual well-being.” For an average of three weeks, participantsundergo a lengthy daily regimen, spending up to eight hours a day in a sauna,interspersed with exercise, and taking massive doses of vitamins, especiallyniacin. In large amounts, niacin can cause liver damage, but it will alsostimulate the skin to flush and create a tingling sensation. The church saysthat this is evidence of drugs and other toxins being purged from the body.Although many in the medical profession have been hostile to the PurificationRundown, citing it as a fraud and a scam, Hubbard thought he deserved a NobelPrize for it.In the Celebrity interview, Haggis admitted that he had been skeptical of theprocedure before going through it—“My idea of doing good for my body was smokinglow-tar cigarettes”—but the Purification Rundown, he said, “was WONDERFUL. Ireally did feel more alert and more aware and more at ease—I wasn’t running insix directions to get something done, or bouncing off the walls when somethingwent wrong.” He mentioned the drugs that he had taken when he was young.“Getting rid of all those residual toxins and medicines and drugs really had aneffect,” he said. “After completing the rundown I drank a diet cola and suddenlycould really taste it: every single chemical!” He had recommended the Rundown toothers, including his mother, when she was seriously ill, and had persuaded ayoung writer on his staff to take the course in order to wean herself fromvarious medications. “She could tell Scientology worked by the example I set,”Haggis told the magazine. “That made me feel very good.”The Purification Rundown is a fundamental feature of Scientology’s drugrehabilitation program, Narconon, which operates nearly two hundred residentialcenters around the world. Celebrity Scientologists conspicuously promoteNarconon, citing the church’s claims that Narconon is “the most effectiverehabilitation program there is.” Kirstie Alley, who served as the nationalspokesperson for Narconon for a number of years, describes herself as “the heartand soul of the project,” because it had helped break her dependency on cocaine.A year after 9/11, Tom Cruise set up a program for over a thousand rescueworkers in New York to go through a similar procedure, which was paid for inpart by using city money. Many participants reported positive results, sayingthat they had sweated a kind of black paste through their pores while in thesauna. The Borough of Manhattan gratefully declared March 13 (Hubbard’sbirthday), 2004, as “Hubbard Detoxification Day.”Kelly Preston has promoted Narconon in her native Hawaii. “Starting in theschools, we’ve delivered to over ten thousand different kids,” she said. Prestonand Travolta’s sixteen-year-old son, Jett, who was autistic, died of a seizurein January 2009. His parents had taken him off of Depakote, an anti-seizuremedication, saying it was ineffective. (The church claims that it does notoppose the use of such drugs when prescribed by a doctor; however, Hubbardhimself denounced the use of anti-seizure medications.) Previously, Prestonasserted on the Montel Williams Show that Jett suffered from Kawasaki syndrome,a rare disorder that she thought was brought on by his exposure to pesticidesand household chemicals.“With Jett, you started him on a program that I think is talked about in thisbook by L. Ron Hubbard,” Williams said, holding up Clear Body, Clear Mind, whichoutlines the principles of the Purification Rundown.“Exactly,” Preston replied.1 She then talked about her own profound experienceon the program. Novocaine from previous dental work began to surface. “I had myentire mouth get numb again for an hour and a half,” she said. Other drugs werepurged as well, along with radiation exposure from the sun. “I had a bathingsuit when I was seven years old—this is completely true. I had a bathing suitthat I thought was so cool with holes in the side and a hole in the center,” shesaid. “And I got a sunburn in it. And twenty years later, I had this samesunburn come out in my skin, the entire sunburn.” Preston brought copies ofHubbard’s book for the entire studio audience.DESPITE HIS EXUBERANT TESTIMONIAL, Haggis was increasingly troubled by thecontradictions in the church. Scientology had begun to seem like two differentthings: a systematic approach to self-knowledge, which he found useful andinsightful; and a religion that he simply couldn’t grasp. He liked and admiredhis auditor, and the confessions were helpful, and he continued to advance onthe Bridge, even after his unsettling encounter with OT III. He saw so manyintelligent people on the path, and he always expected that his concerns wouldbe addressed at the next level. They never were. After OT III, it was all“intergalactic spirituality,” in his opinion. On the other hand, he had alreadypaid for the complete package, so why not continue and see what happened? “Maybethere is something, and I’m missing it,” he told himself.When Haggis reached OT VII, which was the peak at the time, he still feltconfused and unsatisfied. At the top of the OT pyramid, the thetan was promisedthe ability to control “thought, life, form, matter, energy, space and time,subjective and objective.” The final exercise (according to documents obtainedby WikiLeaks—Haggis refused to talk about it) was “Go out to a park, trainstation or other busy area. Practice placing an intention into individuals untilyou can successfully and easily place an intention into or on a Being and/or abody.” But even if you could do that, how would you know if you succeeded? Ifyou were transmitting the intention “Scratch your head” and a person did so, washe responding to your psychic order or was it simply coincidental? It wasdifficult to evaluate.Haggis thought that Hubbard was such a brilliant intellect that the failure tograsp these concepts and abilities must be his alone. He finally confided to acounselor at the Celebrity Centre that he didn’t think he was a very goodScientologist because he couldn’t bring himself to believe. He said he felt likea fraud and thought he might have to leave the church. She told him, “There areall sorts of Scientologists,” just as there are many varieties of Jews andChristians with varying levels of belief. The implication was that Haggis couldbelieve whatever he wanted, to “pick and choose,” as he says.Haggis’s career was going so well that in 1987 he was approached by Ed Zwick andMarshall Herskovitz to write for a new television series called thirtysomething.They were looking for distinctive voices. “I love the fact that you guys aredoing a show that’s about emotions,” Haggis told them. “I hate writing aboutemotions. And I don’t like to talk about my own.” But he seemed to be lookingfor a chance to push himself creatively. With his first script, Zwick andHerskovitz told him, “This is really good, but where does it come from?” Haggisdidn’t know what they meant. “Where does it come from—within you?” theyexplained. The thought that his own experience mattered was a revelation.Zwick and Herskovitz sensed that Haggis wasn’t happy on the show; in any case,he got a lucrative offer to create his own series and left after the firstseason. But he had won two Emmys, for writing and producing, and the experiencetransformed him as a writer. From working with Zwick and Herskovitz, Haggisbecame interested in directing. He finally got the chance to do a brief ad forthe church about Dianetics. He decided against the usual portrayal ofScientology as a triumphal march toward enlightenment, choosing instead to shoota group of people talking about practical ways they had used Dianetics in theirlives. It was casual and naturalistic. Church authorities hated it. They toldhim it looked like a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous.Then, out of the blue, Haggis got a huge break. He did a favor for a friend whowanted to create a new series that would star Chuck Norris, whose career as anaction-movie hero had gone into decline. Haggis wrote the pilot for Walker,Texas Ranger, which ran for eight seasons and was broadcast in a hundredcountries. Haggis was credited as a co-creator. “It was the most successfulthing I ever did,” he said. “Two weeks of work. And they never even used myscript.”With his growing accomplishments and wealth, Haggis became a bigger prize forthe church. He agreed to teach a workshop on television writing while he wasstill the executive producer of Facts of Life, and that brought a number ofaspiring scriptwriters into the Celebrity Centre. Then, in 1988, Scientologysponsored a Dianetics car in the Indianapolis 500, and Paul and Diane wereinvited to attend. Executives from the major book chains were attracted to theScientology reception by the presence of stars, including Kirstie Alley and JohnTravolta, and also by the fact that Hubbard’s books have traditionally soldextraordinarily well. B. Dalton ordered 65,000 copies of Dianetics andWaldenbooks asked for 100,000. Dianetics went back on the New York Timespaperback best-seller list for advice books, thirty-eight years after it wasoriginally published.David Miscavige was at the race. It was one of the few times he and Haggis evermet. The organizer of the event, Bill Dendiu, recalled that Miscavige was notpleased that Haggis had been invited. Dendiu defended his decision becauseHaggis was now a bona fide celebrity. “He has had a string of hit TV shows andby my estimation is a very devoted member of the church,” he told Miscavige.Paul and Diane met Miscavige and other top-level members of the church fordinner. “Paul takes no shit from anybody,” Dendiu recalled. “The fact that hedid not suck up to Miscavige—and in fact, had a couple of little zingers orone-liners for him while we were at the dinner—that got me some additionalbrowbeating.” He added: “You have to understand that no one challenges DavidMiscavige.”The Dianetics car crashed in the first lap. Paul and Diane flew home inTravolta’s plane, with Travolta himself at the controls.SUZETTE HUBBARD BLEW in February 1988.Five years earlier she had met Guy White, a Sea Org marketing executive, on theRPF running program, which at the time was in Griffith Park in Los Angeles—aboutfifty people running all day long, even after dinner, stuffing themselves onbread and honey to keep themselves going. Suzette was warned by an auditor thatGuy was gay. In fact, Guy didn’t know if he was gay or not. When he joined thestaff, he had to respond to a questionnaire that asked, “Have you ever beeninvolved in prostitution, homosexuality, illegal sex or perversion? Give who,when, where, what in each instance.” He had never actually had a homosexualrelationship and had been celibate for a decade; moreover, it was generallyassumed that homosexuality was a false identity, a “valence,” in Hubbard’slanguage, and that such longings would disappear when he got to OT III.Suzette and Guy married in March 1986, three months after her father died. Theirson, Tyson, was born nine months and a day later. It was strange having a childon Gold Base. Suzette had been pregnant when the order was issued banning SeaOrg members from having children,2 and the only other child around was Roanne,Diana Hubbard’s daughter. Other Sea Org members looked upon the childrenlongingly. “People could see what they could never have,” Guy White said. Thefact that Tyson had been born so soon after Hubbard’s death, and that he hadshockingly red hair, stirred speculation that he might be a reincarnation of thefounder. “Is he? Is he?” they asked themselves.Every church or mission maintains an office for the day Hubbard returns. A penand a yellow legal pad await him at each of his desks. His personal bathroomshave toothbrushes and identical sets of Thom McAn sandals beside the shower. OnGold Base, his modest original house was razed and replaced with a $10 millionmansion. A full-time staff attends the empty residence, regularly laundering thefounder’s clothes and keeping the house ready for his white-glove inspection.His vehicles are still in the garage, gassed up, with the keys in the ignition.On his nightstand is a Louis L’Amour novel, with a bookmark placed midwaythrough. The dining table is set for one.The search for Hubbard’s reincarnated being resembles the quest for the newDalai Lama in Tibetan Buddhism, although there are few clues about his identity.He had prophesied that he would be out of action “for the next 20–25 years.” Insome versions of the story, Hubbard will be recognized by his red hair, which iswhy Tyson’s birth aroused such expectations.Suzette was terrified that Tyson would be taken away from her. She had littletime with him as it was. There was a Sea Org policy, written by her father,which mandated an hour a day of “family time,” but that had been canceled. NowSuzette was pregnant again. Over a period of days she smuggled toys and clothesvia a laundry basket into her little Mazda; then one night she left a farewellnote for Guy, grabbed Tyson, and drove to San Diego. A few days later, she movedin with Mary Sue. Mary Sue was living in a house in the Los Feliz neighborhoodof Los Angeles that the church provided when she got out of prison. Amid all theanxiety, Suzette had a miscarriage.After Suzette blew, Guy recalls being sent to Happy Valley and being told hewould have to divorce his wife. Jonathan Horwich, Roanne’s father, was also inHappy Valley, along with Arthur Hubbard, Ron and Mary Sue’s youngest child. Onenight, while Horwich was supposed to be standing guard, Arthur blew and wasnever recovered.In October 1988, Guy also decided to escape. Each evening, he went for a strollalong the fence line, a little farther each time, carrying a snack for theGerman shepherd guard dogs. One night, he jumped the fence, but the dogsbetrayed him and began barking. He had to dive off the road when he saw thelights of the blow team coming after him. For hours, he stumbled through thebrush, bleeding, his clothes torn, until he made it to Hemet, where he poundedon the door of a bowling alley. In broken Spanish, he told the person who peekedout that he had been in a car wreck.Guy finally rejoined Suzette. (They had two other children before he came out toher as gay. They divorced in 1998.)LIKE PAUL HAGGIS, Tom Cruise had been raised Catholic, although he was morereligiously inclined than Paul. His family moved frequently, and he spent partof his childhood in Canada, where he had the reputation of being a headstrong,troublesome, charismatic, and charming boy. His schoolwork suffered because ofdyslexia, and he later said that when he graduated from high school he was “afunctional illiterate.” However, he excelled in sports and drama. His family,like the Haggis family, threw themselves into theater, founding an amateurtroupe of players in Ottawa. His antisocial, bullying father was a disruptiveforce in the family, and early one morning, when Cruise was twelve, his motherpacked up her three daughters and her precocious son and fled back to America.“We felt like fugitives,” Cruise later recalled.Spiritual questing and a tendency toward piety were already features of Cruise’spersonality. He spent a year in seminary in Cincinnati, with a view towardjoining the priesthood. But there was another, intensely ambitious side that wasfocused entirely on stardom. He went to Hollywood when he was eighteen, andmanaged to get a role in Endless Love, a movie starring Brooke Shields. He was anatural actor, but also persistent and choosy, quickly finding his way intomemorable roles. The longing to express his spiritual side had never gone away,but it was difficult, in Hollywood, to know exactly how to fit that in.There was one church that was especially designed to resolve this dilemma.Cruise’s first wife, the actress Mimi Rogers, introduced him to Scientology in1986. He had just finished filming Top Gun, which had made him the world’sbiggest movie star. He had little incentive to publicly declare himself aScientologist after the widespread opprobrium directed at Scientology followingthe FBI raids on Operation Snow White and the exposure of the church’s esotericbeliefs. Rumors of his involvement began to mount, however. For several years hemanaged to keep his affiliation quiet, even from church management. Using hisbirth name, Thomas Mapother IV, he received auditing at a small Scientologymission called the Enhancement Center in Sherman Oaks, which Rogers had startedwith her former husband. Rogers’s close friend, and former roommate, KirstieAlley, did her auditing there, along with singer—and later, congressman—SonnyBono, who had also been brought into the church by Rogers. Cruise would latercredit Scientology’s study methods for helping him overcome his dyslexia.The triumph of adding Cruise to the Scientology stable was fraught withproblems. Mimi Rogers was at the top of that list. Her parents had been involvedwith Dianetics since the early days of the movement. In 1957, when Mimi was ayear old, they had moved to Washington, DC, to work for Hubbard, and her father,Philip Spickler, had briefly joined the Sea Org. But Mimi’s parents had becomedisaffected by the end of the seventies. They were considered “squirrels,”because they continued to practice Scientology outside the guidance of thechurch. It would be one thing to have Tom Cruise as a trophy for Scientology,but it would be a disaster if he became a walking advertisement for thesquirrels.When Miscavige learned of Cruise’s involvement in Scientology, he arranged tohave the star brought to Gold Base, alone, at its secret desert location nearHemet, in August 1989. He assigned his top people to audit and supervise theyoung star during his first weekend stay. Cruise arrived wearing a baseball capand dark glasses, trying to keep a low profile, although everyone on the baseknew he was there.Cruise was preparing to make Days of Thunder that fall. He had just seen atwenty-one-year-old Australian actress, Nicole Kidman, in the thriller DeadCalm, and he was so enchanted that he cast her in a part she was far too youngto play: a brain surgeon who brings Cruise’s character back to life after hecrashes his race car. They had an immediate, intense connection, one thatquickly became a subject of tabloid speculation.According to Rathbun, Cruise and Miscavige now had a common interest: gettingrid of Mimi. She demanded and received a church mediation of their relationship,which involves each partner being put on E-Meters and confessing their “crimes”in front of the other. But with Cruise ready to move on and Miscavige seeminglyset against her, Rogers stood little chance. Marty Rathbun and a church attorneywent to her home carrying divorce papers. “I told her this was the right thingto do for Tom, because he was going to do lots of good for Scientology,” Rathbunrecalled. “That was the end of Mimi Rogers.”Rogers later said that she and Cruise were already having difficulty in theirmarriage. He had been seriously thinking about becoming a monk, in which casemarriage wouldn’t fit into his plans. “He thought he had to be celibate tomaintain the purity of his instrument,” she told Playboy. “Therefore, it becameobvious that we had to split.”AFTER TWO YEARS, Annie Broeker had worked her way out of Happy Valley. She wasassigned to Gold Base, which serves as the headquarters for the Commodore’sMessengers Org; Golden Era Productions, which makes Scientology films andmanufactures the audiovisual materials for the church, as well as E-Meters; andthe Religious Technology Center, which enforces the orthodoxy of Scientologypractices. Through his position as chairman of the RTC, Miscavige directed thechurch’s operations, spending much of his time living on the base. Rathbun andother top executives were also living and working on the five-hundred-acre base,which was still so hush-hush that few Scientologists knew of its existence.Rathbun believed that Miscavige wanted Annie close by, in case Pat Broeker everstirred back to life.An ex-marine named Andre Tabayoyon, who oversaw construction of the security atthe Gold Base, later testified that church funds were used to purchase assaultrifles, shotguns, and pistols; he also said that explosive devices were placedaround the perimeter to be used in case of assault by law enforcement officials.Surrounded by a security fence with three-inch spikes, patrolled by armedguards, and monitored by cameras, motion detectors, infrared scanners, and asniper’s nest at the top of a hill, the property houses about eight hundred SeaOrg members, in conditions that the church describes as “like one would find ina convent or seminary, albeit much more comfortable.”Annie resumed using her maiden name, Tidman. Although she was continuously underguard, she had fallen in love with another Sea Org member—Jim Logan, the sameman who had recruited Paul Haggis into Scientology on the street corner inLondon, Ontario. Annie had met Logan in Happy Valley when both were on the RPF.Jim and Annie married in June 1990 and moved to Sea Org berthing near Gold Base.Logan was no longer the long-haired hippie he had been in those days; he was nowmiddle-aged and balding, with a black moustache, but he still had those intense,playful eyes and a ready laugh. His outsized, boisterous personality didn’talways fit well in the highly regimented life he had signed up for. In thesummer of 1992, Logan was served with a “non-enturbulation order,” which meantthat he should stop stirring things up. In October, eight men came to escort himto a detention facility where troublesome staff members were confined. Logan wastold that he had been declared a Suppressive Person and was going to be bootedout of the Sea Org.Annie had previously confided that she was “finished” with the Sea Org and wouldleave if Jim was ready. He didn’t want to go then; he still hoped torehabilitate himself in the eyes of the church, but Annie made application toformally route out of the Sea Org. In a few months, if all went well, they wouldhave a quiet reunion in Nova Scotia, where they could have children and forgetthe past. Annie promised him, “They can’t make me divorce you.” But on October8, 1992, Logan’s last day in the Sea Org, church officials told him that Anniehad been ordered to disconnect from him. He was served with divorce papers,given a freeloader tab for more than $350,000, and then dropped off at the busstation with a ticket to Bangor, Maine.Several times after that, Jim and Annie were able to speak secretly. She wouldmanage to sneak a call to him late at night, or he would have his mother callher. When Annie couldn’t wait any longer to see him, Jim bought her an openticket from Ontario, California—the nearest airport—to Bangor. It would bewaiting for her to pick up whenever she wanted. A few weeks later, Jim got acall from Annie: she was on her way. It was about five in the morning inCalifornia. She was catching a flight that stopped in Denver, then went on toBoston, where she would change planes for Bangor. Jim set out from Nova Scotiafor the nine-hour drive to the airport.Rathbun got the message that Annie had fled the base about an hour and a halfafter she left. He was panicked. Annie knew as well as anyone the inside storyof the secret money transfers to Hubbard, the offshore accounts, the shreddingof incriminating documents. She could torpedo the church’s application fortax-exempt status. She also knew the true circumstances of Hubbard’s last days.She might even reunite with Pat Broeker, and the two of them could pose achallenge to Miscavige. Rathbun saw Annie as a potential “doomsday machine.”According to Gary Morehead, the hulking chief of security at Gold Base at thetime, a “blow drill” went into effect immediately. Morehead had refined theprocess to a model of Sea Org efficiency. Each year, a minimum of a hundredpeople attempted to escape from Gold, but few got away cleanly. Morehead’ssecurity team kept files on members, containing bank account and credit cardnumbers, family contacts, even hobbies and predilections. When one seniorexecutive fled in 1992, for instance, Morehead knew he was a baseball fan. Hecaught him a week later in the parking lot of the San Francisco Giants stadium.Morehead’s team was aided by the isolation of the base—Gold was in a narrowvalley in the middle of the desert, seven miles from the village of Hemet. Therewas a single highway, easy to patrol; mountain ranges enclosed the base oneither side, and the rocky slopes were copiously supplied with cactus andrattlesnakes. Many of the Sea Org members had neither the resources nor theskills to get very far. There was an ingrained distrust of the non-Scientology“wog” world and its system of justice, as well as a fatalistic view of the reachof the church, especially among Sea Org members who, like Annie, had grown up inScientology. Those who had cell phones used them mainly as walkie-talkies forcommunication on the base; phone records were monitored and the phones would betaken away if they were used to make outside calls. Few of them had cars oftheir own, or even driver’s licenses, so the best they could do was to try toget to the bus station before they were discovered missing. By the time the busmade its next stop, however, there was usually a member of Morehead’s teamwaiting for them. If that failed, Morehead’s security squad would stake out thehouses of the blown member’s family and friends, using scanners that couldlisten in on cordless phones and cell phones, and running the license plates ofeveryone who came and went. When the team finally confronted their prey, theywould try to talk them into returning to the base voluntarily. If that failed,occasionally they would use force.3Most of those who fled were torn by conflicting emotions. On the one hand, theywere often frightened, humiliated, and angry. They desperately wanted a lifeoutside the organization. Some, like Annie, wanted to have children, which shewas forbidden to do as a Sea Org member. On the other hand, they believed thattheir eternal salvation was at stake. The youthful enthusiasm that had causedthem to sign their billion-year contract of service may have been dampened, butthere was usually some residual idealism that the security team could appeal to.Typically, in these confrontations, Morehead would bring along the escapee’s“opinion leader,” which could be his case supervisor, or another family memberwho was in Scientology—his wife or his mother, for instance. In many instances,the fleeing Sea Org member didn’t even argue; he just gave up, knowing that hewould probably be taken directly to RPF, where he might spend months or yearsworking his way back into good standing.At any time, a fleeing member could guarantee his safety by simply calling thepolice, but that rarely if ever happened. The Riverside County Sheriff’sDepartment, whose jurisdiction includes Gold Base, says that there has neverbeen an outcry of abuse, or an accusation of illegal detention from members ofthe church at the base. Although the Sea Org members lived inside a highlysecure compound in a desert hideaway, surrounded by fences and high-techsensors, most of them weren’t really being held against their will. On thecontrary, it was their will that held them. But according to Morehead, no onewho escaped ever returned voluntarily.As soon as Morehead learned that Annie had blown, his team began combing throughher personal effects, calling hotels and motels in the area, and looking forclues as to where she was headed. The easiest way of doing that was to havesomeone pretend to be Annie and try to book a flight, then be told, forinstance, “Oh, we already have you on the eleven-ten flight to Boston.” If thatdidn’t work, another member would call the airlines, posing as a sick relative,and demand help in finding the missing “son” or “wife” or whatever; if theairline representative refused to give out that information, the member wouldcontinue asking to speak to a higher-up, until he got the information. In onecase, it was the vice president of an airline who, thinking he was responding toa family medical emergency, gave up the pertinent details. Morehead also hiredformer FBI or CIA agents as private investigators. As soon as an escapee madethe mistake of using a credit card, the team would know almost immediately wherethe charge was placed. Morehead was always surprised at how easily suchsupposedly confidential information could be obtained. His team quickly learnedthat Annie was on the flight to Boston.Minutes later, Marty Rathbun lit out for the airport at a hundred miles an hour.He didn’t even have time to change clothes. He was wearing a T-shirt,sweatpants, and sneakers. His secretary booked a direct flight that would arriveat Boston only twenty minutes after Annie’s, and just twenty minutes before herconnecting flight to Bangor.It was winter and snowing in Boston when he landed, at ten at night, when mostof the air traffic had ended. He ran through the nearly empty corridors of LoganAirport to the gate for the Bangor flight. There was a stairwell that leddownstairs, and a door that opened to the tarmac. Rathbun rushed outside intothe frigid air. The passengers were still on the ramp; Annie was only six feetaway from him. “Annie!” he cried. She turned around. As soon as she saw who itwas, her shoulders slumped, and she walked toward him.Rathbun talked to Miscavige and said that he would get a couple of hotel roomsin Boston and bring Annie back in the morning, but Miscavige was unwilling torisk it. He told Rathbun that he had already arranged for John Travolta’s jet topick them up a few hours later.Annie and Jim Logan were finally divorced on August 26, 1993. He never saw heragain. (She died in 2011 of lung cancer, at the age of fifty-five.)BY HIS ACTIONS, Miscavige showed his instinctive understanding of how to caterto the sense of entitlement that comes with great stardom. It was not just amatter of disposing of awkward personal problems, such as clinging spouses;there were also the endless demands for nourishment of an ego that is alwaysaware of the fragility of success; the longing for privacy that is constantly atwar with the demand for recognition; the need to be fortified againstordinariness and feelings of mortality; and the sense that the quality of thematerial world that surrounds you reflects upon your own value, and thereforeeverything must be made perfect. These were qualities Miscavige demanded forhimself as well. He surrounded Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman with an approvingand completely deferential environment, as spotless and odorless as a fairytale. A special bungalow was prepared for their stay at Gold Base, along with aprivate rose garden. When the couple longed to play tennis, a court wasrehabilitated, at significant expense. Miscavige heard about the couple’sfantasy of running through a field of wildflowers together, so he had Sea Orgmembers plant a section of the desert; when that failed to meet hisexpectations, the meadow was plowed up and sodded with grass. Miscavige assignedthem a personal chef, Sinar Parman, who had cooked for Hubbard, and had ahigh-end gym constructed that was mainly for the use of Cruise and himself. Whena flood triggered a mudslide that despoiled the couple’s romantic bungalow,Miscavige held the entire base responsible, and ordered everyone to worksixteen-hour days until everything was restored to its previous pristinecondition.In July 1990, Cruise’s involvement with the church became public in an articlein the tabloid Star. (Cruise himself didn’t admit his affiliation until twoyears later, in an interview with Barbara Walters.) The fact that theinformation was leaked, probably from a source within the church, was at once agreat embarrassment for Miscavige and a relief, because Cruise’s name was nowfinally linked irrevocably in the public mind with Scientology. He offered anunparalleled conduit to Hollywood celebrity culture, and Miscavige went to greatlengths to court him. At Thanksgiving, 1990, he ordered Parman to cook dinnerfor Cruise’s whole family. Miscavige even arranged for Cruise to place someinvestments with the Feshbach brothers—Kurt, Joseph, and Matthew—three PaloAlto, California, stockbrokers. They were devoted Scientologists who had made afortune by selling short on the stock market. According to Rathbun, whenCruise’s investments actually lost money, the Feshbachs obligingly replenishedthe star’s account with their personal funds.Early on, Cruise and Miscavige shared a powerful sense of identity with eachother. They were both short but powerfully built, “East Coast personalities,” asParman diagnosed them. They shared a love of motorcycles, cars, and adventuroussports. Miscavige was bedazzled by the glamour surrounding the star, whointroduced him to a social set outside of Scientology, a world Miscavige knewlittle about. He had spent most of his life cloistered in the Sea Org. He wasthrilled when he visited Cruise on the set of Days of Thunder, and the actortook him skydiving for the first time. Cruise, for his part, fell under thespell of Miscavige’s commanding personality. He modeled his determinednaval-officer hero in A Few Good Men on Miscavige, a fact that the church leaderliked to brag about.Just before Christmas, 1990, Sinar Parman was told that Tom and Nicole weregoing to get married, and that he and a Sea Org pastry chef, along with theirwives, would be cooking for the wedding party. Parman was assured that theywould get paid for their trouble; in the meantime, they should buy some civilianclothes suitable for a cold climate. Parman went shopping and put everything onhis credit card, along with a Christmas present for Cruise. Then Cruise’sprivate jet flew them to Telluride, Colorado, where the wedding took place. Theyspent three days preparing meals for guests. Cruise’s auditor, Ray Mithoff,performed the ceremony, and David Miscavige served as best man. Afterward,Parman was informed that Miscavige had changed his mind about paying for hisservices and the expenses incurred. Parman was left with hundreds of dollarscharged to his credit card, which he struggled to pay off on his Sea Orgsalary—fifty dollars a week at the time.At first, Tom and Nicole seemed like the ideal Scientology power match. Theywere intelligent, articulate, extraordinarily attractive people. At Gold Base,Tom reached OT III. He would have spent a considerable amount of time after thatself-auditing in order to exorcise his body thetans. Although Nicole didn’tshare Tom’s obvious enthusiasm for Scientology—she was a cooler personality inany case—she was drawn along by his intensity. She went Clear in no time. Withina year, she had reached OT II, but then, mysteriously, stopped. A candidate whohas begun the OT levels is not supposed to pause until OT III has been achieved.Miscavige suspected the influence of a Suppressive Person—specifically, Kidman’sfather, Antony Kidman, a clinical psychologist who had written several popularself-help books in Australia. From the beginning Kidman was privately considereda Potential Trouble Source.One day at Gold Base, Marty Rathbun summoned a sixteen-year-old Sea Org member,Marc Headley, and told him that he had been selected to undergo specialauditing. He was to tell no one about it, including his co-workers and hisfamily. And by the way, the auditor would be Tom Cruise.Headley reported to a large conference room. Right away he noticed NicoleKidman, who was also receiving auditing, and Kirstie Alley, who he later came tobelieve was there mainly as a “celebrity prop,” since she did little other thanread.“Hello, I am Tom,” Headley remembers Cruise saying, vigorously shaking hishand.4 He handed Headley the metal cans that were attached to the E-Meter andasked if the temperature in the room was all right. Then he instructed Headleyto take a deep breath and let it out. This was a metabolism test, which issupposed to show whether the preclear was prepared for the session. Apparently,the needle on the E-Meter didn’t fall sufficiently. Headley was so starstruckthat he was having trouble focusing.“Did you get enough sleep?” Cruise asked.“Yeah.”“Did you get enough to eat?”“Yeah.”“Did you take your vitamins?”Headley said he never took vitamins.“That might be the problem,” Cruise said. He went into the pantry, which wasfilled with snacks for the celebrities. Headley was used to the meager Sea Orgfare, and he was taken aback by the cornucopia laid out for the stars to nibbleon. As Cruise rummaged through the cabinets, Headley bit into a cheese Danish.The actor found several vitamins and then asked, “Do you take a lot of beepollen?”Headley had no idea what he meant.“Never had bee pollen?” Cruise said excitedly. “Oh, that will do the trick forsure.”He led Headley to his Yamaha motorcycle and rode the two of them to the basecanteen. It was dinnertime, and the canteen was filled with Headley’s gawkingco-workers. Headley was surprised to learn that there was bee pollen for sale,although he says Cruise didn’t pay for it; he just grabbed it and they went backto the conference room. This time, Headley passed the metabolism test, althoughhe privately credited the Danish over the bee pollen.According to Headley, Cruise helped him through the Upper IndoctrinationTraining Routines. “Look at the wall,” Cruise would have said, according toHubbard’s specifications. “Thank you. Walk over to the wall. Thank you. Touchthe wall. Thank you.” The purpose of this exercise, according to Hubbard, is to“assert control over the preclear and increase the preclear’s havingness.”Cruise went on to ask Headley to make an object, such as a desk, hold still, orbecome more solid. Another exercise involved telling an ashtray to stand up, atwhich point the preclear stands and lifts the ashtray, thanks the ashtray, andthen commands the ashtray to sit down. With each repetition, the preclear’scommands get louder, so soon he is yelling at the ashtray at the top of hisvoice. The purpose of this drill is to come to the realization that yourintention is separate from your words and the sound waves that carry them. Theseprocedures went on for hours, as Headley robotically responded to Cruise’scommands. “You learn that if you don’t do what they say, they’ll just ask thesame questions five million times,” Headley recalled. At one point, he fellasleep, but he kept responding automatically. This training went on for hoursevery day for several weeks, until Tom and Nicole returned to Hollywood.When Nicole moved into Tom’s mansion in Pacific Palisades, they were underconstant watch. Miscavige’s wife, Shelly, interviewed Scientology candidates forTom and Nicole’s household staff. According to former executives, theScientologists who worked for Cruise and Kidman reported to the church aboutwhatever they observed. Miscavige offered the couple significant gifts ofservice from Sea Org members. They installed a sophisticated audiovisual system.Sinar Parman, the chef, says he helped design the kitchen. There was acomfortable, symbiotic relationship between the star and the church. The use ofunpaid church clergy to help him renovate his house, hire his staff, and installsophisticated technology was simply a part of the deal.5PAUL HAGGIS WAS ALWAYS a workaholic, and as his career took off, he spent evenless time with his family. He wouldn’t get home till late at night or early inthe morning. His three daughters scarcely knew who he was.In general, Haggis was far more interested in causes than people. He drove anenvironmentally friendly car—a little yellow Mini Cooper with a WAR IS NOT THEANSWER bumper sticker. The Haggis house became a regular stop for thesocial-justice sector of the Hollywood left. Once when Haggis threw afund-raiser for Tibet, the Dalai Lama came. The backyard was strewn withcelebrities and chanting monks. The girls thought it was hysterical. BarbraStreisand introduced herself to the Dalai Lama, and he asked what she did. “Alittle singing, a little dancing,” she told him.For years, Paul and Diane’s marriage had been in turmoil, and in 1983 they beganan epic and bitter divorce. The proceedings lasted for nine years. The girlslived with Diane, visiting Paul every other weekend. During this period ofestrangement from his wife, Haggis flew to New York with a casting director, whowas also a Scientologist. They shared a kiss. He later confessed the incidentduring an auditing session and was sent to the Ethics Office, where he wasassigned some minor punishment. He had been to Ethics before, usually formissing coursework, but he was beginning to feel that the more famous he became,the less likely he was to be rebuked for behavior that was considered “outethics” for other members.Anytime Haggis boggled at an illogical or fanciful piece of data, he wasinvariably reminded that it was his failure entirely. He had come intoScientology as an adult, so his experience outside the church still informed hisjudgments. When he stumbled on something in Scientology that he thought wasridiculous, he would make a mental detour around it, not wanting to spend thetime and money to do the “repairs” that his supervisors would prescribe.Although he never lost his skepticism, his daughters were born into thereligion. They were schooled in it from the beginning. Nearly everyone they knewwas a Scientologist.Each of the girls was a near clone of one of the parents. Alissa and Katy werePaul, pale and blond, but more sharp-featured, with dimpled noses and sculptedcheekbones. Lauren, the middle daughter, was Diane, inheriting her half-Greekmother’s olive skin and dark, Mediterranean eyes. The girls were bright,inquisitive, and cheerful by nature, but their parents’ divorce was an endless,churning, distracting, heartbreaking trauma, and it took a toll.The girls went to Delphi Academy, a private school that uses Hubbard “studytech.” It is largely self-guided. According to Scientology pedagogy, there arethree barriers that retard a student’s progress. The first is “Lack of Mass.”This principle was derived from Alfred Korzybski’s observation that the word andthe object that it names are not the same thing. If the student is studyingtractors, for instance, it is best to have a real tractor in front of him. Theabsence of the actual object is disorienting to the student. “It makes him feelphysiologically condensed,” Hubbard writes. “Actually makes him feel squashed.Makes him feel bent, sort of spinny, sort of dead, bored, exasperated.”Photographs of the object can help, or motion pictures, as they are “a sort ofpromise of hope of the mass,” but they are not an adequate substitute for thetractor under study. The result for the student is that he becomes dizzy, he’llhave headaches, his stomach gets upset, his eyes will hurt, and “he’s going towind up with a face that feels squashed.” Illness and even suicide may be theexpected result. Hubbard’s study tech remedies the problem by using clay orPlay-Doh for the student to make replicas of the object.The second principle is “Too Steep a Gradient,” which Hubbard describes as thedifficulty a student encounters when he makes a leap he’s not prepared for. “Itis a sort of a confusion or a reelingness that goes with this one,” Hubbardwrites. His solution is to go back to the point where the student fullyunderstands the subject, then break the material into bite-size pieces.The “Undefined Word”—the third and most important principle—occurs when thestudent tries to absorb material while bypassing the definition of the wordsemployed. “THE ONLY REASON A PERSON GIVES UP A STUDY OR BECOMES CONFUSED ORUNABLE TO LEARN IS BECAUSE HE HAS GONE PAST A WORD THAT WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD,”Hubbard emphasizes in one of his chiding technical bulletins. “WORDS SOMETIMESHAVE DIFFERENT OR MORE THAN ONE MEANING.” A misunderstood word “gives one adistinctly blank feeling or a washed out feeling,” Hubbard writes. “A not-therefeeling and a sort of an hysteria will follow in the back of that.” The solutionis to have a large dictionary at hand, preferably one with lots of pictures init. All Scientology texts contain glossaries for specialized Scientology terms.The need to understand the meaning of words, Hubbard writes, “is a sweepinglyfantastic discovery in the field of education and don’t neglect it.”These last two principles are fundamental to the induction of Scientologyitself. Because the church asserts that everything Hubbard wrote or spoke isinarguably true, whatever you don’t understand or accept is your fault. Thesolution is to go back and study the words and approach the material in a moredeliberate fashion. Eventually, you’ll get it. Then you can move on.Lauren loved her teacher at Delphi, but the Hubbard method placed theresponsibility of learning almost entirely on the student. For Lauren, herparents’ tumultuous divorce was a crushing distraction. It seemed to her that noone was paying attention to her, either at home or at school. She was illiterateuntil she was eleven. She couldn’t read or write her own name.Second-generation Scientologists are typically far more at home with thelanguage and culture of the church than their parents are. And yet they may findthemselves a little lost when trying to deal with an uncomprehending society.The first time Alissa noticed that she was doing something different from mostpeople was when she performed a Contact Assist. Scientology preaches that if yourepeatedly touch a fresh wound to the object that caused the injury and silentlyconcentrate, the pain lessens and the sense of trauma fades. If a Scientologistsees a person close his hand in a door, for instance, a church manual instructsthe Scientologist to “have him go back and, with his injured hand, touch theexact spot on the same door, duplicating the same motions that occurred at thetime of the injury.” There are other kinds of assists that will awaken anunconscious person, eliminate boils, reduce earaches and back pain, and make adrunk sober. Instead of crying when she hurt herself, Alissa would quietly redothe action over and over, until she had drained it of its sting. She noticedthat non-Scientologists had no idea what she was doing. She was also surprisedwhen she went to a friend’s house for dinner and the family said grace beforethe meal. It took her a second to realize what they were doing. In her opinion,God plays a negligible role in Scientology. “I mean, there’s a spot for it, butit’s sort of a blank spot.” So whenever her friends began to pray, “I would bowmy head and let them have their ceremony.”Paul was also scarred by the divorce—although, as would often be the case forhim, he would mine the experience for his work. He created a television series,Family Law, that was based to some extent on his divorce from Diane. He alwaysfound more solace and meaning in his work than he did in his family. Each yearhe grew more successful, but the gap between him and his daughters grew wider.They knew him better as a writer than as a father, and they would puzzle overthe fact that he was so cool to them, when his scripts were often full ofemotion. Paul felt guilty about not spending time with the girls, so he wouldarrange to bring them to the set and assign them some small task. Alissa got todo nearly every job in the industry, from wardrobe to production assistant; shereceived a Directors Guild card in Canada by the time she was fifteen.In 1991, Haggis went to a Fourth of July party at the home of some Scientologistfriends. He met a striking actress there named Deborah Rennard. She had grown upin Scientology. In her early twenties she had studied acting at the BeverlyHills Playhouse and had fallen under the influence of Milton Katselas, thelegendary acting teacher and Hubbard’s former collaborator. They became lovers.Milton was spellbinding, but he was twenty-seven years older than Deborah, andtheir relationship was an exhausting roller-coaster ride. They stayed togetherfor six years. When Paul met her, Deborah and Milton had recently broken up. Shewas a successful actress with a recurring role in the long-running televisionseries Dallas—as J. R. Ewing’s loyal but always unattainable secretary.[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_014_r1.jpg]Deborah Rennard and Milton Katselas in Silverlake, California, 1985Paul was still going through his epic divorce. Early in his relationship withDeborah, Paul admitted that he was having a spiritual crisis. He said he’d racedup to the top of the Bridge on faith, but he hadn’t gotten what he expected. “Idon’t believe I’m a spiritual being. I actually am what you see,” Paul told her.Deborah advised him to get more auditing. Personally, she was havingbreakthroughs that led her to discover past lives. Images floated through hermind, and she realized, “That’s not here. I’m not in my body, I’m in anotherplace.” She might be confronting what the church calls a “contra-survivalaction”—“like the time I clobbered Paul or threw something at him.” She wouldlook for an “earlier similar” in her life. Suddenly she would see herself inEngland in the nineteenth century. “It was a fleeting glimpse at what I wasdoing then. Clobbering husbands.” When she examined these kindred moments in hercurrent existence and past ones, the emotional charge would dissipate. Paulwould say, “Don’t you think you’re making this up?” At first, she thought hemight be right. But then she wondered if that really mattered. She felt she wasgetting better, so who cared whether they were memories or fantasies? As anactor she went through an analogous process when working on a scene; she wouldgrab hold of a feeling from who knows where. It felt real. It helped her getinto the role. As long as the process worked, why quibble?Deborah made sure Paul showed up at the annual gala and became involved inScientology charitable organizations. Over the years, Haggis spent about$100,000 on courses and auditing and an equal amount on various Scientologyinitiatives. This figure doesn’t include the money that Diane gave to the churchwhile she was married to Paul. Haggis also gave $250,000 to the InternationalAssociation of Scientologists, a fund set up to protect and promote the church.Deborah spent about $150,000 on coursework of her own. Paul and Deborah held afund-raiser in their home that raised $200,000 for a new Scientology building inNashville, and they contributed an additional $10,000 from their own pocket. Thedemands for money—“regging,” it’s called in Scientology, because the calls comefrom the Registrar’s Office—never stopped. Paul gave them money just to keepthem from calling.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 A lawyer for Preston and Travolta claims that the couple “never put their sonthrough a ‘Purification Rundown’ treatment and would never have engaged in anytype of conduct that would have endangered their son’s health, welfare, orwell-being in any way.” He maintains that Preston was referring to herself whenshe responded to Williams’s question.2 According to the church, “The Sea Org policy on children changed in 1986. TheExecutive Director International, Mr. Guillaume Lesevre, issued the change inpolicy which provided that Sea Org members could no longer have children andremain in the Sea Org.”3 The church denies that there is such a thing as the blow drill. The churchproduced an affidavit by Morehead, executed Mar. 31, 1997, in which he says: “Ihave seen people leave and they were free to do so. I am now doing so myself.… Iam aware of stories of individuals claiming to have been held against theirwill, but I know for myself and from my security position that the stories arecompletely false.” Morehead repudiates the statement, saying, “In March of 1997at that specific moment I would have signed anything.”4 Cruise, through his attorney, says he has no recollection of meeting MarcHeadley. Bruce Hines, who was there to make sure the process was done correctly,witnessed the sessions and clearly remembers Cruise auditing Headley.5 Cruise’s attorney remarks, “So far as I know, Mr. Cruise has always paid forany services he received.”"},{"pageContent":"7[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_L02_r1.jpg]THE FUTURE IS OURSNow that he was firmly in control of the church, Miscavige sought to restore theimage of Scientology. The 1980s had been a devastating period for the church’sreputation, with Hubbard’s disappearance and eventual death, the high-profilelawsuits, and the avalanche of embarrassing publicity. Miscavige hired Hill &Knowlton, the oldest and largest public relations firm in the world, to overseea national campaign. The legendarily slick worldwide chairman of Hill &Knowlton, Robert Keith Gray, specialized in rehabilitating disgraced dictators,arms dealers, and governments with appalling human-rights records. Asrepresentatives of the government of Kuwait, Hill & Knowlton had been partlyresponsible for selling the Persian Gulf War to the American people. One of thecompany’s tactics was to provide the testimony of a fifteen-year-old girl,“Nayirah,” to a human-rights committee in the US House of Representatives inOctober 1990. Nayirah described herself as an ordinary Kuwaiti who hadvolunteered in a hospital. She tearfully told the House members of watchingIraqi soldiers storm into the prenatal unit. “They took the babies out of theincubators, took the incubators, and left the babies on the cold floor to die,”she said. The incident could never be confirmed, and the girl turned out to bethe daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States and had nevervolunteered at the hospital. The propaganda operation was, at the time, the mostexpensive and sophisticated public relations campaign ever run in the UnitedStates by a foreign government.Gray had also worked closely with the Reagan campaign. He regaled theScientologists with his ability to take a “mindless actor” and turn him into the“Teflon President.” Hill & Knowlton went to work for the church, putting outphony news stories, often in the form of video news releases made to look likeactual reports rather than advertisements. The church began supportinghigh-profile causes, such as Ted Turner’s Goodwill Games, thereby associatingitself with other well-known corporate sponsors, such as Sony and Pepsi. Therewere full-page ads in newsmagazines touting the church’s philosophy, and cabletelevision ads promoting Scientology books and Dianetics seminars.Then, in May 1991, came one of the greatest public relations catastrophes in thechurch’s history. Time magazine published a scathing cover story titled“Scientology: The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power,” by investigative reporterRichard Behar. The exposé revealed that just one of the religion’s manyentities, the Church of Spiritual Technology, had taken in half a billiondollars in 1987 alone. Hundreds of millions of dollars from the parentorganization were buried in secret accounts in Lichtenstein, Switzerland, andCyprus. Many of the personalities linked with the church were savaged in thearticle. Hubbard himself was described as “part storyteller, part flimflam man.”The Feshbach brothers were the “terrors of the stock exchanges,” who spreadfalse information about companies in order to drive down their valuations. Beharquoted a former church executive as saying that John Travolta stayed in thechurch only because he was worried that details of his sex life would be madepublic if he left. The article asserted that Miscavige made frequent jokes aboutTravolta’s “allegedly promiscuous homosexual behavior.” When Behar queriedTravolta’s attorney for the star’s comment, he was told that such questions were“bizarre.” “Two weeks later, Travolta announced that he was getting married toactress Kelly Preston, a fellow Scientologist,” Behar wrote.“Those who criticize the church—journalists, doctors, lawyers, and evenjudges—often find themselves engulfed in litigation, stalked by private eyes,framed for fictional crimes, beaten up, or threatened by death,” Behar noted. Heaccused the Justice Department of failing to back the IRS and the FBI inbringing a racketeering suit against the church because it was unwilling tospend the money required to take the organization on. He quoted Cynthia Kisser,head of the Cult Awareness Network in Chicago: “Scientology is quite likely themost ruthless, the most classically terroristic, the most litigious and the mostlucrative cult the country has ever seen.”After the Time article appeared, Miscavige was invited to appear on ABC’sNightline, a highly prestigious news show, to defend the image of the church. Hehad never been interviewed in his life. He rehearsed for months, as much as fourhours per day, with Rathbun and Rinder. He would prod them to ask him questions,then complain that they didn’t sound like Ted Koppel, the show’s courtly butincisive host. Miscavige would ask himself the questions in what he thought wasKoppel’s voice, then respond with a hypothetical answer. He sorted through whatseemed to his aides an endless number of wardrobe choices before settling on ablue suit with a purple tie and a handkerchief in his breast pocket. Finally, onValentine’s Day, 1992, he went to New York, where the show would be broadcastlive.The interview was preceded by a fifteen-minute report by Forrest Sawyer aboutScientology’s claims and controversies. “The church says it now has centers inover seventy countries, with more on the way,” Sawyer said. Heber Jentzsch, thepresident of the Church of Scientology International, was featured, claiming amembership of eight million people. Sawyer also interviewed defectors, whotalked about their families being ripped apart, or being bilked of tens ofthousands of dollars. Richard Behar, the Time reporter, recounted howScientology’s private investigators had obtained his phone records. VickiAznaran, a former high official in the church, who was then suing the church,told Sawyer that Miscavige ordered attacks on those he consideredtroublemakers—“have them, their homes, broken into, have them beaten, havethings stolen from them, slash their tires, break their car windows, whatever.”Koppel allowed Miscavige to respond to the Sawyer report. “Every singledetractor on there is a part of a religious hate group called Cult AwarenessNetwork and their sister group called American Family Foundation,” Miscavigesaid. “It’s the same as the KKK would be with blacks.” He seemed completely atease.“You realize there’s a little bit of a problem getting people to talk criticallyabout Scientology because, quite frankly, they’re scared,” Koppel observed.“Oh, no, no, no, no.”“I’m telling you, people are scared,” Koppel insisted.“Let’s not give the American public the wrong impression,” said Miscavige. “Theperson getting harassed is myself and the church.”Koppel then lobbed what seemed like an easy question for a man who had spent somuch time preparing for this encounter. “See if you can explain to me why Iwould want to be a Scientologist.”“Because you care about yourself and life itself,” Miscavige said eagerly. Hegave the example of communication skills. “This is something that majorbreakthroughs exist in Scientology, being able to communicate in the worldaround you,” he said. “There’s an actual formula for communication which can beunderstood. You can drill on this formula.”“So far in life, I haven’t had a whole lot of trouble communicating,” Koppeldrolly noted.“What in your life do you feel is not right, that you would like to help?”Miscavige asked. It was a classic Scientology technique, to find a subject’s“ruin,” the thing that was blocking his access to happiness.“I feel perfectly comfortable with my life,” Koppel replied.Miscavige switched tactics. “Let’s look at it this way, then, what Scientologydoes. If you look out across the world today, you could say that if you take aperson who’s healthy, doing well, like yourself, you’d say that person isnormal, not a crazy, not somebody who is psychotic, you look at a wall and theycall it an elephant,” he said, extemporizing. “And you can see people belowthat—crazy people, criminals—that I think society in general will look at andsay, ‘That breed of person hasn’t something quite right because they’re not upto this level of personality.’…What we are trying to do in Scientology is takesomebody from this higher level and move them up to greater ability.”“What about the folks ‘down there’?”“We don’t ignore them. My point is this: Scientology is there to make the ablemore able.”“Another way of saying that is: you’re interested in folks who’ve got money.”Miscavige objected, claiming that the money in the church goes to good causes.“We are the largest social reform group in the world,” he said, adding that if aperson stays in Scientology long enough, he’ll have plenty of money. Then hereferenced Sawyer’s report again. “The one girl there that was complaining aboutit, a girl named Vicki Aznaran, which by the way, this is a girl who was kickedout for trying to bring criminals into the church, something she didn’tmention.”“You say a ‘girl.’ I think we’re talking about a grown woman, right?”“A grown woman, excuse me,” Miscavige said. “She violated the mores and codes ofthe group.”“Either you have made an accurate charge against someone or—what a numberof … the pieces written about Scientology suggest is that when you have a criticbefore you, you destroy those people.”“That’s easy to say—”“You smear them.”“That’s easy for the person to say, but she’s the one on that program smearingme.”As for Richard Behar, the Time reporter, Miscavige remarked, “The man was onrecord on two occasions attempting to get Scientologists kidnapped. That is anillegal act.”The hour had ended, but Miscavige had just made another unsupported allegation.Koppel decided to extend the show “a few minutes,” but it went on another halfhour without any commercial breaks. He asked Miscavige to explain what he meantabout Behar. “Some people had called him up and he was telling them to kidnapScientologists out,” Miscavige said.“Now, kidnapping, as you well know, is a federal crime,” Koppel observed. “So,why didn’t you bring charges against him?”“He didn’t succeed,” Miscavige said. “Ted, Ted, you’re missing the point.”“There is such a thing as attempted rape, attempted murder, attemptedkidnapping. It’s also a crime.”“I think you’re really missing the issue, Ted, because my point is this: Thatman represents himself as an objective reporter. Here he is on record a fullthree years before he wrote this article, stating that he felt Scientologistsshould be kidnapped to change their religion.“Second of all,” Miscavige continued, “let’s look at this article, and let’s notfool ourselves. It wasn’t an objective piece. It was done at the behest of EliLilly,” the pharmaceutical manufacturer. “They were upset because of the damagewe had caused to their killer drug Prozac.”“I’m sure you have evidence of that,” Koppel said. “You have affidavits?”“Let me tell you what else I have—”“You have affidavits?”“From them? Of course not. You think they’d admit it?” Miscavige said. “We putin a call to Eli Lilly. Their response was, ‘We can neither confirm nordeny.’ ”1In Sawyer’s report there was a brief clip of Hubbard telling his followers, “Iwas up in the Van Allen Belt. This is factual. And I don’t know why they’rescared of the Van Allen Belt, because it’s simply hot. You’d be surprised howwarm space is.” Koppel observed, “When I hear about a man talking about havingbeen taken out to the Van Allen space radiation belt or space ships that wereessentially the same thing as the DC-8, I’ve got to tell you, I mean, if we’retalking about this man’s credibility, that certainly raises some questions in mymind.”Miscavige said that Hubbard’s quote had been taken out of context.“Take a minute, if you would, and see if you can put it into context for us sothat it does not sound ridiculous,” Koppel said.“Okay,” said Miscavige. “I want you to take the Catholic Church and take rightnow and explain to me, to make sense that the Virgin Mary was a virgin,scientifically impossible, unless we’re talking about something …” He trailedoff, then said, “Okay, I’ll be like you, I’ll be the cynic. If we’re talkingabout artificial insemination, how could that be? If you’re talking about goingto Heaven, except we have a space shuttle going out there, we have the Apollogoing out there, you do that. I’m not here—” He was obviously confused anduncomfortable.“You were a Catholic as a child, right?” Koppel asked helpfully.“Yeah.”“So you know full well that those issues are questions of faith.”Miscavige wouldn’t accept the life raft that Koppel offered him. Scientology issold as an entirely rational approach to understanding and mastering existence.“No, no,” Miscavige replied. “Talk about the Van Allen Belt or whatever, thatforms no part of current Scientology, none whatsoever.”“But what did he mean when he was talking about it?”“Quite frankly, this tape here, he’s talking about the origins of the universe,and I think you’re going to find that in any, any, any religion, and I think youcan make the same mockery of it. I think it’s offensive.”“I’m not mocking it, I’m asking you a question,” Koppel replied. “You turn itaround and ask me about Catholicism. I say we’re talking about areas of faith.”“Well, it’s not even a matter of faith,” Miscavige insisted, “becauseScientology is about you, yourself, and what you do. You’re bringing upsomething that isn’t part of current Scientology, that isn’t something thatScientologists study, that is part of some tape taken from, I have no idea, andasking me about it and asking me to put it in context, that I can’t do.” Later,Miscavige told Koppel that he had never heard the Hubbard tape before. (It was apart of a lecture Hubbard gave in 1963, in which he talked about thebetween-lives period, when thetans are transported to Venus to have theirmemories erased.)After the show, Miscavige returned to the greenroom, where Rinder, Rathbun, andNorman Starkey, another executive, were waiting. “How’d I do?” he asked.“Gee, sir, you kicked ass,” one of the men said.“It was a home run,” Rathbun assured him.“Really?” Miscavige asked doubtfully. “Jesus Christ, I was just there and Idon’t know. The guy was pissing me off so much.”Koppel won an Emmy for that show. Miscavige took credit for it, saying, “I gotTed the Emmy.” He even had a replica of an Emmy made and placed in the OfficersLounge at Gold Base. But he never went on television again.THE TIME STORY WAS a turning point in the church’s history. The embarrassmentfor Scientology celebrities undercut the church’s strategy of making thereligion appear to be a spiritual refuge for the show-business elite. One of thechief appeals of the religion to prospective recruits was the perceived networkthat Scientology provided its members, especially in Hollywood, awarding them anadvantage in a ruthlessly competitive industry. With the Time article,affiliation with the church became an embarrassing liability.Tom Cruise was one of the stars who appeared to be backing away fromScientology.2 He stopped moving up the Bridge. He and Nicole adopted twochildren, Isabella and Connor, and began spending more time in Sydney, Kidman’shometown, where she could be close to her family. He hired a powerful publicist,Pat Kingsley, who was able to enforce rigid control over the content of theinterviews the star granted. Although his affiliation with Scientology wasgenerally known, there was no more fuel for the media mill. He seemed to beputting as much distance between himself and the church as possible.The church began to plot its counterattack. The Cult Awareness Network, besiegedby more than fifty lawsuits brought by Scientologists, went bankrupt in 1996. Anindividual Scientologist purchased its name and assets at auction. Soon afterthat, the reorganized Cult Awareness Network sent out a brochure lauding theChurch of Scientology for its efforts to “increase happiness and improveconditions for oneself and others.” The church also began a $3 million campaignagainst Time, placing full-page ads every day in USA Today for twelve weeks,charging that the magazine had “supported” Adolf Hitler, for instance, by naminghim the 1938 “Man of the Year” because of his dominance in European affairs. Alengthy supplement was placed in USA Today titled “The Story That Time Couldn’tTell: Who Really Controls the News at Time—and Why,” in which the church claimedthat Time was actually under the sway of the pharmaceuticalindustry—specifically, Eli Lilly and Company, the maker of Prozac. The churchhad charged that Prozac caused people to commit mass murder and suicide. TheTime article was the drug company’s revenge, the church alleged.3Rathbun directed the ferocious legal assault on Time and oversaw the team ofprivate detectives probing into Behar’s private life. The church, employing whatwas reported to be an annual litigation budget of $20 million and a team of morethan a hundred lawyers to handle the suits already in the courts, filed a $416million libel action against Time Warner, the parent company of the magazine,and Behar. Because the church is regarded under American law as a “publicfigure,” Scientology’s lawyers had to prove not only that the magazine’sallegations were wrong but also that Behar acted with “actual malice”—a legalterm meaning that he knowingly published information he knew to be false, orthat he recklessly disregarded the facts, because he intended to damage thechurch. Although there was no convincing evidence proving that the facts werewrong or that the reporter was biased, the case went all the way to the USSupreme Court, which sustained the district court’s initial ruling against thechurch. In the process, it cost Time more money in defense costs than any othercase in its history.Rathbun’s strategy followed Hubbard’s dictate that the purpose of a lawsuit is“to harass and discourage rather than win.” Hubbard also wrote: “If attacked onsome vulnerable point by anyone or anything or any organization, always find ormanufacture enough threat against them to cause them to sue for peace.… Don’tever defend. Always attack.” He added: “NEVER agree to an investigation ofScientology. ONLY agree to an investigation of the attackers.” He advisedScientologists: “Start feeding lurid, blood, sex, crime, actual evidence on theattackers to the press.… Make it rough, rough on attackers all the way.… Therehas never yet been an attacker who was not reeking with crime. All we had to dowas look for it and murder would come out.” These were maxims that Rathbun tookas his guidelines.The Time article capsized Miscavige’s attempts to break free of the negativeassociations so many people had with Scientology. But there was an even largerbattle under way, one in which the church’s very existence was at stake: itsfight with the IRS to regain its tax-exempt status as a bona fide religion,which it had lost in 1967.The government’s stance was that the Church of Scientology was in fact acommercial enterprise, with “virtually incomprehensible financial procedures”and a “scripturally based hostility to taxation.” The IRS had ruled that thechurch was largely operated to benefit its founder. Miscavige inherited some ofthat liability when he took over after Hubbard’s death. A tax exemption wouldnot only put the imprimatur of the American government on the church as acertified religion, rather than a corrupt, profit-making concern, but it wouldalso provide a substantial amount of immunity from civil suits and thepersistent federal criminal investigations. A decision against the taxexemption, on the other hand, would destroy the entire enterprise, becauseHubbard had decided in 1973 that the church should not pay its back taxes.Twenty years later, the church was $1 billion in arrears, with only $125 millionin reserves. The founder had placed Scientology’s head on the executioner’sblock.The war between the church and the IRS had already gone on for more than twodecades, with both sides waging a campaign of intimidation and espionage.Miscavige accused the Criminal Investigation Division of the IRS of engaging insurveillance of church leaders, wiretaps, and illegal opening of the church’smail. Now the church upped the ante by besieging the IRS with 200 lawsuits onthe part of the church and more than 2,300 suits on behalf of individualparishioners in every jurisdiction in the country, overwhelming governmentlawyers, running up fantastic expenses, and causing an immense amount of havocinside the IRS. Miscavige boasted that the entire legal budget of the federalagency was exhausted: “They didn’t even have money to attend the annual AmericanBar Association conference of lawyers—which they were supposed to speak at!” Thechurch ran ads against the agency, using the images of beloved celebrities (whowere not Scientologists) such as John Wayne and Willie Nelson, who had beenaudited by the IRS. “All of America Loved Lucy,” one ad said, over an iconicphoto of Lucille Ball, “except the IRS.” A ten-thousand-dollar reward wasoffered to potential whistle-blowers to expose IRS abuses. Private investigatorsdug into the private lives of IRS officials, going so far as to attend seminarsand pose as IRS workers, to see who had a drinking problem or might be cheatingon a spouse. Stories based on these investigations were promoted by a phony newsbureau the church established, and also published in the church’s Freedommagazine, which Scientologists passed out for free on the steps of the IRSheadquarters in Washington. The hatred on both sides for the other was intense.It seemed bizarre that a rather small organization could overmatch the USgovernment, but the harassment campaign was having an effect. Some governmentworkers were getting anonymous calls in the middle of the night, or finding thattheir pets had disappeared. Whether or not these events were part of theScientology onslaught, they added to the paranoia many in the agency werefeeling.Both the church and the IRS faced the challenge of addressing the question ofwhat, exactly, constituted a religion in the eyes of the American government. Onthe church’s side was a body of scholars who had arisen in defense of what werecalled “new religious movements,” such as the Hare Krishnas, the UnificationChurch, and of course the Church of Scientology. The term was employed toreplace the word “cult,” because these academics found no reliable way ofdistinguishing a cult from a religion. They believe that new religious movementsare persecuted and ridiculed simply because they are recent and seem exotic.Often, such experts are paid to testify in court on behalf of theseorganizations. In the courtroom setting, the casual distinctions that manypeople often make about cults and brainwashing have proven to be difficult tosustain, as the experts pose telling comparisons with the history of mainstreamreligions, whose practices and rituals have long since been folded into a broadcultural acceptance.The Church of Scientology had decided to enlist such experts following the FBIraids in 1977, which exposed Operation Snow White and created a major crisis inthe church. There was a deliberate campaign to provide religious cloaking forthe church’s activities. A Scientology cross was created. Scientology ministersnow appeared wearing Roman collars. And religious scholars were courted; theywere given tours and allowed to interview carefully coached church members.Frank K. Flinn, a former Franciscan friar and a graduate of Harvard DivinitySchool, has testified repeatedly on behalf of Scientology—notably, in 1984, whenthe Church of Scientology, along with Mary Sue Hubbard, sued Gerald Armstrong,the former archivist for the church. Flinn defined religion as a system ofbeliefs of a spiritual nature. There must be norms for behavior—positivecommands and negative prohibitions or taboos—as well as rites and ceremonies,such as initiations, sacraments, prayers, and services for weddings andfunerals. By these means, the believers are united into an identifiablecommunity that seeks to live in harmony with what they perceive as the ultimatemeaning of life. Flinn argued that Scientology amply fulfilled theserequirements, even if it differed in its expression of them from traditionaldenominations.Like Catholicism, Flinn explained, Scientology is a hierarchical religion. Hecompared L. Ron Hubbard to the founders of Catholic religious orders, includinghis own, started by Saint Francis of Assisi, whose followers adopted a vow ofpoverty. Financial disparities within a church are not unusual. Within thehierarchy of Catholicism, for instance, bishops often enjoy a mansion,limousines, servants, and housekeepers; the papacy itself maintains thousands ofpeople on its staff, including the Swiss Guards who protect the pope, and anentire order of nuns dedicated to being housekeepers for the papal apartments.The Catholic Church also maintains houses of rehabilitation (like the RPF) forerrant priests hoping to reform themselves. Flinn saw the RPF as being entirelyvoluntary and even tame compared to what he experienced as a friar in theFranciscan Order. He willingly submitted to the religious practice offlagellation on Fridays, whipping his legs and back in emulation of thesuffering of Jesus before his crucifixion. Flinn also spent several hours a daydoing manual labor. As a member of a mendicant order, he owned no materialpossessions at all, not even the robe he wore. Low wages and humble work wereessential to his spiritual commitment.There is a place for a Supreme Being in Scientology—in Hubbard’s Eight Dynamics,it’s at the top—but the God idea plays a diminished role compared to manyreligions. On the other hand, some religions worship objects—stones or icons ormandalas—rather than a deity. Scientologists don’t pray; but then, neither doBuddhists. The idea of salvation, so central to Christianity, is not sodifferent from Hubbard’s assertion that the fundamental law of the universe isthe urge to survive. Flinn compared the Scientology distinction between preclearand Clear to Buddhist notions of entanglement and enlightenment, or Christiandoctrines of sin and grace. The Scientology creed that humans are “thetans”simply means we are beings with immortal souls, which no Christian would arguewith.One of Flinn’s most interesting and contested points had to do with hagiography,by which he meant attributing extraordinary powers—such as clairvoyance, visionsof God or angels, or the ability to perform miracles—to the charismatic foundersof a religion. He pointed to the virgin birth of Jesus, the ability of theBuddha to “transmigrate” his soul into the heavens, or Moses bringing manna tothe people of Israel. Such legends are useful in that they bolster the faith ofa community, Flinn said. The glaring discrepancies in Hubbard’s biography shouldbe seen in the light of the fact that any religion tends to make its founderinto something more than human.Flinn was asked to testify about a policy Hubbard had written in 1965 titled“Fair Game Law,” in which he laid down the rules for dealing with SuppressivePersons. That category includes non-Scientologists who are hostile to thechurch, apostates, and defectors, as well as their spouses, family members, andclose friends. “A truly Suppressive Person or Group has no rights of any kind,”Hubbard wrote. Such enemies, he said, may be “tricked, lied to or destroyed.” In1965, he wrote another policy letter ambiguously stating, “The practice ofdeclaring people FAIR GAME will cease. FAIR GAME may not appear on any EthicsOrder. It causes bad public relations. [The new ruling] does not cancel anypolicy on the treatment or handling of an SP.” The supposed revocation of FairGame took place before Operation Snow White, the harassment of Paulette Cooperand other journalists, the persecution of defectors, and many other actionsundertaken by church insiders that were done in the spirit, if not the name, ofthe original policy.“Almost all religious movements in their very early phase tend to be harsh,”Flinn reminded the court. He contended that they tend to evolve and become morelenient over time. As for disconnection, he declared that it was “functionallyequivalent to other types of religious exclusions,” such as shunning ofnonbelievers among Mennonites and the Amish. In the Book of Leviticus, forinstance, which is part of the Torah and the Old Testament of the ChristianBible, idolaters and those who have strayed from the faith were to be stoned todeath. That practice has disappeared; instead, Orthodox Jews will sit Shiva forthe nonbeliever, treating him as if he is already dead. “So this kind ofphenomenon is not peculiar to Scientology,” Flinn concluded. The implicationunderlying Flinn’s testimony was that Scientology is a new religion that isreinventing old religious norms; whatever abuses it may be committing are errorsof youthful exuberance, and in any case they are pale imitators of the practicesonce employed by the mainstream religions that judges and jurors were likely tobe members of.In the 1990s, Flinn had interviewed several Scientologists who were doing RPF inLos Angeles. Their quarters didn’t look any worse than his cell in themonastery, where he slept on a straw bed on a board. He asked if they were freeto go. They told him they were, but they wanted to stay and do penance.Flinn admits to having been a cutup when he was in the order, and he felt out ofplace. “I was an Irishman in a sea of Germans.” He would be sent out to dig thepotato field as punishment for his misbehavior. However, when he finally decidedto leave his order, instead of being incarcerated or given a freeloader tab, hewas given a dispensation releasing him from his vows. He never felt the need toescape. He took off his robe, put on civilian clothes, and walked away. Hisspiritual adviser gave him five hundred dollars to help him out. He was neverpunished or fined, or made to disconnect from anyone.IN TRUTH, the IRS was ill equipped to make a case in court that Scientology—orany other creed—was not a religion. Moreover, the commissioner of the IRS, FredT. Goldberg, Jr., had to balance the longing on the part of some of hisexecutives to destroy the church against the need to keep his resources, bothhuman and financial, from being sucked into the black hole that Scientology hadcreated.One afternoon in Washington, in October 1991, Miscavige and Rathbun were havinglunch at the Bombay Club, a swank Indian restaurant near the White House.Miscavige was fed up with the stalemate, which looked as if it could go onforever, in an endless stream of billable hours to the church’s attorneys. Atthe lunch, Miscavige announced to Gerald Feffer, one of their lawyers, “Martyand I are just going to bypass you entirely. We’re going to see Fred.”Feffer laughed at the thought that Miscavige would talk directly to thecommissioner.“I’m not joking,” Miscavige said. “Marty, do you want to go?”The two men hailed a cab after lunch and went to 1111 Constitution Avenue, theIRS headquarters, and announced to the security officer that they wanted to seethe commissioner.“Is he expecting you?”“No, but if you phone him on the intercom and tell him we are from the Church ofScientology, I’m sure he’d love to see us.”Within a few moments, several of the commissioner’s aides came down to thelobby. Miscavige told them that he wanted to bury the hatchet. He said he knewhow much hatred there was on each side, going back for decades, and that anintervention from the top was necessary. An hour later there was a call in theirhotel room saying the commissioner would see them the following week.In that first meeting with Goldberg, in a drab government conference room at agiant table, Miscavige, Rathbun, and Heber Jentzsch were facing about a dozenupper-level government bureaucrats, including the commissioner. The level ofdistrust between the negotiating parties was extreme, made even greater for theIRS representatives who knew that Scientologists had stolen documents andwiretapped meetings in that very building. Both sides had an incentive to bringthe hostilities to an end, however. Miscavige and Rathbun made their carefullyrehearsed presentation. Miscavige recited a litany of examples in which he feltthe IRS had singled out Scientology for unfair treatment. “Am I lying?” he wouldturn and ask Rathbun theatrically. Rathbun had a briefcase stuffed withdocuments obtained from the 2,300 Freedom of Information Act lawsuits the churchhad filed, or the countless public records that the church had combed through.Among the many internal memos the Scientologists had gathered was one theycalled the Final Solution document. It was the minutes of a meeting in 1974 ofseveral top IRS executives who were trying to define “religion” in a manner thatexcluded Scientology but not other faiths.Miscavige made it clear that the barrage of lawsuits lodged against the IRSwould come to an immediate halt if the church got what it wanted, which was anunqualified exemption for all of its activities. When Miscavige finished hispresentation, Goldberg called for a break, but he signaled to Rathbun to hangback. Goldberg asked him privately if the government settled, would Scientologyalso turn off the personal attacks in Freedom magazine?“Like a faucet,” Rathbun told him.Goldberg appointed his deputy commissioner, John Burke, who had no history withthe conflict, to oversee a lengthy review of Scientology’s finances andpractices. That process went on for two years. During that time, Rathbun andMiscavige commuted to Washington nearly every week, toting banker’s boxesstuffed with responses to the government’s queries. Two hundred Scientologistsin Los Angeles and New York were mobilized to go through the books of thechurch’s tangled bureaucracy. The odds against success were high; the courts hadrepeatedly sided with the IRS’s assertion that the Church of Scientology was acommercial enterprise. Miscavige and Rathbun were very much aware that thefuture of Scientology, if there was one, awaited the result of the IRS probe.Either the panel would rule against them, in which case the church’s taxliability for the previous two decades would destroy it, or they would fallunder the gracious protection of the freedom of religion clause of the FirstAmendment, in which case the Church of Scientology, and all its practices, wouldbe sheltered by the US Constitution.Overshadowing this debate was an incident that renewed the public concern aboutthe dangerousness of totalistic movements. In February 1993, agents for the USBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms tried to execute a search warrant on areligious commune a few miles east of Waco, Texas, that was run by a Christianapocalyptic group calling themselves the Branch Davidians. The leader, DavidKoresh, was stockpiling weapons, practicing polygamy, committing statutory rape,and was said to be physically abusing children, although that last charge wasnever proved. Following a shoot-out that caused the deaths of four governmentagents and six Branch Davidians, the FBI began a siege lasting nearly two monthsand culminating in a catastrophic blaze—broadcast all over the world—thatconsumed the entire compound. Seventy-five members of the sect died in the finalassault, including twenty-five children. The Waco siege threatened to create abacklash against all new religious movements. On the other hand, thegovernment’s handling of the siege, and the disastrous finale, provoked aninternational uproar. The hazards of unorthodox belief were clearly displayed,as were the limitations of police forces to understand and deal with fanaticalmovements.On October 8, more than a thousand Scientologists stood and cheered in the LosAngeles Sports Arena as Miscavige announced, “The war is over!” The IRS hadsettled with the church. Although the terms were secret, they were later leakedto the Wall Street Journal. Instead of the $1 billion bill for back taxes andpenalties that the church owed, Scientology agreed to pay just $12.5 million toresolve outstanding disputes; the church also agreed to stop the cascade oflawsuits against the agency. In return, the IRS dropped its investigations. “Themagnitude of this is greater than you can imagine,” Miscavige said that night atthe Sports Arena. He held up a thick folder of the letters of exemption forevery one of the church’s 150 American entities. The victory over the IRS wastotal, he explained. It gave Scientology financial advantages that were unusual,perhaps unique, among religions in the United States. For instance, schoolsusing Hubbard educational methods received tax exemption. Eighty percent ofindividual auditing on the part of members was now a tax-deductible expense. TwoScientology publishing houses that were solely dedicated to turning outHubbard’s books, including his commercial fiction, also gained the taxexemption. The church even gained the power to extend its tax exemption to anyof its future branches—“They will no longer need to apply to the IRS,” Miscavigemarveled. From now on, the church could make its own decisions about which ofits activities were exempt.“And what about all those battles and wars still being fought overseas?”Miscavige continued. “Well, there’s good news on that front, too.” In the past,he observed, foreign governments would say, “You are an American religion. Ifthe IRS doesn’t recognize you, why should we?” As a part of the settlement,Miscavige revealed, the agency agreed to send notices to every country in theworld, explaining what Scientology was. “It is very complete and very accurate,”Miscavige said of the government brochure. “How do I know? We wrote it!”Miscavige summed up the mood in the Sports Arena: “The future is ours.”A MONTH AFTER the church’s historic triumph over the IRS in 1993, Rathbun blew.He had come to see Miscavige in a different light during the two years theylabored over the tax case. The last six months of the tax case had beenparticularly arduous. During that period, he slept only about four hours anight. The former athlete was a physical wreck. “I’m only doing this for LRH,”he told himself, as he and Miscavige ate dinners together night after night inWashington and trudged back to the Four Seasons in Georgetown. “I’m not going tobe this guy’s bitch for the rest of my life.”No doubt the stress affected Miscavige as well. On the night of his big victoryspeech in the Sports Arena, Miscavige showed up for a run-through, but the stagemanager, Stefan Castle, was still fiddling with the cues for a complicated laserand pyrotechnic display. According to Castle, Miscavige stormed out into thearena and began to strangle him. Miscavige let him go before any real harm wasdone, but it was an alarming signal. Amy Scobee, head of the Celebrity Centre atthe time, also noted that Miscavige’s personality began to shift immediatelyafter the IRS decision, becoming more aggressive and hostile. At the party atthe Celebrity Centre following his speech, Miscavige rudely shoved her aside ashe entered. “You just want to get rid of me,” she remembers him saying.As far as Rathbun was concerned, it didn’t help that Miscavige scarcelyacknowledged him in the speech that night. Immediately after the event,reporters from The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times were calling Rathbunto ask about Miscavige’s salary, which had been disclosed in the IRS documents.Miscavige and his wife together were making more than $100,000 a year—not anextraordinary figure by the standards of world religious leaders, but quite acontrast to the $30 a week most of the Sea Org members were earning. Miscavigewas outraged by the impertinence of the reporters, and Rathbun felt that he wastaking it out on him. This was all coming at a time when he had been postponinga final visit to see his father, who was dying of cancer.The St. Petersburg Times published an editorial demanding that Congressinvestigate the tax-exemption decision. Rathbun was sent to Florida to turnaround the Times editorial board, who were not at all persuaded by hisarguments. Miscavige was furious that Rathbun failed to handle the situation.One evening, Shelly Miscavige called everyone in Rathbun’s office together, andin front of his subordinates she stripped the captain’s bars off his uniform.The next day, Rathbun took four gold Krugerrands that he had stored in a safe,got on his motorcycle, and drove to Yuma, Arizona. He called his father in LosAngeles from a bar, but a church official answered. He was waiting there withRathbun’s wife, Anne, who begged him to come back. Rathbun felt guilty andconflicted. Drinking steadily, he somehow made it to San Antonio, although hewas in frequent communication with church leaders. He finally agreed to callMiscavige, who apologized for his treatment. “You know the kind of pressure Iwas under. Please just see me,” the church leader said, adding that he could bein San Antonio in a matter of hours. “No, I want to see the Alamo,” Rathbun toldhim. They agreed to meet for dinner at the Marriott in New Orleans two dayslater.That evening, Miscavige showed a chastened, vulnerable side of himself thatRathbun had never seen before. According to Rathbun, Miscavige promised to“cease acting like a madman.” He praised Rathbun for his part in gaining the IRSexemption. “Because you did this,” he declared, “you’re Kha-Khan.” It was atitle that Hubbard had come up with in one of his policy letters for a highlyproductive staff member, but in the culture it was understood that such a personwould be forgiven for misdeeds in future lifetimes. Hubbard had awarded it toYvonne Gillham after she died. Rathbun knew that Miscavige was manipulating him,but he was touched nonetheless. As a further reward, Miscavige offered Rathbunthe opportunity to go to the Scientology ship, the Freewinds, and cruise theCaribbean for two years doing nothing but studying and training to be anauditor. Rathbun could finally obtain OT III. It was an offer he couldn’tresist.That was a rewarding time for Rathbun. But as soon as he got off the ship afterhis time away, Miscavige called him into his office and said, “I finally knowwho my SP is. The two years you were gone was the only unenturbulated time in mylife.” He ordered him to Clearwater, his rank broken, as a trainee. That didn’tlast, either. A number of tabloid sensations arose surrounding Scientologycelebrities—Lisa Marie Presley was divorcing Michael Jackson, Kirstie Alley wasdivorcing actor Parker Stevenson—and Miscavige again turned to Rathbun to coolthe press down.Then, on December 5, 1995, a Scientologist named Lisa McPherson died following amental breakdown. She had rear-ended a boat that was being towed in downtownClearwater, Florida, near the church’s spiritual headquarters. When paramedicsarrived, she stripped off her clothes and wandered naked down the street. Shesaid she needed help and was taken to a nearby hospital. Soon afterward, adelegation of ten Scientologists arrived at the hospital and persuaded McPhersonto check out, against doctors’ advice. McPherson spent the next seventeen daysunder guard in room 174 of the Fort Harrison Hotel.For Scientologists, McPherson’s mental breakdown presented a confoundingdilemma. McPherson had been declared Clear just three months before, after tenyears of courses and auditing and substantial contributions to the church. Theprocess had been like “a gopher being pulled through a garden hose,” she latersaid, but it had been worth it. “I am so full of life I am overwhelmed at thejoy of it all!” she wrote. “WOW!”Clears are supposed to be invulnerable to mental frailty. People on the baseknew that McPherson had been acting strangely before her breakdown. MartyRathbun, who was at Flag Base during this time, remembers seeing McPhersonscreaming in the hallways of the Fort Harrison Hotel, because she had just beendeclared Clear. “Aaaaaah! Yahoo!” she cried. She looked insane. How did she getto be Clear when she was obviously irrational? And who was responsible fordeciding that she had achieved that state? According to Rathbun and severalother former church officials who were present at the time, the case supervisorwho pronounced Lisa McPherson Clear was David Miscavige. He had gone to Flag inthe summer of 1995 to take over the auditing delivered at the base. He wouldalso supervise the treatment of McPherson that followed.4When McPherson entered room 174, she was a lovely, shapely young woman. Sheunderwent an Introspection Rundown, the same procedure that Hubbard haddeveloped on the Apollo two decades earlier to treat psychotic behavior. Itinvolved placing McPherson in solitary confinement and providing her with water,food, and vitamin supplements. All communication had to be in writing. Insteadof calming down, McPherson stopped eating. She screamed, she clawed herattendants, she spoke in gibberish, she fouled herself, she banged her headagainst the wall. Staff members strapped her down and tried to feed her with aturkey baster.On December 5, McPherson slipped into a coma. When church members decided totake her to the hospital that night, they bypassed the Morton Plant Hospital,just down the street, where McPherson had originally been seen, and drove herforty-five minutes away, passing four other hospitals, to the Columbia New PortRichey Hospital, where there was a doctor affiliated with the church. The womanthey finally wheeled into the emergency room was skeletally thin and coveredwith scratches, bruises, and dark brown lesions. She was also dead. She hadsuffered a pulmonary embolism on the way to the hospital. In the eyes of theworld press, Scientology had murdered Lisa McPherson. She was one of nineScientologists who had died under mysterious circumstances at the Clearwaterfacility.The night after McPherson died, Rathbun got word from church officials to waitfor a call at a pay phone at a nearby Holiday Inn. “Why aren’t you all over thismess?” Miscavige demanded, when Rathbun answered the call. “The police arepoking around. Do something.”Rathbun discovered that church officials in Clearwater had already lied in twosworn statements to the police, claiming that McPherson hadn’t been subjected toan Introspection Rundown. The church’s official response, under Rathbun’sdirection, was to continue to lie, stating that McPherson had been at thechurch’s Fort Harrison Hotel only for “rest and relaxation” and there wasnothing unusual about her stay. In the meantime, Rathbun went through the logsthat McPherson’s attendants had kept. As many as twenty people had been rotatingin and out of McPherson’s room; some of them were scratched and bruised fromtrying to subdue her; that was hardly the isolation and absolute silence andcalm that the Introspection Rundown called for. Rathbun noted that, among otherentries in the logs, one of the caretakers admitted that the situation was outof control and that McPherson needed to see a doctor. In the presence of aScientology lawyer, Rathbun handed several of the most incriminating logs to achurch executive, and said, “Lose ’em.”The McPherson case loomed over the church for five years, with an ongoing policeinvestigation, protests in front of Scientology facilities, lawsuits on the partof the family, and endless unwanted press. Embarrassing details emerged,including the fact that McPherson had spent $176,700 on Scientology services inher last five years, but she had died with only $11 in her savings account.Rathbun and Mike Rinder, the church’s spokesman, were responsible for managingthe situation, but Miscavige supervised every detail. The level of tension wasnearly unbearable.Rinder had the particularly unrewarding task of defending the church to thepublic. He was articulate and seemingly unflappable, and he had a talent fordisarming hostile interviewers. He had been a Scientologist since he was fiveyears old, in South Australia, when the religion was banned. He had sailed withHubbard aboard the Apollo. Few had a deeper experience of the religion than heand no one was more publicly identified with it. But even Rinder could not quellthe furor that arose from the McPherson affair.Perhaps because of Rinder’s lifelong service to the church, Miscavige saw him asa rival; or perhaps the leader’s frustration with the continual bad press madehis spokesperson a particular object of his wrath. At any rate, Marty Rathbungot a call from Shelly Miscavige around Christmas in 1997, the first year of theprotests over Lisa McPherson’s death. Rathbun was back at Gold Base. Shelly saidthat Dave wanted him to report to his quarters right away. Rathbun rushed downthe hill to Miscavige’s bungalow, where Shelly was waiting just outside thescreen door. A moment later, Mike Rinder, who had also been summoned, cameracing around the corner of the house. According to both men, the screen doorsuddenly flew open and Miscavige came out, wearing a terry-cloth bathrobe.According to Rathbun and Rinder, Miscavige hit Rinder in the face and stomach,then grabbed him around the neck and slammed him into a tree. Rinder fell intothe ivy, where Miscavige continued kicking him several times.5 Rathbun juststood there, stunned and puzzled about why he had been ordered to watch thisdisplay. Afterward, he decided that he was there to back up Miscavige in caseRinder had the nerve to resist. He was the “silent enforcer.”Rathbun’s management of the defense in the McPherson case was one of his mostsuccessful accomplishments for the church. The medical examiner in the case,Joan Wood, had vehemently denied the church’s assertion that Lisa McPherson’sillness and death were sudden. Her health had obviously deteriorated over a longperiod. She had been without liquids for at least five days, the medicalexaminer told a reporter, saying, “This is the most severe case of dehydrationI’ve ever seen.” She ruled that the cause of death was undetermined, and theState of Florida filed criminal charges against the church. If the church wereto be convicted of a felony, it could lead to the loss of its tax exemption andthen its probable extinction.Miscavige and his team brought to bear Scientology’s two greatest assets, moneyand celebrity. The church was building up a strong defense in its case by hiringsome of the most prestigious medical examiners and forensic scientists in thecountry—experts who questioned Joan Wood’s conclusion that the likely cause ofdeath was a blood clot caused by dehydration. One of the local lawyers retainedby the church arranged a personal meeting between Miscavige and Wood’s attorney,Jeffrey Goodis. Miscavige and Rathbun made a number of presentations to Goodis,trying to persuade him that his client was in legal jeopardy because of herruling in the McPherson case. Wood was known as an unflappable witness and aformidable opponent to defense attorneys; her testimony would be crucial if thecase went to trial. Rathbun says that Miscavige repeatedly warned Goodis thatthe church was going to discredit his client and sue her “into the Stone Age.”Four months before the McPherson case was set to go to trial, Joan Wood changedher ruling to say that McPherson’s death was “accidental.” The State’s casecollapsed, charges against the church were dropped, and Wood avoided a lawsuit.Wood retired and became a recluse. She told the St. Petersburg Times that shesuffered panic attacks and insomnia. (She died of a stroke in 2011.)The civil case against the church on the part of McPherson’s family continued,however, along with the negative publicity. Tom De Vocht, who was head of theFlag Land Base in Clearwater, says he arranged a meeting with Mary Repper, aninfluential political consultant who had led the campaigns of many of the stateand local officials in the area, including the state attorney who had filed thecriminal charges against the church. Repper had the reputation of beinganti-Scientology, but she agreed to have lunch with Rinder, Rathbun, andMiscavige at the Fort Harrison Hotel. It turned out that she was a fan of thesoap-opera star Michelle Stafford, who was a Scientologist. Repper was invitedto Los Angeles to meet her at a Celebrity Centre gala. When she returned, Repperbegan hosting a series of dinners and lunches for local officials to meet otherScientology celebrities. Tom Cruise dropped by Repper’s house on severaloccasions to enjoy her famous coconut cake and schmooze with local officialsincluding the mayor of Tampa and influential lawyers and judges. He showed clipsof his movies and testified about how Scientology had changed his life. Fox Newshost Greta van Susteren provided sunset cruises on her yacht. Repper held abrunch for Michelle Stafford; the guests were mainly women who were fans of TheYoung and the Restless, including the secretaries of local judges. Meantime, thechurch threw black-tie galas in the ballroom of the Fort Harrison Hotel, whereEdgar Winter, Chick Corea, or Isaac Hayes would perform. The Pinellas Countysheriff attended these events, along with the mayors of Clearwater and Tampa, aswell as a number of lawyers and judges who had been targeted by the church ascommunity leaders. Rathbun says that when Miscavige learned that Jeffrey Goodisand his wife were big fans of John Travolta, they were invited to a gala at theFort Harrison Hotel, and Travolta was asked to thank them for their help.Rathbun says the star was told, “This guy is really going to bat for us.”The church poured money into local charities. According to Rathbun and Rinder,the idea was to change the climate of public opinion and thereby influence theattitude of the courts toward the church. Rathbun says there was a parallelcampaign to discredit Lisa McPherson’s family as golddiggers who were exploitingtheir daughter’s death.In a recent deposition, Rathbun estimated that the entire campaign to shut downthe prosecution of the church cost over $20 to $30 million. (The civil suitbrought by the family settled for an undisclosed sum in 2004.)SCIENTOLOGY WAS UNDER ATTACK elsewhere in the world as well. Germany, acutelysensitive to the danger of extremist movements, viewed Scientology withparticular alarm. In Hamburg, in 1992, the state parliament created a commissionto investigate “destructive groups,” a category that included the Church ofSatan, Transcendental Meditation, and the Unification Church, but was mainlyaimed at Scientology. Scientologists were barred from holding government jobsand forbidden to join Germany’s main political party, the Christian DemocraticUnion, because they weren’t considered Christians. The youth wing of the partyorganized boycotts of Cruise’s first Mission: Impossible and Travolta’s moviePhenomenon. The city of Stuttgart canceled a concert by Chick Corea when it wasdiscovered that he was a Scientologist. Seventy percent of Germans favored theidea of banning the organization altogether.The 1990s saw the rise of apocalyptic movements in many different countries. Asthe millennium drew near, the theme of science fiction and UFOs becameespecially pronounced and deadly. In October 1994, police in Switzerland,investigating a fire in a farmhouse, discovered a hidden room with eighteencorpses wearing ceremonial garments, arranged like spokes in a wheel. Otherbodies were found elsewhere on the farm. Their heads were covered with plasticbags; some had been shot or beaten. The next day, three chalets burned inanother Swiss village. Investigators found more than two dozen bodies in theruins. They had been poisoned. Some of the dead had been lured to the scene andmurdered, but most were followers of Joseph Di Mambro, a French jeweler, who hadcreated a new religion, the Order of the Solar Temple. Di Mambro’s chieflieutenant, a charismatic Belgian obstetrician named Luc Journet, preached thatafter death the members would be picked up by a spaceship and reunited on thestar Sirius. Like Hubbard, Journet had been influenced by Aleister Crowley andthe Ordo Templi Orientis. A year after these macabre incidents, the burnedcorpses of sixteen other members of the group were found in Grenoble, France;then, in 1997, five more members of the order burned themselves to death inQuebec, making a total of seventy-four deaths. In contrast to the BranchDavidians or the followers of Jim Jones, who were predominantly lower class, themembers of the Solar Temple were affluent, well-educated members of thecommunities they lived in, with families and regular jobs, and yet they hadgiven themselves over to a mystical science-fiction fantasy that turned theminto killers, suicides, or helpless victims.In March 1995, adherents of a Japanese movement called Aum Shinrikyo (“SupremeTruth”) attacked five subway trains in Tokyo with sarin gas. Twelve commutersdied; thousands more might have if the gas had been more highly refined. It waslater discovered that this was just one of at least fourteen attacks the groupstaged in order to set off a chain of events intended to result in anapocalyptic world war. The leader of the group, Shoko Asahara, a blind yogainstructor, combined the tenets of Buddhism with notions drawn from IsaacAsimov’s Foundation Trilogy, which depicts a secretive group of scientists whoare preparing to take over the world. Many of Asahara’s followers were indeedscientists and engineers from top Japanese universities who were enchanted bythis scheme. They purchased military hardware in the former Soviet Union andsought to acquire nuclear warheads. When that failed, they bought a sheep farmin Western Australia that happened to be atop a rich vein of uranium. Theycultivated chemical and biological weapons, such as anthrax, Ebola virus,cyanide, and VX gas. They had used such agents in previous attacks, but failedto create the kind of mass slaughter they hoped would bring on civil war andnuclear Armageddon. Still, Aum exposed the narrow boundary between religiouscultism and terror, which would soon become more obvious with the rise ofal-Qaeda. A spokesperson for the Church of Scientology in New Zealand explainedthat the source of Aum Shinrikyo’s crimes was the practice of psychiatry inJapan.Just as the debate in Germany was coming to a climax, in March 1997, thirty-ninemembers of a group calling itself Heaven’s Gate committed suicide in a San Diegomansion. They apparently had hoped to time their deaths in order to ascend to aspacecraft that they believed was following Comet Hale-Bopp. MarshallApplewhite, their leader, a former choirmaster, represented himself as areincarnated Jesus who was receiving guidance from the television show StarTrek.Although Scientology has persecuted its critics and defectors, it has neverengaged in mass murder or suicides; however, the public anxiety surroundingthese sensational events added to the rancor and fear that welled up in Germany.Could Scientology also turn violent? There were elements mixed into thesevarious groups that resembled some features of Scientology—magical beliefs andscience fiction being the most obvious. Past lives were a common theme. Like AumShinrikyo, Scientology has ties to Buddhist notions of enlightenment and Hindubeliefs in karma and reincarnation. Structurally, Aum Shinrikyo was the mostsimilar to Scientology, having both a public membership and a cloistered clergy,like the Sea Org, called renunciates, who carried out directives that the largerorganization knew little or nothing about. When the attacks on the subway tookplace, Aum’s membership in Japan was estimated to be about 10,000, with anadditional 30,000 in Russia, and some scattered pockets worldwide, withresources close to $1 billion—figures that compare with some estimates ofScientology today. What separated these groups from Scientology was theirorientation toward apocalypse and their yearning for the end-time. That hasnever been a feature of Scientology. Clearly, however, the lure of totalisticreligious movements defies easy categorization. Such groups can arise anywhereand spread like viruses, and it is impossible to know which ones will turnlethal, or why.Both the German government and the Scientologists viewed their struggle throughthe prism of Germany’s Nazi past. Ursula Caberta, the head of the Hamburganti-Scientology task force, compared Hubbard’s Introduction to ScientologyEthics to Adolf Hitler’s Mein Kampf: “Hitler was thinking that the Aryans weregoing to rule the world, the untermenschen. The philosophy of L. Ron Hubbard isthe same.” In response to such statements, in January 1997 a group of Hollywoodcelebrities, agents, lawyers, and movie executives published a full-page openletter to Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the International Herald Tribune. “Hitlermade religious intolerance official government policy,” the letter stated. “Inthe 1930s it was the Jews. Today it is the Scientologists.” The letter comparedthe boycotts of Cruise, Travolta, and Corea to Nazi book-burnings. The letterwas written and paid for by Bertram Fields, then the most powerful lawyer inHollywood, whose clients included Travolta and Cruise. None of the thirty-foursignatories of the document were Scientologists, but many were Jews. Most ofthem—such as Oliver Stone, Dustin Hoffman, and Goldie Hawn—had worked with thetwo stars or were friends or clients of Fields.Entertainment Tonight sent the actress Anne Archer, a well-known Scientologist,to Germany on a “fact-finding mission.” She later testified before the USCongress, as did other Scientology celebrities—Travolta, Corea, and IsaacHayes—about the suppression of religious freedom in Germany. “Individuals andbusinesses throughout Germany are routinely required to sign a declaration,referred to as a ‘sect filter,’ swearing that they are not Scientologists,”Travolta told Congress. “Failure to sign means that companies will not hirethem, trade unions will not admit them, they will not be permitted to joinsocial groups, banks will not open accounts for them, and they are even excludedfrom sports clubs, solely because of their religion.”In April, John Travolta met with President Bill Clinton at a conference onvolunteerism in Philadelphia. It was a freighted moment for the president, sinceTravolta was portraying a character based on him in the forthcoming moviePrimary Colors. “He said he wanted to help me out with the situation inGermany,” Travolta later said. “He had a roommate years ago who was aScientologist and had really liked him, and respected his views on it. He saidhe felt we were given an unfair hand in that country, and that he wanted to fixit.” Clinton set up a meeting for Travolta and Cruise with Sandy Berger, hisnational security advisor, who was given the additional assignment of being theadministration’s “Scientology point person.”None of this had any effect on Travolta’s character in the film, as the moviehad already been shot, nor on Germany’s policy toward the church, which refusedto recognize Scientology as a religion or allow members to join politicalparties. However, the US State Department began pressuring the German governmenton behalf of Scientology. The Germans were puzzled that their Americancounterparts seemed not to know or care about the church’s RPF camps, which theGermans called penal colonies, and the reported practices of confinement, forcedconfessions, and punishing physical labor, which they said amounted tobrainwashing. There was a belief within the German cabinet that the church’sreal goal was to infiltrate the government and create a Scientology superstate.“This is not a church or a religious organization,” the labor minister, NorbertBlum, told Maclean’s magazine. “Scientology is a machine for manipulating humanbeings.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Behar says that a private investigator, posing as a distraught parent, calledhim and begged for help with a child who had gone into Scientology. Behar hadreferred the caller to the Cult Awareness Network. He says he never advisedkidnapping. The private investigator taped the conversation, and Behar’sattorneys subpoenaed the tape for his defense in the lawsuit brought by thechurch.2 Cruise, through his attorney, denies that he ever retreated from hiscommitment to Scientology.3 A spokesperson for Time categorically denied this charge.4 According to a church spokesperson, “Mr. Miscavige was not involved in anyaspect of Ms. McPherson’s spiritual progress in Scientology.”5 The church denies that Miscavige has abused any members of the church, sayingthat the abuse claims have been propagated by a “group of vociferousanti-Scientologists.”"},{"pageContent":"8[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_L02_r1.jpg]BOHEMIAN RHAPSODYPaul Haggis and Deborah Rennard married in 1997, soon after Paul’s divorce fromDiane became final. Paul was still seeking joint custody of his three daughters.Without consulting him, Diane had taken Lauren and Katy out of the DelphiAcademy, apparently intending to enroll them in public school. Paul and Dianewere ordered by the court to undergo psychiatric evaluation, a procedure thatScientology abhors. In December 1998, the court surprised everyone by awardingPaul full custody of his daughters. According to court records, the rulingfollowed the discovery that the girls were not enrolled in school at all.The girls were stunned. They had watched the hostilities through Diane’s eyes.No one had prepared them for the possibility that they might be taken fromher—until then, it had been the three girls and their mother against the world.The girls thought the decision was unbalanced and unfairly influenced by thefact that their father had more money. Alissa vowed she would never speak to himagain.Haggis was also caught short by the court’s decision. In addition to theyear-old son, James, he had with Deborah, he suddenly had two teenage daughterson his hands as well. (Alissa was twenty-one at the time, and lived on her own.)The girls felt uprooted and they missed the emotional support of their mother.They didn’t resent Deborah; actually, they appreciated her advocacy and the wayshe balanced out Paul. Still, it was a difficult adjustment for everyone.Paul put the girls in a private school, but that lasted only six months. Theyweren’t entirely comfortable talking to people who weren’t Scientologists, andbasic things like multiple-choice tests were unfamiliar. They demanded to besent to a boarding institution on an isolated hilltop near Sheridan, Oregon,called the Delphian School—or the “mother school,” as it was known toScientologists.Alissa had gone there when she was fourteen years old. It had been a mixedexperience for her. She had brought a copy of The Autobiography of Malcolm X andbooks of eighteenth-century poetry, a CD of great speeches by Lincoln and MartinLuther King, and a pack of tarot cards. Although she loved the school, she neverfelt she fit in with the other kids. They wanted to talk about boys and popculture, and she was more interested in philosophy and religion. But Delphianwas just what Lauren needed. She got intensive tutoring to help her overcome hereducational deficits; however, she also began to come up against some of theconstraints of her church.While she was at Delphian, Lauren decided to write a paper about religiousintolerance. In particular, she felt that Scientology was under attack and shecouldn’t understand why. When she went online to see what the opposition wassaying, a fellow student turned her in to Ethics. Lauren was told thatScientologists shouldn’t look at negative stories about their religion. She wassupposed to be saving the planet, so why was she wasting her time reading lies?Because of her isolation, and the censorship imposed on her education, whenLauren finally graduated from high school, at the age of twenty, she had neverheard anyone speak ill of Scientology, nor did she question the ban on researchabout her religion. She thought, “I guess I’m not supposed to do these things. Iwill stay away.” Like her father, she learned it was easier not to look.Alissa had a different issue. She didn’t really date in high school, and by thetime she got to junior college it began to dawn on her that she was gay. Sheactually wasn’t sure what that meant. She had two uncles who were gay, but forthe longest time she didn’t know what a lesbian was. Then her sister Katy, whois five years younger, and had grown up in the Internet-savvy culture, came outto her parents. Paul told Katy that there was no way that he would ever love herless. That made it easier for Alissa to talk about what she was discoveringabout herself. The vow never to speak to her father again began to lose its holdon her.All the girls had grown up hearing prejudiced remarks from people in the churchwho saw homosexuality as an “aberration” that undermined the survival of thespecies; gays themselves were seen as sinister perverts. These attitudes wereinformed by Hubbard’s writings on the subject. But it wasn’t just Scientology,Alissa realized; the entire society was biased against homosexuals. In her earlytwenties, Alissa finally found the courage to come out to her father. “Oh, yeah,I already knew that,” he told her. He said he wondered why she had ever datedboys in the first place.“You knew?” she said. “I didn’t know! How did you know? Why didn’t you tell me?You could have clued me in. It would have made it easier for me.”That was so typical of her father. He was maddening in that way, completelyaccepting but disengaged, as if it really didn’t matter one way or the other.To signify her newfound identity, Alissa got a tattoo of her favorite Latinpoem, the opening line of Carmen 5 by Catullus: “Vivamus mea Lesbia, atqueamemus” (Let us live, my Lesbia, and let us love). It snaked all the way downher left arm.EVER SINCE the Time exposé, the church had been frantically trying to recoverTom Cruise. Both Cruise and Nicole Kidman were attaining ever greater success;Cruise became the first actor to star in five consecutive films to gross morethan $100 million in the United States, including Jerry Maguire and the firstMission: Impossible; Kidman was also gaining international renown with her rolesin Batman Forever and To Die For. They gave the impression that they wereputting Scientology behind them.In 1996, Marty Rathbun had gone to Los Angeles to audit Cruise, but that onesession went nowhere. According to Rathbun, Miscavige blamed Nicole Kidman, andviewed her as a gold digger who was faking Scientology. He says that Miscavigewas hopeful that if they portrayed Nicole Kidman as a Suppressive Person, Cruisecould be peeled away from her.It was two years before Cruise agreed to go through another bout of auditing.This time, strict secrecy was imposed. Worried about scaring off the tentativestar, Rathbun arranged the sessions so that even top officials in the churchwere unaware that Cruise was receiving services. For five days in October 1998,Cruise drove into a private parking lot in the back of the historic GuarantyBuilding on Hollywood Boulevard, with the yellow Scientology sign atop it thatlooms over the fabled district. Charlie Chaplin and Rudolph Valentino used tohave their offices here. Now the lobby is a shrine to the life and works of L.Ron Hubbard. A giant bust of the founder greets the occasional visitor. Embeddedin the sidewalk in front of the building are the stars of bygone celebrities onthe Hollywood Walk of Fame—Otto Kruger, Tony Martin, Ann Rutherford, RichardCarlson, Jetta Goudal, Paul Winchell—who had their own moments of great renownand are now largely forgotten.Cruise went in a back door that led to a basement hallway. There was an elevatorat the end of the hallway that went directly to the “secret” eleventh floor,where both Miscavige and Rathbun maintained offices. The World Series was underway—New York versus San Diego—and Cruise wore his Yankees hat. “He was not ingood shape, spiritually or mentally,” Rathbun observed. “He was personally veryenturbulated.”After that episode of auditing, Cruise went quiet again. He and Kidman were inEngland filming Eyes Wide Shut for Stanley Kubrick. In any case, Rathbun andMiscavige had their hands full, fending off the lawsuits and reporters swirlingaround the McPherson case. Rathbun said that, in January 2001, he got a callfrom Cruise asking for help. Cruise said that he and Kidman were finished.Cruise never offered a public explanation for the divorce, and Kidman herselfwas clearly surprised by his decision. She later revealed that she had suffereda miscarriage two months after Cruise moved out, and she had asked the doctorsto preserve samples of the fetus’s DNA to prove that Cruise was the father. Shepleaded with him to undergo marriage counseling at the church. Cruise refused,publicly declaring, “Nic knows exactly why we are getting a divorce.”This was a decisive moment in Cruise’s relationship with Scientology. Rathbunprovided the star with more than two hundred hours of auditing over the nextcouple of years. From July through Thanksgiving, 2001, Rathbun was with Cruiseat the Celebrity Centre frequently, doing auditing rundowns and the PTS/SP(Potential Trouble Source/Suppressive Persons) course. He paired Cruise withanother actor, Jason Beghe, to do training drills; for instance, Beghe wouldthink of a hypothetical date, which Cruise had to figure out, using the E-Meter,an exercise Cruise found really frustrating.A young man named Tommy Davis began acting as Rathbun’s assistant. He broughtsandwiches and helped out with Cruise’s children, making sure they werereceiving church services. Despite his youth, Davis was already a unique figurein the church: He was a second-generation Scientologist, a Sea Org member, andthe scion of the Hollywood elite. His mother was Anne Archer, a talented andpopular actress who had starred in a number of movies, including Patriot Gamesand Fatal Attraction, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award. She hadbeen a deeply committed Scientologist since she began studying with MiltonKatselas at the Beverly Hills Playhouse in her twenties. She had always beenproud to associate herself with Scientology in public, speaking at innumerableevents on behalf of the church. Her son Tommy embodied the aspiration of thechurch to establish itself in the Hollywood community; indeed, he was livingproof that it had done so. He had known Cruise since he was eighteen years old,so it was natural that he soon became the church’s liaison with the star,reporting directly to Shelly Miscavige. He had a relationship with Cruisesimilar to the one that Spanky Taylor once enjoyed with John Travolta. Rathbunassigned Davis to sit with Cruise in the parking lot of Home Depot in Hollywoodwhile the star was doing his Tone Scale drills—guessing the emotional state ofrandom people coming out of the store.Cruise then took a break to promote his movie Vanilla Sky. The followingFebruary through April 2002, Cruise and Rathbun were once again working togetherfull-time, mostly at Gold Base. Cruise was preparing for his role in The LastSamurai, directed by Ed Zwick, and between sessions with Rathbun he would gointo the courtyard to practice his swordplay.Cruise had begun dating the Spanish actress Penélope Cruz, and in the fall of2001 Rathbun began auditing her as well. At the same time, he was still actingas Nicole Kidman’s Ethics Officer in the church, even though she and Cruise wereengaged in a bitter divorce proceeding. One of the issues was whether thechildren would be educated in schools using the Hubbard method, which Kidmanopposed. That was another battle she lost. Although Tom and Nicole split custodyof their children, both Isabella and Connor soon chose to live exclusively withtheir father. Rathbun says this was because the Scientology staff, especiallyTommy Davis, quietly worked to turn the children against Kidman. “Tommy toldthem over and over again their mother was a sociopath and after a while theybelieved him,” he recalled. “They had daily sessions with Tommy. I was there. Isaw it.”According to several former Sea Org members, Rathbun’s auditing sessions withCruise were videotaped. Tom De Vocht, a former church official, said Miscavigewould watch them and then regale his inner circle, over his nightly whiskey,with stories of Cruise’s confessions, dwelling especially on his sex life.1Rathbun was opposed to the endless courtship of Cruise. In his opinion, therewas no need for it once Cruise was securely back on the Bridge. Rathbun toldMiscavige, “I think I’m done with this guy.” Miscavige responded, “He’ll be donewhen he calls me.” The leader was galled by the fact that Cruise had nevercontacted him when he came back for counseling. Rathbun continually urged Cruiseto call “COB,” as Miscavige is known in the church—Chairman of the Board. At onepoint Cruise asked for Miscavige’s number, but then failed to call. Histentativeness was worrisome.Whatever restraint Cruise felt about Miscavige eventually fell away, however,and Miscavige was once again folded into the star’s inner circle. There weremovie nights in Cruise’s mansion. Miscavige flew with Cruise in the WarnerBrothers jet to a test screening of The Last Samurai in Arizona. The two menbecame closer than ever. Cruise later said of Miscavige, “I have never met amore competent, a more intelligent, a more compassionate being outside of what Ihave experienced from LRH. And I’ve met the leaders of leaders. I’ve met themall.”Cruise’s renewed dedication to Scientology permanently changed the relationshipbetween the church and the Hollywood celebrity community. Cruise poured millionsof dollars into the church—$3 million in 2004 alone. He was not simply afigurehead; he was an activist with an international following. He could takethe church into places it had never been before. Whenever Cruise traveled abroadto promote his movies, he used the opportunity to lobby foreign leaders andAmerican ambassadors to promote Scientology. Davis usually accompanied him onthese diplomatic and lobbying missions. Cruise repeatedly consulted with formerPresident Clinton, lobbying him to get Prime Minister Tony Blair’s help ingetting the Church of Scientology declared a tax-deductible charitableorganization in the United Kingdom. Rathbun was present for one telephone callin which Clinton advised Cruise he would be better served by contacting Blair’swife, Cherie, rather than the prime minister, because she was a lawyer and“would understand the details.” Later, Cruise went to London, where he met witha couple of Blair’s representatives, although nothing came of those efforts. In2003, he met with Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and Vice PresidentDick Cheney’s chief of staff, Scooter Libby, to express the church’s concernsover its treatment in Germany. Cruise had access to practically anyone in theworld.That same year, Cruise and Davis lobbied Rod Paige, the secretary of educationduring the first term of President George W. Bush, to endorse Hubbard’s studytech educational methods. Paige had been impressed. For months, Cruise kept incontact with Paige’s office, urging that Scientology techniques be folded intothe president’s No Child Left Behind program. One day Cruise flew his littlered-and-white-striped Pitts Special biplane, designed for aerobatics, to Hemet,along with his Scientologist chief of staff, Michael Doven. Miscavige andRathbun picked them up and drove them to Gold Base. Rathbun was in the backseatand recalls Cruise boasting to COB about his talks with the secretary.“Bush may be an idiot,” Miscavige observed, “but I wouldn’t mind his being ourConstantine.”Cruise agreed. “If fucking Arnold can be governor, I could be president.”Miscavige responded, “Well, absolutely, Tom.”2IN 2001, Haggis was fired from Family Law, the show he had created. His career,which for so long seemed to be a limitless staircase toward fame and fortune,now took a plunge. He began working at home.Within a week, he started writing a movie script called Million Dollar Baby,based on a series of short stories by F. X. Toole. He spent a year working onit, drawing upon some of his own painful memories. He identified with thecharacter of a sour old boxing coach, Frankie Dunn. Like Haggis, Frankie isestranged from his daughter. His letters to her are returned. He turns toreligion, going to Mass every day and seeking a forgiveness that he doesn’treally believe in. Into the coach’s dismal life comes another young woman,Maggie Fitzgerald, an aspiring boxer from a white trash background. All of theloss and longing he feels for his daughter is apparent in his mentoring of thisgritty young fighter, who has more faith in him than he has in himself. ButMaggie is paralyzed when her neck is broken in a fight. In a climactic moment,she begs Frankie to pull the plug and let her die. Haggis faced a similar choicein real life with his best friend, who was brain-dead from a staph infection.“They don’t die easily,” he recalled. “Even in a coma, he kicked and moaned fortwelve hours.”Haggis dreamed of directing the movie himself. But as much as studios admiredthe writing, the story was so dark nobody wanted to get near it. Haggis beganborrowing money to stay afloat. He turned down another TV series because herealized that his heart hadn’t been in television for years.One of his abandoned TV projects still haunted him. The idea sprang from anunsettling incident a decade before, when he and Diane were driving home fromthe premiere of Silence of the Lambs. Paul was wearing a tuxedo and driving aPorsche convertible. He stopped at a Blockbuster Video store on WilshireBoulevard to rent some obscure Dutch film. When they got back into the car, twoyoung black men with guns suddenly rushed up to them. The robbers ordered themout of the car and told them to walk toward a dark parking lot. That seemed likea really bad idea. Haggis pretended not to hear them. He put Diane in front ofhim and headed down Wilshire instead.“Stop!”Paul and Diane froze. They heard footsteps, and one of the thieves snatched thevideo out of Diane’s hand. Then the Porsche roared off. That was the last Haggisever saw of it.Ten years later, Haggis awakened in the middle of the night and began chewingover this frightening episode once again. He often thought about it. The entireexperience had lasted less than a minute, but it had colored his stance towardlife in complicated ways. Where did these kids come from? They were living inthe same city as he, but a universe of race and class separated them. He couldimagine who he was in their eyes, just some rich white guy with much more thanhis share of what life had to offer. In a way, Haggis was on their side. But itcould have turned out so much worse; guns always make things dangerouslyunpredictable. He was shaken by that thought. The unexpected coda of snatchingthe rented videotape was intriguing. Haggis had managed a wisecrack to the copsat the time. “I think you’ll discover that these men have been here quite often,looking for that video, and it was never in.”Specifically, what he thought about in the middle of the night was what thosekids said to each other as they sped out of the Blockbuster parking lot ontoWilshire in his pearlescent Cabriolet. Could he find himself in them? Haggis gotout of bed and began writing. By mid-morning he had a lengthy outline. It wasabout the manifold ways that people interact with each other—how the experienceof having someone honk at you in traffic and shoot you the finger can affectyour mood, so that you take it out on someone else at the first opportunity; orhow, alternatively, someone lets you into a long line of traffic, and your daybrightens. He saw life in America as a volatile collision of cultures—ofimmigrants who fail to read the codes that underlie our system, of races thatresent and mistrust each other, of people coexisting in different social stratawho look at each other with uncomprehending fear and hatred.He had shopped the proposal around to different television producers, but theyunanimously passed on it. Now, as he was struggling financially andartistically, Deborah suggested he consider writing the script as a movie.“You’ll win an Academy Award,” she told him.Haggis contacted his friend Robert Moresco, who had been a writer on Haggis’sseries EZ Streets. He told Moresco, “I don’t think anybody’s going to make this,but it’s a great story.” The two men began working in Haggis’s home office, nextto the laundry room. They wrote a first draft in two weeks. Haggis decided tocall it Crash.The title refers to a fender bender that sets off a chain of events, revealingthe contradictory elements of the characters and the city they inhabit. In thedizzying seconds after the collision an LAPD detective suddenly realizes what’smissing in his life. “It’s the sense of touch,” he says in the movie’s openinglines. “In LA no one touches you.… We’re always behind metal and glass. Think wemiss that touch so much, we crash into each other just to feel something.”Haggis insists on turning his heroes into villains and vice versa, such as theracist white cop who molests a tony, upper-class black woman in one scene, thensaves her life in another. Haggis felt that by exploring such complexities hewas teasing out the dark and light threads of his own personality.For the next year and a half, he struggled to get the movie green-lit. He wasstill a first-time movie director, and that posed an obstacle. Moreover, thescript called for an ensemble cast with no single starring role—always anobstacle in Hollywood. Haggis finally interested a producer, Bob Yari, whoagreed to make the movie for $10 million if Haggis could assemble a star-studdedcast.Don Cheadle was the first to sign on, both as an actor and a producer, and hisname added credibility to the project. Matt Dillon and Tony Danza came aboard.Heath Ledger and John Cusack agreed to work for scale, as everyone did. Still,the project dragged on. Finally, Haggis was told the movie was a go. He thensent the script to John Travolta and Kelly Preston, who he thought would beperfect as the district attorney and his wife.“That’s great, because now we really need them,” one of the producers, CathySchulman, told him the next day. Heath Ledger had dropped out and Cusack was notfar behind. Once again, the movie would need more big-name stars to get thefinancing. Haggis immediately sent a note to Preston, telling her he waswithdrawing his offer. As a matter of pride, he felt it was wrong to use hisfriends in such a way—especially other Scientologists. Preston was miffed, sincehe had failed to explain his decision.[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_015_r1.jpg]Priscilla Presley, John Travolta, and Kelly Preston at the Church of ScientologyCelebrity Centre’s thirty-seventh-anniversary gala, Hollywood, August 2006But without two more signature names the movie was back in limbo. Haggis wasabout to lose Cheadle as well, because he was scheduled to make Hotel Rwanda.Yari finally told Haggis to shut the production down.The following Monday, when Schulman came into the production office, she foundHaggis there, alone.“What are you doing?” she asked.“I’m prepping the movie.”Yari agreed to keep the office open for one more week, and then another, as eachMonday Schulman would find Haggis at work preparing for a movie that now had nobudget at all. Gradually, other people began working with him, for no pay.“If you get Sandy Bullock, you got a green light,” Schulman told him.Haggis got Sandra Bullock for the role of the district attorney’s wife, abrittle, racist socialite, a role far from the plucky gamines she had played inthe past. In the movie, she’s the one who gets carjacked at gunpoint. But theproducers wanted one more name: Brendan Fraser. Haggis thought he was much tooyoung for the part, as did Fraser, but he agreed to do it. The movie was finallygreen-lit, just four weeks before the shooting started. Only now, the tenmillion dollars had shrunk to six and a half.For Haggis, everything was riding on this film. He mortgaged his house threetimes; he also used it as a set, in order to save on his location budget. Hecanceled many of the exterior scenes and borrowed the set of the television showMonk to film interiors. He was eating carelessly and smoking constantly. He lostweight. He desperately needed more time.When he finished shooting a scene in Chinatown, Cathy Schulman caught up withhim to ask about the next day’s shoot. “You look like you’re clutching yourchest,” she observed.Haggis admitted that he was having some pains.“Sharp pains?” Schulman urged him to see a doctor. He didn’t want to hear that.He went home.He woke the next morning in agony. He called his doctor, who told him it wasprobably stress, but agreed to see him just to set his mind at ease. By now,Paul was short of breath, so Deborah drove him to the doctor’s office. Thedoctor did a few tests and said yes, it was stress and muscle fatigue. “Butwe’ll do an electrocardiogram just in case.”A few moments later the doctor returned. His face was snow white. “Don’t standup!” he said in a professionally measured voice. “You’ve had a heart attack!”That night in the hospital, Haggis suffered another cardiac failure. He receivedthree stents in the arteries to his heart in an emergency operation. He was ableto watch the entire procedure on the monitor. It was really like an out-of-bodyexperience, watching his own fragile heart being repaired. The movie he wasmaking didn’t seem so important anymore.That changed as soon as the operation was over.Schulman arrived with some more bad news. “I talked to your doctor,” she toldHaggis. “He’s not going to allow you to go back to work for another four or fivemonths. I’ve got to hire another director.”“Fine,” Haggis responded. He said he’d talk it over with his doctor.The doctor confirmed the decision. “Paul, it’s not just your heart attack,” hetold him. “You’ve had an operation. It’ll put too much stress on your heart.”“I totally understand,” Haggis replied. “Let me ask you how much stress youthink I would be experiencing if I were just sitting at home while anotherdirector is finishing my fucking film!”Production was shut down for a week and a half until Haggis returned, with anurse at his side who checked his vital signs every quarter hour. Sandra Bullockbrought him green tea and refused to let him drink coffee. Every time Haggistried to stand up, she told him to sit down. She had a kind of implacablematernal authority. He finished the film in his chair with a cup of tea in hishands.Clint Eastwood had been asked to read Million Dollar Baby for the role ofFrankie Dunn, the boxing coach. He loved the script, but said he would only dothe role if he could direct as well. Although Haggis hated to surrender theopportunity to direct, he knew it would be a bigger picture if Eastwood werebehind it. Hilary Swank was cast as Maggie Fitzgerald, a part that would bringher an Academy Award. Morgan Freeman also would win in a supporting role, andEastwood for directing—all that in addition to winning the Oscar for BestPicture. Haggis would be nominated for Best Screenplay. But that was still onthe horizon.While he was still editing Crash, Haggis began writing another movie forEastwood, Flags of Our Fathers. They went to visit the producer of that project,Steven Spielberg, on the set of War of the Worlds, which he was shooting withTom Cruise. Spielberg had called Haggis to talk over an idea for another script.Haggis had met Cruise on a couple of occasions, once at a fund-raiser and againat the Celebrity Centre. As the most popular and sought-after leading man inHollywood, Cruise was given perks that few other stars could match. He had askedTommy Davis, now his full-time Scientology handler, to set up a tent on the setof War of the Worlds in order to distribute church materials to the crew andprovide Scientology assists. The precedent alarmed many in Hollywood, andSpielberg was widely criticized for letting it happen.“It’s really remarkable to me,” Spielberg observed, as he and Haggis walked tohis trailer. “I’ve met all these Scientologists, and they seem like the nicestpeople.”“Yeah, we keep all the evil ones in the closet,” Haggis replied.3A couple of days later, Tommy Davis called Haggis at home and told him someonefrom senior management needed to see him urgently. Haggis had no idea what wasgoing on. He assumed that the church was going to pressure him to take some moreauditing or another course, as had happened so often in the past. Davis met himat the Celebrity Centre and escorted him to a room where Greg Wilhere waswaiting. Wilhere, a handsome former college football player, was a seniorexecutive in the church assigned to be Cruise’s personal auditor. (Heaccompanied the star even to the shooting of Days of Thunder, where a characterin the movie was named after him.) Wilhere was livid because Haggis had upsetTom Cruise by subverting years of work on Cruise’s part to recruit Spielberginto the church.“It was a joke,” Haggis protested. He said he had no idea how that could haveundermined Cruise’s efforts to draw the most powerful man in Hollywood intoScientology. Wilhere said that Steven was having a problem with one of his sevenchildren, and Tom was working to “steer him in the right direction.” All thatwas ruined, Wilhere said, because Spielberg now believed there were evilScientologists who were locked in a closet.Haggis felt like he was trapped in a farce. It all seemed wildly ridiculous, buthe was the only one who thought so. Still, he’d be crazy to antagonize TomCruise and Steven Spielberg. He offered to explain to Spielberg that he had beenkidding, there were no evil Scientologists, and if there were, they wouldn’t bekept in a closet. He couldn’t believe that Spielberg would actually think he hadbeen serious.Wilhere was unappeased. He said Cruise was apoplectic. He directed Haggis towrite the star a letter of apology—this minute. Haggis dutifully wrote out anote on the paper handed to him, but Wilhere said it wasn’t sufficient. Haggiswrote a more contrite note. Wilhere said he would pass it along. But Haggisnever got a response from Cruise.4Haggis came away from that meeting with a new appreciation of the significanceof Tom Cruise to Scientology. He had heard that Cruise had often been enlistedto try to recruit famous people. They included James Packer, the richest man inAustralia; David Beckham, the British soccer star, and his wife, Victoria, theformer Spice Girl; and Cruise’s good friends, the actors Will and Jada PinkettSmith, who later funded a school that used Hubbard educational techniques. Butthere was no one else like Spielberg. Had Cruise been successful in his efforts,it would have been a transformative moment in the history of the church,especially in its relation to Hollywood. It would have given reality to themythology of Scientology’s influence in the entertainment industry. Who couldguess how many recruits would flood into the church because of Spielberg’simprimatur? Or how much money would pour into Scientology’s coffers by mogulsand agents and aspiring movie stars seeking to gain favor? The ambition behindsuch a play on the part of the church was breathtaking. And Haggis had steppedinto the middle of it with an innocent jest.Cruise turned his attention to the other Scientologists in the industry. Manyhad gone quiet following the scandals in the church or had never openly admittedtheir affiliation with the church. Cruise called a meeting of other Scientologycelebrities and urged them to become more outspoken about their religion. Thepopular singer Beck, who had grown up in the church, subsequently began speakingopenly about his faith. Erika Christensen, a rising young actress who was also asecond-generation Scientologist, called Cruise her spiritual mentor.Inspired by a new sense of activism, a group of Scientology actors turnedagainst Milton Katselas, the gray eminence of the Beverly Hills Playhouse. Noone had been more instrumental in forging the bond between Scientology andHollywood. Katselas had been a longtime friend of Hubbard’s and still kept aphotograph of him on his desk. The two men were similar in many ways, butespecially in their transformative effect on those who studied under them.Humorous, compassionate, and charismatic, but also vain and demanding, Katselaswas not above bullying his students to make a point; however, many of them feltthat he had taken them to a higher level of artistry than they had ever thoughtthey could achieve. When Katselas addressed an acting student, it wasn’t justabout technique; his lessons were full of savvy observations about life andbehavior.One of those students, Allen Barton, was a classical pianist as well as apromising actor. When Katselas heard him play, he found him a teacher and paidfor his piano lessons. Barton eventually arranged a recital on a Sunday evening.Katselas showed up at the theater at eight that morning, just as the piano wasbeing delivered. He noticed that the stage was scratched, there were piled-upboxes spilling out of the wings, and a large spiral staircase—a prop from an oldproduction—was left on the stage, because it was simply too big to move. Bartonexplained that he was going to cover up as much as possible with black drapes.Katselas called his office and within an hour ten people arrived. He sent Bartonoff to relax and prepare himself for the performance. When Barton returned thatafternoon, the staircase was gone, the boxes had disappeared, the stage had beensanded and painted, and four trees surrounded the piano. Even the pots the treeswere planted in had been painted to match the backdrop. The overall effect wasstunning. “Have a good show,” Katselas said, and walked away. Overwhelmed,Barton ran after him. “How can I ever thank you?” he asked. As he drove off,Katselas said, “Learn to expect it of yourself.”Such stories became a part of the Katselas legend. He was an OT V and a verypublic Scientologist, but he had stopped moving up the Bridge, in part becausehe refused to travel to Flag, where the upper-level courses were offered.Moreover, he had gotten into Ethics trouble because of his behavior with some ofhis female students. Jenna Elfman was a leader of the revolt against Katselas.She had been one of his prize students, winning a Golden Globe Award in 1999 forher free-spirited performance in the sitcom Dharma & Greg. Allen Barton, who hadbecome a teacher at the Playhouse, wrote Elfman a letter in June 2004, beggingher to relent. He called the movement against Katselas “ScientologicalMcCarthyism,” harking back to the blacklisting of Hollywood celebrities in the1950s because of their supposed Communist sympathies. “As Scientologists, are wenow a group that blacklists, that casts aside friendships and alliances on thebasis of how fast someone is moving up the Bridge?” he wrote. “If we as a groupare going to take on the billions of wogs out in the world, how can wedisconnect from each other?” Elfman never responded.After Cruise rallied the Scientology celebrities, a group of students demandedthat Katselas make the Playhouse a “WISE” business. The acronym stands for WorldInstitute of Scientology Enterprises. Katselas refused, even though he lost ahundred students in a mass Scientology walkout. Many of them went to anotherschool, the Acting Center, which was founded in 2006, based in part onScientology techniques. Katselas died of heart failure in 2008, and the BeverlyHills Playhouse is no longer connected with the church. The long line ofprotégés that Katselas left behind cemented the association between the churchand the Hollywood acting community, but in the end he was ostracized by the verypeople whose careers he had nurtured.Tom Cruise was now considered the unofficial Ethics Officer of Hollywood. He wasthe embodiment of Hubbard’s vision of a church with temples dedicated tocelebrity rather than God. Cruise’s intensity and commitment, along with hisspectacular ambition, matched Miscavige’s own. It was as if Miscavige had rubbeda magic lantern and Cruise had appeared, a genie who could open any door. He wasone of the few people that Miscavige saw as a peer. Miscavige even wondered ifthere was some way to appoint Cruise the church’s Inspector General forEthics—Rathbun’s job. “He’d say that Tom Cruise was the only person inScientology, other than himself, that he would trust to run the church,” oneformer Sea Org member recalled. Rathbun observed: “Miscavige convinced Cruisethat he and Tom were two of only a handful of truly ‘big beings’ on the planet.He instructed Cruise that LRH was relying upon them to unite with the few othersof their ilk on earth to make it onto ‘Target Two’—some unspecified galacticlocale where they would meet up with Hubbard in the afterlife.”[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_L03_r1.jpg]HAGGIS HAD ALSO BEEN folded into the celebrity recruitment apparatus. He had puthis money and his reputation in the hands of the church. He, too, was servingScientology. But he rarely spoke about his affiliation to his employees orassociates. Even his close friends were surprised to learn that he was in thechurch. “He didn’t have that sort of straight-on, unambiguous, unambivalent viewthat so many Scientologists project into the world,” Marshall Herskovitzobserved.For years, Herskovitz and several of Haggis’s closest non-Scientology friendsparticipated in an irregular Friday get-together called Boys’ Night. They met atan Italian restaurant on Montana Avenue in Santa Monica. The actor Josh Brolinusually attended, along with director Oliver Stone, producer Stephen Nathan, anda peace activist and former priest named Blase Bonpane, among others. One nightan attractive New York Times reporter came to write about the event, and the mendecided that she made them all a lot more appealing than they were on otheroccasions. After that, they voted to invite one woman to join them whenever theymet. Usually, it’s a beautiful actress. Julie Delpy and Charlize Theron haveboth been accorded this honor. Madeleine Stowe recalled it as the funniestevening she had ever had, although she had the sense to bring her husband along.She remembered Haggis sitting back, wisecracking, smoking a cigarette, watchingit all happen.Although Brolin, Nathan, and Stone are three of Haggis’s closest male friends,they never talked to him about Scientology. And yet each of the three had anexperience in the church, which the others weren’t aware of. Steve Nathan hadbeen hooked up to an E-Meter in the late 1960s by some British Scientologistswho were looking for recruits, but he hadn’t been impressed. Oliver Stone didn’teven know Haggis was in Scientology. But for that matter, few knew that Stonehad also spent a month in the church. He was a young man just back from Vietnam,full of trouble and questions. He signed up at the church’s New York center inthe old Hotel Martinique. “It was like going to college and reading DaleCarnegie, something you do to find yourself.” The difference was that inScientology there were nice parties and beautiful girls. Scientology didn’tanswer his questions; but on the other hand, he noted, “I got laid.”Brolin had known Haggis for many years. They had worked together in television,and Brolin had helped with Haggis’s charities. Brolin and his wife, actressDiane Lane, shared a house in Italy during the summers with Paul and Deborah.One evening, lubricated with grappa, Brolin began recounting a story of a friendwho had “infiltrated” Scientology. He wondered why Paul and Deborah werelistening stony-faced. When he finished the tale, Deborah finally said, “Youknow, we’re Scientologists.”“What?” Brolin exclaimed. “When the fuck did that happen?”“A long time ago,” Deborah said.“I am so sorry, I had no idea!” Brolin said.After that, Brolin went with Deborah to a couple of gatherings to hear aboutScientology’s opposition to psychotropic drugs. Although Brolin had never talkedabout it, he had gone to the Celebrity Centre himself, “in a moment of realdesperation,” and received spiritual counseling. He quickly decided Scientologywasn’t for him. But he still wondered what the religion did for celebrities likeTom Cruise and John Travolta: “Each has a good head on his shoulders, they makegreat business decisions, they seem to have wonderful families. Is that becausethey were helped by Scientology?”Brolin once witnessed Travolta giving a Scientology assist at a dinner party inLos Angeles. Marlon Brando arrived with a cut on his leg. He had been injuredwhile helping a stranded motorist on the Pacific Coast Highway pull his car outof a mudslide, and he was in pain. Travolta offered to help, saying that he hadjust reached a new level in Scientology, which gave him enhanced abilities.Brando said, “Well, John, if you have powers, then absolutely.” Travolta touchedBrando’s leg and they each closed their eyes. Brolin watched, thinking it wasbizarre and surprisingly physical. After ten minutes, Brando opened his eyes andsaid, “That really helped. I actually feel different!”IN 2003, Cruise continued working with Rathbun on his upper levels. While he wasat Gold Base, instead of staying in the cottage he had formerly shared withNicole Kidman, Cruise moved into the guesthouse of L. Ron Hubbard’s residence,Bonnie View. One Sunday night, following a late-night meal in Hubbard’s baronialdining room, Cruise got food poisoning. The culprit was thought to be anappetizer of fried shrimp in an egg roll. The cook was summarily sent to HappyValley.Rathbun accompanied Cruise to Flag Base in Clearwater where he could perform theexercises required to attain OT VII. Because Miscavige depended on Rathbun tohandle so many of the church’s most sensitive problems, he had been lulled intofeeling a kind of immunity from the leader’s violent temper. In September, hereturned to Gold Base and gave a report to Miscavige about Cruise’s progress.Miscavige asked where Cruise would be doing his semiannual checkups. “At Flag,”Rathbun said. All OT VIIs do their checkups at Flag.“Who’s going to do it?”Rathbun named an auditor in Clearwater that he thought highly of.Miscavige turned to his wife and said, “Can you believe this SP?” He declaredthat unlike any other OT VII, Cruise would get his checkups at Gold Base.When Cruise duly arrived at Gold for his semiannual check, he was preparing forhis role as a contract killer in Collateral. Miscavige took him out to the gunrange and showed him how to shoot a .45-caliber pistol. Meanwhile, Rathbunadministered the star’s six-month checkup.Because of his insubordination, Rathbun had to go through a program ofpenitence. One of the steps was to write up a list of his offenses against thechurch, which Miscavige had sketched out for him. “I am writing this publicannouncement to inform executives and staff that I have come to my senses and Iam no longer committing present time overts and have ceased all attacks andsuppressions on Scientology,” Rathbun admitted in September 2003, adopting theabject tone that characterizes many Scientology confessions. Speaking infull-blown Scientologese, he wrote, “The end result is unmocked org form,overworked and enturbulated executives and staff.” This meant that he had notthought out his intentions clearly, causing the church and the people who workedfor it to be in disarray. He had a particular apology to make to DavidMiscavige: “Each and every time on major situations, COB has had to intervene toclean up wars I had exacerbated.… The cumulative amount of COB’s time I havecost in terms of dropping balls, creating situations internally and externally,is on the order of eight years.”Rathbun was shocked, not just by being declared an SP, but also by the changesat Gold Base in the year and a half he had been posted to Flag. Allcommunications into and out of the base had been cut off. The leader had severalof his top executives confined to the Watchdog Committee headquarters—a pair ofdouble-wide trailers that had been married together. By the end of the year, thenumber who were living there under guard had grown to about forty or fiftypeople. It was now called the Hole. Except for one long conference table, therewas no furniture—no chairs or beds, just an expanse of outdoor carpet—so theexecutives had to eat standing up and sleep on the floor, which was swarmingwith ants. In the morning, they were marched outside for group showers with ahose, then back to the Hole. Their meals were brought to them—a slop of reheatedleftovers. When temperatures in the desert location mounted to more than ahundred degrees, Miscavige turned off the electricity, letting the executivesroast inside the locked quarters.The leader ordered them to stay until they finally had rearranged the “OrgBoard”—the church’s organizational chart—to his satisfaction, which was nevergiven. Photographs of Sea Org personnel were continually moved from one positionto another on the chart, which meant that people were constantly beingreassigned to different posts, whimsically, and no post was secure. About ninehundred positions needed to be filled at Int and Gold Bases, and the stack ofpersonnel and ethics files was five feet high. This anarchic process had beengoing on more or less intensively for four years.At odd, unpredictable hours, often in the middle of the night, Miscavige wouldshow up in the Hole, accompanied by his wife, Shelly, and his Communicator,Laurisse Stuckenbrock, each of whom carried a tape recorder to take downwhatever Miscavige had to say. The detainees could hear the drumbeat of theshoes as Miscavige’s entourage marched toward the trailers. The leader demandedthat the executives engage in what were termed “séances”—endless hours ofconfessions about their crimes and failures, in this and previous lives, as wellas whatever dark thoughts—“counter-intentions”—they might be harboring againsthim. If someone was not forthcoming with such confessions, the group wouldharass that person until he produced a confession. Sometimes these were sexualfantasies. That would be written up in a report, which Miscavige would then readaloud to other church officials.The entire base became paralyzed with anxiety about being thrown into the Hole.People were trying desperately to police their thoughts, but it was difficult tokeep secrets when staff members were constantly being security-checked withE-Meters. Even confidences whispered to a spouse were regularly betrayed. Afterone of COB’s lengthy rants, recordings of his statement would be sent to a stenopool, then transcripts were delivered to the executives in the Hole, who had toread them aloud to each other repeatedly.Mike Rinder was in the Hole for two years, even though he continued to be thechurch’s chief spokesperson. Bizarrely, he would sometimes be pulled out andordered to conduct a press conference, or to put on a tuxedo and jet off to aScientology gala; then he would be returned to confinement. He and otherexecutives were made to race around the room on their hands and bare knees, dayafter day, tearing open scabs on their knees and leaving permanent scars.Miscavige once directed De Vocht to rough up Rinder, because “he’s just an SP.”De Vocht took Rinder outside and gave him a going-over. But De Vocht was alsofrightened of Miscavige. He took to sleeping with a broken broom handle. Whenanother executive spoke up about the violence, he was beaten by two ofMiscavige’s assistants and made to mop the bathroom floor with his tongue.[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_016_r1.jpg]Mike Rinder, former chief spokesperson for the church, in Florida, 2012The detainees developed a particular expression whenever Miscavige came in,which he took note of. He called them “Pie Faces.” To illustrate what he meant,Miscavige drew a circle with two dots for eyes and a straight line for a mouth.He had T-shirts made up with the pie face on it. Rinder was “the Father of PieFaces.” People didn’t know how to react. They didn’t want to call attention tothemselves, but they also didn’t want to be a Pie Face.In Scientology, there is a phrase that explains mob psychology: Contagion ofAberration, meaning that groups of people can stimulate each other to do thingsthat are insane. According to former church executives, one day Miscavigearrived at the Hole and demanded that Marc Yager, the Commanding Officer of theCommodore’s Messengers Org, and Guillaume Lesevre, the Executive Director of theChurch of Scientology International, confess that they were homosexual lovers.He threatened that Tom Cruise would come to “punch you guys out” if the otherSea Org members in the Hole failed to get a confession from the two men. Thecaptive executives took this threat seriously. When Miscavige left, a group ofwomen executives who had been appointed as leaders of the detainees urged someof the bigger men in the Hole to “give some people some black eyes before Tomhas to.” Several men dutifully beat up Lesevre and Yager. Then one of the womenreported to Miscavige that the men had confessed that they were gay lovers. WhenDebbie Cook, the former Captain of Flag Service Org and one of the mostrespected executives in the church, said that wasn’t true, she was declared atraitor. She was made to stand in a garbage can for twelve hours, as the otherdetainees demanded that she confess her own “homosexual tendencies.” The womenin the room repeatedly slapped her and poured water over her head. A sign washung around her neck, saying LESBO.Rathbun was seen as being COB’s chief enforcer. During meetings in the Hole orelsewhere on the base, he would stand to one side and glare at his colleagueswhile he says Miscavige berated and abused them. Although he was physicallyintimidating, Rathbun was suffering from a number of physical ailments,including a bad back, gallstones, calcium deposits in his neck, and painfulvaricose veins, which he believed came from having to stand at attention forhours on end. He, too, was prone to bursts of sudden violence. “Once on a phonecall I saw him get so mad that he put his fist right through a computer screen,”his former wife recalled. Miscavige would send him down to observe what wasgoing on in the Hole and come back with reports. In January 2004, when Rinderwas accused of withholding a confession from the group, Rathbun took him outsideand beat him up. Rathbun says Miscavige wasn’t satisfied. He called Rathbun intohis massive office in the Religious Technology Center, a cold and imposing roomwith steel walls and eighteen-foot ceilings, and accused him of letting Rinder“get away with murder.” Then, according to Rathbun, out of nowhere, Miscavigegrabbed him by the throat and slammed his head against the steel wall.5 Rathbunblacked out for a moment. He wasn’t hurt, but the terms had changed.A few days later, Rathbun found himself in the Hole, along with the entireInternational Management team and other executives. Miscavige said they weregoing to stay there until they got the Org Board done.Scientologists are trained to believe that whatever happens to them is somehowtheir fault, so much of the discussion in the Hole centered on what they haddone to deserve this fate. The possibility that the leader of the church mightbe irrational or even insane was so taboo that no one could even think it, muchless voice it aloud. Most of the people in the Hole had a strong allegiance tothe group—Scientology and the Sea Org—and they didn’t want to let their comradesdown. Many had been in the Sea Org their entire adult lives and portions oftheir childhood. Mike Rinder joined the Sea Org when he was eighteen. Amy Scobeewas sixteen. Tom De Vocht was thirteen. They had already surrendered thepossibility of ordinary family life. Sex outside of marriage was taboo, so manymembers married in their teens; but since 1986, children have been forbidden toSea Org members. Former church executives say that abortions were common andforcefully encouraged. Claire Headley married Marc when she was seventeen; bythe time she was twenty-one she had been pushed to have two abortions. Sheestimates that sixty to eighty percent of the women on Gold Base have hadabortions. “It’s a constant practice,” she said.6Worried about pillow talk, Miscavige instituted a policy of imposed divorces in2004; people in the Religious Technology Center, the Commodore’s MessengerOrganization, and Golden Era Productions could not be married to members inother divisions. For many of those people in the Hole, everyone they knew orcared about was in the church. The cost of leaving—emotionally and spiritually,as well as financially—was forbidding. And they knew if they tried to run away,they’d likely be found and punished.Those who attempted to leave the Sea Org through the formal process of “routingout” would be presented with a freeloader tab for all the coursework andcounseling they had received over the years. Claire and Marc Headley, forinstance, were billed more than $150,000 when they left and told they would haveto pay if they ever wanted to see their family again. Those who accept thisoffer can spend years paying off their debt. Those who don’t stand to lose anyconnection to their friends and family who remain in Scientology.Many had long since turned their back on friends and family who were not in thechurch, and the prospect of facing them again brought up feelings of shame. Thethought of leaving loved ones still in the church was even more fraught. All ofthese conflicting emotions were informed by the Scientology theory that lifegoes on and on, and that the mission of the church is to clear the planet, so inthe scheme of things the misery one might be suffering now is temporary andnegligible. There is a larger goal. One is always working for “the greatest goodfor the greatest number of dynamics,” as Scientology ethics prescribed. And sothe executives of the church who had given their lives to the Sea Org directedtheir confusion and their anger inward, or toward their helpless colleagues.Rinder was an inevitable target. He was seen as being arrogant and above it all.Few people other than Rathbun really understood Rinder’s job; unlike the others,the two men were often off the base, dealing with lawyers, the government, andthe press. No doubt there was resentment at work as well. The next time the SeaOrg executives turned on Rinder, Rathbun exploded. He caught his friend in aheadlock and slammed him to the ground, then sat astride him, pounding his headinto the floor and shouting at him, nose to nose. Rinder managed to whisper,“Marty, I don’t want to play this game anymore.”Suddenly, Rathbun froze. Words had been spoken that broke the spell. But it wasonly a moment.One evening about eight o’clock, Miscavige arrived, with his wife and hisCommunicator, Shelly and Laurisse, flanking him as usual with tape recorders intheir hands. He ordered that the conference table be taken away and chairs bebrought in for everyone in the Hole—about seventy people at the time, includingmany of the most senior people in the Sea Org. He asked if anyone knew what“musical chairs” meant. In Scientology, it refers to frequent changes of post.About five hundred people had been moved off their jobs in the last five years,creating anarchy in the management structure. But that wasn’t the point he wastrying to make. Finally, someone suggested that it was also a game. Miscavigehad him explain the rules: Chairs are arranged in a circle and then, as theplayers march around them, one chair is removed. When the music stops, everybodygrabs a seat. The one left standing is eliminated. Then the music starts again.Miscavige explained that in this game the last person to grab a chair would bethe only one allowed to stay on the base; everyone else was to be“offloaded”—kicked out of the Sea Org—or sent away to the least desirableScientology bases around the world. Those whose spouses were not in the Holewould be forced to divorce.While Queen’s Greatest Hits played on a boom box, the church executives marchedaround and around, then fought for a seat when the music stopped. As the numberof chairs diminished, the game got more physical. The executives shoved andpunched each other; clothes were torn; a chair was ripped apart. All this time,the biting lyrics of “Bohemian Rhapsody” floated over the saccharine melody:Is this the real life?Is this just a fantasy?Caught in a landslideNo escape from reality.Rathbun, with his bad back, was eliminated fairly quickly. Rinder, De Vocht,Marc Headley—one by one, they found themselves standing alone, behind lowcubicle walls, watching the surviving contestants desperately fighting to remainin the Hole rather than be sent off to God knows where. There was a clock overthe door marking the hours that passed as the music played on and on thensuddenly stopped and the riot began again. As people fell out of the game, COBhad airline tickets for distant locations printed up for them at the base’stravel office. There were U-Haul trucks waiting outside to haul away theirbelongings. “Is it real to you now?” Miscavige teased. They were told that buseswould be ready to leave at six in the morning. Many were in tears. “I don’t seeanybody weeping for me,” Miscavige said. The utter powerlessness of everyoneelse in the room was made nakedly clear to them. The game continued until 4a.m., when a woman named Lisa Schroer grabbed the final chair.The next morning the whole event was forgotten. No one went anywhere.In several legal declarations he has made over the years, Miscavige hasprotested, “I am the ecclesiastical leader of the religion, not the Church.” Thedistinction is important when the church is dragged into lawsuits or threatenedwith criminal liability; Miscavige can point to a chart that assignsorganizational responsibility to other departments, whereas the soleresponsibility of the Religious Technology Center, which he heads, is to protectScientology doctrine and literature. And yet, Miscavige freely consigned thoseother department heads to the Hole or sent them to RPF. During the period thatthe organizational chart was being constantly rearranged, the only reliableposting on the base was his, that of COB RTC; everyone else was constantly beinguprooted and repotted in other temporary assignments. There is really only oneperson in charge of the Church of Scientology.A few days after the musical chairs episode, Miscavige ordered everyone in theHole to report to Golden Era Productions to stuff CDs into cases. At one point,he began sharply interrogating De Vocht, who was shaken and stuttered inresponse. According to De Vocht, Miscavige punched him in the face. He felt hishead vibrate. He tried to turn away from the next blow, but Miscavige grabbedhis neck and shoved him into the floor, pummeling and kicking him.7 De Vocht hadserved Miscavige for years, and had even considered him a friend. He haddedicated his life to Scientology and had been in the Sea Org for nearly thirtyyears. He recalls thinking, “Now here I am, being beat up by the top dog infront of my peers.”After the attack, Miscavige continued his speech. De Vocht was so humiliatedthat he couldn’t bring himself to look at his companions. Finally, he managed aglance at them. Pie faces.Rathbun was there, and at that moment he made a decision. As the otherexecutives were being led back to the Hole, he slipped away and got hismotorcycle and hid in the bushes. When a car finally approached, he racedthrough the open gate into the outside world.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 The church denies that Cruise was videotaped, or that Miscavige watched suchtapes, or used such information to manipulate anyone. Noriyuki Matsumaru, whoworked in the RTC with Miscavige, confirms De Vocht’s account.2 Cruise, through his lawyer, denies this exchange and says he has no politicalambition.3 Spielberg’s publicist says that the director doesn’t recall the conversation.4 Tom Cruise’s lawyer says that the actor doesn’t remember the incident or hisbeing upset with Haggis.5 As previously noted, the church denies all allegations of abuse by Miscavige.6 The church denies that anyone in the Sea Org has ever been pressured to havean abortion.7 The church denies that Miscavige has ever abused members of the church."},{"pageContent":"9[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_L02_r1.jpg]TC AND COBGreat fame also imposes a kind of cloister on those who join its ranks. TomCruise had been a movie star since he was twenty-one, with two popular movies inthe same year, The Outsiders and Risky Business. By age twenty-five, he was thebiggest star in Hollywood, on his way to becoming one of the most famous movielegends in history. At the same age, Miscavige had become the de facto leader ofScientology. Each of these men assumed extraordinary responsibilities when theirpeers were barely beginning their careers. Their youth and position set themapart. So it was natural that two such powerful, isolated men would seethemselves mirrored in each other.A number of Sea Org members who observed Cruise when he came to Gold Baseremarked that he seemed liberated to be in an environment where no one hassledhim, or took his photograph, or asked for autographs. There are cottages builtfor the use of other well-known Scientologists, such as John Travolta, KirstieAlley, Edgar Winter, and Priscilla Presley, so the base can sometimes feel likea secret celebrity spa. Once, Miscavige had the entire Gold Base crew line up atthe gate and salute Cruise when he arrived. Cruise must have felt self-consciousabout this display, because it happened only once. People on the base have beendirected not to speak to Cruise at all, unless spoken to. In this way, Cruisetastes the life that Miscavige has lived for decades, one of seclusion anddeference, concentrated on spiritual advancement.1Similarly, after becoming associated with Cruise, the style of Miscavige’s lifebegan to reflect that of a fantastically wealthy and leisured movie star. Henormally awakens at noon, with a cup of coffee and a Camel cigarette. The coffeeis fresh-ground Starbucks, preferably a Guatemala or Arabian Mocha Java, madewith distilled water, to which he adds raw sugar and half-and-half. Then hetakes breakfast, the first of his five meals.According to Miscavige’s former chef, Sinar Parman, the church leader was eating“three squares and a snack at night,” until the late nineties. One day, while ona Delta flight from LA to Clearwater, Miscavige walked to the cabin from hisseat in first class and showed some photos from a muscle magazine to Parman andhis steward, who traveled with him. He told them he wanted to “get ripped andhave six-pack abs.” After the flight, Miscavige changed physical trainers andbegan taking bodybuilding supplements. He also adopted a strict diet thatrequires each meal to be at least forty percent protein and to contain no morethan four hundred calories. Soon, he was looking like the men in the musclemagazines.To maintain his physique, Miscavige’s chefs have to enter each portion size intoa computer, including the cream in his morning coffee. Miscavige often startswith an omelet of one whole egg and five egg whites. Two and a half hours later,lunch is provided. Two choices would be prepared daily, for both him and hiswife—four meals altogether. Miscavige prefers pizza, soup, and submarinesandwiches. Throughout the day cigarettes, bottled water, and protein bars arestationed wherever he might be working. Dinner is a five-course meal, and onceagain, dual entrées are prepared for him to choose from. Miscavige’s favoritefoods include wild mushroom risotto, linguine in white clam sauce, and pâté defoie gras. Fresh fruit and vegetables are purchased from local markets orshipped in from overseas. Several times a week, a truck from Santa MonicaSeafood brings Atlantic salmon, or live lobster, flown in fresh from the EastCoast or Canada. Corn-fed lamb arrives from New Zealand. When guests such as TomCruise come to dinner, the kitchen goes into extravagant bursts of invention,with ingredients sometimes flown in from different continents. Two hours afterdinner, the first evening snack arrives, with lighter offerings, such as Italianwhite bean soup or clam chowder. After midnight, there is a final late-nightsnack—a selection of nonfat cheeses, an apple crisp, or blueberry crepes, oftengarnished with edible flowers. Shelly usually preferred a fruit platter. Shewould drink only almond milk, which was made on-site from organic almonds. Sheinsisted that all the food be consistent with the diet recommended for theirblood type (both Shelly and David are type O). Two full-time chefs work all daypreparing these meals, with several full-time stewards to serve them.According to Claire Headley, who oversaw the finances for the ReligiousTechnology Center between 2000 and 2004, the food costs for David and Shelly andtheir guests would range between $3,000 to as much as $20,000 per week. At theend of the evening, Miscavige retires to his den and drinks Macallan Scotch andplays backgammon with members of his entourage, or listens to music on his$150,000 stereo system (he loves Michael Jackson), or watches movies in hisprivate screening room (his favorite films are Scarface and the Godfathertrilogy). He usually turns in around three or four in the morning.Miscavige enjoys shooting pool or playing video games in his lounge. He has atanning bed, and a high-end gym that few people other than Cruise are permittedto use. Although he is short in stature, Miscavige exudes physical power. Hefavors tight-fitting T-shirts that show off his chiseled biceps. He collectsguns, maintains at least six motorcycles, and has a number of automobiles,including an armor-plated GMC Safari van with bulletproof windows and satellitetelevision, and a souped-up Saleen Mustang that Cruise gave him to match hisown. His uniforms and business suits are fashioned by Richard Lim, a Los Angelestailor whose clients include Cruise, Will Smith, and Martin Sheen. Miscavige’sshoes are custom-made in London by John Lobb, bootmaker to the royal family. Hiswardrobe fills an entire room. Two full-time stewards are responsible for hiscleaning and laundry. Cruise admired the housecleaning so much—even Miscavige’slightbulbs are polished once a month—that the church leader sent a Sea Org teamto Cruise’s Telluride retreat to train the star’s staff.Until 2007, when he traveled, Miscavige would often rent Cruise’s Gulfstreamjet, but he has since upgraded to a roomier Boeing business jet, at a cost ofthirty to fifty thousand dollars per trip. He brings along his personalhairdresser and chiropractor. He loves underwater photography, and when hereturns from his annual trip on the Freewinds, he has the photography staff putthe photos into slides so they can be appreciated by the entire Gold Base staff.The contrast with the other Sea Org members is stark. They eat in a mess hall,which features a meat-and-potatoes diet and a salad bar, except for occasionalextended periods of rice and beans for those who are being punished. The averagecost per meal as of 2005 (according to Marc Headley, who participated in thefinancial planning each week) was about seventy-five cents a head—significantlyless than what is spent per inmate in the California prison system. When membersjoin the Sea Org, they are issued two sets of pants, two shirts, and a pair ofshoes, which is their lifetime clothing allotment; anything else, they purchasethemselves. Although the nominal pay for Sea Org members is fifty dollars aweek, many are fined for various infractions, so it’s not unusual to be paid aslittle as thirteen or fourteen dollars. Married couples at Gold Base share atwo-bedroom apartment with two other couples, meaning that one pair sleeps onthe couch. In any case, few get more than five or six hours of sleep a night.There are lavish exercise facilities at the base—an Olympic pool, a golf course,basketball courts—but they are rarely used. Few are permitted to have access tocomputers. Every personal phone call is listened to; every letter is inspected.Bank records are opened and records kept of how much money people have. Culturaltouchstones common to most Americans are often lost on Sea Org members at GoldBase. They may not know the name of the president of the United States or beable to tell the difference between the Republican and Democratic parties. It’snot as if there is no access to outside information; there is a big-screentelevision in the dining hall, and people can listen to the radio or subscribeto newspapers and magazines; however, news from the outside world begins to loseits relevance when people are outside of the wider society for extended periodsof time. Many Sea Org members have not left the base for a decade.On April 30 of each year, Scientology staff from around the world are pressed tocontribute to Miscavige’s birthday present. One year, as birthday assessmentswere being passed around, few could contribute because they hadn’t been paid formonths. Finally, staffers got their back pay so that they could make theirdonations. Janela Webster, who worked directly under Miscavige for fifteenyears, received $325, out of which she paid $150 for Miscavige’s gift. Suchpresents include tailored suits and leather jackets, high-end cameras, divingequipment, Italian shoes, and a handmade titanium bicycle. One year Flag ServiceOrg in Clearwater gave him a Vyrus 985 C3 4V, a motorcycle with a retail priceof $70,000.2 Another division presented him with a BMW.Miscavige keeps a number of dogs, including five beagles. He had blue vests madeup for each of them, with four stripes on the shoulder epaulets, indicating therank of Sea Org Captain. He insists that people salute the dogs as they paradeby. The dogs have a mini-treadmill where they work out. A full-time staff memberfeeds, walks, and trains the dogs, takes them to the veterinarian, and entersone of them, Jelly, into contests, where he has attained championship status.Another of Miscavige’s favorites, a Dalmatian–pit bull mix named Buster, went ona rampage one day and killed ten peacocks on the property, then proudly laidthem out for all to see. Buster has also attacked various members of the staff,sending one elderly woman to the emergency room and earning Buster his ownEthics folder. Miscavige eventually had the dog taken away to another Sea Orgbase, even though he believed that Buster had a nose for “out ethics” behavior.The relieved staff members joked that Buster had been sent to Dog RPF.From an early age, Miscavige had taken control of his family. His father, RonSenior, joined the Sea Org following a charge of attempted rape lodged againsthim in 1985. Former church members say that significant church resources wereused to contain the scandal, and that David forced his father to join the SeaOrg. Because David’s mother, Loretta, refused to sign up for that, she and Ronagreed to divorce. She continued in Scientology, rising to the summit as an OTVIII. She worked as an accountant for the law firm of Greta Van Susteren, thetelevision commentator, and her husband, John Coale, both Scientologists, whomaintain a mansion on Clearwater Beach. Loretta was a heavy smoker who sufferedfrom emphysema and obesity—scarcely the image of an Operating Thetan—but herself-deprecating, sometimes goofy sense of humor made her popular among thestaff and upper-level Scientologists—“the court jester of the Scientologycountry club,” as Rathbun called her. Loretta’s regal position as the leader’smother allowed her to give rein to gossipy stories about Dave’s childhood, whichshe told in a thick Philly accent. Miscavige complained that his mother wastrying to destroy him. He ordered Rathbun to run a security check on her, usingthe E-Meter. When Loretta realized what he was up to, she burst out laughing.Miscavige sent his personal trainer to help his mother get in shape, and he hadchurch members monitoring her diet, but her chronic health problems overtookher. “She was sick for a long time,” her granddaughter, Jenna Miscavige Hill,recalled. “She was not happy with the turn the church took.” Sometimes Lorettawould burst into tears. “I would try to help her the only way I knew how,” Hillsaid. “She was an amazing grandma.” (Loretta Miscavige died in 2005.)THE LEVEL OF ABUSE at the Gold Base was increasing year by year as—unpoliced byoutside forces—other senior executives began emulating their leader. Rinder, DeVocht, and Rathbun all admit to striking other staff members. Even some of thewomen became physically aggressive, slapping underlings when they didn’t performup to standard. Debbie Cook, the former leader of Flag Base, says that althoughMiscavige never struck her, he ordered his Communicator to do so. Another time,she said, he told his Communicator to break Cook’s finger. She bent Cook’sfinger but failed to actually break it.Miscavige can be charming and kind, especially to Sea Org members who needemotional or medical assistance. He has a glittering smile and a commandingvoice. And yet former Scientologists who were close to him recall that hisconstant profanity and bursts of unprovoked violence kept everyone off balance.Jefferson Hawkins, a former Sea Org executive who had worked with Paul Haggis onthe rejected Dianetics campaign, says he was beaten by Miscavige on fiveoccasions, the first time in 2002. He had just written an infomercial for thechurch. Miscavige summoned him to a meeting, where about forty members wereseated on one side of a long conference table; Miscavige routinely sits byhimself on the other side. He began a tirade about the shortcomings of theinfomercial. When Hawkins started to respond, Miscavige cut him short. “The onlything I want to hear from you is your crimes,” Miscavige said, meaning thatHawkins was to confess his subversive intentions. Then, without warning,Miscavige jumped on the table and launched himself at Hawkins, knocking himagainst a cubicle wall and battering him in the face. The two men fell to thefloor, and their legs became entangled. “Let go of my legs!” Miscavige shouted.Miscavige extricated himself and left the room, leaving Hawkins on the floor,shocked, bruised, disheveled, humiliated, and staring at the forty people whodid nothing to support him. “Get up! Get up!” they told him. “Don’t make himwrong.”Even if he had had access to a phone, Hawkins wouldn’t have called the police.If a Sea Org member were to seek outside help, he would be punished, either bybeing declared a Suppressive Person or by being sent off to do manual labor formonths or years. Far more important, Hawkins believed, was the fact that hisspiritual immortality was on the line. Scientology had made him aware of hiseternal nature as he moved from life to life, erasing his fear of mortality.Without that, he would be doomed to dying over and over again, “in ignorance anddarkness,” he said, “never knowing my true nature as a spirit.” Miscavige, heconcluded, “holds the power of eternal life and death over you.”The church provided an affidavit of a former Sea Org member, Yael Lustgarten,who stated that she was present at the meeting and that the attack by Miscavigenever happened. She claims that Hawkins made a mess of his presentation—“Hesmelled of body odor, he was unshaven, his voice tone was very low and he couldhardly be heard”—and he was merely instructed to shape up. On the other hand,Amy Scobee said she witnessed the attack—it was her cubicle the two men fellinto—and after the altercation, she recalled, “I gathered all the buttons fromJeff’s shirt and the change from his pockets and gave them back to him.”Tommy Davis later testified that he had conducted an investigation of thecharges of abuse at the base. He said that all of the abuse had been committedby Rinder, Rathbun, and De Vocht—none by Miscavige.TOM DE VOCHT GREW UP in a little central Florida town called Fort Meade. When hewas ten years old, in 1974, his cousin, Dicky Thompson, a keyboardist in theSteve Miller Band, came to visit, riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. That yearthe band had a number one song, “The Joker,” and Thompson rode into town with aglow of fame around him. “He had a weird stare,” De Vocht remembered. “Heinvited my sister to meet Steve Miller and John Travolta.” Within a year, mostof De Vocht’s family had joined the Church of Scientology. In July 1977,thirteen-year-old Tom De Vocht signed the billion-year contract for the Sea Org.De Vocht became one of Miscavige’s allies and moved up the bureaucratic ladderquickly. In 1986, he was appointed the Commanding Officer of the Commodore’sMessengers Org at Flag. In 2001, Miscavige called him, complaining, “Tom, Ican’t get my building done.” The new headquarters for the Religious TechnologyCenter at Gold Base, Building 50, was years behind schedule and well overbudget. Miscavige directed De Vocht to come to Gold Base and oversee theconstruction. The first day he got there, De Vocht realized that “this buildingis going to be the end of me.”Forty-seven million dollars—more than a thousand dollars per square foot—hadpreviously been spent on the new center. The building had already been completeda couple of times, using the highest-grade materials—cold rolled steel, andanigre, a beautiful but extremely hard, pinkish African wood—only to havecomponents ripped out because they didn’t meet Miscavige’s standards.Miscavige’s desk, also made of steel, was so heavy that De Vocht worried whetherthe structure would support it. He discovered that there were no actualarchitectural drawings for the building; there were only renderings of what itshould look like. The stucco exterior walls were already cracked because thewhole edifice was at a 1.25-inch tilt. The walls weren’t actually connected tothe floors. Even a minor earthquake (Gold Base was just west of the San AndreasFault) might cause the whole building to collapse. De Vocht recommended that thebuilding be torn down and rebuilt from scratch, but Miscavige rejected thatidea.The expense of essentially rebuilding a poorly constructed building from theinside was immense. When De Vocht had almost finished construction, having spentan additional $60 million, Miscavige still had a list of complaints. He was alsocritical of the landscaping. Gold Base is in a desert, but Miscavige demandedthat the building appear to be set in a forest.One morning, De Vocht says, Miscavige and his wife were inspecting the largevault in the legal department of Building 50, when the leader stopped in histracks and began rubbing his head. He turned pale. “Where did we put the goldbullion?” he asked his wife. For a full minute, Miscavige kept rubbing his headand asking about the gold, but then he snapped out of it and went on as ifnothing had happened. De Vocht recalls that forty-five minutes later, ShellyMiscavige called him and asked him, “What are we going to do? He’s losing it.”She told him that Dave had gone “Type 3”—psychotic—because of all theSuppressive Persons at the base.3While De Vocht was working on Building 50, he was forced to attend a séance withfive hundred other Sea Org members on Gold Base. People were called out by nameand asked, “What crimes have you committed against David Miscavige?” One afteranother, people approached the microphone and confessed to ways in which theywere suppressing the dissemination of Scientology or thinking taboo thoughts. DeVocht was disgusted by the orgy of self-abasement. One night, he simply tookover the meeting and brought some semblance of order to it. That night, ShellyMiscavige asked him to be the Commanding Officer of the Commodore’s MessengersOrg, which essentially put him in charge of the entire base. “It’s out ofcontrol,” she pleaded, saying that her husband counted on him and had no oneelse to turn to.In 2004, De Vocht finished reconstructing the 45,000-square-foot Building 50,which wound up costing $70 million. “You’re the biggest spender in the historyof Scientology,” Miscavige told him. “You should be shot.”EVEN THOUGH MEMBERSHIP in the church has been declining for years, according topolls and census figures, money continues to pour into Scientology coffers infantastic sums. Donors are accorded higher status depending on the size of theirgifts to the International Association of Scientologists—Patron Maximus for a$25 million pledge, for instance. Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson,became a Patron Laureate for her $10 million gift to the association in 2007.The IAS now holds more than $1 billion, mostly in offshore accounts, accordingto former executives of the church. Scientology coursework alone can be verypricey—as much as $400,000 to reach the level of OT VIII. That doesn’t count thebooks and materials or the latest-model E-Meter, which is priced at $4,650. Thenthere is the auditing, which ranges in price from $5,000 to $8,000 for atwelve-hour “intensive,” depending on the location and the level of the auditor.Services sold in Clearwater alone amount to $100 million a year.Despite the frequent cost overruns on construction, Scientology undertook aworldwide building campaign, kicked off by Miscavige’s decision to use theoccasion of 9/11 to issue a call for a massive expansion of the church.“Bluntly, we are the only people of Earth who can reverse the decline,” heannounced. “The way to do better is to get big.”In some cases, the building projects have become significant moneymakers for thechurch. Across the street from Scientology’s Fort Harrison Hotel in Clearwateris the Super Power Building, intended to be a training facility to enhance theperceptions of upper-level thetans. The fund-raising kicked off with a $1million gift from the Feshbach brothers. Despite years-long construction delaysand fines imposed by the City of Clearwater, the 380,000-square-foot Super PowerBuilding has proven to be a bonanza for the church, which has taken in at least$145 million in donations to complete the project—$120 million more than it wasprojected to cost when first proposed, in 1993. The church explains that theplan has been enlarged from its original goals, which has created delays andadditional expenses. Tom De Vocht, who worked on the construction for years,said that the building remained unfinished for so long because no one knew whatsuper power was.Under Miscavige’s leadership, the church has aggressively launched a programcalled Ideal Orgs, which aim to replicate the grandeur of Hubbard’s Saint HillManor. A number of the Ideal Orgs have been shuttered—including Seattle, Boston,and New Haven—because the local Scientology communities were unable to supportthem. Other notable churches and missions are now boarded up orunloaded—including one in Santa Monica that Paul and Deborah Haggis raised moneyto establish.THE INTENSITY OF the pressure on Sea Org members to raise money for thechurch—while working for next to nothing—can be understood in part through theaccount of Daniel Montalvo. His parents joined the Sea Org when he was five, andthe very next year he signed his own billion-year contract. He says that hebegan working full-time in the organization when he was eleven and recalls that,along with other Sea Org members, including children, his days stretched fromeight in the morning until eleven thirty at night. Part of his work wasshoveling up asbestos that had been removed during the renovation of the FortHarrison Hotel. He says no protective gear was provided, not even a mask. Herarely saw his parents. While he was at Flag Base in 2005, when he was fourteen,he guarded the door while Tom Cruise was in session. The sight of childrenworking at a Sea Org facility would not have been unusual. They were separatedfrom their parents and out of school. According to Florida child labor laws,minors who are fourteen and fifteen years old are prohibited from working duringschool hours, and may work only up to fifteen hours a week. Daniel said that hewas allowed schooling only one day a week, on Saturday.When Daniel was fifteen, he was assigned to work on the renovation ofScientology’s publications building in Los Angeles, operating scissors lifts andother heavy equipment. According to California child labor laws,fifteen-year-old children are allowed to work only three hours per day outsideof school, except on weekends—no more than eighteen hours per week total.Sixteen is the minimum age for children to work in any manufacturingestablishment using power-driven hoisting apparatus, such as the scissors lift.Daniel graduated to work at the church’s auditing complex nearby, called theAmerican Saint Hill Organization; then from six in the evening until three inthe morning he volunteered at Bridge Publications. He was paid thirty-sixdollars a week.Daniel’s work at Bridge Publications was sufficiently impressive that he wasposted full-time in the manufacturing division there the following year. Thechurch had issued a new edition of Hubbard’s books and lectures called TheBasics, which was being aggressively marketed to Scientologists. One of Daniel’sjobs was to cut the “thumb notches” that mark the glossary and the appendix inthese handsomely made books, like the notches one would find in an unabridgeddictionary. A machine with a guillotine steel blade slices through the pages toproduce the half-moon indentation. California law specifically forbids theoperation of the machine by anyone under the age of eighteen. Daniel noted abouttwenty other minors working at the plant, all of them sleep deprived and workingaround heavy equipment. One night Daniel chopped off his right index finger onthe notching machine. A security officer picked up his finger and put it in aplastic bag with ice, then took Daniel to the children’s hospital in Hollywood.He was instructed to tell the admitting nurse that he had injured himself in askateboarding accident. The doctors were unable to reattach his finger.After that, Daniel was sent to the sales division of Bridge Publications. Saleshad been declining since The Basics had first been published in 2007. The Basicsincluded eighteen books and a number of Hubbard lectures on CD; the completepackage cost $6,500. Sea Orgs all over the world had call centers set up to sellthem. In Los Angeles, there were hourly quotas to be met, and those who failedsuffered various punishments, such as having water dumped on their head or beingmade to do push-ups or run up and down the stairs. There were security guards onevery floor. A salesperson had to get a slip verifying that he had made hisquota before he was permitted to go to bed.Often it was simply impossible to make the quota legitimately, so people ranunauthorized credit cards. Members of the Sea Org sales force would break intothe church’s financial records and pull up the credit card information of publicmembers. Members who had money on account at the church for future courses wouldsee it drained to pay for books they didn’t order. Parishioners who balked atmaking contributions or buying unwanted materials were told they were inviolation of church ethics, and their progress in Scientology was blocked orthreatened.Members who pledge more than they can afford can find themselves in acompromised situation. One Scientologist who was a bank teller says he was toldto comply with a robbery in order to pay off his debt to the church; the robberstook four thousand dollars. In 2009, Nancy Cartwright’s fiancé, Stephen E.Brackett, a contractor, had taken a substantial construction advance to renovatea restaurant. The company that insured the project later sued Cartwright,claiming that she and Brackett had diverted the money to the Church ofScientology. Brackett, an OT V, had been featured in a church ad for the SuperPower Building, identified as a “key contributor.” “Mankind needs your help,”Brackett was quoted as saying in the ad. He later took his life by jumping off abridge on Pacific Coast Highway near Big Sur.4The biggest financial scandal involving church members was a Ponzi schemeoperated by Reed Slatkin; he was one of the co-founders, with Paul Haggis’sfriend Sky Dayton, of EarthLink. Slatkin’s massive fraud involved more than halfa billion dollars in investments; much of the initial “profit” was returned toScientology investors, such as Daniel and Myrna Jacobs, who earned nearly $3million on a $760,500 “investment.” According to Marty Rathbun, Slatkin’sScientology investors included Anne Archer and Fox News commentator Greta VanSusteren. Later investors were not so lucky. Slatkin was convicted of defrauding$240 million; it is still not known how much of that money went directly to thechurch, although the court found that about $50 million was funneled to thechurch indirectly by investors with massive gains. In 2006, groups affiliatedwith the Church of Scientology, including the Celebrity Centre, agreed to payback $3.5 million.IN JULY 2004 Miscavige hosted Tom Cruise’s forty-second birthday party aboardthe Scientology cruise ship Freewinds. The Golden Era Musicians, includingMiscavige’s father on trumpet, played songs from Cruise’s movies as film clipsflickered on the giant overhead screens installed especially for the occasion.Cruise himself danced and sang “Old Time Rock and Roll,” reprising a famousscene in Risky Business, the movie that firmly established him as a star.Occasionally, the Freewinds is used to confine those Sea Org members that thechurch considers most at risk for flight. Among the crew on the ship duringCruise’s birthday party was Valeska Paris, a twenty-six-year-old Swiss woman.Paris had grown up in Scientology and joined the Sea Org when she was fourteen.Three years later, her stepfather, a self-made millionaire, committed suicide,leaving a diary in which he blamed the church for fleecing his fortune. WhenValeska’s mother denounced the church on French television, Valeska was isolatedat the Clearwater base in order to keep her away from her mother. The next year,at the age of eighteen, she was sent to the Freewinds. She was told she would beon the ship for two weeks. She was held there against her will for twelve years.Shortly before Cruise arrived, Paris developed a cold sore, which causedMiscavige to consign her to a condition of Treason, so she wasn’t allowed to goto the birthday party, but she later did wind up serving Cruise and hisgirlfriend at the time, the Spanish actress Penélope Cruz.In October, Miscavige acknowledged Cruise’s place in Scientology by awarding himthe Freedom Medal of Valor. Miscavige called Cruise “the most dedicatedScientologist I know” before an audience of Sea Org members who had spent muchof their lives working for the church for a little more than seven dollars aday. Then he hung the diamond-encrusted platinum medallion around the star’sneck.“I think you know that I am there for you,” Cruise said to the thrilledaudience. “And I do care, so very, very, very much.” He turned to an imposingportrait of Hubbard, standing beside a globe. “To LRH!” he said, with a crispsalute.Lana Mitchell, the cook who had been accused of feeding Cruise the poisonedshrimp a few months before, had gotten out of Happy Valley, but she watched theceremony while in RPF, along with some two hundred of her detained colleagues.About fifty of them were Sea Org executives who had been purged by Miscavige.They were being held in the Los Angeles complex on L. Ron Hubbard Way, in themassive blue former hospital where Spanky Taylor and so many others had beenconfined. Some had been in the organization for more than twenty years and hadworked directly for Hubbard. They were completely cut off from the outsideworld—no television, radio, or even any music. As many as forty people werecrammed into each of the former hospital rooms, with only one bathroom to share.Often there was not enough food to go around. Some of those confined had severemedical conditions, including Uwe Stuckenbrock, the former internationalsecurity chief, who suffered from multiple sclerosis and had deteriorated to thepoint of being unable to speak. One of the jobs Mitchell was assigned on RPF waswelding, but she had never done it before, and she burned her eyes because shewasn’t wearing the protective glasses correctly. She got no medical attention atall.Every effort was made to keep RPF’ers out of view. Windows were curtained so noone could see in or out. They traveled through tunnels and over rooftops whenthey needed to move about within the complex. There were no days off, althoughthey were allowed to call their families on Christmas. Their sole diversion waswatching the big Scientology galas on television. After all, the elaborate setsfor these events were constructed by the RPF’ers in Los Angeles or at Flag Basein Clearwater. To view the big Cruise event, they were all taken to the messhall.One of the penitents was Mark McKinstry, who had been National Sales Manager atBridge Publications when the movie version of Battlefield Earth, starring JohnTravolta, came out in 2000. Hubbard’s tale is about an alien race of “Psychlos,”who have turned people into slaves—until a hero arises to liberate humanity.Travolta had worked for years to get the movie made, and wound up paying asignificant portion out of his own pocket. It was at the peak of his career. “Itold my manager, ‘If we can’t do the things now that we want to do, what good isthe power?’ ” he remarked at the time. Miscavige had been deeply involved in thefilming from the beginning. He would watch dailies of the film in Clearwaterwhile he was overseeing the handling of the Lisa McPherson case. His critiqueswould then be typed up and sent to the Scientology representative who was alwaysat Travolta’s side. When the movie was completed, Miscavige called Travolta tocongratulate him, saying that LRH would be proud. He predicted it was going tobe a blockbuster.McKinstry had been working for a year promoting the movie edition of the book.He traveled across the country with Travolta to push the book in bookstores,malls, and Walmarts. About 750,000 copies were sold. Like many others who havespent time with Travolta, McKinstry came to like him immensely. The actor wasdevoting a substantial amount of his own time and energy to making the book asuccess. But when the movie came out, it was a critical and box-officecatastrophe. Even at the premiere, Sea Org members had to be bused in to Mann’sChinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard to fill the empty seats for as many asthree shows a day. For some of them, it was the first movie they had seen inyears. “ ‘Battlefield Earth’ may well turn out to be the worst movie of thiscentury,” the New York Times critic observed, in what proved to be a typicalreview. There were false accusations that the film contained subliminal messagespromoting Scientology. Travolta’s career went into a lengthy dark period. Cruiselater complained to Miscavige, saying that the movie was terrible for thechurch’s public image.5 Miscavige responded that it would never have been madeif he’d had anything to do with it.McKinstry was dismayed when he went to a screening of the movie and watchedpeople walking out or booing. His wife could see that he was upset and askedwhat was wrong. “Why didn’t anyone watch this movie before it was released?” hesaid. She reported to the church what he had said, and he was ordered to RPF.[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_L03_r1.jpg]SHORTLY BEFORE HE RECEIVED Scientology’s top award, Cruise ended his three-yearrelationship with Penélope Cruz. Shelly Miscavige had been supervising herauditing and helping her through the Purification Rundown. But, like Nicole,Penélope was suspect in the eyes of the church’s leader. She was anindependent-minded person and continued to meditate and identify herself as aBuddhist.Cruise traveled with a Scientology delegation to open a magnificent new churchin Madrid, where he read his speech to the crowd in halting Spanish. Before theopening, however, he was sitting with his sister Lee Anne, who had become hispublicist. Mike Rinder, who was in the room, remembers that Cruise heatedlycomplained to his sister that no one had been able to find him a new girlfriend.Miscavige walked in, Rinder says, and Cruise made the same complaint to him.6Miscavige took the hint. “I want you to look for the prettiest women in thechurch,” Tom De Vocht remembers Miscavige saying. “Get their names and phonenumbers.” Miscavige then assigned Greg Wilhere and Tommy Davis to audition allthe young actresses who were in Scientology—about a hundred, according to MarcHeadley, who observed some of the videos. Shelly Miscavige, the leader’s wife,oversaw the project personally. Wilhere and Davis immediately went to work. Thewomen weren’t told why they were being interviewed, but they were asked abouttheir opinions of Cruise and where they were on the Bridge. Wilhere, who wasactually in the Hole at the time, was taken out of confinement, given aBlackBerry and five thousand dollars to buy civilian clothes at a Saks FifthAvenue outlet, then sent to New York and Los Angeles to videotape theinterviews. Rinder noticed that when Cruise arrived at the Freedom Medal ofValor ceremony a month later, he was accompanied by a raven-haired young actressand model, Yolanda Pecoraro. She was born into Scientology and had completed anumber of courses at the Celebrity Centre and on the Freewinds, but she was onlynineteen years old. Cruise was forty-two at the time.The Scientology search team came up with another aspiring actress, NazaninBoniadi, twenty-five years old, who had been born in Iran and raised in London.Naz was well educated and beautiful in the way that Cruise was inclined torespond to—dark and slender, with large eyes and a flashing smile. She hadstudied pre-med at the University of California at Irvine before deciding to tryher luck as an actress. More important for the purposes of the match, however,was the fact that Boniadi was an OT V. Her mother was also a Scientologist.In early November 2004, Naz was informed that she had been selected for aspecial program that was critical to the future of the church, but it was sosecret she wouldn’t be allowed to tell anyone, even her mother. Naz was movedimmediately into the Celebrity Centre, where she spent a month going throughsecurity checks and special auditing programs. She hoped the project hadsomething to do with human rights, which was her special interest, but all shewas told was that her participation would end bigotry against Scientology.At one point during the intensive auditing and security checks, Wilhere informedher that she would have to break up with her longtime boyfriend in order for theproject to proceed. She refused. She couldn’t understand why her boyfriend posedany kind of problem; indeed, she had personally introduced him to Scientology.Wilhere persisted, asking what it would take for her to break off the romance.Flustered, she responded that she would break up if she knew he had beencheating on her. According to Naz’s friends, the very next day, Wilhere broughtin her boyfriend’s confidential auditing files and showed her several instancesof his infidelities, which had been circled in red. Naz felt betrayed, but alsoguilty, because Wilhere blamed her for failing to know and report herboyfriend’s ethical lapses herself; after all, she had audited him on severaloccasions. Obviously, she had missed his “withhold.” She confronted herboyfriend and he confessed. That was the end of their relationship.7Another time, Naz was asked what her “ideal scene for 2-D”—in other words, herdream date—would be. It was eating sushi and going ice-skating. But she wonderedwhy that was important.One of her assignments was to study a bulletin of Hubbard’s titled “TheResponsibilities of Leaders.” It is Hubbard’s deconstruction of the lives of thenineteenth-century South American military leader Simón Bolívar and hisferociously protective mistress, a socialite named Manuela Sáenz. Bolívar,Hubbard writes, “was a military commander without peer in history. Why he wouldfail and die an exile to be later deified is thus of great interest. Whatmistakes did he make?” Sáenz, his consort, “was a brilliant, beautiful and ablewoman. She was loyal, devoted, quite comparable to Bolivar, far above the cut ofaverage humanoids. Why then did she live a vilified outcast, receive suchviolent social rejection and die of poverty and remain unknown to history? Whatmistakes did she make?”Hubbard’s analysis was that Bolívar knew how to do only one thing brilliantly—tolead men in battle—and therefore he tended to resort to military solutions whendiplomacy or politics would better serve. “He was too good at this one thing,”Hubbard observes. “So he never looked to any other skill and he never evendreamed there was any other way.” Bolívar failed to use his immense authority toreward his friends and punish his enemies; thus his friends deserted him and hisenemies grew stronger. Craving glory and the love of his people, Bolívardisdained the bloody intrigues that might have kept him in power. “He neverbegan to recognize a suppressive and never considered anyone needed killingexcept on a battlefield,” Hubbard coldly sums up. “His addiction to the mostunstable drug in history—fame—killed Bolivar.”Manuela Sáenz might have saved him. She had qualities that he lacked, but she,too, made mistakes. For all her cleverness, she never contrived to make Bolívarmarry her, which would have given her the standing that she badly needed. “Shewas utterly devoted, completely brilliant and utterly incapable of bringing offan action of any final kind,” Hubbard notes. “She violated the power formula innot realizing that she had power.” She should have taken on the portfolio ofBolívar’s secret police chief (as Mary Sue did for Hubbard). “She was notruthless enough to make up for his lack of ruthlessness and not provident enoughto make up for his lack of providence,” Hubbard writes. “She was an actress forthe theater alone.”In Hubbard’s view, the moral of Bolívar and Sáenz’s tragedy is that those withpower must use it. Someone close to power, like Manuela, has to dedicate herselfto enlarging the strength of her partner. “Real powers are developed by tightconspiracies of this kind,” Hubbard writes. If Manuela had been willing tosupport Bolívar completely, Hubbard concludes, she would have been a trulyhistoric figure, rather than being “unknown even in the archives of her countryas the heroine she was.”Nazanin Boniadi was obviously being groomed for leadership. Why else would shebe reading about Bolívar and Sáenz? But what lesson was she supposed to draw?She was puzzled by the demands the church was placing on her, which had littleto do with human rights. Along with the security checks and the coursework, Nazwas told to have her braces taken off and was given very expensive beautytreatments. Wilhere informed her that the “director” of the special project haddecided that her hair had too much red in it, so a stylist to the stars came tothe Celebrity Centre to darken and highlight her hair. Then came the shoppingspree. Wilhere took Naz to Rodeo Drive and spent twenty thousand dollars for hernew wardrobe.Finally, Naz and Wilhere flew to New York, first class. She guessed that themission would finally be revealed to her. They stopped at the New York Org,ostensibly on routine business, but there they happened to run into Tom Cruise.Tommy Davis was with him. Although it all seemed like a happy coincidence, Nazwas a little flustered. Not only was Cruise the biggest star in the world, hehad also just been accorded the highest honor in Scientology. She said to him,“Very well done, sir.” (Later she was corrected for saying that, because youdon’t commend your senior.)Cruise was charming. He said that he and Davis were headed over to the EmpireState Building and then to Nobu for some sushi—why didn’t they join them?Afterward, they all went skating at Rockefeller Center, which was closed to thepublic while they were on the rink. It was beginning to seem a little tooperfect. She spent that first night with Cruise in the Trump Tower, where he hadtaken an entire floor for his entourage.Cruise invited Naz to hang out on the set of War of the Worlds, which wasshooting in Athens, New York, the next morning. At the end of the day, Davisaccompanied her back to the city. In the limo, he handed Naz a non-disclosureagreement. There was no lawyer present, and she wasn’t given a copy of what shesigned. He informed her that the “mission” was now off the table. This—therelationship with Cruise—was far more important. Davis warned that if she didanything to upset Cruise he would personally destroy her.Naz wasn’t resistant. She wanted to help the world, and she had faith thatScientology could do that. Cruise was dazzling. Scientology was deeply importantto both of them. It was obviously meant to be, so why question it?According to several knowledgeable sources, within a few weeks Naz moved intoCruise’s house. Davis and Jessica Feshbach were constantly tutoring her in howto behave toward the star. One evening, she and Cruise had dinner with severalScientologists, including Tommy Davis and Cruise’s niece, Lauren Haigney, whowas in the Sea Org and was posted to Gold Base. She had been Katy Haggis’s bestfriend all through their childhood. They were at the Delphian School together.At the dinner, Lauren talked about her friendship with Katy, and how she haddecided to break off their relationship when Katy said she was a lesbian. Nazwas shocked, not just by the comment but by the fact that everyone agreed withher decision.8In December, Cruise took Naz to his vacation house in Telluride, where they werejoined by David and Shelly Miscavige. While they were at Cruise’s retreat, Davidand Shelly watched a screener of Million Dollar Baby. Afterward, Miscavige saidit had been difficult to sit through. He complained about what a poor example ofa Scientologist Haggis was, and said that he needed to get back on the Bridgeand stop making such awful, low-tone films. Cruise agreed. “He needs to get hisethics in,” he remarked.Naz was having an awful menstrual period, and she wanted to beg off the festivedinner they had planned, but she knew she was obliged to play the hostess.Still, she felt miserable and her mind was foggy. A couple of times, Miscavigeaddressed comments to her, and she couldn’t quite understand what he said.Miscavige speaks in a rapid-fire Philly brogue, and Naz had to ask him to repeathimself more than once. The next day, both Davis and Cruise dressed her down fordisrespecting the church leader—specifically, for “insulting his TR 1.” InScientology lingo, that refers to the basic Training Routine about communicatingwith another person. Naz had embarrassed Miscavige because he wasn’t able to gethis message across. Davis said that her conduct was inexcusable. If she was inpain, she should have taken a Tylenol.With his characteristic intensity, Cruise himself later explained theseriousness of the situation: “You don’t get it. It goes like this.” He raisedhis hand over his head. “First, there’s LRH.” He moved his hand down a fewinches. “Then, there is COB.” Bringing his hand down to his own eye level, hesaid, “Then there’s me.”Two weeks later, Jessica Feshbach told Naz to pack her things. Cruise was toobusy to say good-bye. Naz’s last glimpse was of him working out in his home gym.Davis later explained to her that Cruise had simply changed his mind about therelationship, deciding that he needed someone with more power. But the star waswilling to make amends by paying for a package that would allow her to attain OTVII. Continuing up the Bridge would help her deal with her grief and loss, Davisassured her.In February 2005, Naz went to Clearwater to take the courses. At first, she wastreated like a VIP, but soon one of her friends noticed dramatic changes inher—she was weeping all the time. Naz confided that she had just gone through awrenching breakup with Tom Cruise. The shocked friend immediately reported herto Ethics. Naz was assigned a condition of Treason and ordered to do reparationsfor the damages she had done to the group by revealing her relationship withCruise. She was made to dig ditches and scrub public toilets with a toothbrush.Finally, in June, she worked her way back into good standing with the church,but she was ordered to stay away from the Celebrity Centre. Davis advised her togo live in some far corner of the world and never utter another word about TomCruise.9The search for a new mate for the star now went beyond Scientologists. Cruisebriefly courted the Colombian actress Sofía Vergara, whom he met at a pre-Oscarparty hosted by Will and Jada Pinkett Smith, but that relationship dissolvedwhen Vergara refused to become a Scientologist. The religion was a crucialfactor, both for Cruise and for the church. Cruise was particularly interestedin Jennifer Garner. Other actresses were invited to the Celebrity Centre toaudition for what they believed was a role in the Mission: Impossible series.The names included Kate Bosworth, Jessica Alba, Lindsay Lohan, ScarlettJohansson—and Katie Holmes.Holmes was an ingenue with almond-shaped brown eyes, who described herself as atwenty-six-year-old virgin. She had been a top student at an all-girls Catholichigh school in Toledo, Ohio, but like Tommy Davis, she had dropped out ofColumbia University after a single semester. Soon she was starring on theteenage soap opera Dawson’s Creek and had a modest film career in coquettishroles. Church researchers discovered an interview she had given to Seventeen inOctober 2004. “I think every young girl dreams about [her wedding],” Holmes toldthe magazine. “I used to think I was going to marry Tom Cruise.” She haddeveloped a crush on the actor when he appeared in Risky Business. At the time,she was four years old.Katie and Tom met in April 2005. “I was in love from the moment that I shook hishand for the first time,” she later told talk-show host Jay Leno. Cruise isfamous for his ardent courtship—flowers, jewelry, and imaginative dates. He tookKatie on a nighttime helicopter ride over Los Angeles, with take-out sushi.Within a little more than two weeks, she had moved into Cruise’s Beverly Hillsmansion, fired her manager and agent and replaced them with his representatives,and had begun to be accompanied by Jessica Feshbach, who was explained in pressinterviews as being her “best friend.”In May, Cruise appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show. The audience, nearly allwomen, were in a near-hysterical state of anticipation even before Cruise cameout on the stage, so his behavior has to be seen against a backdrop of a highlytitillated screaming mass, to which he responded like a surfer catching amassive wave. He pumped his fist in the air and knelt on the floor. “Something’shappened to you!” Winfrey exclaimed.“I’m in love!” he explained.“We’ve never seen you behave like this before!”“I know!” Cruise said, jumping backward onto her couch. Then he grabbedWinfrey’s hands and began wrestling with her. “You’re gone!” she kept saying.“You’re gone!” It was a scene of complete delirium.Cruise’s spectacular and highly public romance was overshadowing the promotionfor War of the Worlds, the movie he had just made with Spielberg, which would bereleased the following month. A few weeks after the Winfrey show, Cruise did aninterview with Today show host Matt Lauer as Holmes sat nearby. The questionswere friendly, and Cruise seemed happy and relaxed until Lauer mentioned thatHolmes had agreed to take up Scientology. “At this stage in your life, could yoube with someone who doesn’t have an interest?” Lauer asked.“You know, Scientology is something that you don’t understand,” Cruiseresponded. “It’s like, you could be a Christian and be a Scientologist, okay.”“So, it doesn’t replace religion,” Lauer offered.“It is a religion, because it’s dealing with the spirit. You as a spiritualbeing.”Lauer then asked about a comment that Cruise had recently made about actressBrooke Shields, who had written that antidepressants had helped her get throughher postpartum depression. “I’ve never agreed with psychiatry—ever!” Cruisesaid. He was dressed in black, his muscular arms on display; he had a stubblebeard and his hair was draped in bangs across his forehead. He radiated anathletic intensity and a barely contained fury. “As far as the Brooke Shieldsthing, look, you’ve got to understand, I really care about Brooke Shields. Ithink, here’s a wonderful and talented woman. And I want to see her do well. AndI know that psychiatry is a pseudo-science.”“But, Tom, if she said that this particular thing helped her feel better,whether it was the antidepressants or going to a counselor or psychiatrist,isn’t that enough?”“Matt, you have to understand this,” Cruise said, glowering. “Here we are today,where I talk out against drugs and psychiatric abuses of electric-shockingpeople—okay, against their will—of drugging children with them not knowing theeffect of these drugs. Do you know what Adderall is? Do you know Ritalin? Do youknow now that Ritalin is a street drug? Do you understand that?”“The difference is—”“No, no, Matt.”“This wasn’t against her will, though.”“Matt, Matt, Matt, Matt.”“But this wasn’t against her will.”“Matt, I’m asking you a question.”“I understand there’s abuse of all these things.”“No, you see, here’s the problem,” Cruise said. “You don’t know the history ofpsychiatry. I do.”Lauer was taken aback by Cruise’s aggressiveness, but he pressed on. “Do youexamine the possibility that these things do work for some people? That yes,there are abuses, and yes, maybe they’ve gone too far in some areas. Maybe thereare too many kids on Ritalin. Maybe electric shock—”“Too many kids on Ritalin?” Cruise said, shaking his head. “Matt.”“Aren’t there examples where it works?”“Matt, Matt, Matt, you don’t even—you’re glib. You don’t even know what Ritalinis.” He said there were ways that Shields could solve her depression—hementioned diet and exercise—other than drugs. “And there are ways of doing itwithout that, so that we don’t end up in a brave new world. The thing that I’msaying about Brooke is that there’s misinformation, okay. And she doesn’tunderstand the history of psychiatry. She doesn’t understand in the same waythat you don’t understand it, Matt.”SCIENTOLOGY’S HISTORY OF psychiatry holds it responsible for many of the illsthat have affected humanity—war, racism, ethnic cleansing, terrorism—all in thepursuit of social control and profit. The church has opened an exhibit,“Psychiatry: An Industry of Death,” on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. Itdescribes the often grisly and benighted practices that have characterized theevolution of the profession, including madhouses, lobotomies, electroshocktherapy, and the proliferation of psychiatric drugs to treat spurious diagnoses.Scientology views this history as a long march by psychiatrists to manipulatehuman behavior and institute world government.Although it’s not included in the exhibit, Hubbard’s chronology of psychiatryactually begins “five billion years ago” with the development of a particulartechnique that was developed “in the Maw Confederation of the Sixty-thirdGalaxy”:Take a sheet of glass and put it in front of the preclear—clear, very clearglass—which is supercooled, preferably about a −100 centigrade. You got that?Supercooled, you know? And then put the preclear right in front of thissupercooled sheet of glass and suddenly shove his face into the glass.…Takes about twenty seconds, then, to accomplish a total brainwash of a case.Now, if you wish to play God, as the whole-track psychiatrist did at that time,all you have to say at this time is, of course, “Go to Earth and be president,”or something like that, you know? And a thetan, being properly brainwashed now,will take off, and that’s that.Hubbard also blamed psychiatrists, allied with the tyrant Xenu, for carrying outgenocide in the Galactic Confederacy seventy-five million years ago. There areobvious parallels in this legend with the Nazi regime, which used doctors,including psychiatrists, to carry out the extermination of the mentally ill,along with homosexuals, Gypsies, and Jews; and also by the Soviet government,which employed psychiatrists to diagnose political dissidents and lock themaway. Hubbard lived through these shameful events, and they no doubt colored hisimagination.After Hubbard’s death, Miscavige continued the campaign. In 1995, he told theInternational Association of Scientologists that the church’s goals for the newmillennium were to “place Scientology at the absolute center of society” and to“eliminate psychiatry in all its forms.” The Citizens Commission on HumanRights, a lobby group created by the Church of Scientology that runs thepsychiatry museum, maintains that no mental diseases have ever been proven toexist. In this view, psychiatrists have been responsible for the Holocaust,apartheid, and even 9/11. The commission is not above bending the truth to makeits point. The president of CCHR, Dave Figueroa, asserts that Osama bin Laden’schief deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was a psychiatrist who took control of binLaden’s “thought patterns.” “Whatever type of drugs that Zawahiri used to makethat change in bin Laden, we don’t know,” Figueroa explained. “We know there wasa real change in that guy’s attitude.” This view is reiterated in the terrorismportion of the museum. (In fact, Zawahiri is a general surgeon, not apsychiatrist.)10CCHR’s main effort has been an international campaign against the use ofpsychiatric drugs, especially for children. The surgeon general of the UnitedStates issued a report in 2001 claiming that more than twenty percent ofchildren ages nine to seventeen had a diagnosable mental or addictive disorder,and that four million American children suffered from major mental illness.There is obviously an immense market for medications to treat such disorders.About ten percent of Americans over the age of six are on antidepressants, andantipsychotic drugs are the top-selling category of drugs in the country. Theyhave become a plague on the schoolgrounds of America, with indiscriminateprescriptions creating a new culture of drug dependency—one that thepharmaceutical industry and the medical profession bear some responsibility for.Haggis has been a substantial supporter of the CCHR. As a boy, he says, he spentmost of his days staring out the window, daydreaming—a candidate for anattention deficit disorder diagnosis. “I identified with the oddballs and themisfits,” he said. “Those who conform have very little chance of making adifference in life.” He was sure that if his parents had medicated him, he mightnever have become a writer. He hosted fund-raisers for CCHR in his home. “Isimply believe that psychiatric drugs are over-prescribed, especially tochildren,” he said. “I think that is a crime.”Scientologists have been seeking ways of criminalizing psychiatric remedies. Inthe same period that Cruise was chastising Brooke Shields for takingantidepressants, Kirstie Alley and Kelly Preston were testifying before statelawmakers in Florida, who passed a bill, written in part by Scientologists, thatwould hold schoolteachers criminally liable for suggesting to parents that theirchildren might be suffering from a mental health condition, such as attentiondeficit disorder. Governor Jeb Bush vetoed the bill. Governor Jon Huntsman didthe same in Utah. Similar bills have been pushed by the CCHR in other states. Inher Florida testimony, Kirstie Alley held up photographs of children who hadcommitted suicide after taking psychotropic drugs. “None of these children werepsychotic before they took these drugs,” she asserted, sobbing so hard she couldbarely speak. “None of these children were suicidal before they took thesedrugs.”Some drug makers have covered up studies that indicate an increased danger ofsuicidal or violent thoughts caused by psychotropic medicines. Eli Lilly, forinstance, suppressed data showing that patients who were taking the popular drugProzac—the only antidepressant certified as safe for children—were twelve timesmore likely to attempt suicide than patients taking similar medications.Antidepressants have been implicated in a number of schoolyard shootings, suchas the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, where two students killed twelve oftheir classmates and a teacher. One of the killers was taking Luvox at the time.Adderall—one of the drugs cited by Cruise—is an amphetamine often prescribed forattention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; it sometimes causes increasedaggression in children and adolescents. Ritalin, the most common drug prescribedfor ADHD, is similar to cocaine in its potential for addiction. According to ThePrimary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, a person usingRitalin, Adderall, or other cocaine-like drugs “can experience nervousness,restlessness, agitation, suspiciousness, paranoia, hallucinations and delusions,impaired cognitive functions, delirium, violence, suicide, and homicide.”But people who are taking antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood-stabilizingdrugs are already at a higher risk for suicide or violent behavior. One of thedangers of prescribing an antidepressant is that it may give the patient thestimulus he or she needs to act on suicidal impulses that are already present.Sudden withdrawal from antidepressants can prompt suicidal thoughts as well.Several studies have found that the risk of suicide was just as great for thosewho don’t receive antidepressants as for those who do; over time, however,patients taking antidepressants are less likely to kill themselves. Suchmedications now come with warnings about increased suicidal behavior. And yet,one study noted the steady decline of overall suicide rates in the United Statessince fluoxetine (Prozac) was introduced in the American market. The authorsestimated that the drug was responsible for saving 33,600 lives between 1988 and2002.There are numerous examples of Scientologists who have considered or actuallycommitted suicide, or engaged in violence, who might have been helped if theyhad taken psychotropic medicines. In Buffalo, New York, on March 13, 2003 (L.Ron Hubbard’s birthday), twenty-eight-year-old Jeremy Perkins stabbed his motherseventy-seven times. He was a schizophrenic with a history of violence andhallucinations, who had rejected psychiatric treatment because he was aScientologist. Hana Eltringham, who had been Hubbard’s chief deputy, believesthat Scientology itself caused her own shattered mental state. For years afterattaining OT III, Eltringham had frequent thoughts of suicide. The unremittingmigraines and voices in her head made her despair. Several times, she came closeto jumping off the top floor of the church’s headquarters in Clearwater, butrestrained herself because she was worried that it would bring disgrace upon thechurch and Hubbard’s teachings. It was only when she left the church and begantaking Prozac that her headaches and her suicidal thoughts went away. “It haschanged my life,” she claimed. Her friend Mary Florence Barnett, ShellyMiscavige’s mother, had similar symptoms—constant headaches and suicidalthoughts. She confided to Eltringham that she wanted to kill herself in order tostop the suppressive body thetans from taking over her mind. Barnett eventuallywent outside the official church to receive Scientology counseling, a hereticalpractice known in Scientology as squirreling. (The church denies that Barnettbecame involved with dissident Scientologists, but if she had, that would haveplaced David and Shelly Miscavige in a compromised position with the church.They would have been Potential Trouble Sources if they failed to disconnect fromher.) On September 8, 1985, Barnett’s body was found. She had been shot threetimes in the chest and once through the temple with a rifle. Both of her wristswere slashed. She left two suicide notes. The Los Angeles County MedicalExaminer ruled her death a suicide.In 2007, Kyle Brennan, twenty years old, who was not a Scientologist, went tostay with his father, a member of the church, in Clearwater. Brennan was takingLexapro, an antidepressant heavily promoted by its manufacturer, ForestLaboratories. He was also under the care of a psychiatrist. According to courtrecords, Brennan’s father, Thomas, was ordered to “handle” his son. ThomasBrennan’s auditor was Denise Miscavige Gentile, David Miscavige’s twin sister.She spoke on the phone to Kyle’s mother, who was not a Scientologist, and urgedher to enroll her son in Narconon, the church’s drug-treatment program. Hismother refused, pointing out that the program costs approximately $25,000;moreover, Kyle was not a drug addict. She sued, charging that church officialshad ordered Thomas Brennan to lock his son’s Lexapro in the trunk of his car.Days after that, Kyle shot himself to death with a .357 Magnum that his fatherkept in his bedside table. (The suit was dismissed for lack of evidence.)The long history of humanity’s inadequate attempts to deal with depression, andthe manifold ways in which insanity expresses itself, have never yielded a clearpath. Tragedies such as the suicide of Kyle Brennan demonstrate the danger ofdogmatic interpretations of psychiatry, such as those offered by Tom Cruise andother Scientology celebrities on the subject. The American PsychiatricAssociation felt so threatened by Cruise’s statements on the Today show that thepresident of the organization issued a statement affirming that mental illnessesare real medical conditions. “It is irresponsible for Mr. Cruise to use hismovie publicity tour to promote his own ideological views and deter people withmental illness from getting the care they need,” said Steven S. Sharfstein, thepresident of the APA. But at the 2005 annual meeting of the InternationalAssociation of Scientologists, Mike Rinder, who had been let out of the Hole forthe occasion, credited Cruise with persuading the Food and Drug Administrationto post suicide warnings on the labels of two psychiatric drugs within days ofhis interview with Lauer.“If someone wants to get off drugs, I can help them,” Cruise told the Germanmagazine Der Spiegel, in April 2005. “I myself have helped hundreds of peopleget off drugs.”HAGGIS HAD SENT a rough cut of his movie Crash to the Toronto Film Festival, animportant venue for independent films that are looking for distribution. InSeptember 2004, the movie met its first audience at the Elgin Theatre, anelegant old vaudeville house downtown, not far from the spot where Paul soldtickets at the soft-porn theater his professor used to run.As he watched the movie, Haggis was appalled. Everything that was wrong wasglaringly apparent on the huge screen. He sat glumly waiting for it to end,calculating what could be salvaged. So when the audience rose to its feet at theend, cheering, Haggis couldn’t believe what was happening. Lion’s Gate Filmsbought Crash for $3.5 million and scheduled it for release the following spring.Crash opened quietly in April 2005. There were no billboards or bus signs, whichwere already touting the arrival of War of the Worlds in June. The reviews forCrash were passionate but polarized. Roger Ebert gave it four stars, calling it“a movie of intense fascination.” A. O. Scott, who reviewed it for The New YorkTimes, was less infatuated. It was a “frustrating movie,” he wrote, “full ofheart and devoid of life; crudely manipulative when it tries hardest to besubtle; and profoundly complacent in spite of its intention to unsettle anddisturb.” There was no actual premiere, just a screening at the Academy Theateron Wilshire Boulevard, and no grand party afterward. Haggis and his family wentout to dinner.Despite the conflicting reviews and limited distribution, a groundswell wasbuilding for the movie, driven entirely by audiences who were caught up in anational conversation over race and class that the movie prompted. It would goon to earn nearly $100 million in international sales. Million Dollar Baby hadjust won the Academy Award for Best Picture that February. Haggis was writing aJames Bond movie, Casino Royale, in addition to the Eastwood picture Flags ofOur Fathers. He was flying.Tom Cruise’s career was headed in the opposite direction. Haggis had seen him atthe Vanity Fair Oscar party. Cruise and Tommy Davis arrived on Ducatimotorcycles, wearing black jackets, and were let in the back door of Morton’sSteakhouse in Beverly Hills. They said hello to Haggis, but nothing more. Pollsshowed that Cruise was still ranked as the most powerful actor in Hollywood, andeven the most powerful celebrity in the world, but he was also ranked number oneas the celebrity that people would least like to have as their best friend.When Cruise returned to Gold Base, Miscavige showed off his Harley-DavidsonV-rod motorcycle, which had been custom-painted a candy-apple red over a brushednickel surface. Miscavige’s brother-in-law, John Brousseau, known for hiselegant craftsmanship, had done the work. In addition to overseeing therenovation of the Freewinds, Brousseau had installed bars on the doors of theHole shortly after Rathbun escaped.According to Brousseau, “Cruise was drooling” over the motorcycle. “God, couldyou paint my bike like that?” he asked. Brousseau looked at Miscavige, whonodded. Cruise brought in two motorcycles to be painted, a Triumph Rocket IIIand a Honda Rune. Spielberg had given him the Honda after the filming of War ofthe Worlds; it had already been custom-painted by the set designer. Brousseauhad to take each motorcycle apart completely and nickel-plate all the partsbefore painting them.11 Cruise drove the newly painted Rune, with Katie on theback, to the fans’ screening of his movie at Grauman’s Chinese Theatre in June.[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_017_r1.jpg]Tom Cruise and David Miscavige at the Church of Scientology opening in centralMadrid, 2004After that, Brousseau was regularly assigned to work on special projects forCruise. Shelly Miscavige had drafted Brousseau and seven other Sea Org members,along with many of Cruise’s employees at Odin Productions, to work for more thantwo weeks rehabilitating Cruise’s leased nine-bedroom mansion on Alpine Drive inBeverly Hills—painting, fixing the roof, doing cabinet work, stretching thecarpet, rewiring, pressure-washing the tennis court, weeding and planting,repairing the irrigation system, and even reorganizing the clothes in theclosets. In the last week, Brousseau says, he had at least a hundred contractorsunder his direction in order to get the house ready for Cruise.Brousseau and a Sea Org executive, Steve Marlowe, also oversaw the renovationson a Blue Bird bus, like Hubbard’s, that Cruise had purchased. Later, Cruisebought another bus, which he called The Silver Screen. Brousseau spent threemonths commuting to the Marathon Coach factory in Coburg, Oregon, to oversee theretrofitting of the forty-foot vehicle into an elaborate motor home. Brousseauestimates that the redesign cost about $1.5 million, but that doesn’t includehis labor or that of Sea Org members in the Golden Era prop department, whomanufactured the furniture, countertops, and cabinetry. In 2006, Brousseau alsocustomized a limousine for the star, using the body of a Ford Excursion that hesays Cruise acquired using the Scientology fleet discount. Katie was pregnantand wanted a new vehicle with a baby seat. Miscavige had wanted to impress thecouple by renovating the Excursion at a local custom shop, but the job waspoorly done. Miscavige purchased another Excursion for Cruise to replace the onethat had been botched. Meanwhile, Brousseau spent the next six months personallyrebuilding the original Excursion. He ripped the vehicle down to its frame andinstalled handmade reclining seats and wood paneling fashioned from a burl of aeucalyptus tree that had been toppled in a storm. He spent about two thousandhours on the project. The materials were paid for by Cruise’s productioncompany, but according to Brousseau, his labor, and that of about ten other SeaOrg members, was not compensated. “It was a half-million-dollar beauty all doneby me, with other folks from Scientology,” Brousseau said.Brousseau had even carved a matching Montblanc pen out of the burl, its ownhidden storage case in the vehicle. When Cruise showed it to Katie, she wasdazzled. She turned to Brousseau and asked, “Oh, J.B., did you make that?”“Don’t thank me,” Brousseau quickly responded. “I’m just the hammer. This—,” hesaid, pointing to Miscavige, “is the hand that wields me.”Cruise, who became a pilot while filming Top Gun, keeps a hangar at an airportin Burbank for his airplane collection. Sea Org members completely renovated thehangar, installing a luxurious office that had been fabricated at Golden EraProductions. Brousseau says that the furniture—a dry bar, table and chairs,desks, et cetera—was milled at an RPF base in Los Angeles. Brousseau took dozensof photographs documenting his handiwork on the star’s behalf.No member of the Sea Org has spent more time in Cruise’s service than TommyDavis, who was viewed within the church as the star’s special handler andpersonal assistant. Although Davis maintains that he provided similar servicesfor other celebrities, his assignment to Cruise was his primary duty between2000 and 2004. However, he asserted, “None of the Church staff involved werecoerced in any way to assist Mr. Cruise. Church staff, and indeed Churchmembers, hold Mr. Cruise in very high regard and are honored to assist him.”IN JUNE 2006, Shelly Miscavige disappeared.She had spent her whole life conveying orders and gathering intelligence for apowerful, erratic, domineering church leader, first for Hubbard and then for herhusband. She and Miscavige were always respectful toward each other in public,if not openly affectionate. As he gained power within the church, she began tosee the two of them as reincarnations of Simón Bolívar and Manuela Sáenz, andthe lesson she drew from that previous existence was that she needed to befiercely protective of her mate, and to keep him from making the kinds ofmistakes that his character was destined to commit. In the eyes of some Sea Orgmembers, Shelly was brittle and imperious, but Rathbun noted that she sometimesobjected when Miscavige’s physical assaults threatened to get out of hand. Noone else did.That spring, Shelly returned from a Freewinds voyage before her husband did, andin his absence she decided to arrange the Org Board herself. There were nosettled posts, executives were still churning in the Hole, and the managementstructure was a mess. Taking matters into her own hands, Shelly made a number ofappointments.Soon after her husband came back, Shelly’s mood visibly changed. Herbrother-in-law, John Brousseau, observed that she looked cowed: “The bulldog wasgone.” Shortly before she disappeared, she asked Mike Rinder if Dave still hadhis wedding ring on. Then she vanished. Although a missing-person report hasbeen filed, the Los Angeles Police Department will not comment on herwhereabouts. She was escorted to her father’s funeral in August 2007. That’s thelast time she was seen in public. Former Sea Org members say she is beingguarded at a church facility in Running Springs, California, near LakeArrowhead, one of the several repositories for Hubbard’s writings. It gets coldthere in the winter. Miscavige sent Shelly a sweater and a pair of gloves forChristmas.In November 2007, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes married in a fifteenth-centurycastle outside of Rome. Among the celebrities attending were Jennifer Lopez andMarc Anthony, Will and Jada Pinkett Smith, Jenna Elfman, and even BrookeShields. Once again, David Miscavige served as the best man.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Cruise’s attorney says that Sea Org members were not directed to salute himand that he has had many cordial exchanges with them.2 According to Tommy Davis, “From their perspective, it was the least they coulddo to express their affection.”3 According to Tommy Davis, “These incidents are pure fantasy by Tom De Vocht.”4 The case against Cartwright was settled out of court.5 Cruise’s attorney notes, “Mr. Cruise has never expressed anything but supportand respect for the work on Battlefield Earth.”6 Cruise’s attorney says Cruise did not complain about not having a girlfriendat the opening of the church in Madrid.7 The church has stated, “Scientology ministers maintain and practice a code ofconduct known as the Auditor’s Code. The Auditor’s Code provides standards toensure that priest-penitent communications remain strictly confidential. Allsuch information is kept strictly confidential by a Scientology minister and theChurch.”8 Cruise’s attorney says that this conversation never took place. According toTommy Davis: “Katy did not lose her friend because she admitted she was gay, shelost her friend because Katy lied to her about being gay.”9 Several sources independently told me of Boniadi’s experiences with TomCruise. All their recollections were consistent. Cruise’s attorney says that noScientology executives set him up with girlfriends, and that no femaleScientologist that Cruise dated moved into his home.10 Also in the exhibit is a photograph of Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas, known asAbu Dadah, who is described as a psychiatrist and the mastermind of the Madridtrain bombings in 2004. Yarkas, an al-Qaeda fund-raiser, was a used-car salesmanwho had little or nothing to do with the Madrid bombings. In a list of 218international known Islamist militants, the only one who ever studied psychologywas Ali Mohammed, an Egyptian operative who helped plan the American Embassybombings in 1998. “Psychologists are conspicuous by their absence,” SteffenHertog, a lecturer in comparative politics at the London School of Economics,wrote me in a private communication. “The pattern is similar for other types ofextremist groups: Among 215 leading German Nazis with known higher education,there are only 2 psychologists, compared to 71 lawyers.” In another CitizensCommission on Human Rights report, titled “Chaos and Terror: Manufactured byPsychiatry” (www.cchrstl.org/documents/terror.pdf[http://www.cchrstl.org/documents/terror.pdf]), the supposed mastermind of theMadrid bombings is now said to be “Moroccan psychiatrist Abu Hafizah.” No suchperson exists on the list of known Islamist terrorists, nor is anyone by thatname attached to the Madrid bombings.11 The church denies Brousseau’s account. Cruise’s attorney denies that hisclient ever saw Miscavige’s motorcycle and claims,“We have photographic evidenceshowing the actual painter doing the job. It’s not Mr. Brousseau.” However, theattorney did not provide the photos. Brousseau did provide photos of the work hesays he did on each of Cruise’s vehicles he claimed to have worked on."},{"pageContent":"[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_018_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"10[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_L02_r1.jpg]THE INVESTIGATIONProposition 8, the California initiative to ban marriage between same-sexcouples, appeared on the ballot in 2008. Paul Haggis was deeply involved infighting the initiative, marching in demonstrations and contributingfinancially. His advocacy placed a strain on his relationship with Scientology.For several years, he had been concerned about the bigotry he found inside thechurch, especially when it was directed at his two gay daughters. Katy, inparticular, had expressed her discomfort with the way she was treated at theCelebrity Centre, where she had been taking some courses. She had decided to goto another Scientology mission where she wouldn’t feel so judged.One evening, Paul and Deborah went to a small fund-raising dinner at JohnTravolta and Kelly Preston’s house. Deborah and Kelly were on the parents’committee to raise funds for a new Delphi school in Santa Monica. Several othercouples were there, all of them Operating Thetans. One of the guests referred tothe waiter as a faggot.It is difficult to imagine such open bigotry in Hollywood, a liberal stronghold,but especially in the home of John Travolta, who has dodged rumors of his sexualorientation since he first became a star. Despite the onslaught of publicity andsexual harassment suits that have been lodged against the star over the years,many Scientologists, including Haggis, believed that Travolta was not gay.Haggis had been impressed by his apparently loving relationship with his wifeand children; but it is also common to assume that homosexuality is handled atthe OT III level, where the body thetans that cause such problems can be auditedaway. The other diners may have been so convinced of Travolta’s sexualorientation that they felt free to display their prejudice. In any case,Travolta reprimanded his guest, saying that such remarks were not tolerated intheir home.Haggis was flooded with admiration for the firm but graceful way that the starhad handled the situation. After the other guests had departed, Haggis andTravolta had a conversation in his small study. They talked about the bigotrythey had observed in the church. Haggis confided that Katy had been made to feelunwanted at the Celebrity Centre. Travolta said that Hubbard’s writings had beenmisinterpreted, and he later provided some references that Katy could use todefend herself.When Hubbard wrote Dianetics, in 1950, he reflected the prevailing socialprejudices, including the psychiatric community, which considered homosexualitya mental illness. (It was not removed from the American PsychiatricAssociation’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders until 1973.)“The sexual pervert”—by which Hubbard meant the homosexual—“is actually quiteill physically,” he writes. The following year, he published the Tone Scale inScience of Survival. Near the bottom, at 1.1 on the scale, is the CovertlyHostile personality. People in this state engage in casual sex, sadism—andhomosexual activity. Hubbard describes this as “the most dangerous and wickedlevel.… Here is the person who smiles when he inserts a knife blade between yourvertebrae.” “This is the level of the pervert, the hypocrite, the turncoat. Thisis the level of the subversive.… A 1.1 is the most dangerously insane person insociety and is likely to cause the most damage.… Such people should be takenfrom the society as rapidly as possible and uniformly institutionalized.”Another way of dealing with them, he writes, is “to dispose of them quietly andwithout sorrow.” He went on: “The sudden and abrupt deletion of all individualsoccupying the lower bands of the Tone Scale from the social order would resultin an almost instant rise in the cultural tone and would interrupt the dwindlingspiral into which any society may have entered.”Hubbard occasionally moderated his stance, although he never entirely repudiatedor discarded his prejudice. In 1952, he said, “Homosexuality is about as seriousas sneezes.” In 1965, he refers in an executive letter to a “squirrel” who, hesays, “was sacked for homosexuality and theft.” Another disaffectedScientologist, Hubbard notes in the same letter, “is a set-up for an arrest as ahomosexual.” Two years later, when social attitudes toward gays were slowlychanging, he declared, “It has never been any part of my plans to regulate orattempt to regulate the private lives of individuals.” However, becauseeverything Hubbard wrote is sacrosanct in the church, these early views areindelibly fixed in the minds of many Scientologists. Long after the founder’sdeath it was still generally believed that auditing would “sort out”homosexuality. Gays in the church were frequently pressed to buy courses or takeadditional auditing in order to handle their condition.The ambivalence in the church over the question of sexual orientation is evidentin its treatment of Travolta. Over the years, the church has acted to protecthis reputation. Marty Rathbun has said there were many allegations that hehelped “to make go away.” He sometimes worked in concert with Travolta’sattorneys, attempting to keep stories out of the press. In 2003, a gay artist,Michael Pattinson, sued the church, Travolta, and more than twenty otherindividuals, claiming that the star had been held up as an example of howScientology can cure homosexuality. Pattinson said that he spent twenty-fiveyears in the church, and half a million dollars, trying to change his sexualorientation, without success. (That case was voluntarily withdrawn following anavalanche of countersuits. Both Pattinson and his attorney say they were driveninto bankruptcy.)Haggis identified with homosexuals because they were a minority. They were theunderdogs. They were also two of his daughters. The backers of Proposition 8were using scare tactics to drive their campaign, claiming that homosexuals weregoing to take over the schools and teach people to be gay. Lauren Haggisactually heard people saying that. Then someone pointed her to a website thatlisted the proposition’s backers. The Church of Scientology of San Diego was onthe list. “I was just floored,” she said. “And so I sent an e-mail to my sistersand my dad saying, um, what’s going on?”Haggis began peppering Tommy Davis with e-mails, demanding that the churchsupport efforts to reverse the marriage ban. “I am going to an anti Prop 8 rallyin a couple of hours,” he wrote on November 11, 2008, a week after theinitiative passed with 52 percent of the state’s voters. “When can we expect thepublic statement?” Davis responded with a proposed letter that would go to theSan Diego media, saying that the church had been “erroneously listed among thesupporters of Proposition 8.” “ ‘Erroneous’ doesn’t cut it,” Haggis fired back.“The church may have had the luxury of not taking a position on this issuebefore, but after taking a position, even erroneously, it can no longer standneutral.” He demanded that the church openly declare itself in favor of gayrights. “Anything less won’t do.”Davis stopped responding. When Haggis prodded him again, Davis admitted that thecorrection to the San Diego media was never actually sent. “To be honest I wasdismayed when our emails (which I thought were communications between us) werebeing cc’d to your daughters,” he wrote. Davis was frustrated because, as heexplained to Haggis, the church avoids taking political stances.1 Davis insistedthat it wasn’t the “church” in San Diego that adopted a position against Prop 8.“It was one guy who somehow got it in his head it would be a neat idea and putChurch of Scientology San Diego on the list,” Davis insisted. “When I found out,I had it removed from the list.”As far as Davis was concerned, that should have been the end of the matter. Anyfurther actions on the part of the church would only call attention to amistaken position on an issue that the church wanted to go away. “Paul, I’vereceived no press inquiries,” he said. “If I were to make a statement on this itwould actually bring more attention to the subject than if we leave it be.”But Haggis refused to let the matter drop. “This is not a PR issue, it is amoral issue,” he wrote in February 2009. “Standing neutral is not an option.”In the final note of this exchange, Haggis conceded, “You were right: nothinghappened—it didn’t flap—at least not very much. But I feel we shamed ourselves.”Since Haggis’s children had been copied on the correspondence with Davis, ithelped clarify Lauren’s stance with the church. At first, Davis’s responses gaveher hope, but then she realized, “They’re just trying to minimize it as much aspossible.” After that, “I was totally done with the church.”The experience also helped her to see her father in a different light. “It’slike night and day from when I first moved in with him,” she said. “I didn’tknow that my dad loved me.”[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_L03_r1.jpg]BECAUSE HAGGIS STOPPED COMPLAINING, Davis felt that the issue had been laid torest. But, far from putting the matter behind him, Haggis began an investigationinto the church. His inquiry, much of it conducted online, echoed the actions ofthe lead character he was writing for Russell Crowe in The Next Three Days, whogoes on the Internet to research a way to break his wife out of jail.What is so striking about Haggis’s investigation is that few prominent figuresattached to the Church of Scientology have actually looked into the charges thathave surrounded their institution for many years. The church discourages suchexamination, telling its members that negative articles are “entheta” and willonly cause spiritual upset. In 1996, the church sent CDs to members to help thembuild their own websites, which would then link them to the Scientology site;included in the software was a filter that would block any sites containingmaterial that vilified the church or revealed esoteric doctrines. Keywords thattriggered the censorship were Xenu, OT III, and the names of prominentScientology critics.Although Haggis never used such a filter, one already existed in his mind.During his thirty-four years in the church he had purposely avoided asking toomany questions or reading materials that he knew would disparage his faith. Butnow, frustrated by his exchange with Davis, he began “poking around.” He cameupon an interview on YouTube with Tommy Davis that had been broadcast by CNN inMay 2008. “The worldwide interest in Scientology has never been higher,” Davisboasts on the show. “Scientology has grown more in the last five years than thelast five decades combined.” The anchor, John Roberts, asks Davis about thechurch’s policy of disconnection, in which followers are urged to separatethemselves from friends or family members who might be critical of theorganization. “This is a perfect example of how the Internet turns things andtwists things,” Davis responds. “There’s no such thing as disconnection asyou’re characterizing it. And certainly, we have to understand—”“Well, what is disconnection?” Roberts tries to interject.“Scientology is a new religion,” Davis continues, talking over the host. “Themajority of Scientologists in the world, they’re first generation. So theirfamily members aren’t going to be Scientologists.… So, certainly, someone who isa Scientologist is going to respect their family members’ beliefs—”“Well, what is disconnection?” Roberts asks again.“And we consider family to be a building block of any society, so anythingthat’s characterized as disconnection, or this kind of thing, it’s just nottrue. There isn’t any such policy.”Haggis knew this was a lie. His wife, Deborah, had disconnected from her parentstwice. When she was in her twenties and acting in Dallas, her mother andstepfather broke away from the church. They were close friends of HanaEltringham, who had stood up for them at their wedding, so when they had doubtsabout their faith, they went to see her. Eltringham was then counseling peoplewho were considering getting out of Scientology or other new religions. Shehelped Scientologists confront the contradictions that were implicit in theirfaith, such as Hubbard speaking of events that had taken place trillions orquadrillions of years in the past, although scientists estimate the age of theuniverse to be less than 14 billion years, or the fact that it has never beenshown that anyone has ever obtained any enhanced OT abilities. Eltringham alsotalked about the abuses she observed and experienced. “Hana told us how Sea Orgmembers were treated,” Mary Benjamin, Deborah’s mother, recalled, “how they werekept in a basement in Los Angeles and fed rice and beans if they didn’t keeptheir stats up. How, in the desert, in terrible heat, they would march in acircle for hours.”Like many active members of the church, the Benjamins kept money on account—intheir case, $2,500—for future courses they intended to take. Deborah’s motherinsisted on getting the money back. Deborah knew what a big deal that was forthe church. She didn’t speak to her parents for more than three years,automatically assuming that they must have been declared Suppressive Persons.But when her sister was about to get married, Deborah wrote to the InternationalJustice Chief, the Scientology official in charge of such matters, who said thatshe was allowed to see her parents as long as they didn’t say anything againstScientology. The Benjamins readily agreed.A decade later, however, Deborah went to Clearwater, intending to take someupper-level courses, and learned that the previous ruling no longer applied. Ifshe wanted to do more training, she would have to confront her parents’mistakes. The church recommended that she take the Potential TroubleSource/Suppressive Persons course.Many Scientologists have taken the same course. Deborah’s friend Kelly Prestonhad taken it as well. “I was PTS, but I didn’t realize it, and so I was told,‘You need to be on PTS/SP,’ ” Preston later recalled in her interview forCelebrity magazine. She discovered that her life was full of SuppressivePersons. “Being an artist and having a lot of theta, you really attract thosetype of people,” Preston said. (“Theta” is a Scientology term for life force.)“I ended up having to handle or disconnect from quite a few different people.”It took Deborah a year to complete the course, but it didn’t change her parents’status. She petitioned officials at the Celebrity Centre in Los Angeles forhelp. They put her on another program that took two more years to finish. Still,nothing changed. If she failed to “handle” her parents—by persuading them tomake amends to the church—she would have to disconnect not only from them butalso from everyone who spoke to them, including her siblings. She realized, “Itwas that, or else I had to give up being a Scientologist.” The fact that Paulrefused to disconnect from her parents posed yet another conflict.According to the church, Deborah’s parents had been part of a class-actionlawsuit against Scientology by disaffected members in 1987, which was dismissedthe following year.2 The church required them to denounce the anti-Scientologygroup and offer a “token” restitution. That meant performing community serviceand following a rehabilitation course, called A to E, for penitents seeking toget back into the church’s good graces; it includes repaying debts, takingadditional courses, and making public declarations of error. Deborah told herparents that if they wanted to remain in contact with her they had to follow thechurch’s procedures. Her parents, worried that they would also be cut off fromtheir grandson, agreed to perform community service. For three months theydelivered food in a Meals on Wheels program in Los Angeles. But the churchwasn’t satisfied. Deborah was told that if she maintained contact with herparents she would be labeled a Potential Trouble Source—a designation that wouldalienate her from the entire Scientology community and render her ineligible forfurther training. A senior official counseled her to agree to disconnect fromher parents and have them formally branded SPs. “Until then, they won’t turnaround and recognize their responsibilities,” he said.“Okay, fine,” Deborah responded. “Go ahead and declare them. Maybe it’ll getbetter.”The official then granted Deborah permission to begin upper-level coursework inClearwater.In August 2006, a formal notice on yellow parchment, called a “goldenrod,” wasposted at the Celebrity Centre declaring Deborah’s parents Suppressive Persons,explaining that they had withdrawn the money they had placed on deposit forfuture coursework and that they had associated with “squirrels”—that is, theyreceived unauthorized Scientology counseling. A month later, Mary Benjamin senther daughter a letter. “We tried to do what you asked, Deborah. We worked thewhole months of July & Aug. on A-E.” They gave the church back the $2,500 forthe courses that they never intended to take. After all that, she continued, achurch adjudicator had told them to hand out three hundred copies of L. RonHubbard’s booklet “The Way to Happiness” to libraries and to document eachexchange with photographs. Her parents had had enough. “If this can’t beresolved, we will have to say Good-Bye to you & James will lose hisGrand-Parents,” her mother wrote. “This is ridiculous.”In April 2007, Deborah received a letter from the lawyer who represented herparents, threatening a lawsuit for the right to visit their grandson. Deborahhad to hire an attorney. Eventually, the church relented. Deborah was summonedto the Celebrity Centre and shown a statement rescinding the decision, althoughshe wasn’t allowed to have a copy of it.WHILE HE WAS RESEARCHING on the Internet, Haggis came upon a series of articlesthat had run in the St. Petersburg Times3 beginning in June 2009, titled “TheTruth Rundown.” The paper has maintained a special focus on Scientology, sincethe church maintains such a commanding presence in Clearwater, which is adjacentto St. Petersburg. Although the paper and the church have frequently been atodds, the only interview that David Miscavige has ever given to a newspaperresulted in a rather flattering profile in the Times in 1998. (Since then,Miscavige has not spoken to the press at all.)In the series, Haggis learned for the first time that several of the topmanagers of the church had quietly defected—including Marty Rathbun. For severalyears, the word in the Scientology community was that Rathbun had died ofcancer. Mike Rinder, the chief spokesperson, and Tom De Vocht, the formerlandlord of all the church properties in Clearwater, were also speaking outabout the abuses that were taking place inside the top tier of management—mainlyat the hands of the church leader. Amy Scobee, who had overseen the CelebrityCentre in Los Angeles, pointed out that the reason no one outside of theexecutive circles knew of the abuse, even other Scientologists like Haggis, wasthat people were terrified of Miscavige—and not just physically. Their greatestfear was expulsion. “You don’t have any money. You don’t have job experience.You don’t have anything. And he could put you on the streets and ruin you.”Tommy Davis had produced nine senior church executives who told the Times thatthe abuse had never taken place. Dan Sherman, the church’s official Hubbardbiographer and Miscavige’s speechwriter, recounted a scene in which he observedMiscavige talking to an injured sparrow. “It was immensely tender,” Sherman toldthe reporters.Much of the abuse being alleged had taken place at Gold Base. Haggis had visitedthe place only once, in the early 1980s, when its existence was still a closelyheld secret. That was when he was preparing to direct the Scientology commercialthat was ultimately rejected. At first glance, it seemed like a spa, beautifuland restful; but he had been put off by the uniforms, the security, and themilitarized feel of the place.“At the top of the church, people were whacking folks about like Laurel andHardy,” Haggis said. He was embarrassed to admit that he had never even askedhimself where Rathbun and Rinder had gone. He decided to call Rathbun, who wasnow living on Galveston Bay in South Texas. Although the two men had never met,they were well known to each other. After being one of the most powerful figuresin Scientology, Rathbun was scraping together a living by freelancing stories tolocal newspapers and selling beer at a ballpark. He figured that South Texas wasabout as far from Los Angeles and Clearwater as he could hope to get. Haggis wasfloored when he learned that Rathbun had had to escape. He was also surprised tolearn that other friends, such as Jim Logan, the man who brought him into thechurch so long ago on the street corner in Ontario, had also fled or beendeclared Suppressive Persons. One of Haggis’s closest friends in the churchhierarchy, Bill Dendiu, told Haggis that he had escaped from Gold Base bydriving a car—actually, an Alfa Romeo convertible that Haggis had soldhim—through the fence. He still had scars on his forehead to show for that.“What kind of organization are we involved in where people just disappear?”Haggis wondered.He also came across a number of anti-Scientology websites, includingExscientologykids.com [http://Exscientologykids.com], which was created by JennaMiscavige Hill, the leader’s niece, who joined the Sea Org when she was twelve.For her and many others, formal education had stopped when they entered theorganization, leaving them ill prepared for life outside the church. Jenna saysthat for much of her early life, she was kept in a camp with other Sea Orgchildren and little adult supervision. They rarely saw their parents. “We ranourselves completely,” she recalled.For several years, Haggis had been working with a charity he established to setup schools in Haiti. These stories reminded him of the child slaves he hadencountered in that country. “They were ten, twelve years old, signingbillion-year contracts—and their parents go along with this!” he said of the SeaOrg children. “And they work morning, noon and night.… Scrubbing pots, manuallabor—that so deeply touched me. My God, it horrified me!”AFTER TOM CRUISE’S BEHAVIOR on Oprah and the Today show, Sumner Redstone, thechairman of Viacom, which owns Paramount Studios, chose not to renew Cruise’sdeal. “He turned off all women,” Redstone explained. “He was embarrassing thestudio. And he was costing us a lot of money.” Cruise and his longtime producingpartner, Paula Wagner, worked out a deal with MGM to resurrect the strugglingUnited Artists studio. Soon after that, Wagner approached Haggis, offering him avery generous deal. He wrote one script for them, a big-budget children’s movie,but the studio was so financially pressed that it couldn’t afford to produce it.In January 2008, just as it seemed that the derision that was directed at Cruisewas about to die down, a video was posted on the Internet. It was a tapedinterview with the star that preceded his acceptance of the Freedom Medal ofValor four years earlier. Wearing a black turtleneck, with the theme music fromMission: Impossible playing in the background, Cruise spoke to Scientologists inlanguage they understood. “Being a Scientologist, you can look at someone andknow absolutely that you can help them,” Cruise said. “So for me it really isKSW, and it’s something that I don’t mince words with that—with anything!—butthat policy with me has really gone—phist!” He made a vigorous gesture. “Boy!There’s a time I went through when I said, you know what, when I read it I justwent pooh! That’s it! That’s exactly it!”The video was placed on YouTube and viewed by millions who had no idea what hewas talking about. Cruise’s urgency came off as the ravings of a wild-eyedfanatic, but to Scientologists it was a sermon they had heard many times. “KSW”refers to a policy letter that Hubbard wrote in 1965 titled “Keeping ScientologyWorking.” In the letter Hubbard reprimanded his followers for straying from thenarrow path he had laid out for them. “When somebody enrols [sic], consider heor she has joined up for the duration of the universe—never permit an‘open-minded’ approach,” Hubbard writes. “If they’re aboard, they’re here on thesame terms as the rest of us—win or die in the attempt.” Hubbard concludes: “Thewhole agonized future of this planet, every Man, Woman and Child on it, and yourown destiny for the next endless trillions of years depend on what you do hereand now with and in Scientology.”The church instantly began taking down the video from the Internet, threateninglawsuits because of copyright violations. A loose coalition of Internet hackerswho called themselves Anonymous seized on the issue. “We were a bunch of kidswho didn’t care about anything,” Gregg Housh, a computer-repair technician inBoston who acts as an unofficial spokesperson for the group, recalled. Untilthen, they had never protested anything, but they considered the Internet theirturf and were offended that the church would attempt to control what theywatched. In truth, they knew little about Scientology, but the more theylearned, the more aroused they became.“We shall proceed to expel you from the Internet and systematically dismantlethe Church of Scientology in its present form,” Anonymous declared in a creepyvideo of its own. “We are anonymous. We are legion. We do not forgive. We do notforget. Expect us.” Some members of the Anonymous coalition wageddenial-of-service attacks on church computers, shutting down their websites foran extended period. On February 10, 2008, Anonymous organized protests in frontof Scientology churches and missions in a hundred cities across the world. Manyof the demonstrators were wearing what has now become the signature of theAnonymous movement—the Guy Fawkes mask, taken from the film V for Vendetta.At the center of the controversy was the beleaguered Tom Cruise. Anunflattering, unauthorized biography by the British writer Andrew Morton waspublished days after the YouTube video of Cruise appeared, creating a new roundof headlines—“Cruise Out of Control,” “Explosive Claims on Cruise Baby,” “GermanHistorian Likens Cruise Speech to Goebbels”—that were intensely personal andinsulting. Questions of his religion, his sexual orientation, his relationshipwith his wife, even the paternity of his daughter were laid out like a banquetfor public consumption. Several top executives at United Artists, includingCruise’s partner, Paula Wagner, decided to leave.Haggis was in his office in Santa Monica when he got a call from Cruise. Hehadn’t heard a word from him since writing the apology for his wisecrack toSpielberg. Haggis still had his deal at United Artists, which Cruise wasrunning. Now the star had a favor to ask. He wanted to gather a group of topScientologists in Hollywood—Kirstie Alley, Anne Archer, and Haggis—to go onOprah or Larry King Live to denounce the attacks on Cruise as religiouspersecution. Haggis told Cruise that was a terrible idea. He said that Cruiseshould stop trying to be a mouthpiece for the church and go back to doing whathe does best—being a movie star. People love him for that, not for having theanswers to all of life’s problems. He also advised the star to have a sense ofhumor about himself—something that is often lacking in Scientology. Instead ofconstantly going on the attack, he might simply say, “Yeah, I get that it soundscrazy, but it works for me.”4Cruise didn’t want to hear what Haggis had to say at the time, but soon afterthis conversation, he took a wildly comic turn in the Ben Stiller film TropicThunder, playing a profane studio executive who reminded a number of Hollywoodinsiders of Sumner Redstone. He also went back on the Today show for anotherinterview with Matt Lauer. This time, he was chastened and introspective. “Icame across as arrogant,” he admitted, when reflecting on their previousinterview three years earlier. “That’s not who I am. That’s not the person Iam.… I’m here to entertain people. That’s who I am and what I want to do.”Outside the windows of the studio, a crowd of people in the plaza of RockefellerCenter waved and blew kisses.HAGGIS WAS CASTING The Next Three Days in the summer of 2009, and he asked JasonBeghe to read for the part of a detective. Beghe’s best-known film role was asthe love interest for Demi Moore in G.I. Jane. In the late nineties, when Haggishad worked with the gravel-voiced actor on a CBS series, Family Law, Beghe hadbeen an occasional front man for Scientology. He had come to the church, like somany others, through the Beverly Hills Playhouse. In old promotional materialsfor the church, Beghe is quoted as saying that Scientology is “a rocket ride tospiritual freedom.” He says that Miscavige once called him “the poster boy forScientology.”[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_019_r1.jpg]Paul Haggis on the set of The Next Three Days, in a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,train yard“I just want you to know I’m no longer in Scientology,” Beghe told Haggis whenhe called. “Actually, I’m one of its most outspoken critics. The church would bevery unhappy if you hire me.”“Nobody tells me who I cast,” Haggis responded, but he decided to look at thelengthy video Beghe had posted on the Internet, in which he denounces the churchas “destructive and a rip-off.” Haggis thought the actor had gone over the edge,but he asked if they could talk.The two men met at Patrick’s Roadhouse, a pleasantly shabby coffee shop on thePacific Coast Highway. Beghe was calmer than he had been in the video, which henow called “a snapshot of me having been out only three months.” He could seethat Haggis was troubled. Even though Beghe had renounced the church, hecontinued to use Scientology when dealing with former members. In his severalmeetings with Haggis, he employed techniques based on Hubbard’s EthicsConditions. These range from Confusion at the bottom and ascend through Treason,Enemy, Doubt, Liability, Emergency, and so on, up to Power. Each of theconditions has a specific set of steps to follow in order to advance to a higherstate. Assuming that Haggis was in the condition of Doubt, Beghe knew that theproper formula required him to provide information.He told Haggis that in the late nineties he began having emotional problems. Thechurch prescribed more auditing and coursework. In retrospect, Beghe felt thatit had done no good. “I was paying money for them to fuck me up,” he said,estimating that he had spent as much as $600,000 in the process, and nearly $1million in his thirteen-year Scientology career. When he finally decided toleave the church, he told Tommy Davis that the church was in a condition ofLiability to him. Ordinarily, when a Scientologist does something wrong,especially something that might damage the image of the organization, he has tomake amends, often in the form of a substantial contribution. But now thesituation was reversed, Beghe maintained. He proposed that the church buy someproperty and lease it to him at a negligible rate. “You guys don’t have anypolicies to make up the damage, so I’m doing this for your own good—and formine,” he explained to Davis and others. “Because I don’t have a policy oftaking it in the ass.”5While talking to Haggis, Beghe was reluctant to use the word“brainwashing”—“whatever the fuck that is”—but he did say that somehow his mindhad been taken over. “You have all these thoughts, all these ways of looking atthings, that are L. Ron Hubbard’s,” he explained. “You think you’re becomingmore you, but within that is an implanted thing, which is You theScientologist.”Haggis was disturbed by Beghe’s account of what had happened after he left thechurch. He claimed that none of his Scientology friends would talk to him, hisson had been kicked out of school, he was being followed by privateinvestigators and threatened with lawsuits. Perhaps because Haggis had neverbeen as much of a true believer as some members, he didn’t nurse the same senseof betrayal. “I didn’t feel that some worm had buried itself in my ear, and ifyou plucked it out you would find L. Ron Hubbard and his thought,” he said. Buthe did feel that he had been cautioned.“TOMMY,” HAGGIS’S LETTER of August 19, 2009, abruptly begins. “As you know, forten months now I have been writing to ask you to make a public statementdenouncing the actions of the Church of Scientology of San Diego. Their publicsponsorship of Proposition 8, which succeeded in taking away the civil rights ofgay and lesbian citizens of California—rights that were granted them by theSupreme Court of our state—is a stain on the integrity of our organization and astain on us personally. Our public association with that hate-filled legislationshames us.”The tone of the letter is both aggrieved and outraged, mixing Haggis’s personalexperiences with the results of his one-man investigation into the church. Hementions how Katy Haggis’s friends had turned against her when she came out tothem as a lesbian. Katy had told him that another friend of hers had applied tobe the assistant for Jenna and Bodhi Elfman, the Scientology acting couple.Lauren Haigney, Tom Cruise’s niece in the Sea Org, had been assigned to vet theapplicants. Katy says that Lauren wrote up a report saying that Katy’s friendwas known to hang out with lesbians. The friend did not get the job, Katy said.6Haggis also recounted the scene at John Travolta and Kelly Preston’s house, whenanother Scientologist made the slur about the gay waiter. “I admire John andKelly for many reasons; one of them is the way they handled that,” Haggisstated. “You and I both know there has been a hidden anti-gay sentiment in thechurch for a long time. I have been shocked on too many occasions to hearScientologists make derogatory remarks about gay people, and then quote LRH intheir defense.” He said that the church’s decision not to denounce the bigotswho supported Proposition 8 was cowardly. “Silence is consent, Tommy. I refuseto consent.”He referenced Davis’s interview on CNN. “I saw you deny the church’s policy ofdisconnection. You said straight-out there was no such policy, that it did notexist,” he wrote. “I was shocked. We all know this policy exists. I didn’t haveto search for verification. I didn’t have to look any further than my own home.”He reminded Davis of Deborah’s experience with her parents. “Although it causedher terrible personal pain, my wife broke off all contact with them.… That’s notancient history, Tommy. It was a year ago.” He added: “To see you lie so easily,I am afraid to ask myself: what else are you lying about?”Then, he said, he had read the series of articles in the St. Petersburg Times.“They left me dumbstruck and horrified. These were not the claims made by‘outsiders’ looking to dig up dirt against us. These accusations were made bytop international executives who had devoted most of their lives to the church.Say what you will about them now, these were staunch defenders of the church,including Mike Rinder, the church’s official spokesman for 20 years!“Tommy, if only a fraction of these accusations are true, we are talking aboutserious, indefensible human and civil rights violations.”He continued:And when I pictured you assuring me that it is all lies, that this is nothingbut an unfounded and vicious attack by a group of disgruntled employees, I amafraid that I saw the same face that looked in the camera and denied the policyof disconnection. I heard the same voice that professed outrage at our supportof Proposition 8, who promised to correct it, and did nothing.I was left feeling outraged, and frankly, more than a little stupid.Haggis was especially disturbed by the way the church’s Freedom magazine hadresponded to the newspaper’s revelations. It included a lengthy annotatedtranscript of conversations that had taken place prior to the publication of theseries between the Times reporters, Joe Childs and Thomas C. Tobin, andrepresentatives of the church, including Tommy Davis and Jessica Feshbach, thetwo international spokespersons for the church. In the Freedom account, thenames of the defectors were never actually stated, perhaps to shieldScientologists from the shock of seeing familiar figures such as Marty Rathbunand Amy Scobee publicly denouncing the organization and its leader. Rathbun wascalled “Kingpin” and Amy Scobee “The Adulteress.” At one point in theconversation, Davis had told reporters that Scobee had been expelled from thechurch because she had had an affair. The reporters responded that she haddenied any sexual contact outside her marriage. “That’s a lie,” Davis told them.Feshbach, who carried a stack of documents, then said, “She has a writtenadmission [of] each one of her instances of extramarital indiscretions.… Ibelieve there were five.”When Haggis read this, he immediately assumed that the church had gotten itsinformation from auditing sessions.7 He was inflamed. “A priest would go to jailbefore revealing secrets from the confessional, no matter what the cost tohimself or his church,” he wrote. “You took Amy Scobee’s most intimateadmissions about her sexual life and passed them on to the press and thensmeared them all over the pages of your newsletter!…This is the woman who joinedthe Sea Org at 16! She ran the entire celebrity center network, and was a loyalsenior executive of the church for what, 20 years?” He added that he was awarethat the church might do the same to him. “Well, luckily, I have never heldmyself up to be anyone’s role model.”Haggis concluded:The great majority of Scientologists I know are good people who are genuinelyinterested in improving conditions on this planet and helping others. I have tobelieve that if they knew what I now know, they too would be horrified. But Iknow how easy it was for me to defend our organization and dismiss our critics,without ever truly looking at what was being said; I did it for thirty-fiveyears.… I am only ashamed that I waited this many months to act. I hereby resignmy membership in the Church of Scientology.AT THE TIME Haggis was doing his investigation, the FBI was also looking intoScientology. In December 2009, Tricia Whitehill, a special agent from the LosAngeles office, flew to Florida to interview former members of the church at thebureau’s office in downtown Clearwater, which happens to be directly across thestreet from Scientology’s spiritual headquarters. Tom De Vocht, who spoke toWhitehill then, got the impression that the investigation had been going on forquite a while. He says that Whitehill confided that she hadn’t told the localagents what the investigation was about, in case the office had beeninfiltrated. Amy Scobee also spoke to Whitehill for two full days, mainly aboutthe abuse she had witnessed.Whitehill and Valerie Venegas, the lead agent on the case, also interviewedformer Sea Org members in California. One was Gary Morehead, who had developedthe blow drill. He explained how his security team would use emotional andpsychological pressure to bring escapees back; but failing that, physical forcehas been used.8Whitehill and Venegas worked on a special task force devoted to humantrafficking. The laws regarding trafficking were built largely around forcedprostitution, but they also pertain to slave labor. Under federal law, slaveryis defined, in part, by the use of coercion, torture, starvation, imprisonment,threats, and psychological abuse. The California Penal Code lists severalindicators that someone may be a victim of human trafficking: signs of trauma orfatigue; being afraid or unable to talk because of censorship or securitymeasures that prevent communication with others; working in one place withoutthe freedom to move about; owing a debt to one’s employer; and not havingcontrol over identification documents. Those conditions resemble the accounts ofmany former Sea Org members who lived at Gold Base. If proven, those allegationswould still be difficult to prosecute given the religious status of Scientology.Marc Headley escaped from Gold Base in 2005; he says this was after being beatenby Miscavige.9 His defection was especially painful for the church, because Marcsays he was the first person Tom Cruise audited. In Scientology, the auditorbears a significant responsibility for the progress of his subject. “If youaudit somebody and that person leaves the organization, there’s only one personwhose fault that is—the auditor,” Headley explained. Later that year, Marc’swife, Claire, also escaped. In 2009, they sued the church, claiming that theworking conditions at Gold Base violated labor and human-trafficking laws. Thechurch responded that the Headleys were ministers who had voluntarily submittedto the rigors of their calling, and that the First Amendment protectedScientology’s religious practices. The court agreed with this argument anddismissed the Headleys’ complaints, awarding the church forty thousand dollarsin litigation costs.In April 2010, John Brousseau also fled. He, too, represented a dangerousliability to the church. He had been a Sea Org member for decades; he had workedpersonally for Hubbard; and he knew Miscavige intimately. But what was of mostconcern to the church was the fact that he had worked on or overseen numerousspecial projects for Tom Cruise. None of these unique and costly gifts comeanywhere close to the millions of dollars that the star has donated to thechurch over the years, but they do call into question the private benefitafforded a single individual by a tax-exempt religious organization.Brousseau knew the lengths to which the church would go in order to find him andbring him back. He drove to Carson City, Nevada, and bought a netbook computerat a Walmart, along with an air card, then set up an encrypted e-mail account.He sent a note to Rathbun, saying, “I just left and I’m freaked out, and I’vegot nowhere to go.” Rathbun invited him to South Texas. Expecting that thechurch would have hired private detectives to stake out key intersections on theinterstate highways, Brousseau stuck to county roads. It took him three days tomake it to Texas. He was driving a black Ford Excursion, much like the one thathe had fashioned into a limousine for Cruise.Brousseau and Rathbun met at a Chili’s restaurant near Corpus Christi. Theydecided to hide Brousseau’s truck at a friend’s house. Rathbun then checkedBrousseau into a Best Western motel under a different name. Despite theprecautions, two days later, at five thirty in the morning, when Brousseau wentout on the balcony to smoke, he heard a door open nearby and footsteps walkingtoward him. It was Tommy Davis and three other church members.“Hey, J.B.,” Davis said. “You got yourself in some shit.”Brousseau turned and walked away.“Where are you going?” Davis demanded.Brousseau said he was going to get some coffee. Davis and the Scientologydelegation followed behind him. The Circle K across the street wasn’t open yet,so Brousseau went into the motel lobby. He told the receptionist, “Call thepolice. These guys are stalking me.”She laughed in disbelief.“We’ve got a room here, too,” Davis said.Brousseau said he needed to go to the bathroom. As soon as he got back to hisroom he bolted the door and called Rathbun. “Marty, they came for me,” he said.After calling 911, Rathbun jumped in his truck to go to the motel, but four carsfilled with Scientologists blocked his way. He says they were led by MichaelDoven, Cruise’s former personal assistant.Brousseau waited in his room until the police officers arrived. Davis and theothers left empty-handed.10Brousseau talked to Whitehill and Venegas at the FBI. He was under theimpression that the federal agents were considering a raid on Gold Base.Brousseau says he was shown high-resolution photos of the base taken from adrone aircraft. He says he was told that they had even gathered the tail numberson Tom Cruise’s aircraft, in case Miscavige tried to escape. Brousseau andothers claim to have discouraged the idea, saying that such a raid would turnMiscavige into a martyr; and, in any case, no one would testify against him.Rinder told the agents it would be a waste of time, because everyone would tellthem their lives are all “seashells and butterflies.” The investigation wasreportedly dropped.11AFTER SENDING COPIES of his resignation letter to his closest friends inScientology, Haggis wasn’t surprised when he came home from work a few dayslater to find nine or ten of them standing in his front yard. “I can’t imaginewhy you’re here,” he joked, but he invited them to sit on the back porch andtalk. Anne Archer and her husband, Terry Jastrow, an Emmy-winning producer forABC Sports, were there. Mark Isham, a composer who worked with Haggis for years,came with his wife, Donna. Sky Dayton, the founder of EarthLink and BoingoWireless, joined them, along with several other friends and a representative ofthe church that Haggis didn’t know. His friends could have served as anadvertisement for Scientology—they were wealthy high achievers with solidmarriages who exuded a sense of spiritual well-being.Scientologists are trained to believe in their persuasive powers and the need tokeep a positive frame of mind. But the mood on Haggis’s porch was downbeat andhis friends’ questions were full of reproach.“Do you have any idea that this might damage a lot of wonderful Scientologists?”Jastrow asked. “It’s such a betrayal of our group.”Haggis responded that he didn’t mean to be critical of Scientology. “I loveScientology,” he said. Everyone knew about Haggis’s financial support of thechurch and the occasions when he had spoken out in its defense. He reminded hisfriends that he had been with them at the Portland Crusade, when he had beendrafted to write speeches.Archer had a particular reason to feel aggrieved: Haggis’s letter had called herson a liar. She could understand the pain and anger Haggis felt over thetreatment of his own gay daughters, but she didn’t think that was relevant. Inher opinion, homosexuality is not the church’s issue. She had personallyintroduced gay friends to Scientology.Isham was especially frustrated. He felt that they weren’t breaking through toHaggis. Of all the friends present, Isham was the closest to Haggis. They had acommon artistic sensibility that made it easy to work together. Isham had won anEmmy for the theme music he composed for Haggis’s 1996 television series, EZStreets. He had scored Crash and Haggis’s last movie, The Valley of Elah. Soonhe was supposed to start work on The Next Three Days. Now both their friendshipand their professional relationship were at risk.Isham had been analyzing the discussion from a Scientological perspective. Inhis view, Haggis’s emotional state on the Tone Scale at that moment was a 1.1,Covertly Hostile. By adopting a tone just above it—Anger—he hoped to blastHaggis out of the psychic place where he seemed to be lodged. Isham made what hecalls an intellectual decision to be angry.“Paul, I’m pissed off,” he told Haggis. “There are better ways to do this. Ifyou have a complaint, there’s a complaint line.” Anyone who genuinely wanted tochange Scientology should stay within the organization, Isham argued, not quit.All of his friends believed that if he wanted to change Scientology, he shoulddo it from within. They wanted him to recant and return to the fold or elsewithdraw his letter and walk away without making a fuss.Haggis listened patiently. A fundamental tenet of Scientology is that differingpoints of view must be fully heard and acknowledged. But when his friendsfinished, they were still red-faced and angry. Haggis suggested that as goodScientologists, they should at least examine the evidence. He referred them tothe St. Petersburg Times articles that had so shaken him, and to certainwebsites written by former members. He explained that his quarrel was with themanagement and the culture of the church, not with Scientology itself. Bycopying them on his resignation letter, he had hoped that they would be ashorrified as he by the practices that were going on in the name of Scientology.Instead, he realized, they were mainly appalled by his actions in calling themanagement of the church to account.Haggis’s friends came away from the meeting with mixed feelings—“no clearer thanwhen we went in,” Archer felt. What wasn’t said in this meeting was that thiswould be the last time any of them would ever speak to Haggis. Isham didconsider Haggis’s plea to look at the websites or the articles in the St.Petersburg Times, but he decided “it was like reading Mein Kampf if you wantedto know something about the Jewish religion.”After that first meeting with friends on his back porch, Haggis had severallengthy encounters with Tommy Davis and other representatives of the church.They showed up at his office in Santa Monica—a low-slung brick building onBroadway, covered in graffiti, like a gang headquarters. The officials broughtthick files to discredit people they heard or assumed he had been talking to.This was August 2009; shooting for The Next Three Days in Pittsburgh was goingto start within days, and the office desperately needed Haggis’s attention. Hisproducing partner, Michael Nozik, who is not a Scientologist, was frustrated.Haggis was spending hours, day after day, dealing with Scientology delegations.He resorted to getting members of his staff to walk him out to his car becausehe knew that Scientology executives would be waiting for him, and he wanted togive the impression he was too busy to speak—which he was. But then he wouldgive up and let them into the office for another lengthy confrontation.During one of these meetings, Davis showed Haggis a policy letter that Hubbardhad written, listing the acts for which one could be declared a SuppressivePerson. Haggis had stepped over the line on four of them.“Tommy, you are absolutely right, I did all those things,” Haggis responded. “Ifyou want to call me that, that’s what I am.”“We can still put this genie back in the bottle,” Tommy assured him, but itwould mean that Haggis would withdraw the letter and then resign quietly.Although Haggis listened, he didn’t change his mind. It seemed to him that theScientology officials became more “livid and irrational” the longer they talked.For instance, Davis and the other church officials insisted that Miscavige hadnot beaten his employees; his accusers, they said, had committed the violence.“Whoa, whoa, whoa,” Haggis responded, “okay, let’s say that’s true, Miscavigenever touched anyone. I’m sorry, but if someone in my organization were goingaround beating people, I’d know about it! You think I’d put up with it? And I’mnot that good a person.” Haggis noted that if the rumors about Miscavige’sviolent temper were true, it just proved that even the greatest leaders arefallible. “Look at Martin Luther King, Jr.,” he said, referring to one of hisheroes. “If you look at his personal life, it’s been said he has a few problemsin that area.”“How dare you compare Dave Miscavige with Martin Luther King!” one of theofficials shouted.Haggis was aghast. “They thought that comparing Miscavige to Martin Luther Kingwas debasing his character,” he said. “If they were trying to convince me thatScientology was not a cult, they did a very poor job of it.”12Copies of Haggis’s e-mail resignation letter were forwarded to various membersof the church, although few outside of church circles knew about it. By October,the letter had found its way to Marty Rathbun. He had become an informalspokesperson for Scientology defectors who, like him, believed that the churchhad broken away from Hubbard’s original teachings. He called Haggis, who wasshooting in Pittsburgh, and asked if he could publish the letter on his blog.“You’re a journalist, you don’t need my permission,” Haggis said, although hedid ask him to excise the portion of the letter that dealt with his dinner withJohn Travolta and Kelly Preston and the part about his daughter Katy’shomosexuality.Haggis didn’t think about the consequences of his decision. He thought it wouldshow up on a couple of websites. He was a writer, not a movie star. But Rathbungot fifty-five thousand hits on his blog that afternoon.The next morning, the story was in newspapers around the world. Haggis got acall from Tommy Davis. “Paul, what the hell!”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Four years before, the church had actively campaigned against Proposition 63,the Mental Health Services Act, which raised taxes to provide for increased carefor the mentally ill; the proposition passed.2 Mary Benjamin says they were never parties to the suit.3 Now called the Tampa Bay Times.4 Cruise’s attorney, Bertram Fields, denies this took place: “Mr. Cruise hasnever asked Mr. Haggis or anyone else to denounce media attacks on Mr. Cruise onthe Larry King show or anywhere else or to do anything like that.”5 The church characterizes this as an attempt at extortion.6 The church forwarded a letter to me from Katy Haggis’s friend in which shedenies losing a job because of their friendship and asserting that the church iswelcoming to everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation. The friend, whoseparents are both employed by the church, did not respond to a request to talkfurther.7 Tommy Davis gave me an affidavit, signed by Scobee, in which she admits tohaving liaisons. Scobee told me there were only two incidents, both of whichinvolved a kiss and nothing more. She says she did not write the affidavit; shesays she only signed it in the hope of leaving the church on good terms so thatshe could stay in touch with relatives. The church maintains that it does notuse confidential information derived from auditing sessions.8 The church denies that blow drills exist.9 According to Tommy Davis, “Mr. Miscavige has never physically assaulted MarcHeadley or anyone else.”10 Davis later said that he had never followed a Sea Org member who had blownand had only gone to see Brousseau because he was “a very good friend of mine”(Deposition of Thomas Davis, Marc Headley vs. Church of ScientologyInternational, and Claire Headley vs. Church of Scientology International, USDistrict Court, Central District of California, July 2, 2010).11 Valerie Venegas told one of her sources that higher-up officials had spikedit; later, she blamed me, because I had uncovered the probe and had called toverify it with the agents (Tony Ortega, “FBI Investigation of Scientology:Already Over before We Even Heard of It,” Village Voice Blogs, Mar. 19, 2012).12 Tommy Davis says that Martin Luther King, Jr.’s name never came up."},{"pageContent":"11[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_L02_r1.jpg]TOMMYWhen I first contacted Davis in April 2010, asking for his cooperation on aprofile I was writing about Haggis for The New Yorker, he expressed a reluctanceto talk, saying that he had already spent a month responding to similar queries.“It made little difference,” he said. “The last thing I’m interested in isdredging all this up again.” He kept putting me off, saying that he was too busyto get together, although he promised that we would meet when he was moreavailable. “I want our time to be undistracted,” he explained in an e-mail. “Weshould plan on spending at least a full day together as there is a lot I wouldwant to show you.” We finally arranged to meet on Memorial Day weekend.I flew to Los Angeles and spent much of that weekend waiting for him to call. OnSunday at three o’clock, Davis appeared at my hotel, with Jessica Feshbach. Wesat at a table on the patio. Davis has his mother’s sleepy eyes. His thick blackhair was combed forward, with a lock falling boyishly onto his forehead. He worea wheat-colored suit with a blue shirt that opened onto a chest that seemed,among the sun-worshippers at the pool, strikingly pallid. Feshbach, a slender,attractive woman, anxiously twirled her hair.Davis now told me that he was “not willing to participate in, or contribute to,an article about Scientology through the lens of Paul Haggis.” I had come to LosAngeles specifically to talk to him, at a time he had chosen. I wondered aloudif he had been told not to talk to me. He said no.“Maybe Paul shouldn’t have posted the letter on the Internet,” Feshbachinterjected. “There are all sorts of shoulda woulda coulda.” She said that shehad just spoken to Mark Isham, the composer, whom I had interviewed. “He talkedto you about what are supposed to be our confidential scriptures.” That I wouldask about the church’s secret doctrines was offensive, she said. “It’s a two-waystreet happening,” she concluded.1“Everything I have to say about Paul, I’ve already said,” Davis declared. Heagreed to respond to fact-checking queries, however.THE GARDEN BEHIND Anne Archer and Terry Jastrow’s home in the Brentwoodneighborhood of Los Angeles is a peaceful retreat, filled with olive trees andhummingbirds. A fountain gurgles beside the swimming pool. Jastrow wasrecounting his first meeting with Archer, in Milton Katselas’s class. His friendDavid Ladd, son of the Hollywood legend Alan Ladd, had invited him to visit. “Isaw this girl sitting next to Milton,” Jastrow recalled. “I said, ‘Who’sthat?’ ”Archer smiled. There was a cool wind blowing in from the Pacific, and she drew ashawl around her. “We were friends for about a year and a half before we had ourfirst date,” she said. They were married in 1978.“Our relationship really works,” Jastrow said. “We attribute that essentially ahundred percent to applying Scientology.”The two spoke of the techniques that had helped them, such as never beingcritical of the other and never interrupting.Scientology “isn’t a ‘creed,’ ” Archer said. “These are basic natural laws oflife.” She described L. Ron Hubbard as “an engineer, not a faith healer,” whohad codified human emotional states, in order to guide the adept to higherlevels of existence—“to help a guy rise up the Tone Scale and feel a zest and alove for life.”Jastrow had been an acolyte in an Episcopal church when he was studying at theUniversity of Houston, but doubts overwhelmed him. “I walked out in the middleof communion,” he said. “I was an atheist for ten years. That was the conditionI was in when I started at the Beverly Hills Playhouse.” He had never heard ofScientology at the time.Archer said that the controversy that continually surrounds the church hadn’ttouched her. “It’s not that I’m not aware of it.” She added that Scientology isgrowing despite the public criticism. “It’s in a hundred and sixty-fivecountries.”“Translated into fifty languages!” Jastrow interjected. “It’s thefastest-growing religion.” In his opinion, “Scientologists do more good thingsfor more people in more places around the world than any other organizationever.” He added, “When you study historical perspective of new faiths, they’veall been—”“Attacked,” said Archer. “Look at what happened to the—”“The Christians!” Jastrow said simultaneously. “Think of the Mormons and theChristian Scientists.”They talked about the church’s focus on celebrities. “Hubbard recognized that ifyou really want to inspire a culture to have peace and greatness and harmonyamong men, you need to respect and help the artist to prosper and flourish,”Archer said. “And if he’s particularly well known he needs a place where he canbe comfortable. So, Celebrity Centres provide that.” She blamed the press forconcentrating too much on Scientology celebrities. Journalists, she said, “don’twrite about the hundreds of thousands of other Scientologists.”“Millions!”“Millions of other Scientologists. They only write about four friggin’ people!”Jastrow suggested that Scientology’s critics often had a vested interest. Hepointed to psychiatrists, psychologists, doctors, drug makers, pharmacies—“allthose people who make a living and profit and pay their mortgages and pay theircollege educations and buy their cars, et cetera, et cetera, based on people notbeing well.”“Who advertise in the newspapers and on television, more than any otheradvertisers,” Archer added.“But this is a collateral issue, darling, in terms of what I’m talking about,”Jastrow continued. “For the first time in America’s experience with war, thereare more mental illnesses from Iraq and Afghanistan than physical illnesses,” hesaid, citing a recent article in USA Today. “So mental illnesses become a bigbusiness.” Drugs merely mask mental distress, he said, whereas “Scientology willsolve the source of the problem.” The medical and pharmaceutical industries are“prime funders and sponsors of the media,” he said, and therefore might exert“influence on people telling the whole and true story about Scientology justbecause of the profit motive.” He said that only Scientology could help mankindright itself. “What else is there that we can hang our hopes on?”“That’s improving civilization,” Archer added.“Is there some other religion on the horizon that’s going to help mankind?”Jastrow asked. “Just tell me where. If not Scientology, where?”ANNE ARCHER BEGAN STUDYING with Katselas in 1974, two years after her son TommyDavis was born. She was the exceptionally beautiful daughter of two successfulactors. Her father, John Archer, was best known during the 1930s and 1940s asthe voice introducing the radio drama The Shadow. (“Who knows what evil lurks inthe hearts of men? The Shadow knows,” he said at the beginning of the program.)He went on to appear in more than fifty films. Her mother, Marjorie Lord, playedDanny Thomas’s wife on the popular television show Make Room for Daddy. Withsuch a bloodline, it might be expected that Archer would be aiming towardstardom, but when she entered the Beverly Hills Playhouse she was coming off atelevision series (Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice) that she didn’t respect and thathad been canceled after a single season. She was a young mother in a dissolvingmarriage and an actor with diminishing career prospects.Katselas had a transformative effect. Like so many others, Archer was magnetizedby this ebullient Greek, with his magnificent beard and his badgering, teasing,encouraging, and infuriating personality. He was one of the most inspiringpeople Archer had ever met. Where had he acquired such wisdom? Some of the otherstudents told her that Katselas was a Scientologist, so she decided to try itout. She began going two or three times a week to the Celebrity Centre to takethe Life Repair Program. “I remember walking out of the building and walkingdown the street toward my car, and I felt like my feet were not touching theground. I said to myself, ‘My God, this is the happiest I’ve ever been in myentire life. I’ve finally found something that works!’ ” She added, “Life didn’tseem so hard anymore. I was back in the driver’s seat.”When Tommy was old enough, Archer would bring him to the Playhouse while she wastaking lessons. He would wander around the theater, venturing into the lightbooth and watching his mother learning her craft. Jastrow recalled being struckby Tommy’s poise even as a five-year-old child. “I am a really good dad, and hetaught me how,” Jastrow said. He gave the example of a visit from his ownparents, who had flown out from Midland, Texas, to meet Terry’s new family.After Jastrow had driven them back to the airport, Tommy said, “I notice thatyour dad was pretty strict with you.” Jastrow agreed that his father had beenvery stern when he was growing up. Then Tommy continued, “I was noticing thatyou’re pretty strict with me.” Jastrow pointed to that as a defining moment intheir relationship. “I realized I wanted to be his friend first,” he said. “Hewas the senior being in that relationship.”Anne and Terry soon found their way into Scientology, but Tommy was initiallyraised in his mother’s original faith, Christian Science. His father, WilliamDavis, is a wealthy financier and real-estate developer who was once reported tobe among the largest owners of agricultural property in California. He was alsoa well-known fund-raiser for Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, and personallycontributed an estimated $350,000 a year to Republican causes. Although Tommygrew up in an environment of money and celebrity, he impressed people with hismodesty. He longed to do something to help humanity. Scientology seemed to offera direction.Paul Haggis met Tommy at the Celebrity Centre in 1989, when he was seventeenyears old—“a sweet and bright boy.” Their meeting came at a critical moment inTommy’s life. He had just broken up with his girlfriend. Archer had taken him tothe Celebrity Centre for counseling, where he took a course called PersonalValues and Integrity.Tommy’s presence immediately caused a stir inside the church. The president ofthe Celebrity Centre, Karen Hollander, fixed on the idea that Tommy should beher personal assistant. He was young, very rich, and handsome enough to be amovie star himself. He had grown up mixing with famous people. It would be aperfect fit. Whenever celebrities came in, there would be Anne Archer’s son. Butthat required coaxing Tommy to join the Sea Org. Hollander called in the youngermembers of her staff to woo him. “You can either go to college and get a wogeducation, or you can join Sea Org and be doing the best service you could everdo for mankind—and for yourself,” John Peeler, Hollander’s secretary at thetime, would tell him.Although Anne and Terry say they wanted Tommy to get a college education, theyknew of the efforts to recruit him and didn’t stand in the way. That fall, Tommyentered Columbia University, but lasted only a single semester. Over Christmasbreak, he went back into Hollander’s office, and when he came out, he excitedlytold Peeler he had just signed the billion-year contract.His job for Hollander was to attend to the celebrities who lounged around thepresident’s office. Lisa Marie Presley was often there, as were Kirstie Alley,and writer-director Floyd Mutrux. John Travolta would drop by occasionally. Alsoin this crowd was a clique of young actors who had grown up in the church,including Giovanni Ribisi and his sister Marissa, Jenna Elfman, and JulietteLewis. Davis would arrange for them all to go to movies together. He wascharming, attractive, he had a great sense of humor, and eventually, DavidMiscavige began to notice. “Miscavige liked the fact that he was young andlooked trendy and wore Brioni or Armani suits,” Mike Rinder observed. “He had acute BMW. It was an image that Miscavige liked.”Davis moved into Sea Org berthing in a dodgy neighborhood on Wilcox Street inWest Hollywood. It was quite a step down from the luxurious life he had enjoyeduntil then. He was quickly introduced to some of the inner secrets of theorganization. In about 1994, he was involved in an embarrassing cover-up when awell-known spokesperson for the church was captured in a video having sex withseveral other men. Amy Scobee says that church executives were frantic thattheir spokesperson would be exposed as being gay. Scobee and Karen Hollander seta briefcase with the spokesperson’s auditing files in the backseat of the carthat Hollander was borrowing at the time—actually, Tommy Davis’s BMW—intendingto take the files to Gold Base the next day for senior managers to review.Because the car was in a highly secure parking lot, they thought nothing of it.Davis returned late that night, however. He found his car and decided to take itback to the Sea Org dormitory. When he parked the car on Wilcox Street, hehappened to notice the briefcase, so he locked it in the trunk and went to bed.The next day, Scobee got a call from a sheepish Davis. He said that someone hadbroken into his car and stolen the briefcase out of the trunk. “When we toldTommy what was in the briefcase, he freaked,” Scobee recalled. “He went aroundfor a week, searching through Dumpsters.” Finally, someone approached Davisabout the reward he had offered and led him to the thief, a homeless man who wastrying to sell the briefcase; the contents, which were still in it, meantnothing to him. Davis gave the man twenty dollars.2 Davis was disappointedbecause the search forced him to miss the ceremony where John Travolta wasawarded a Scientology medal.Davis went through a period of doubt and actually considered dropping out of theSea Org, according to Scobee, but then he recommitted and became so enthusiasticthat he had the Sea Org logo—a laurel wreath with twenty-six leaves representingthe stars in the Galactic Confederacy—tattooed on his arm. When Miscavige foundout, he berated Davis, saying that he had violated the church’s copyright.Davis began working with Marty Rathbun during his intensive auditing of Cruise.When Rathbun was thrown in the Hole, Davis became something more than a goferfor the star. He provided a line to Cruise at a time when the actor’srelationship with the church was not yet solidified, and his constant presencebeside the superstar boosted the image of Scientology as a hip, insider network.Although Cruise is ten years older, the two men physically resemble each other,with long faces and strong jaws, a likeness that is enhanced by similar spikyhaircuts. Their relationship evolved into a friendship, but one that reflectedthe immense power imbalance between them, as well as Davis’s position as adeputy of the church in the service of its most precious asset. Until hisassociation with Cruise, Davis had been called Tom, but he became Tommy todistinguish him from the star. In other ways, he became more like him—hisclothes, his hair, his intensity.At the age of nineteen, Davis married a dreamy Belgian woman, Nadine vanHootegem, who was also in the Sea Org. “I made the decision to forward the aimsof Scientology,” she told the ABC News program 20/20 in 1998. “I actuallycompare it a little bit like Mother Teresa.” She added, “It’s a fun activity toset men free.” According to Mike Rinder, Nadine Davis became intensely involvedin Tom Cruise’s entourage. “Somehow dealing with Katie Holmes, she did somethingwrong,” Rinder says. “She became a non-person.” He says that Tommy was forced todivorce her.3Soon after Cruise’s troubles in 2005, Tommy Davis was sent to Clearwater toparticipate in the Estates Project Force. Normally, the EPF functions as a kindof boot camp for new Sea Org members. Donna Shannon was a veterinarian who hadrisen to OT VII before signing her billion-year contract. She was surprised tofind that about half the people undergoing training were veteran Sea Org memberswho were being disciplined, including Davis. He seemed like a nice guy, so shewas puzzled that he was subjected to the worst hazing. “He complained aboutbeing out scrubbing the Dumpster with a toothbrush till late at night,” sherecalled, “then he’d be up at six to do our laundry.” Sometimes Davis would beparaded in front of the other Sea Org members as his Ethics Officer shouted,“This guy is not a big shot! He’s lying to you!” Only later did Shannon learnthat Davis was Anne Archer’s son. (As it happens, Archer was also at theClearwater base, taking advanced courses. A teenage Sea Org member—DanielMontalvo, the same one who guarded Cruise during his auditing sessions—wasassigned to keep her in the dark and make sure that she never encountered herson.)Shannon and Davis worked together, maintaining the grounds. “I was supposedlysupervising him,” Shannon said. “I was told to make him work really hard.” Thatdidn’t seem to be a problem for Davis. At one point, Shannon said, he borrowedabout a hundred dollars from her because he didn’t have money for food.One day, Shannon and Davis were taking the bus to a work project. Shannon askedwhy he was in the EPF.“I got busted,” Davis told her. “I fucked up on Tom Cruise’s lines”—meaning thathe had botched a project Cruise was involved in.“So what are your plans now?” she asked.“I just want to do my stuff and get back on post,” Davis replied.Shannon said that suddenly “it was like a veil went over his eyes, and he goes,‘I already said too much.’ ”Several months later, Davis paid her back the money.4[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_020_r1.jpg]Tommy DavisWhen Davis finished the EPF, he replaced Rinder as chief spokesperson for thechurch, because Rinder was confined to the Hole. One of his first assignmentswas to deal with John Sweeney, an aggressive reporter for the BBC, who was doinga story on Scientology and had been working with Rinder until then. Davis madethe mistake of admitting to Sweeney that he reported to Miscavige every day,spoiling the illusion of the leader as being unavailable and above the fray.Miscavige pulled Rinder out of the Hole and ordered him to help Davis deal withthe BBC, although he added, “You’re Tommy Davis’s servant.”Sweeney immediately sensed that Rinder had been demoted. Rinder was “gaunt,hollow-eyed, strange with a hint of niceness.” Tommy was now “the top dog,gleaming teeth, snappily suited, charming but creepily so.” When Sweeney refusedto accede to the church’s restrictions (mainly that he agree not to use the word“cult” in his report) and began independently reporting on the accusations ofdefectors, he was shadowed by private investigators. A Scientology film crewshowed up to document the making of the BBC documentary. Cameras were pointed atcameras. Davis appeared unannounced at Sweeney’s hotel and even traveled acrossthe country to disrupt his interviews with Scientology dissidents. Sweeney hadcovered wars in Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Chechnya, but he had never had suchemotional and psychological pressure placed upon him. During theseconfrontations, Rinder trailed behind Davis, staring blankly into space as Davisgoaded the reporter, inches from his face. When Sweeney suggested thatScientology is a “sadistic cult,” Davis, wearing sunglasses, checked with hiscameraman to see that the camcorder was running, then said, “Now listen to mefor a second. You have no right to say what is and what isn’t a religion. TheConstitution of the United States of America guarantees one’s right to practiceand believe freely in this country. And the definition of religion is veryclear. And it’s not defined by John Sweeney. For you to repeatedly refer to myfaith in those terms is so derogatory and so offensive and so bigoted. And thereason you kept repeating it is ’cause you wanted a reaction like you’re gettingright now. Well, buddy, you got it! Right here, right now, I’m angry! Realangry!”Davis turned and walked away, trailed by Sweeney, who protested, “It’s your turnto listen to me! I’m a British subject.… ”Another confrontation took place at the “Psychiatry: An Industry of Death”exhibit in Hollywood. Davis once again moved in, nose to nose with Sweeney.“You’re accusing members of my religion of brainwashing!” He was referring to anearlier interview Sweeney had conducted with another Scientologist.“No, Tommy,” Sweeney responded, his voice rising, “you were not there—”“Brainwashing is a crime,” Davis said.“Listen to me! You were not there! At the beginning! Of the interview!” Sweeneyshouted in an oddly slow cadence. “You did not hear! Or record! The interview!”“Do you understand that brainwashing is a crime?” Davis said, unfazed bySweeney’s enraged screams.Davis’s composure and his spirited defense of his church made quite a contrastwith the sputtering and eventually deeply chagrined reporter, who apologized toBBC viewers on the air.In March 2007, John Travolta’s new movie, Wild Hogs, a comedy about twomiddle-aged men who decide to become bikers, was scheduled to open in Britain.Concerned that Sweeney would confront Travolta during the publicity for thefilm, Rinder and Davis planned to travel together to London, but on the day ofdeparture, Davis failed to show up. Someone went to his room, but he was nowhereto be found. Rinder had to travel to London alone. He learned from Miscavige’scommunicator that Davis had blown. Sweeney immediately sensed that something wasup and kept pestering Rinder about where Davis was. Rinder told him Davis hadthe flu.As part of the film promotion, Travolta arrived at the red-carpet Londonpremiere on a motorcycle. Sweeney was standing in the crowd in Leicester Square,well away from the star, crying out, “Are you a member of a sinister,brainwashing cult?” Travolta’s fans shouted Sweeney down.Later, Sweeney asked Rinder if it was true that Miscavige had beaten him,claiming to have an eyewitness.“Who’s the witness?” Rinder asked.“He wishes to remain confidential because he says he is scared.”“John, that is typical of what you do,” Rinder said.“He says that David Miscavige knocked you to the ground.”“Absolute rubbish, rubbish, rubbish, not true, rubbish.”Rinder threatened to sue if Sweeney aired such allegations. When the BBC programran, there was no mention of physical abuse. Rinder felt that he had spared thechurch considerable embarrassment. But, far from being grateful, Miscavige toldhim that Sweeney’s piece should never have run at all. He ordered Rinder toreport to an RPF facility in England. Rinder decided he’d had enough. He blew.Davis called the church and returned voluntarily from Las Vegas, where he hadbeen hiding.5 He was sent to Clearwater, where he was security-checked byJessica Feshbach. The aim of the check is to gain a confession using an E-Meter.It can function as a powerful form of thought control.Davis and Feshbach subsequently married.ON A RAINY MORNING in late September 2010, I finally got my meeting with TommyDavis. The profile of Paul Haggis I had been preparing was nearing publication.Davis and Feshbach, along with four attorneys representing the church, traveledto Manhattan to meet with me; my editor, Daniel Zalewski, and David Remnick, theeditor of The New Yorker; the two lead fact-checkers on the story, JenniferStahl and Tim Farrington, as well as the head of the magazine’s fact-checkingdepartment, Peter Canby; and our lawyer, Lynn Oberlander. Leading theScientology legal delegation was Anthony Michael Glassman, a former assistant USattorney who now has a boutique law firm in Beverly Hills, specializing inrepresenting movie stars. On his website, he boasts of a $10 million judgmentagainst The New York Times. The stakes were obvious to everyone.The Scientology delegation brought with them forty-eight three-ring binders ofsupporting material, stretching nearly seven linear feet, to respond to the 971questions the checkers had posed. It was an impressive display. The binders werelabeled according to categories, such as “Disappearance of L. Ron Hubbard,” “TomCruise,” “Gold Base,” and “Haggis’s Involvement in Scientology.” Davisemphasized that the church had gone to extraordinary lengths to prepare for thismeeting. “Frankly, the only thing I can think that compares would be thepresentation that we made in the early 1990s to the IRS.”We sat around a large blond conference table with the kaleidoscopic lights ofTimes Square garishly whirling in the background. I particularly recall theDunkin’ Donuts sign over Davis’s shoulder as he began his presentation. First,he ruled out any discussion of the church’s confidential scripture. He comparedit to “shoving an image of the Prophet Mohammed in the face of a Muslim” or“insisting that a Jew eat pork.” He then attacked the credibility of some of thesources for the piece, whom he called “bitter apostates.” “They are unreliable,”he said. “They make up stories.” He produced a paper by Bryan Wilson, who was aneminent Oxford sociologist and prominent defender of new religious movements (hedied in 2004). Wilson argues that testimony from disaffected members should betreated skeptically, noting, “The apostate is generally in need ofself-justification. He seeks to reconstruct his own past to excuse his formeraffiliations and to blame those who were formerly his closest associates.… He islikely to be suggestible and ready to enlarge or embellish his grievances tosatisfy that species of journalist whose interest is more in sensational copythan in an objective statement of the truth.” Davis had highlighted the lastpart for my benefit.As an example, Davis singled out Gerald Armstrong, the former Scientologyarchivist, who received an $800,000 settlement in a fraud suit against thechurch in 1986. Davis charged that Armstrong had forged many of the documentsthat he later disseminated in order to discredit the church’s founder, althoughhe produced no evidence to substantiate that allegation. He passed around aphotograph of Armstrong, which, he said, showed Armstrong “sitting naked” with agiant globe in his lap. “This was a photo that was in a newspaper article he didwhere he said that all people should give up money,” Davis said. “He’s not avery sane person.”6Davis also displayed photographs of what he said were bruises sustained by MikeRinder’s former wife in 2010, after Rinder physically assaulted her in a Floridaparking lot.7 Davis then showed a mug shot of Marty Rathbun in a jailhousejumpsuit, after being detained in New Orleans in July 2010 for publicdrunkenness. “Getting arrested for being drunk on the intersection of Bourbonand Toulouse?” Davis cracked. “That’s like getting arrested for being a leper ina leper colony.” Other defectors, such as Claire and Marc Headley, were “themost despicable people in the world.” Jefferson Hawkins was “an inveterateliar.”If these people were so reprehensible, I asked, how had they all arrived at suchelevated positions in the church?“They weren’t like that when they were in those positions,” Davis replied.The defectors we were discussing had not only risen to positions ofresponsibility within the church; they had also ascended Scientology’s ladder ofspiritual accomplishment. I suggested that Scientology didn’t seem to beeffective if people at the highest levels of spiritual attainment were actuallyliars, adulterers, wife beaters, drunks, and embezzlers.“This is a religion,” Davis responded movingly. “It aspires to greatness, hope,humanity, spiritual freedom. To be greater than we are. To rise above ourcraven, humanoid instincts.” Scientology doesn’t pretend to be perfect, he said,and it shouldn’t be judged on the misconduct of a few apostates. “I haven’t donethings like that,” Davis said. “I haven’t suborned perjury, destroyed evidence,lied—contrary to what Paul Haggis says.” He spoke of his frustration with Haggisafter his resignation: “If he was so troubled and shaken on the fundamentals ofScientology … then why the hell did he stick around for thirty-five years?” Hecontinued: “Did he stay a closet Scientologist for some career-advancementpurpose?” Davis shook his head in disgust. “I think he’s the most hypocriticalperson in the world.” He said he felt that he’d done all he could in dealingwith Haggis over the issue of Proposition 8. He added that the individual whohad made the mistake of listing the San Diego church as a supporter of theinitiative—he didn’t divulge his name—had been “disciplined” for it. I askedwhat that meant. “He was sat down by a staff member of the local organization,”Davis explained. “He got sorted out.”Davis thought I was making too much out of the issue of Suppressive Persons inthe piece. “Do you know how many people, grand total, there are in the world whohave been declared Suppressive?” he asked rhetorically. “A couple of thousandover the years. At most.” He said that in fact many had been restored to goodstanding. “Yet again, you’re falling into the trap of defining our religion bythe people who’ve left.”Hubbard had said that only two and a half percent of the human population weresuppressive, but one of the problems I faced in writing about Scientology,especially its early days, is that the preponderance of people who had beenclose to Hubbard had either quietly left the church or been declaredSuppressive. Some, like Pat Broeker, had gone underground. Many others, likeDavid Mayo, had signed non-disclosure agreements. Those who remained in thechurch were off-limits to me.8We discussed the allegations of abuse lodged by many former members againstMiscavige. “The only people who will corroborate are their fellow apostates,”Davis said. “They’re a pack of sanctimonious liars.” He produced affidavits fromother Scientologists refuting their accusations. He noted that in the talesabout Miscavige, the violence always seemed to come out of nowhere. “One wouldthink that if such a thing occurred, which it most certainly did not, there’dhave to be a reason,” Davis said.I had wondered about these outbursts as well. When Rinder and Rathbun were inthe church, they claimed that allegations of abuse were baseless. Then, afterRinder defected, he said that Miscavige had beaten him fifty times. Rathbun hadtold the St. Petersburg Times in 1998 that in the twenty years he had workedclosely with Miscavige, he had never seen him hit anyone. “That’s not histemperament,” he had said. “He’s got enough personal horsepower that he doesn’tneed to resort to things like that.” Later, he acknowledged to the Times,“That’s the biggest lie I ever told you.” He has also confessed that in 1997 heordered incriminating documents destroyed in the case of Lisa McPherson, theScientologist who died of an embolism while under church care. If these men werecapable of lying to protect the church, might they not also be capable of lyingto destroy it?However, eleven former Sea Org members told me that Miscavige had assaultedthem; twenty-two have told me or testified in court that they have witnessed oneor more assaults on other church staff members by their leader.9 Marc Headley,one of those who say Miscavige beat them on several occasions, said he knowsthirty others who were attacked by the church leader. Rinder says he witnessedfourteen other executives who were assaulted, some on multiple occasions, suchas the elderly church president, Heber Jentzsch, who has been in the Hole since2006. Some people were slapped, others punched or kicked or choked. LanaMitchell, who worked in Miscavige’s office, saw him hit his brother, Ronnie, inthe stomach, during a meeting. Mariette Lindstein, who also worked inMiscavige’s office, witnessed as many as twenty attacks. “You get veryhardened,” she admitted. She saw Miscavige banging the heads of two of hissenior executives, Marc Yager and Guillaume Lesevre, together repeatedly, untilblood came from Lesevre’s ear. Tom De Vocht says he witnessed Miscavige strikingother members of the staff about a hundred times. Others who never saw suchviolence spoke of their constant fear of the leader’s wrath.The attacks often came out of the blue, “like the snap of a finger,” as JohnPeeler described it. Bruce Hines, who was a senior auditor in 1994, told me thatbefore he was struck, “I heard his voice in the hallway, deep and distinctive,‘Where is that motherfucker?’ He looked in my office. ‘There he is!’ Withoutanother word he came up and hit me with an open hand. I didn’t fall down. It wasat that point I was put in RPF. I was incarcerated six years.”Davis admitted that the musical chairs episode occurred, even though the churchdenies the existence of the Hole, where it took place. He explained thatMiscavige had been away from Gold Base for some time, and when he returned, hefound that many jobs had been reassigned without his permission. The game wasintended to demonstrate how disruptive such wholesale changes could be on anorganization. “All the rest of it is a bunch of embellishment and noise andhoo-haw,” Davis told me. “Chairs being ripped apart, and people being threatenedthat they’re going to be sent to far-flung places in the world, plane ticketsbeing purchased, and they’re going to force their spouses—and on and on and on.I mean, it’s just nuts!”The Scientology delegation objected to the negative tenor of The New Yorkerqueries about the church’s leader, including such small details as whether ornot he had a tanning bed. “I mean, this is The New Yorker. It sounds like theNational Enquirer,” Davis complained. He wouldn’t say what Miscavige’s salarywas (the church is not required to publicly disclose that information), but hederided the idea that the church leader enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle.Miscavige, he contended, doesn’t live on the ostentatious scale of many otherreligious leaders. “There’s no big rings. There’s no fancy silk robes,” he said.“There’s no mansion. There’s no none of that. None, none, none. Zero, zilcho,not.” As for the extravagant birthday presents given to the church leader, Davissaid that it was tradition for Sea Org members to give each other gifts fortheir birthdays. It was “just obnoxious” for me to single out Miscavige.“It’s not true that he’s gotten for his birthday a motorcycle, fine suits, andleather jackets?” I asked.“I gave him a leather jacket once,” Davis conceded.“So it is true?” I asked. “A motorcycle, fine suits?”“I never heard that,” he responded. “And as far as fine suits, I’ve got somefine suits. The church bought those.” In fact, he was wearing a beautifulcustom-made suit, with actual buttonholes on the cuffs. He explained that forIRS purposes it was considered a uniform. When Sea Org members mix with thepublic, he explained, they dress appropriately. “It’s called Uniform K.”Davis declined to let me speak to Miscavige; nor would he or the other membersof the group agree to talk about their own experiences with the church leader.I asked about the leader’s missing wife, Shelly Miscavige. John Brousseau andClaire Headley believe that she was taken to Running Springs, near Big Bear,California, one of several sites where Hubbard’s works are stored in undergroundvaults. “She’ll be out of sight, out of mind until the day she dies,” Brousseauhad predicted, “like Mary Sue Hubbard.”In the meeting, Tommy Davis told me, “I definitely know where she is,” but hewouldn’t disclose the location.Davis brought up Jack Parsons’s black magic society, which he asserted Hubbardhad infiltrated. “He was sent in there by Robert Heinlein, who was runningoff-book intelligence operations for naval intelligence at the time.” Davis saidthat the church had been looking for additional documentation to support itsclaim. “A biography that just came out three weeks ago on Bob Heinlein actuallyconfirmed it at a level that we’d never been able to before, because ofsomething his biographer had found.”The book Davis was referring to is the first volume of an authorized Heinleinbiography, by William H. Patterson, Jr. There is no mention there of Heinleinsending Hubbard to break up the Parsons ring. I wrote Patterson, asking if hisresearch supported the church’s assertion. He responded that Scientologists hadbeen the source of the claim in the first place, and that they provided him witha set of documents that supposedly backed it up. Patterson said that thematerial did not support the factual assertions the church was making. “I wasunable to make any direct connection of the facts of Heinlein’s life at the timeto that narrative or any of its supporting documents,” Patterson wrote. (Thebook reveals that Heinlein’s second wife, Leslyn, had an affair with Hubbard.Interestingly, given Hubbard’s condemnation of homosexuality, the wife chargedthat Heinlein had as well.)“Even those allegations from Sara Northrup,” Davis continued, mentioning thewoman who had been Parsons’s girlfriend before running off with Hubbard. “He wasnever married to Sara Northrup. She filed for divorce in an effort to try andcreate a false record that she had been married to him.” He said that she hadbeen under a cloud of suspicion, even when she lived with Parsons. “It alwayshad been considered that she had been sent in there by the Russians,” he said.“I can never pronounce her name. Her actual true name is a Russian name.” Daviswas referencing a charge that Hubbard once made when he was portraying his wifeas a Communist spy named Sara Komkovadamanov. “That was one of the reasons L.Ron Hubbard never had a relationship with her,” Davis continued. “He never had achild with her. He wasn’t married to her. But he did save her life and pull herout of that whole black magic ring.” Davis described Sara as “a couple beersshort of a six-pack, to use a phrase.” He included in the binders a letter fromher, dated June 11, 1951, a few days before their divorce proceedings:I, Sara Northrup Hubbard, do hereby state that the things I have said about L.Ron Hubbard in the courts and the public prints have been grossly exaggerated orare entirely false.I have not at any time believed otherwise than that L. Ron Hubbard was a fineand brilliant man.She went on to say, “In the future I wish to lead a quiet and orderly existencewith my little girl far away from the enturbulating influences which have ruinedmy marriage.” (Sara did live a quiet and orderly existence until her death, ofbreast cancer, in 1997. She explained why she made the tapes, in her last monthsof life. “I’m not interested in revenge,” she said. “I’m interested in thetruth.”)The meeting with the Scientology delegation lasted all day. Sandwiches werebrought in. Davis and I discussed an assertion that Marty Rathbun had made to meabout the OT III creation story. While Hubbard was in exile, Rathbun said, hewrote a memo suggesting an experiment in which ascending Scientologists mightskip the OT III level—a memo Rathbun says that Miscavige had ordered destroyed.“Of every allegation that’s in here,” Davis said, waving the binder containingfact-checking queries, “this one would perhaps be, hands down, the absolutely,without question, most libelous.” He explained that the cornerstone of the faithwas the writings of the founder. “Mr. Hubbard’s material must be and is appliedprecisely as written,” Davis said. “It’s never altered. It’s never changed. Andthere probably is no more heretical or more horrific transgression that youcould have in the Scientology religion than to alter the technology.”But hadn’t certain derogatory references to homosexuality found in some editionsof Hubbard’s books been changed after his death?Davis agreed that was so, but he maintained that “the current editions areone-hundred-percent, absolutely fully verified as being according to what Mr.Hubbard wrote.” Davis said they were checked against Hubbard’s originaldictation.“The extent to which the references to homosexuality have changed are because ofmistaken dictation?” I asked.“No, because of the insertion, I guess, of somebody who was a bigot,” Davisreplied. “The point is, it wasn’t Mr. Hubbard.”“Somebody put the material in those—”“I can only imagine,” Davis said, cutting me off.“Who would have done it?”“I have no idea.”“Hmm.”“I don’t think it really matters,” Davis said. “The point is that neither Mr.Hubbard nor the church has any opinion on the subject of anyone’s sexualorientation.…”“Someone inserted words that were not his into literature that was propagatedunder his name, and that’s been corrected now?” I asked, trying to be clear.“Yeah, I can only assume that’s what happened,” Davis said. “And by the way,” headded, referring to Quentin Hubbard, “his son’s not gay.”During his presentation, Davis showed an impressively produced video thatportrayed Scientology’s worldwide efforts for literary programs and drugeducation, the translation of Hubbard’s work into dozens of languages, and thedeluxe production facilities at Gold Base. “The real question is who wouldproduce the kind of material we produce and do the kinds of things we do, set upthe kind of organizational structure that we set up?” Davis asked. “Or what kindof man, like L. Ron Hubbard, would spend an entire lifetime researching, puttingtogether the kind of material, suffer all the trials and tribulations and gothrough all the things he went through in his life … or even with the thingsthat we, as individuals, have to go through, as part of the new religion? Workseven days a week, three hundred sixty-five days a year, fourteen-, fifteen-,eighteen-hour days sometimes, out of sheer total complete dedication to ourfaith. And do it all, for what? As some sort of sham? Just to pull the wool overeveryone’s eyes?” He concluded, “It’s ridiculous. Nobody works that hard tocheat people. Nobody gets that little sleep to screw over their fellow man.”We came to the section in the queries dealing with Hubbard’s war record. Hisvoice filling with emotion, Davis said that if it was true that Hubbard had notbeen injured, then “the injuries that he handled by the use of Dianeticsprocedures were never handled, because they were injuries that never existed;therefore, Dianetics is based on a lie; therefore, Scientology is based on alie.” He concluded: “The fact of the matter is that Mr. Hubbard was a war hero.”I believe everyone on The New Yorker side of the table was taken aback by thisdaring equation, one that seemed not only fair but testable. As proof of hisclaim that Hubbard had been injured, Davis provided a letter from the US NavalHospital in Oakland, dated December 1, 1945. It states that Hubbard had beenhospitalized that year for a duodenal ulcer, but was pronounced “fit for duty.”Davis had highlighted a passage in the letter: “Eyesight very poor, beginningwith conjunctivitis actinic in 1942. Lame in right hip from service connectedinjury. Infection in bone. Not misconduct, all service connected.” Davis addedlater that according to Robert Heinlein, Hubbard’s ankles had suffered a“drumhead-type injury”; this can result, Davis explained, “when a ship istorpedoed or bombed.”Despite subsequent requests to produce additional records, this was the onlydocument Davis provided to prove that the founder of Scientology was not lyingabout his war injuries. And yet, Hubbard’s medical records show that only fivedays after receiving the doctor’s note, Hubbard applied for a pension based onhis conjunctivitis, an ulcer, a sprained knee, malaria, and arthritis in hisright hip and shoulder. His vision was little changed from what it had beenbefore the war. This was the same period during which Hubbard claimed to havebeen blinded and made a hopeless cripple.Davis acknowledged that some of Hubbard’s medical records did not corroboratethe founder’s version of events. The church itself, Davis confided, had beentroubled by the contradiction between Hubbard’s story and the official medicalrecords. But he said there were other records that did confirm Hubbard’s versionof events, based on various documents the church had assembled. I asked wherethe documents had come from. “From St. Louis,” Davis explained, “from thearchives of navy and military service. And also, the church got it from variousavenues of research. Just meeting people, getting records from people.”The man who examined the records and reconciled the dilemma, he said, was “Mr.X.” Davis explained, “Anyone who saw JFK remembers a scene on the Mall whereKevin Costner’s character goes and meets a man named Mr. X, who’s played byDonald Sutherland.” In the film, Mr. X is an embittered intelligence agent whoexplains that the Kennedy assassination was actually a coup staged by themilitary-industrial complex. In real life, Davis said, Mr. X was Colonel LeroyFletcher Prouty, who had worked in the Office of Special Operations at thePentagon. (Oliver Stone, who directed JFK, says that Mr. X was a compositecharacter, based in part on Prouty.) In the 1980s, Prouty worked as a consultantfor Scientology and was a frequent contributor to Freedom magazine. “We finallygot so frustrated with this point of conflicting medical records that we tookall of Mr. Hubbard’s records to Fletcher Prouty,” Davis continued. Prouty toldthe church representatives that because Hubbard had an “intelligencebackground,” his records were subjected to a process known as “sheep-dipping.”Davis explained that this was military parlance for “what gets done to a set ofrecords for an intelligence officer. And, essentially, they create two sets.”(Prouty died in 2001.)The sun was setting and the Dunkin’ Donuts sign glowed brighter. As the meetingwas finally coming to an end, Davis made a plea for understanding. “We’re anorganization that’s new and tough and different and has been through a hell of alot, and has had its ups and downs,” he said. “And the fact of the matter isnobody will take the time and do the story right.”Davis had staked much of his argument on the veracity of Hubbard’s militaryrecords. The fact-checkers had already filed a Freedom of Information Actrequest for all such material with the National Archives in St. Louis, wheremilitary records are kept. Such requests can drag on well past deadline, and wewere running short on time. An editorial assistant, Yvette Siegert, flew to St.Louis to speed things along.Meantime, Davis sent me a copy of a document that he said clearly confirmedHubbard’s heroism: a “Notice of Separation from the US Naval Service,” datedDecember 6, 1945. The document specifies medals won by Hubbard, including aPurple Heart with a Palm, implying that he was wounded in action twice. But JohnE. Bircher, the spokesman for the Military Order of the Purple Heart, wrote methat the Navy uses gold and silver stars, “NOT a palm,” to indicate multiplewounds. Davis included a photograph of the actual medals Hubbard supposedly won,but two of them weren’t even created until after Hubbard left active service.There was a fire in the St. Louis archives in 1973, which destroyed a number ofdocuments, but Yvette returned with more than nine hundred pages of what thearchivists insisted were Hubbard’s complete military records. Nowhere in thefile is there mention of Hubbard’s being wounded in battle or breaking his feet.X-rays taken of Hubbard’s right shoulder and hip showed calcium deposits, butthere was no evidence of any bone or joint disease in his ankles.There is a Notice of Separation in the official records, but it is not the oneDavis sent me. The differences in the two documents are telling. The St. Louisdocument indicates that Hubbard earned four medals for service, but they reflectno distinction or valor. The church document indicates, falsely, that Hubbardcompleted four years of college, obtaining a degree in civil engineering. Theofficial document correctly notes two years of college and no degree.The official Notice of Separation was signed by Lieutenant (jg) J. C. Rhodes,who also signed Hubbard’s detachment paperwork. On the church document, thecommanding officer who signed off on Hubbard’s separation was “Howard D.Thompson, Lt. Cmdr.” The file contains a letter, from 2000, to anotherresearcher, who had written for more information about Thompson. An analyst withthe National Archives responded that the records of commissioned naval officersat that time had been reviewed and “there was no Howard D. Thompson listed.”The church, after being informed of these discrepancies, asserted, “Our experton military records has advised us that, in his considered opinion, there isnothing in the Thompson notice that would lead him to question its validity.”Eric Voelz and William Seibert, two longtime archivists at the St. Louisfacility, examined the church’s document and pronounced it a forgery.10Eric Voelz additionally told The New Yorker, “The United States has never handedout Purple Hearts with a palm.” He said that ditto marks, which are found on thedocument provided by the church, do not typically appear on forms of this kind.The font was also suspect, since it was not consistent with the size or style ofthe times. Voelz had never heard of the “Marine Medal,” and he took issue withthe “Br. & Dtch. Vict. Meds.” found on the church document, saying that medalsawarded by foreign countries are not listed on a Notice of Separation, and thatthey were unlikely to have been awarded to an American in any case.A few months after this meeting, Davis and Feshbach stopped representingScientology, even though they continued to be listed as the top spokespeople onthe church website. Rumor from former members is that Davis blew but wasrecovered and once again subjected to sec-checking. Then Feshbach becameseriously ill. According to the church, they are on a leave of absence from theSea Org for medical reasons. They are now living in Texas. When I last spoke toDavis, he said, “I think you should know my allegiances haven’t changed—at all.”He added: “I don’t have to answer your questions anymore.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 In my meeting with Isham, he had asserted that Scientology is not a“faith-based religion.” Leaving aside the question of what religion is withoutfaith, I pointed out that in Scientology’s upper levels, there was a cosmologythat would have to be accepted on faith. Isham responded that he wasn’t going todiscuss the details of OT III, nor had I asked him to. “You understand the onlyreason it’s confidential is because in the wrong hands it can hurt people,” hetold me, evidently referring to Hubbard’s warning that those who are notspiritually prepared to receive the information would die, of pneumonia.2 The church denies that this ever happened. Davis admits that the briefcase waslost but claims that there were no sex-related videos inside.3 Davis says he and his wife divorced because of irreconcilable differences, andthat “it had nothing to do with the organization.”4 Davis says that he does not recall meeting Shannon, has never scrubbed aDumpster, and has no need to borrow money.5 Davis denies that he blew or was in Las Vegas. Noriyuki Matsumaru, who was afinance officer in the Religious Technology Center at the time, told me he wasin charge of handling Davis’s punishment when he returned.6 Armstrong told me that he was actually wearing running shorts in the photo,which were obscured by the globe. His settlement with the church prohibited himfrom talking about Scientology, a prohibition he has ignored, and the church haswon two breach-of-contract suits against him, including a $500,000 judgment in2004, which Armstrong didn’t pay. He gave away most of his money and continuesto speak openly about the church.7 Rinder denies committing violence against his wife. A sheriff’s reportsupports this.8 At this point Paul Haggis had not been declared Suppressive. He later was.9 The list of those who told me they had been physically assaulted by DavidMiscavige: Mike Rinder, Gale Irwin, Marty Rathbun, Jefferson Hawkins, Tom DeVocht, Mark Fisher, Bruce Hines, Bill Dendiu, Guy White, Marc Headley, andStefan Castle.

DidMohammed really ride into Heaven on the back of his legendary transport, thesteed Buraq? Did Jesus’ disciples actually encounter their crucified leaderafter his burial? Were these miracles or visions or lies? Would the religionssurvive without them?There is no question that a belief system can have positive, transformativeeffects on people’s lives. Many current and former Scientologists have attestedto the value of their training and the insight they derived from their study ofthe religion. They have the right to believe whatever they choose. But it is adifferent matter to use the protections afforded a religion by the FirstAmendment to falsify history, to propagate forgeries, and to cover uphuman-rights abuses.Hubbard once wrote that “the old religion”—by which he meant Christianity—wasbased on “a very painful lie,” which was the idea of Heaven. “Yes, I’ve been toHeaven. And so have you,” he writes. “It was complete with gates, angels andplaster saints—and electronic implantation equipment.” Heaven, he says, wasbuilt as an implant station 43 trillion years ago. “So there was a Heaven afterall—which is why you are on this planet and were condemned never to be freeagain—until Scientology.” He went on: “What does this do to any religious natureof Scientology? It strengthens it. New religions always overthrow the false godsof the old, they do something to better man. We can improve man. We can show theold gods false. And we can open up the universe as a happier place in which aspirit may dwell.”One might compare Scientology with the Church of Latter Day Saints, a newreligion of the previous century. The founder of the movement, Joseph Smith,claimed to have received a pair of golden plates from the angel Moroni inupstate New York in 1827, along with a pair of magical “seeing stones,” whichallowed him to read the contents. Three years later, he published The Book ofMormon, founding a movement that would provoke the worst outbreak of religiouspersecution in American history. Mormons were chased all across the countrybecause of their practice of polygamy and their presumed heresy. Smith himselfwas murdered by a mob in Carthage, Illinois. His beleaguered followers sought toescape the United States and establish a religious theocracy in the territory ofUtah, which they called Zion. Mormons were so despised that there was a bill inCongress to exterminate them. And yet Mormonism would evolve and go on to becomeone of the fastest-growing denominations in the twentieth, and now thetwenty-first, centuries. Members of the faith now openly run for president ofthe United States. In much of the world, this religion, which was once tormentedbecause of its perceived anti-American values, is now thought of as being themost American of religions; indeed, that’s how many Mormons think of it as well.It is a measure not only of the religion’s success but also of the ability of afaith to adapt and change.And yet Joseph Smith was plainly a liar. In answer to the charge of polygamy, heclaimed he had only one wife, when he had already accumulated a harem. A strangebut revealing episode occurred in 1835, when Smith purchased several Egyptianmummies from an itinerant merchant selling such curiosities. Inside the mummycases were scrolls of papyrus, reduced to fragments, which Smith declared werethe actual writings of the Old Testament patriarchs Abraham and Joseph. Smithproduced what he called a translation of the papyri, titled The Book of Abraham.It still forms a portion of Mormon doctrine. In America at the time, Egyptianwas still thought to be indecipherable, but the Rosetta Stone had already beendiscovered, and Jean-François Champollion had successfully rendered thehieroglyphic language into French. In 1966, the Joseph Smith papyri werediscovered in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It was soonshown that the passages that Smith “translated” were common funerary documentswith no reference to Abraham or Joseph whatsoever. This fraud has been known fordecades, but it has made little difference in the growth of the religion or thedevotion of its adherents. Belief in the irrational is one definition of faith,but it is also true that clinging to absurd or disputed doctrines binds acommunity of faith together and defines a barrier to the outside world.The evolution of Scientology into a religion also resembles the progression ofChristian Science, the faith Tommy Davis was born into. Like Hubbard, Mary BakerEddy, the founder of Christian Science, experimented with alternative ways ofhealing. Like Hubbard, she claimed to have been an invalid who cured herself;she, too, wrote a book based on her experience, Science and Health with Key tothe Scriptures, which became the basis for the founding of the Church of Christ,Scientist, in 1879. Far more than is the case with Scientology, ChristianScience stands against mainstream medical practices, even though bothorganizations lay claim to being more “scientific” than religious. Manyreligions, including Christian Science, Jehovah’s Witnesses, evenChristianity—have known scorn and persecution. Some, like the Shakers and theMillerites, died out, but others, including Mormons and Pentecostals, haveelbowed their way into the crowded religious landscape of American society.The practice of disconnection, or shunning, is not unique to Scientology, nor isthe longing for religious sanctuary. America itself was founded by truebelievers who separated themselves from their non-Puritan kinfolk by placing anocean between them. New religious leaders continually appear, giving expressionto unmet spiritual needs. There is a constant churning of spiritual movementsand denominations all over the world, one that advances with freedom ofexpression. One must look at L. Ron Hubbard and the odyssey of his movementagainst this historical backdrop and the natural human yearning fortranscendence and submission.In the late 1970s, I lived for several months in an Amish and Mennonitecommunity in central Pennsylvania, researching my first book.1 Their movementhad been nearly annihilated in Europe, but in the 1720s they began taking refugein William Penn’s colony, the “holy experiment” of Pennsylvania. Amish life hasremained essentially unchanged since then, a kind of museum ofeighteenth-century farm life. The adherents live sequestered lives, out of thedrift of popular culture, on a kind of religious atoll. I was moved by thebeauty and simplicity of their lives. The Amish see the Earth as God’s garden,and their duty is to tend it. The environment they surround themselves with isfilled with a sense of peace and a purposeful orderliness. Individuality issanded down to the point that one’s opinions are as similar to another’s as theapproved shape of a bonnet or the regulation beard. Because fashion and noveltyare outlawed, one feels comfortably encased in a timeless, unchanging vacuum.The enforced conformity dims the noise of diversity and the anxiety ofuncertainty; one feels closer to eternity. One is also aware of the electrifiedfence of orthodoxy that surrounds and protects this Edenic paradise, and theexpulsion that awaits those who doubt or question. Still, there is a kind ofquiet majesty in the Amish culture—not because of their rejection of modernity,but because of their principled non-violence and their adherence to a way ofliving that tempers their fanaticism. The Amish suffer none of the socialopprobrium that Scientologists must endure; indeed, they are generally treatedlike beloved endangered animals, coddled by their neighbors and smiled upon bysociety. And yet they are highly schismatic, willing to break off all relationswith their dearest relatives on what would seem to an outsider to be an inanepoint of doctrine or even the question of whether one can allow eaves on a houseor pictures on a wall.As adorable as the Amish appear to strangers, such isolated and intellectuallydeprived religious communities can become self-destructive, especially when theyrevolve around the whims of a single tyrannical leader. David Koresh createdsuch a community in the Branch Davidian compound that he established near Wacoand aptly called Ranch Apocalypse. In 1993, I was asked to write about the siegethat was then under way. I decided not to, because there were more reporters onthe scene than Branch Davidians; however, I had been unsettled by the sight ofthe twenty-one children that Koresh sent out of the compound shortly before thefatal inferno. Those children left behind their parents and the only life theyhad known. They were ripped out of the community of faith, placed in governmentvans, and ushered through a curtain of federal agents and reporters onto thestage of an alien world and who knows what future. I thought there must be otherchildren who had experienced similar traumas; what had become of them?There is a strangely contorted mound in a cemetery in Oakland, California, closeby the naval hospital where Hubbard spent his last months in uniform. Under anundistinguished headstone rest four hundred bodies out of the more than ninehundred followers of Jim Jones who perished in Jonestown in 1978. The casketshad been stacked on top of each other on the side of a bulldozed hillside, thenthe earth was filled in, grass was planted, and the tragedy of Jonestown wasburied in the national memory as one more inexplicable religious calamity. Themembers of the Peoples Temple, as Jones called his movement, had been drawn tohis Pentecostal healing services, his social activism, and his racialegalitarianism. Charisma and madness were inextricably woven into the fabric ofhis personality, along with an insatiable sexual appetite that accompaniedJones’s terror of abandonment. In his search for a secure religious community,Jones had repeatedly uprooted his congregation. Finally, in May 1977, the entiremovement disappeared, virtually overnight. Without warning, leaving jobs andhomes and family members who were not a part of the Peoples Temple, they werespirited away to a jungle encampment in Guyana, South America, which Jonesbilled as a socialist paradise. There he began to school them in suicide.I learned that not everyone had died in Jonestown. Among the survivors wereJones’s three sons: Stephan, Tim, and Jim Junior. They had been away from thecamp playing basketball against the Guyanese national team in the capital cityof Georgetown. These haunted young men had never before told their stories. Oneof the privileges of being a journalist is to be trusted to hear such memoriesin all their emotional complexity. One night I went to dinner with Tim Jones andhis wife, Lorna. Tim was physically powerful, able to press a hundred poundswith either arm, but he couldn’t fly on an airplane because of his panicattacks. He wanted his wife to come along because he had never given her a fullaccount, and he wanted to be in a public place so he wouldn’t cry. It was Timwho had to return to Jonestown to identify the bodies of everyone he knew,including his parents, his siblings, and his own wife and children, his wholeworld. He was convinced that, if he had been there, he could have prevented thesuicides. He told this story, bawling, pounding the table, as the waiter steeredaway and the other diners stared at their plates. Never have I felt so keenlythe danger of new religious movements and the damage that is done to people whoare lured into such groups, not out of weakness in character but through theirdesire to do good and live meaningful lives.SCIENTOLOGY WANTS TO BE understood as a scientific approach to spiritualenlightenment. It has, really, no grounding in science at all. It would bebetter understood as a philosophy of human nature; seen in that light, Hubbard’sthought could be compared with that of other moral philosophers, such asImmanuel Kant and Søren Kierkegaard, although no one has ever approached thesweep of Hubbard’s work. His often ingenious and minutely observed categories ofbehavior have been shadowed by the bogus elements of his personality and theabsurdity that is interwoven with his bouts of brilliance, making it difficultfor non-Scientologists to know what to make of it. Serious academic study of hiswriting has also been constrained by the vindictive reputation of the church.The field of psychotherapy is Scientology’s more respectable cousin, although itcannot honestly claim to be a science, either. Freud’s legacy is that of a freeand open inquiry into the motivations of behavior. He also createdpostulates—such as the ego, the superego, and the id—that might not endurestrict scientific testing, but do offer an approach to understanding the innerworkings of the personality. Hubbard’s concept of the reactive and analyticalminds attempts to do something similar. Jung’s exploration of archetypes, basedon his psychological explorations, anticipates the evolution of Dianetics intoScientology—in other words, the drift from therapy to spiritualism.There is no point in questioning Scientology’s standing as a religion; in theUnited States, the only opinion that really counts is that of the IRS; moreover,people do believe in the principles of Scientology and live within a communityof faith—what else is required to accept it as such? The stories that inviteridicule or disbelief, such as Xenu and the Galactic Confederacy, may befanciful—or pure “space opera,” to use Hubbard’s term—but every religionfeatures bizarre and uncanny elements. Just consider some of the obvious sourcesof Hubbard’s unique concoction—Buddhism, Hinduism, magic, General Semantics, andshamanism—that also provide esoteric categories to explain the ineffablemysteries of life and consciousness. One can find parallels in many faiths withthe occult beliefs and practices of Scientology. The concept of expelling bodythetans, for instance, is akin to casting out demons in the Christian tradition.But like every new religion, Scientology is handicapped by the frailties of itsfounder and the absence of venerable traditions that enshrine it in the culture.To an outsider who has struggled to understand the deep appeal of Scientology toits adherents, despite the flaws and contradictions of the religion that many ofthem reluctantly admit, perhaps the missing element is art. Older faiths have abody of literature, music, ceremony, and iconography that infuses the doctrinalaspects of the religion with mystery and importance. The sensual experience ofbeing in a great cathedral or mosque may have nothing to do with “belief,” butit does draw people to the religion and rewards them emotionally. Scientologyhas built many impressive churches, but they are not redolent palaces of art.The aesthetic element in Scientology is Hubbard’s arresting voice as a writer.His authoritative but folksy tone and his impressionistic grasp of human naturehave cast a spell over millions of readers. More important, however, is thenature of his project: the self-portrait of the inside of his mind. It isperhaps impossible to reduce his mentality to a psychiatric diagnosis, in partbecause his own rendering of it is so complex, intricate, and comprehensive thatone can only stand back and appreciate the qualities that drove him, hour afterhour, year after year, to try to get it all on the page—his insight, his daring,his narcissism, his defiance, his relentlessness, his imagination—these are thetraits of an artist. It is one reason that Hubbard identified with the creativecommunity and many of them with him.Scientology orients itself toward celebrity, and by doing so, the church awardsfamousness a spiritual value. People who seek fame—especially in theentertainment industry—naturally gravitate to Hollywood, where Scientology iswaiting for them, validating their ambition and promising recruits a way in. Thechurch has pursued a marketing strategy that relies heavily on endorsements bycelebrities, who actively promote the religion. They speak of the positive rolethat Scientology has played in their lives. When David Miscavige awarded TomCruise the Freedom Medal of Valor in 2004, he praised his effectiveness as aspokesperson, saying, “Across ninety nations, five thousand people hear his wordof Scientology every hour.” It is difficult to know how such a figure wasderived, but according to Miscavige, “Every minute of every hour someone reachesfor LRH technology, simply because they know Tom Cruise is a Scientologist.”Probably no other member of the church derives as much material benefit from hisreligion as Cruise does, and consequently none bears a greater moralresponsibility for the indignities inflicted on members of the Sea Org,sometimes directly because of his membership. Excepting Paul Haggis, noprominent Hollywood Scientologist has spoken out publicly against the widespreadallegations of physical abuse, involuntary confinement, and forced servitudewithin the church’s clergy, although many such figures have quietly walked away.Since leaving Scientology, Haggis has been in therapy, which he has foundhelpful. He’s learned how much he blames others for his problems, especiallythose closest to him. “I really wish I had found a good therapist when I wastwenty-one,” he said. In Scientology, he always felt a subtle pressure toimpress his auditor and then write up a glowing success story. Now, he said,“I’m not fooling myself that I’m a better man than I am.”The same month that Haggis’s resignation from the church had become public,United Artists, Tom Cruise’s studio, terminated Haggis’s development deal. Iasked if the break had anything to do with his resignation. Haggis thought for amoment, then said, “You don’t do something that obvious—it’d be a bad PR move.”He added, “They’d run out of money, so we all knew we were being kicked out.”Recently, he and Deborah decided to divorce. They have moved to the sameneighborhood in New York, so that they can share custody of their son. Deborahhas also left the church. Both say that the decision to end their marriage hasnothing to do with their renunciation of Scientology.On November 9, 2010, The Next Three Days premiered at the Ziegfeld Theatre, inManhattan. Movie stars lined the red carpet as photographers fired away. JasonBeghe was there, and he told me that he had taken in Daniel Montalvo, the youngman who lost his finger in the church book-publishing plant. Montalvo hadrecently blown from the Sea Org. He was nineteen years old. “He’s never seentelevision,” the actor marveled. “He doesn’t even know who Robert Redford is.”Nazanin Boniadi, who has a small part in the movie, was also there; Haggis hadgiven her the role after learning what had happened to her after the church hadengineered her match with Tom Cruise. “Naz’s story was one of those that made merealize I had been lied to for a long time, that I had to leave and do soloudly,” Haggis later confided.After the screening, everyone drifted over to the Oak Room of the Plaza Hotel.Haggis was in a corner receiving accolades from his friends when I found him. Iasked if he felt that he had finally left Scientology. “I feel much more myself,but there’s a sadness,” he admitted. “If you identify yourself with somethingfor so long, and suddenly you think of yourself as not that thing, it leaves abit of space.” He went on, “It’s not really the sense of a loss of community.Those people who walked away from me were never really my friends.” Heunderstood how they felt about him, and why. “In Scientology, in the EthicsConditions, as you go down from Normal through Doubt, you get to Enemy, andfinally, near the bottom, there is Treason. What I did was a treasonous act.”The film did poorly at the box office. It had the misfortune of opening to mixedreviews on the same night that the last installment of the Harry Potter seriespremiered. Haggis had to close his office. It looked like another bleak periodin his career, but he followed it by writing a screenplay for a video game,Modern Warfare 3, which would go on to set a sales record, earning $1 billion inthe first sixteen days after its release.I once asked Haggis about the future of his relationship with Scientology.“These people have long memories,” he told me. “My bet is that, within twoyears, you’re going to read something about me in a scandal that looks like ithas nothing to do with the church.” He thought for a moment, then said, “I wasin a cult for thirty-four years. Everyone else could see it. I don’t know why Icouldn’t.”MARTY RATHBUN DIVIDES the people who leave Scientology into three camps. Thereare those who reject the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard entirely, such as PaulHaggis; and those who still believe entirely, but think that the church underDavid Miscavige has taken Scientology away from the original, true teachings ofthe founder. There is a third category, which he has been struggling to define,that includes those people who are willing neither to swallow all the dogma norto throw away the insights they gained from their experience. Hubbard’s life andteachings are still the guideposts of their lives. “It wouldn’t stick if therewasn’t a tremendous amount of good it did for them,” Rathbun says. He’s beenstudying the history of other religions for parallels, and he quotes an old Zenproverb: “When the master points at the Moon, many people never see it at all,they only look at the master.”Rathbun has been counseling Scientologists who leave the church, and because ofthat he’s been subject to continual monitoring and harassment from the church.His computers have been hacked and phone records have been stolen. A group of“Squirrel Busters” moved into his little community of Ingleside on the Bay, nearCorpus Christi, in order to spy on him and drive him away through constantharassment. They wore video cameras on their hats and patrolled the neighborhoodin a golf cart or occasionally a paddleboat. This lasted for 199 days. Thattactic didn’t work, because his neighbors rallied to his support. Many otherdefectors have been harassed and followed by private investigators.On a sweltering Fourth of July weekend, 2011, a group of about a hundred“independent” Scientologists gathered at a lake cabin in East Texas. Rathbun andMike Rinder had organized it. A few courageous swimmers were leaping off thedock, but rumors of alligators kept most people on the shore. A brief, powerfulstorm rolled through, driving everyone to shelter.One of the attendees was Stephen Pfauth, known as Sarge, a Vietnam veteran whohad gotten into Scientology in 1975. He is a slender man with haunted eyes. “Itwas one of those sudden things that happened,” he explained. “I was looking forsomething, especially spiritually.” He had run across an advertisement on theback of a magazine for Hubbard’s book Fundamentals of Thought. Soon afterreading it, he flew to Washington, DC, and took a three-day workshop called LifeRepair Auditing. “I was blown away.” He immediately quit his job. “I sold myhouse and bought the Bridge.” Soon, a church official began cultivating him,saying, “LRH needs your help.” Pfauth joined the Sea Org that November.He became head of Hubbard’s security detail, and was with the founder on hisCreston ranch in his final days, with Pat and Annie Broeker. In early 1985,Hubbard became extremely ill and spent a week in a hospital. Pfauth was told itwas for pancreatitis. “I didn’t find out about the strokes until later,” hesaid. After that, Hubbard stayed mostly in his Blue Bird bus, except when hecame out to do his own laundry. Pfauth might be shoveling out the stables andthey’d talk.[images/Wrig_9780385350273_epub_021_r1.jpg]Marty Rathbun with an E-Meter at his home in Ingleside on the Bay, Texas, 2011Six weeks before the leader died, Pfauth hesitantly related, Hubbard called himinto the bus. He was sitting in his little breakfast nook. “He told me he wasdropping his body. He named a specific star he was going to circle. That rehabsa being. He told me he’d failed, he’s leaving,” Pfauth said. “He said he’s notcoming back here to Earth. He didn’t know where he’d wind up.”“How’d you react?” I asked.“I got good and pissy-ass drunk,” Pfauth said. “Annie found me at five in themorning in my old truck, Kris Kringle, and I had beer cans all around me. I didnot take it well.”I mentioned the legend in Scientology that Hubbard will return.“That’s bull crap,” Pfauth said. “He wanted to drop the body and leave. And hetold me basically that he’d failed. All the work and everything, he’d failed.”I had heard a story that Pfauth had built some kind of electroshock mechanismfor Hubbard in the last month of his life. I didn’t know what to make of it,given Hubbard’s horror of electroshock therapy. Pfauth’s eyes searched theceiling as if he were looking for divine help. He explained that Hubbard washaving trouble getting rid of a body thetan. “He wanted me to build a machinethat would up the voltage and basically blow the thetan away. You can’t kill athetan but just get him out of there. And also kill the body.”“So it was a suicide machine?”“Basically.”Pfauth was staggered by Hubbard’s request, but the challenge interested him. “Ifigured that building a Tesla coil was the best way to go.” The Tesla coil is atransformer that increases the voltage without upping the current. Pfauthpowered it with a 12-volt automobile battery, and then hooked the entireapparatus to an E-Meter. “So, if you’re on the cans, you can flip a button andit does its thing,” Pfauth explained. “I didn’t want to kill him, just to scarehim.”“Did he try it?”“He blew up my E-Meter. Annie brought it back to me, all burnt up.”This was just before Christmas, 1985. Hubbard died a few weeks later of anunrelated stroke.The believers are still waiting for his return.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 City Children, Country Summer (Scribner’s, 1979)."},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND A NOTE ON SOURCESCompared with other religions I have written about, the published literature onScientology is impoverished and clouded by bogus assertions. Some crucialdetails one would want to know about the church have been withheld—for instance,the number of people who are members of the International Association ofScientologists, which would be the best guide to knowing the true dimensions ofthe church’s membership. The church promised to provide an organizational chart,but never did so; in any case, it would have been more notional than actual interms of the flow of authority and responsibility, since many of the church’sexecutive hierarchy have been quarantined for years in the Hole at the directionof the only individual who controls the institution.L. Ron Hubbard’s extensive—indeed, record-breaking—published works form the coreof the documentary material that this book draws upon. Hubbard expressed himselfvariously in books, articles, bulletins, letters, lectures, and journals; onecannot understand the man or the organization he created without examining hiswork in each of these media. The church has published a useful compendium ofHubbard’s thought in What Is Scientology? Although the church employs afull-time Hubbard biographer and has commissioned several comprehensive works inthe past, there is still no authorized account of Hubbard’s life. One of theprevious Hubbard biographers, Omar Garrison, did write a full-scale account ofHubbard’s life, which was suppressed. The church has published a series of Ronmagazines, which have been compiled as a highly selective encyclopedia. Foryears, the church has been mopping up other documents—journals, letters,photographs—and withholding them from public view, which makes it difficult forindependent researchers to fill in blanks in the historical record.There are several important repositories of information that I have used in thisbook, however: the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress; the HeinleinPrize Trust and the UC Santa Cruz Archives; the Kenneth Spencer Research Libraryof the University of Kansas; and the National Personnel Records Center in St.Louis, Missouri. The Stephen A. Kent Collection on Alternative Religions,University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, houses an important collectionof Scientology material, and Professor Kent graciously allowed my assistant,Lauren Wolf, to work in his archive. In addition to being an endless source ofmemories on the history of the church, Karen de la Carriere made her extensivephotographic archive available. Many thanks to these valuable resources fortheir cooperation.There are three major unauthorized biographies of L. Ron Hubbard: RussellMiller’s excellent Bare-Faced Messiah (1987) was the first in-depth look at theman. Scientology unsuccessfully sued Miller, a British journalist, who says thatwhile researching his book he was spied upon, his phone was tapped, and effortswere made to frame him for a murder he did not commit. Soon thereafter, BentCorydon’s L. Ron Hubbard: Messiah or Madman? (1987) appeared, followed by JonAtack’s A Piece of Blue Sky (1990). The church attempts to discredit both ofthese authors because they are former Scientologists who the church says wereexpelled from the organization. It is notable that no comprehensive biography ofHubbard has been attempted since the church’s campaign against these books.The scarcity of academic work on the church and its leaders testifies to thecaution with which scholars regard the subject, as well as the reluctance of theorganization to divulge information about its members, beliefs, and innerworkings to qualified social scientists. In 1976, Roy Wallis published The Roadto Total Freedom: A Sociological Analysis of Scientology, the first significantacademic study of the church. While he was researching his book, Wallis wasspied upon, and forged letters were sent to his colleagues and employersimplicating him in a homosexual relationship. Renunciation and Reformulation: AStudy of Conversion in an American Sect, an insightful book by HarrietWhitehead, an anthropologist, appeared in 1987. Since then, contributions fromthe academy have been meager. At this point, I should also acknowledge the workof Hugh Urban, at Ohio State University, David S. Touretzky at Carnegie MellonUniversity, and Stephen Kent, at the University of Alberta. Each of thesescholars has produced important contributions to the understanding ofScientology, despite the obstacles and threats posed by the church.Court documents contain a valuable record of the history and culture of thechurch and its founder; this is especially true of the landmark 1991 suit Churchof Scientology California vs. Gerald Armstrong. David Miscavige has been shyabout giving interviews, but he has provided testimony and declarations inseveral lawsuits, most extensively in 1990, in Bent Corydon v. Church ofScientology.A handful of courageous journalists have provided much of the essentialinformation available about the culture of Scientology. Paulette Cooper openedthe door with her 1971 exposé, The Scandal of Scientology. I have outlined inthis book some of the harassment that she endured. Joel Sappell and Robert W.Welkos of the Los Angeles Times did a remarkable six-part series in 1990.Richard Leiby has been writing about Scientology since the early 1980s, firstfor the Clearwater Sun and subsequently for the Washington Post. Richard Beharcovered the subject in Barron’s and most notably in his 1991 exposé for Time,“The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power.” Janet Reitman had unparalleled access tothe church for her 2006 Rolling Stone article, “Inside Scientology,” whichbecame a book of the same title in 2011. Chris Owen, an independent researcher,has written extensively about the church online, and has revealed much of theinformation available about Hubbard’s wartime experiences. Tom Smith hasconducted a number of knowledgeable interviews on his radio show, The Edge,broadcast by Hillsborough Community College in Tampa, Florida. Joe Childs andThomas C. Tobin of the Tampa Bay Times (formerly the St. Petersburg Times) havewritten groundbreaking stories, especially about the abuse inside the churchhierarchy. Tony Ortega has been writing about Scientology since 1995, for thePhoenix New Times, and he continued as a valuable resource in the pages and theblog of the Village Voice until his recent resignation. Several of thesejournalists have been harassed, investigated, sued, or threatened in variousways. I am the beneficiary of their skill and persistence.In the last decade, defectors from the Sea Org have provided a rich trove ofpersonal accounts. These have taken the form of memoirs and blog postings, andthey have accumulated into an immense indictment of the inner workings of thechurch. Among the memoirs I should single out are Marc Headley’s Blown for Good:Behind the Iron Curtain of Scientology (2009); Nancy Many’s My Billion YearContract (2009); Amy Scobee’s Abuse at the Top (2010); and Jefferson Hawkins’sCounterfeit Dreams (2010). Kate Bornstein’s A Queer and Pleasant Danger (2012)provides an especially interesting account of the Apollo days.Websites devoted to challenging the church have proliferated, beginning withalt.religion.scientology in 1991. Some of the most active are AndreasHeldal-Lund’s Operation Clambake at xenu.net [http://xenu.net]; Steve Hall’sscientology-cult.com [http://scientology-cult.com]; Arnaldo Lerma’s lermanet.com[http://lermanet.com], and the Ex Scientology Message Board, which is an onlinecommunity for former members of the church, founded by “Emma” and now run by“Mick Wenlock and Ethercat.” Exscientologykids.org[http://Exscientologykids.org], started by Jenna Miscavige Hill, DavidMiscavige’s niece, among others, played an important role in Paul Haggis’sdecision to leave the church. Although many of the postings on these websitesare anonymous, they provide rich texture to a subculture that few outsiders canappreciate.One blog has become a rallying point for “independent” Scientologists who haverenounced the official church: Marty Rathbun’s Moving on Up a Little Higher,which began in 2009. It has been the source of many telling personal stories, aswell as documents leaked by church insiders. Rathbun and his wife, MoniqueCarle, have suffered constant harassment, along with surveillance by privateinvestigators, because of his open challenge to Miscavige’s authority.In researching this book, I conducted hundreds of interviews, the preponderanceof them on the record. I have always been sparing in relying on anonymoussources, but writing about Scientology poses a challenge for a reporter. Anumber of my sources were fearful of retribution by the church—in particular,legal harassment and the loss of contact with family members. Many keyindividuals have signed confidentiality agreements that enforce their silence. Iowe all my sources a great debt of gratitude for their willingness to speak tome despite the risk to their own well-being.Paul Haggis plays a unique role in this book. He never intended to talk publiclyabout his experience in the church. That he opened up to me, knowing thechurch’s reputation for retribution, is a measure of his courage and hisforthrightness.This book is dedicated to my colleagues at The New Yorker, and so my list ofdebts includes the many people there who assisted me in writing the profile ofPaul Haggis (“The Apostate,” Feb. 14 and 21, 2011) that became the startingpoint for my research into Scientology. I had talked previously with DavidRemnick, the editor of the magazine, about an article on the Church ofScientology. David appreciated the legal hazards, but I don’t think either of usrealized the amount of time and resources the piece would ultimately require.His commitment was all the more meaningful coming during a period when themagazine was under the same financial stress that other print media wereexperiencing. My editor at The New Yorker, Daniel Zalewski, has shepherded methrough many articles, and his steadiness and advocacy are always deeplyappreciated. Daniel’s assistant at the time, Yvette Siegert, cheerfully flew toSt. Louis as our deadline approached to fetch L. Ron Hubbard’s military recordsfrom the archives there. Lynn Oberlander, the magazine’s lawyer, was a stalwartally, undaunted by the legal team arrayed by the church and by certaincelebrities who were mentioned in the article. Ann Goldstein, the magazine’scopy chief, did her usual careful and respectful job. Nick Traverse and KellyBare labored to put the thousands of pages of documents on the Cloud—a highlyexperimental procedure at this old-school magazine—so that we could all haveaccess to the same material simultaneously. I want to pay particular tribute tothe New Yorker fact-checking department, headed by Peter Canby. Jennifer Stahlwas the lead checker, spending six months full-time on the piece; herscrupulousness was inspiring, and she commanded the respect of everyone whodealt with her. Tim Farrington also worked intensely on the article. Eventually,a good portion of the department pitched in, including Nandi Rodrigo, MikeSpies, Katia Bachko, and even Peter himself. To be supported by such trulyprofessional colleagues means so much.Although the Church of Scientology was not a willing partner in the effort towrite this book, I want to thank the spokespeople I worked with—Tommy Davis,Jessica Feshbach, and Karin Pouw—for responding to what must have seemed anendless stream of queries from me and the fact-checkers. I have no doubt thatthey will quarrel with the results, but the book is more accurate because oftheir participation, however reluctant that might have been. Initially, Davispermitted me to speak with several active members of the church, but the doorclosed on that opportunity. I was never allowed to talk to David Miscavige orany of the upper-tier executives I requested. (As I would learn, many of themwere sequestered and not available in any case.) A reporter can only talk topeople who are willing to talk to him; whatever complaints the church may haveabout my reporting, many limitations can be attributed to its decision torestrict my interactions with people who might have provided more favorabletestimony.Robert Jay Lifton did me the honor of reading this book in manuscript andproviding his insights, especially on the issue of thought reform. R. ScottAppleby helped me place Scientology in the context of other world religions. Myfriend Stephen Harrigan also commented on an early draft, as he has done on manyoccasions. A writer depends on such willing friends.My editor at Knopf, Ann Close, has been through five books with me—a marvelousrelationship that has now spanned a quarter of a century. For this book, theKnopf team labored under a stressful deadline, and I would like to acknowledgethe extraordinary efforts of Anke Steinecke, legal counsel; Katherine Hourigan,the managing editor; Paul Bogaards, the director of publicity; Kim Thornton, thepublicist for this book; Kevin Bourke, the production editor; Claire BradleyOng, the production manager; and Cassandra Pappas, the designer. I also thank myagent, Andrew Wylie, for his sage counsel.When I began writing the book, I hired two young and talented fact-checkers,Axel Gerdau and Lauren Wolf. They were both interested in long-form journalism,and I thought I might be able to teach them something about that; so, oneevening a week, I held a class for them, in which the text was the unwrittenbook we were working on. Axel and Lauren were immediately plunged into therecondite world of Scientology, but they adroitly managed to negotiate thelanguage and the thinking. After Axel went on to other pursuits, Lauren remainedas my research assistant. The book has gained immeasurably from her curiosityand doggedness, as well as her natural human sympathy—qualities that willcertainly ensure her future career and reward those who have the good fortune toenjoy her company.As usual, I owe special thanks to my wife, Roberta, who has once again set asidemany anxieties to support my work."},{"pageContent":"NOTESINTRODUCTION1 [Wrig_9780385350273_epub_itr_r1.htm#itr-nts1a] 8 million members: Interviewwith Tommy Davis, the former chief spokesperson for the Church of ScientologyInternational.
