They are mentioned by Sennacherib with the Hagarenes (“wanderers”), being attacked by him in 703 B .

The herald or preacher swells with inspiration, and “bursts forth” in speech. The prophet was at fi rst called a Roeh (“seer”) or diviner (1 Sam. ix, 9), who had “second sight.” The bands, or order, of Naba ī m are said (1 Sam. x, 5, 10) to have fi rst appeared in the time of Saul, being organised by Samuel, and these prophets fell into ecstacies, and went out with drums and pipes, lutes and harps, like modern Dervishes (1 Sam. xix, 20, 23, 24).

The hooded snake is a great Egyptian emblem, and represented on the Phœnician shrine of ’Ain el H ̣ aiy ā t (“the spring of serpents”). The N ā ga tribes of India were serpent worshipers, but Angami N ā gas in Assam claim descent from the lingam (see Journal Anthrop. Instit ., August 1897), and we must be cautious in applying the term to tribes, for in Assam, as Prof. Beal points out ( Proc. Rl. Geogr.

Indra’s favourite name is Indra-n ā g, and by aid of Brahm ā ’s arrow (N ā ga-pasa) R ā ma and his brother escaped their foes. The hero Arjuna was restored by the N ā ga charm of his wife Ul ū pi. The sun K ā syapa was father of a thousand many-headed N ā gas, by his wife Kadru, daughter of Daksha, and among these were Sesha and V ā suki. Neither Br ā hmanism nor Buddhism could overcome N ā ga worship, and both absorbed its symbolism. The Naga was “ the biter ” or “ the strangler,” the dragon (or “ gazer ”), the guardian of hidden treasures, and one who entere d into secret places. It secretes poison, but “ none but women know where its feet are ” (Prof. A. de Gubernatis, Zool. Mythol ., ii, chap. 5), though sacred footprints are common in N ā ga shrines (see Pad). The Pancha-muke, or “ fi ve- faced,” N ā ga spreads his fi ve hoods as a canopy over many gods. The feast of the N ā g-Pancham ī (“ serpent fi fth ”) is held on the 5th of Savan, about the end of July. A whole district in Ban ā ras is named from the N ā ga-Ku ā n or “ snake well ”—one of the oldest “ stations ” in this sacred city—and here, at th e Panchami-Mela, both sexes bathe in the dirty pool. [The Jews so bathe also in the pool of Gihon, where a serpent is said by Arab tradition to swallow the waters of the intermittent spring.—E D .] They present offerings to the N ā ga, and carry home small N ā ga images as charms. Strange scenes of licence occur at this dark square well with its steep, well-worn steps, when shepherds and ploughmen of the lower castes have bathed and begin to sport. The walls of the building are of massive masonry, with many niches for images of Hanum ā n, Ganesa, and P ā rvati, sheltered by three or fi ve headed N ā gas ; and on the fl oor of one niche we observed a stone lingam round which a N ā ga was represented as twining. Elsewhere the serpent al so coils round the lingam, being carved in the Argha in which it stands. The dreaded snake was called by fair names (as the fairies were called “ good people ”), and was the Agatho-daim ō n (“ good spirit ”) in the west. Even the Buddhist “ wheel ” shows sacred snakes in heaven. Many powerful tribes in India itself were called N ā gas, such as the founders of Nag-pur in Central India, or the natives of the Southern N ā ga tracts.

The Chinese are called N ā gas in the earliest chronicles of Tibet ( Proc. Bengal Rl. Asiatic Socy ., Feby., 1892), speaking N ā ga-bh ā sha or “ serpent speech,” and the dragon is the great Chines e symbol (see China, Korea, and Takshas). Indra-n ā g, as a crowned king with a bow, is attended by N ā gas : he has many shrines in the hilly tracts above the Bi ā s, R ā vi, or Vibali river (Dr Oldham, Journal Rl. Asiatic Society , July 1891), and is said to have been a N ā ga chief who once reigned in Paradise, but came back to earth to rule N ā gas. The Naga kings once ruled in the N.W. of India, in Sind, Katch, Gujer ā t, and on the Ganges, as Ahi- Kshatras or “ serpent warriors ” (see Ahi). The T ā ka or N ā ga king- dom embraced the country watered by the seven rivers fl owing from Kail ā sa (Mr Hewitt, Journal Rl. Asiatic Socy ., 1889-1890). In 1891, according to Dr Oldham (as above cited) the serpent gods Sesha, and V ā suki were still worshiped with th e ancient rites at the festival of the N ā g-Takshaka, just as in the days of N ā ra R ā ja, about 200 to 300 B . C . The temples are dedicated to Siva, but human fi gures decked with serpents represent the N ā ga R ā jas of the race, and over each is a canopy of cobras with 5, 7, or 9 hoods. In these temples the N ā ga is the chief deity, and subordinate fi gures, such as N ā gas and Nagunis— men and women with serpent tails and human heads—do not appear. One of the N ā ga-R ā ja shrines contains a lingam, and Siva’s bull is represented outside others, but is not worshiped hy the serpent wor- shipers. Goats and sheep are sacri fi ced to the N ā ga, votive offerings are set up, lights and incense are used, and the deity is consulted by an attendant, the devotees being mainly non-Aryans. Only descend- ants of Takht-n ā g, and of B ā s-deo, act as priests at the rites, and (except Br ā hmans) they alone approach the Kail ā s-Kund or holy tank. The names of B ā sak-n ā g (V ā suki) and Takshaka are household words from Kashmir to the Narbada, and further south, and N ā ga-R ā jas ruled also the valley of the Indus to P ā tala, and the Him ā layan regions. Their power extended “ be neath the sea ” according to their legends, and N ā gas dwelt in Indra’s Svarga, or “ heaven.” The cobra kills 20,000 to 30,000 persons annually in India, yet few Hindus will willingly hurt a N ā ga. “ It is an emblem of renewed life, life out of death, or life everlastin g,” for it renews its skin. It is specially adored when haunting some sacred well or tank. Here the pious are baptised, and the lingam of Siva is placed close by. The N ā ga-Ishvar shrine at Banaras is also sacred to Mah ā -deva or Siva.

But there are also evil serpents, which swallow the waters, like Vr ī tra, against whom Indra made war. The 48 N ā gas, and N ā ga kings of India, are enumerated by Prof. Hoernle ( Indian Antiq ., December 1892), including many well- known names, such as that of Ananta, the serpent of Vishnu. Dr Oldbam ( Journal Rl. Asiatic Socy .,July 1901) describes modern N ā ga worship in the north. The N ā ga temples are presided over by Kshatriya chiefs, and not by Br ā hmans. These offer their own sacri fi ces, and the desi or local Br ā hmans are not of any recognised clan, and are only respected as aged men. The real medium of communication with the N ā ga deity is an inspired prophet, who may be of the lowest caste ; and the instructor of this inspired priest is the Chela (or “ disciple ”) usually of pure Kshatriya caste. He is not el ected, but “ called ” by God, being possessed by the divine spirit. He is a celibate who eats only food prepared by himself : he sleeps on the ground, and his feet are bare. He is always under the divine in fl uence, and must not be touched by any. No priest has any power over him, or over the temple property, rites, and festivals. A council of elde rs is guided by the divine will, as announced by the Chela prophet. He speaks for Indra, not of his own accord. He is not a magician, and he dresses like other villagers, but wears a red cap and no shoes. He receives such grain as he needs from the village store, and usually the head of any victim offered in sacri fi ce. He often undergoes severe penances, scourging himself—till the blood fl ows—with the iron s ū ngal or g ā j ā , closely resembling the whip with many lashes held by priests and gods in Egyptian pictures. He is the living representative of the ancient serpent worshiping priests and diviners of Western Asia. Nagar. A common Indian term for a town. N ā g-arjuna. A Buddhist teacher of importance, about 170 A . C ., who has been confused with the earlier N ā ga-s ē na (150 B . C .). He was the son of a rich Br ē hman of Vidarbha, and, according to the legend, the gods decreed he should only live 7 days, but this was extended to 7 years through the prayers of the parents and gifts bestowed on Br ā hmans and Bhikshus. He was sent to a solitary place, where a Buddha met him, and sent him to the monastery of K ā lendra. The abbot’s attention was attracted by his recitation of sacred g ā thas (hymns), and his history was made kn own. He was directed to recite without sleeping till the end of the fatal seven years, and his piety pleased Chandika (a godess), who bestowed food on all the Bhikshus in consequence ; she became frantically enamoured of N ā g-arjuna, and"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"N ā g-arjuna 6 urged him to leave the earth, but he preferred duty here to bliss in heaven. He built for her a lofty stone temple, in which he placed a thick wooden post (or lingam), which secured the affections of Chan- dika, who declared she would never leave him till it decayed and turned to dust. As a maiden of low degree she however enticed a Buddhist cook to burn this post, when she fl ed to heaven ; and Nag- arjuna was then reduced to beg of kings and peoples for the support of his monastery. He set out to dist ant countries to raise funds, in consequence of a famine, and was aided by two leaves of an enchanted tree, which guided him to a sage, who told him how to change base metals into gold. This enabled N ā g-arjuna to support the N ā lendra monks, by whom he was called Siddh i or “ perfect.” He made a huge image of Mah ā -k ā la (“ great death ”), which enchanted even the N ā gas or snake spirits. His teaching refuted that of Sankar- ā ch ā rya (see that heading), and the N ā gas besought him to dwell among them, whence he was named the Arjuna of N ā gas. But he remained at N ā lendra, and the N ā gas gave him rich gifts and a sacred book (the N ā ga-sahasrik ā ). One of the oldest of sacred caves in India is that of N ā g-arjuna, near R ā ja-griha, in Behar, called that of the “ Brahman ī milkmaids ” (see Krishna) ; it contains texts as old as 200 B . C ., and the legend of the miraculous food supply granted by Chandika the godess still attaches to it. Ot her caves, connected with N ā g-arjuna, contain Gauro-Sanskrit texts with salutations to Buddha, Mah ā -vira, King Ā s ō ka, and his brother. In one of these we fi nd Nirv ā na (or Nibutti) de fi ned (see Nirv ā na) as “ absorption of the soul in the Supreme being.” This dates only from the year 73 of the Samvat era, or in 17 of our 1st century ; another of these texts speaking of the dedication of images, to Siva and Dev ī , shows that the descendants of Chandragupta (namely Yajna and Ananta-varma) were not purely Buddhist rulers, though N ā g-arjuna is supposed to have been a Buddhist himself. He also compos ed works on astrology, medicine, and alchemy, and developed (on becoming an abbot) the M ā dhya-mika phiJosophy, which had been imperfectly taught by his predecessor, Sarah-Bhadra. He aided the “ lesse r vehicle ” school of Buddhism, and enforced discipline, expelling 8000 immoral monks. The centre of this school was at Buddha-gay ā , where he restored decayed monas- teries, and propped up the holy Bodhi tree with two pillars, making fi nally a great stone railing round small chapels, and erecting 7 huge statues of Buddha. The encroaching river was so forced to change its course.

He visited S. India, and as- tonished Brahmans by his knowledge of the sacred books. He induced King De-chye (or Sankara) and two wealthy chiefs (Madhu and Supra-Madhu) to be converts and supporters of Buddhism, and at a great age he was taken up to heaven. Tibetan accounts say that the great Ā ndhra king S ā ta-v ā hana, in S. India, built the monastery where he spent his last years : it is now a Hindu shrine of Malik- arjuna in the “ black mountain ” near the Krishna river. This was called (as recorded by Hiuen-Tsang and Fa-hien) the “ pigeon mountain,” connecting it with P ā rvati (probably Chandika) as the “ black pigeon ” (see P ā rvati); and the legend relates that Sankara’s son could only succeed his father by securing the head of N ā g-arjuna, who was on P ā rvati’s mountain. The saint consented that his head should be cut off, which others vain ly attempted, till he himself did it with a blade of Kusa grass. A Yaksha, or, spirit, then fl ung it a dis- tance of fi ve miles, and it was turned to stone with the rest of the body. It is believed that the severed head and the body are ever drawing nearer ; and when they reunite the saint will reappear and preach for 100 years. He is regard ed by Prof. Beal, and others, as the fi rst Buddha of S. India ( Indian Antiq ., June 1887), but his story is essentially at variance with original Buddhism. He was not only turned to stone, but is said to have set up stones to please the N ā gas. The legend is of value only as representing the popular beliefs of the age (166 to 200 A . C .). Prof. Beal gives us a famous lette r, supposed to be written by N ā g- arjuna to King Udayana of Shingtu, a friend of his youth, in S. India, which is full of pure Buddhist ethiks. This is said to be translated by I-tsing the Chinese pilgrim (700 A . C .), and supposed to have been written to convert King Jantaka—“ one well versed from his youth in other teachings than that of Buddha.” It was translated twice about 431 to 434 A . C . by the Sr ā man named Gunavarnam, and according to this account (some two centuries after his time) N ā g-arjuna in his “ friendly letter ” says that “ he relies only on the true law ” of Buddha, insisting on “ the three gems , charity, morality, and thoughts about the Devas” (or gods), which last nevertheless is not Buddha’s teaching. I-tsing adds : “ this is the thousand letter classic of China, and is learned by heart by children in India.” N ā ga-s ē na . A distinguished Buddhist monk in Afghanist ā n about 150 B . C .

The footprints of four Buddhas were shown at a stupa 200 feet high, and another of the same height, a mile to, the N. W., was then attributed to Ā s ō ka. In the Chinese work above mentioned the region is called Ta-tsin, a term applying to the Byzantine empire, but here meaning the Greek kingdom of Baktria.

The same memorial idea is found in the tying of rags to holy trees, common among Kelts and Syrians alike. They are stuck on poles, in cairns, wherever any important event, such as a murder, or the resting of an idol, occurred. The sacred wells (see Mar ī ), and lakes, are full of pins and nails, and Highlanders say it pleases the saint at Loch Maree to drive nails in to his oak tree. At Mechlenburg, to cure hernia, the patient on tw o successive Fridays must make the sign of the cross over the part affected, with nails; and, without saying a word, must then drive them into an oak ot beech tree hard by, the nails being driven in over their heads : the patient will recover when the bark of the tree grows over the nail-heads ( Folk-Lore Journal , Dec. 1893). Nairs. A tribe of S. India, remarkable as being polyandrous like some in the Him ā layas. The woman has several recognised husbands, and property descends to a sister’s children. No one enters a Nair woman’s house if a man’s shoes are at the door. In like manner (see R.

He was born 20 miles N.E. of Lucknow in 1780 A . C . ; his real name was Sahaja-Nanda ; and he settled at Junagarh in Katiawar about 1800. With his teacher R ā ma-nanda he established himself at Ah ̣ mad-ab ā d about 1804, and became celebrated fo r his power of fascination, which entranced converts who compared him to Vishnu, and to his consort Lakshmi (Sir Monier Williams, Journal Rt.

Br ā hman jealousy of his populari ty led to his being thrown into prison, but the people sang his praises, cursed his enemies, and fi nally rose in arms and compelle d his release. Monasteries were established where those who be lieved in him retired to learn the pure doctrine, and to imitate his ascetik life. Bishop Heber saw, and argued with him, and found him surrounded by multi- tudes of enthusiastic followers who “ would willingly have shed"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Natagi 12 their blood rather than suffer a fringe of his garment to be touched roughly.” He settled in the secluded village of Wartal, and built a temple to Krishna and Lakshmi. He then strove to purify the licentious V ā llabh ā ch ā rya system, and at last died of fever on 28th October 1829. He was greatly beloved, and dei fi ed after death. His shoes, clothes, bed, and footprints , are held 'as holy as those of Buddha, or of Muh ̣ ammad; but the sect only number about 25,000 persons, including 1000 Br ā hma-hari ascetiks and 500 subordinate P ā las. They are faithful to his teac hing of devotion to Krishna, with observance of religious rites, and of chastity, but have not been success- ful as missionaries to the Hindus, being more concerned with legends of Krishna than with the teaching of things spiritual. The Siksha- patri, or text-book of the sect, was given to Sir Monier Williams in 1875 by the chief Gosain, and was translated by him. It speaks of Krishna not as the supreme (see Kr ishna) but as alone able to under- stand the Impenetrable and Almighty Spirit, whom men fear ; and thus as a mediator like Christ or th e Virgin. The believer is to regard his prophet, and Siva alike, as forms of Br ā hma (Sect. 49), and N ā r ā yana-Svami is Vishnu incarnate : but Vishnu, Siva, Ganesa, P ā rvati, and the sun, are also to be adored (Sect. 84). Krishna is the energy of M ā y ā (“ matter ”) and : “ He who abides in the living personal soul, as the internal monito r dwells in the heart, is to be con- sidered as the self-existent Supreme Being, the rewarder of all actions ” (Sect. 106). “ That being (Sect. 108) is Krishna, the supreme creator, god, and soul of being, the cause of all manifestations, and therefore to be adored as our one chosen de ity ” (see Henotheism). To worship him is to be absorbed in him (Sec t. 121), as we read also in the Bhagav ā d-G ī ta. N ā r ā yana-Svami recommends study of the Bh ā gav ā ta- Purana : the commentary of R ā m ā nuj ā ch ā rya on the G ī ta ; and the Saris-aka Sutras of Vyasa. He sa ys that “ Religious usages, business arrangements, and penances, should be adapted to the country, time, age, property, rank, and ability ” of those concerned. Natagai.

Inhabitants of New Mexico who preserve quaint rites connected with serpents , arrows, sacred sticks, and crosses, adoring gods of wind, rain, and lightning (Miss Buckland, Journal Anthrop.

Nazareth is not noticed in the Old Testament, and was an obscure village in the hills of Lower Galilee. It became famous after 326 A . C ., as described by Eu sebius and Jerome ( Onomastikon ). The old site of the Annunciation is in the Greek Church at the spring head. Joseph ’s house is represented by a cave —apparently an ancient cistern.

Nebo (Nabu), was the name also of a Babylonian god, “ the herald ” or “ proclaimer.” His emblem was the lamp, and he was the messenger of heaven, and a recordin g angel. In Akkadian he is called Ak “ the wise ” (see Ak), and he was also the god of the planet Mercury—a deity who was also messe nger of Zeus. His shrine at Borsippa, outside Babylon, was rebuilt in 600 B . C . by King Nabu- kudur-us ̣ ur (Nebuchadnezzar II), and he is said to have been still worshiped here in our 4th century.

A term applied by geologists and antiquaries to the period of the “ new stone ” condition in Europe, when weapons of polished stone were used, and metal was as yet unknown. This continued as late as 1500 or 1000 B . C ., before bronze had been in- troduced by Asiatic traders from Phœnicia, Asia Minor, and Greece. Some geologists suppose the Neolit hik races to have superseded the Palaiolithik (“ old stone ”) people, who used unpolished stones as early as 18,000 years ago (Dr Isaac Taylor, Contempy. Review , August 1890). The Neolithik tribes were sa vages, but not cannibals ; they had bows and arrows, and hunted the stag, horse, and boar. They ate nuts and wild fruits, but in the later age had cereals, and domesticated sheep, goats, cattle and dogs. They lived in the valleys, or in pile dwellings on marshes, or in pits th atched over; and buried the dead in barrows. Their clothing was of hides stitched together, and they adorned themselves with shells and red iron ores. They had bone needles and rude pottery. They were even able to draw designs on bones, at a time when the mammo th was not yet extinct, and the reindeer still used in W. Europe.

Viking Society , 15th March 1895). In Italy, about 1500 or 2000 B . C ., they appear to have begun to use bronze, but knew no ot her metal, and had no glass. They were then pastoral, and even rudely agricultural. The “ stone folk ” of the Belary districts in S. and Central India were in this stage.of culture (like some of the S. Sea Islanders), as described by Mr F. Fawcett ( Ninth Oriental Congress , September 1891). Their rude carvings are called “ the work of God ” by the natives, and represent naked fi gures hewn out on vertical rocks. They knew the dog, fox, tiger, leopard, and elephant, but no horses are represented. Nephesh. Hebrew : “ self,” “ soul.” [Assyrian napistu ; Arabic nefes “ self.”—E D .] The word often means “ breath,” and even a corpse (Levit. xix, 28 ; xxi, 1 ; Haggai ii, 13). Man became a “ living individual ” (Gen. i, 20, 30; ii, 7) like any other animal, the life being regarded as being in the blood (Gen. ix, 4). For all animals have “ one breath ” (Eccles. iii, 19), and the Nephesh hungers (Prov. xxvii, 7 ; Isaiah xxix, 8), and “ hath appetite.” [The radical mean- ing of the word is “ to swell ” or “ expand ” (see Spirits).—E D .] The “ soul that sinneth it shall die ” (Ezek. xviii, 20) evidently means the “ person ” ; and the Nephesh is the “ life of the fl esh ” (Levit. xvii, 11). The K ̣ abbala connects it with the phallus in the symbolic fi gure of the Adam K ̣ admon (see K ̣ abbala), and calls it “ the foundation.” A monumental stone over a grave was called a Nephesh, being a phallic emblem of life (see Academy , 3d March 1883). Yahveh even swears by his Nephesh or “ self.” The idea of “ soul ” is thus not really con- nected with the word. Dr Robertson Smith says, in con fi rmation of Buxtorf, that the Arabic Nefes “ simply meant a stele (monumental stone), and it so appears at Petra, and on H ̣ imyaritic inscriptions.” [The word in common speech means “ self ” in Arabic, and so does napistu in Assyrian.—E D .] Nephel ē .

Nestorius was the Patriarch of Constantinople (428-431 A . C .), and was opposed to the teaching of the Catholic party who condemned him at the Council of Ephesus in 431 A . C . He held ancient beliefs common among the Oriental Churches, and regarded Jesus as a human being who was inspired (or po ssessed) by the Divine Christ or Logos—the holy spirit—at his baptism. Hence he opposed the growing superstitious worship of Mary, already called the Theo-tokos or “ God bearer ”—the Mother of God—saying that she was but a woman, “ and it is impossible that God should be born of a woman.” He was, however, unable to overcome the dominant opinions, though he urged the emperor to “ purge the earth of heretics,” adding, “ Heaven will be your reward, and I will aid you to conquer Persia.” Nestorius was driven from Constantinople, and retired to the monastery of St Euprepios. He was persecuted and exiled, and died about 454 A . C . The sect was celebrated for its learning, and as they sepa- rated from the Catholics after 431 A . C ., they never used the images and pictures which Western Christians soon after began to place in their churches. Their colleges at Edessa were suppressed by the Emperor Zeno, in 489 A . C ., but by the 7th century they had esta- blished their own form of Christianity, their Aramaik alphabet and literature, throughout Babylonia and Persia. Dr Isaac Taylor tells us that : “ The Nestorian alphabet became the parent of a whole family of alphabets from the Volga to the Paci fi c, of which Kalmuk, Mongolian, and Manchu survive ” ( Notes and Queries , 10th June 1900). The Turkish Uigurs used it early ; for Merv was the seat of a Nestorian archbishop at least as early as 500 A . C ., and Christians had reached the Oxus (according to Cosmos) half a century later. Rubruquis (see Mongols) found Mongolia full of Nestorian priests whom he despised—for he was a Franciscan monk. Kublai Khan, immediately after the time of his visi t, is said to have had a Nestorian wife ; and, in the 12th century, Ung Kh ā n (Prester John) had belonged himself apparently to this sect. The Nestorians have left a valuable record of their presence in China, outside the W. gate of Singan fu, in the province of Shensi. It is a grey stone nearly 9 feet hi gh, 3 feet broad, and a foot thick, placed on the back of a stone tortoise now nearly buried, in front of a Buddhist temple (see Notes and Queries , 13th August 1892).

The legend still survives, and the Leilat en-Nuk ̣ tah (“ night of the drop ”) is that in which a mysterious drop of water falls into the Nile, and causes its fl ood (Renouf, Proc. Bib. Arch. Socy ., Novr. 1890). Ptah-hapi (“ the creating bull ”) is a corpulent red de ity, but Hapi has also a woman’s breast, and is blue-colored—as Nila means. Hence the Nile is called Shi h ̣ or or “ dark ” in Hebrew (Isaiah xxiii, 3), as well as Iyor “ the river ”—a term used also in Egyptian. Nimbus. A “ cloud ” or halo, often surrounding the whole body (as in the Vesica Piscis), but usually the head only. Persian and Greek sun gods have a rayed glory round the head.

Nimi. Sanskrit : “ twinkling,” of the eye. A King Nimi was one of the three sons of lkshvaku, who asked his preceptor Vasishta to offer a sacri fi ce ; but the latter refused, and the sacri fi ce was offered by others for 500 years, till Vasishta cursed Nimi, who disappeared from earth but appears still in the eye. He is especially connected with the godesses Bhav ā ni and Uma. Nimrod. A Hebrew hero (Gen. x, 8-11) who was a great hunter. His kingdom corresponds to that of the historic Akkadian kings of Babylonia. He is called a “ son of Kush ” (see Kus). He is famous in Talmudic legends, and among Arabs, who call him Nimr ū d or Nimrus ̣ , but he is unnoticed in any known kuneiform inscription as yet. Perhaps the best explanation of the name is that of Prof. Hilprecht, who connects it with the Kassite Murutas (see that heading) : the Semitic derivation from Marad “ to rebel ” being evidently of late origin. [ Nim or Nu is “ chief ” in Akkadian, and Nu-muru-tas or Nim-uru-tas , would mean the “ chief solar hero.”—E D .] The Talmudic legends make him a fi re worshiper (see Abraham), who cast the servant of Yahveh into a furnace which was so fi erce that 2000 Chaldeans were slain by approaching it. Abraham was shot into it from a catapult, but it became a meadow in which he walked unhurt, as Zoroaster also was uninjured by the fl ames of Ahriman. Nimrod’s people built the tower of Babel, but were turned into demons, and their star-gazers into apes. They shot arrows into heaven which fell back covered with blood (see Tabari, quoted in Jewish World , 20th May 1887). Nimrod then tried to reach heaven, in a box borne by four eagles, but fell to earth (see Etana), and a gnat entered his nostril and reached the brain, so that he died after beating his head for 400 years. Nin. Akkadian : “ lord ” or “ lady ” (the language not distinguish- ing gender) : a title from which many names are formed including the Greek Ninos, founder of Nineveh. T hus Ea is called Nin-Dara (“ lord of the deer ”) from his emblem, and Nin-ib is the “ creating lord ” (B’el or Adar), while Nin-id-gal is the “ lord of the strong hand,” and Nin-ki-gal is “ lady of the land of death.” Nineveh. Akkadian : Nin-ua or “ chief’s abode.” The famous Assyrian capital on the Tigris. [It is now known to be mentioned not only in the Amarna letters about 1480 B .

The Romans partly rebuilt it, but the Sassanians of Persia again destroye d it, and a new city arose in the Middle Ages at Mosul hard by. The ancient capital stretched 2½ miles along the Tigris, and measured a mile in breadth. The river has now receded from the S.W. wall. The citadel of Kuyunjik is near the centre : the mound of Nebi Yunas (“ prophet Jonah ”), as called by the Moslems, who erected a shrine in connection with Jonah’s visit to Nineveh, is on the south. The mo st important discoveries at Nineveh belong to the time of Assm:-bani-pal (668-625 B . C .) see Assyria. Ninian. St Ninian, or Ringan, is said to have been the fi rst Chris- tian missionary to Scotland ; settling at Rosnat, near Whithorn in Wigton Bay. His cave or hermitage was at Glasserton whence, according to Bede, he sallied forth to preach in all towns S. of the Grampians. The Irish say that he was called Mynin (or Monenn), and founded a church (Kluain Konaire) in Leinster. “ He converted Galloway about 430 ” A . C ., but the people reverted to paganism (see Mungo). Ninian is said to have been a Briton educated at Rome ; and he prepared missionaries at Rosnat for the conversion of Ireland, including Colum- kill (see Columba), and Finian of Movilla. Whit-horn is the Latin “ Candida Casa ” or “ white-house,” but he is said to have died at Kluain Konaire in Kildare county. These tr aditions point to the introduction of Christianity from Scotland into Ireland in the 6th century A . C . Niörd. The third greatest As or god of Skandinavians, born in Vanaheim (“ the water home ”), and living among sailors in Noatun (“ ship town ”), ruling the winds, and sea, and quenching the fi res of day in his waves. To the Vanir, or “ sea folk,” he was the “ rich and bene fi cent one,” and his children were Frey and Freya. Skadi “ the scathing one,” daughter of Thiassi the giant god of land, took Niörd as a husband because of his feet, but land and water did not long agree. His consort is also Nert hus, or Iörd—the earth godess of Rugen (Mr Karl Blind, Contemporary Review, Oct. 1881), but when Niörd joined the Æsar or gods Skadi spoke of Freya as “ our child.” Nipon. See Japan. Nipur. Nippur. A city S.S.E. of Babylon, now called Nuffer . According to Rabbinical accounts it is the Calneh or Calno of the Bible (Gen. x, 10 ; Isaiah x, 9) : in Akkadian texts it is called “ The city of En-lil ” or Ba’al.

The great Ziggurat, or stepped pyramid, was called Nu-khar-sag in Akkadian, or “ the lofty mountain top,” and on it was a small brick sh rine such as He rodotos describes on the pyramid of Babylon. The excavations reached a depth of 37 feet before the pavement with bricks giving the name of Naram- Sin was reached, and the foundations laid by Urbau and the early Akkadian kings were 35 feet lower still. The monuments belong to various ages, from the earliest down to the time of the later Kassites (11th century B . C .) and of Esarhaddon of Assyria, Nabopolassar, Nebuchadnezzar (600 B . C .), and the later Persians Darius II and Artaxerxes. Jewish magic bowls of our 5th century were also found, and arched structures probably of late date. The kuneiform tablets of the Assyrian and Persian age are very numerous, and various in character, being both religious and commercial. The pyramid was built by Urbau, father of Dungi, whom the Babylonians of the 6th century B . C . believed to have reigned about 2800 B . C . Among the older texts is one giving a list of temple property, including 92 vest- ments, 12 white robes for the god or for priests, 8 robes for the godess, and 10 collars of pure gold, 2 white robes and 4 scented robes—as the text is understood. [The excavations are of fi cially described by Prof. Hilprecht (see Memoirs , I, ii, p. 8). In 1888-1889 the explorers obtained 2000 tablets, and 25 Hebrew bowls ; in the next year 8000 tablets mostly of early date, 75 Hebrew bowls, an d 100 votive axes of the Kassite age (the third dynasty of Babylon) ; while in 1893-1896 no less than 21,000 tablets were found, ranging from the time of Dungi, king of Ur, down to that of Darius II. These discoveries were among the most important, including 500 ancient vases, and 1513 brick stamps. The conclusions as to the date of the earliest remains are however doubtful within at least a thousand years. The oldest building seems to be that of Urbau, whom the later Babylonians placed about 2800 B . C . Among the brick stamps are two in Semitic speech; one reading “ Sargani, king of the city, King of Agade, built the house of Bel ” (No. 3) ; the other (No. 4) “ The god Naram-Sin built the house of Bel.” The characters used are less archaic than those of Urbau ; and the platform in which the inscriptions of Naram-Sin occur is apparently less early than Urbau’s pyramid. Dr Oppert considers the Sargani texts to be not older than 2000 or 1500 B . C ., by which time Sargina, and Naram-Sin, were dei fi ed.

An ancient lintel stone in the ruins bears a very rude and early Akkadian text, of a king whose name is doubtful, and also a later Semitic te xt in honour of Sargani. We know that Babylonian and Assyrian builders used to lay bare the ancient foundations of temples, an d then added new texts to those that they found. This appears to be the true explanation of the puzzle at Nipur. On another door-socket of diorite, inscribed in the later Semitic writing and character, we read (No. 2) : “ The god Sargani, king of the city, the son be gotten by B’el, the just, the king of Agad ē , and of the children of B’el, built the mountain of the house ; the temple of B’el of Nipur he caused to be built. Whoso injures me, let both B’el and Sham ash destroy his foundation and ruin his family.” There is no proof that fragments found below these remains must be as old as 4000 B .

Akkadian : “ creating lord,” a god of harvest. Nirv ā na. Sanskrit. Pali Nibban . A condition of perfect rest, as understood among Buddhists, though the translation is much disputed in the West, and differently de fi ned even in the East (see N ā g-arjuna). In intimate conversa tion with Buddhists we never found them to regard it as meaning a “ blowing out ” or extinction ; though, in our 2nd century, some explained it as meaning absorption into deity. It appears rather to mean “ a going forth ” (as we speak of the “ departed ”). When Buddha was questioned as to the future he used to say : “ I set out from the forest—the misery and turmoil of life—and seek peace.” Nirvana was a term used by Br ā hmans in his time, and it was then a pious custom, after the duties of active life had been ful fi lled, and the family provided for, to retire in old age to a forest, for contemplation and prep aration for death (see Buddha). In the Hitopadesa (see that heading) Hi ndus are told to seek the Tapo- vana (“ forest grove ”) for such preparation (see Benfey’s Dicty ., pp. 481, 812, 835). In the Mah ā -bh ā rata Nirv ā na simply means death. Buddhist monks refuse to af fi rm or deny anything as to the"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Nirv ā na 25 future, urging us not to trouble ourselves about the unknown or inexplicable. Prof. Rhys Davids says that they do not admit Nibbana (in P ā li) to be the Sanskrit Nirvana, saying that Gotama prohibited his teaching being rendered into Sa nskrit. To some it conveys the idea of absorption into deity, which is not the same idea as extinction, in their belief (see the Fourth Arupa Vinaka, and the Mah ā -bodhi Journal , May 1903, p. 9). Burnouf seems to have originated the misconception that there were three kinds of Nibbana (namely Nibbana proper, Para-Nibbana, and Mah ā -para-Nibbana). These terms apply to the state of an Arahat, or Buddha, who attains perfect peace before and after death. Nibbana is perfect rest for all, and many P ā li texts deny that it means annihilation. For we must rid our minds of the idea that these thinkers held the views that centre round our conception of an immortal soul. Buddha said, “ Who so puts aside all worldly and carnal desires grows in wisdom ; and he attains here on earth the Peace (Nibbana), the deliverance from death : and an eternal state ” (see Oldenberg, Sutta- Sangaha , p. 264). But in the nature of things the good Buddhist is forced to say that : “ Nibbana is cessation—the end of all ; the annihilation of the fatal threefold fi re of Passion, Wrath, and Ignorance : the annihilation of all that has bound us : the cessation of the Delusion of life, which has veiled from us the glory of the light beyond.” The idea conveyed varied, among various nations in different ages, and some even rendered it immortality, or pleasure and everlasting joy, here and hereafter. Others understood rest from trouble, emancipation, and enduring peace. Some said that the good entered Svarga (heaven), but the perfect one was extinguished. The school of Naga-sena, dis- cussing “ being ” and “ not being,” created a mysticism according to which Nibbana was annihilation, and Adi-Buddha a deity in heaven. But some remembered that Gotama said that “ being ” and “ not being ” could not be understood by any. Naga-sena is reported to have said to King Menander : “ Nirvana does not exis t till it is received. . . . The Buddha exists, yet we cannot say he is here or there, just as we cannot say this of fi re when it is extinguished. The Buddha has attained extinction, yet he lives in the teaching of his life.” This, however, is a late doct rine, found also in Nap ā l (see Prof. Max Müller, Chips , i, p. 283). Nirv ā na, in our earthly state, is the condition in which the fl esh no longer strives against the spirit, and the spirit attains to a joy unknown to the world. It is as vain to attempt to follow all the ideas of Buddhists about Nibbana, as it would be to attempt to sum up in one word all the ideas of Christian thinkers about the future.

C .,” according to Dr Rhys Davids, Buddha is made to say that if men’s hearts “ be calmed and satis fi ed they will be reborn after death, when the body is dissolved, in the happy realms of heaven.” It is therefore, as Prof. Beal says, “ easier said than proved that Buddha preached atheism, annihilation, and the non-existence of the soul ” : though Dr Rhys Davids ( Romantic History , pp. x, 99) says that Gotama taught de fi nitely that man has no soul to exist after death. In the P ā li Suttas he teaches (see Journal Rl. Asiatic Socy ., Oct. 1883, p. 43), that to af fi rm or to deny anything as to the future state is “ founded on ignorance . . . under the in fl uence of our passions.” The belief in a great spirit, and a future, existed when Ā s ō ka’s edicts were inscribed, but does not belong to pure Buddhism. The ignorant Buddhists of Japan believe in the soul and in heaven (Hearn, Gleanings in Buddha Fields , 1897) like others, but Gotama was unconcerned with such speculations.

One of the six systems of Indian philosophy (see Darsanas), attributed to a Gotama of the age of R ā ma. It is “ logic,” seeking the truth by analysis and sy llogism, being free from the Vedanta mysticism. The word means “ that whereby we go with certainty.” The modern schools, like that of Gangesa Up ā dhy ā ya (of Mithila in N.E. Beh ā r), in our 14th century, adhere to the original Ny ā ya Sutras, and are found chie fl y at Nadiya in Central Bangal. They (like Aristotle) lay stress on the exact de fi nition of terms (see Mr Ny ā yaratna’s paper to the Oriental Congress of 1891). These philo- sophers thus distinguish the Manas or “ mind ” from the Atman “ self ” or “ soul.” The Manas, they teach, is not an intellectual faculty, but a substance—a tiny atom, through which alone can knowledge reach the Atman, which is an “ immaterial thinking principle,” acted on by the bodily activities—speech, gesture, taste, etc., which it is wise to restrain ; for from these come desi res and pains, affection, hatred, envy, and pride. The soul thus receives pain or pleasure, knowledge imperfect or correct. It is not howe ver an immortal individuality, as with us. Such speculation Gotama Buddha, after having considered the system with others, regarded as vain ; but he thought that emancipation from rebirth was the aim to be followed ; and, to the Ny ā ya philosopher, Moksha or “ emancipation ” is also the fi nal goal.

This tree is the symbol of gods in Asia and Europe (see Eloh ī m); and Europe still celebrates “ oak day,” or “ oak-apple day,” on 29th May. The Quercus Æsculus (“ food oak ”), and the Quercus Robur , or Ilex —the ever-green oak—were the trees of Zeus. The oak is monarch of the woods; and the Kosmogonic Oak represented the Creator. The rustling of the oak-leaves at D ō d ō na gave oracles, as did that of the sacred oak of Pramest ē (see Fors). Arkadians, and Italians, claimed descent from oaks, and regarded bees among the oak boughs as spirits of ancestors. Th ose who desired to pray, or to make vows, whether kings or subjects, pr iests or slaves, sought Jupiter Fœderis (the lord of vows) under “ an ancient oak.” The oak grove was a shrine not made by man ; and even to-day Te Deums are chanted under holy oaks in Russia, and elsewhere, while disease is cured by passing the sick through hollow oaks, or oaken hoops, or by the touching of an oak. The Druids sought a magic drink in oak groves (see Mistletoe). The oak le af decked Jove’s altars, crowned heroes, and adorned gates, columns, buildings, and statues of victory, in Imperial Rome. The civic crown of oak leaves was the most prized of rewards to the Roman. The oak of Abraham (see H ̣ ebron), and other oaks ( Quercus Ægilops , and Quercus Pseudo-coccifera , the gall oak) are still holy trees in Syria. The Ilex, or ever-green oak, became a funereal tree, as symbolising immo rtality, like the cypress, yew, and some fi rs ; and as a tree used for fi rewood it was sacred to fi re gods, to Lucid us, and to Pan—the latter being a son of Dryop ē —the “ oak spirit ” ; while the Dryads were female oak nymphs. Prom ē theus, the Greek fi re god, was also connected with oaks. The oak was feared as attracting lightning, and connected with the fi ckle moon or Hekat ē . Pliny says that a sacred oak on the Vatican hill was covered with Etruskan inscriptions. Christian legends make the Ilex oak the tree of death ; all other trees that the Jews tried to use for making the cross of Christ split. The Ilex was therefore only used for fi rewood. The acorns (on which early Aryans fed) were used in garlands, and Romulus is said fi rst to have crowned heroes with leaves of the holm oak.

Oaths. Vows. Solemn promises made in presence of the gods (see Mamitu), especially before stone emblems (“ swearing stones ”), those concerned joining hands through a hole in the stone, or laying a hand on it. Hindus kneeling before snch emblems touch their limbs and organs, devoting them to destruction should they fail of their oaths. Others will do this anywhere ; and we have seen merchants in their shops con fi rm a promise by placing their hands under their thighs (see Gen. xxiv, 2, 9). Rings, and holes in altars, are used for swearing, as among Romans (see Rivers of Life , i, p. 369, fi g. 172) ; all pledges of ful fi lment fell to the priest or shrine if a vow was broken, and the offender might be made a slave till he performed his promise. Grimm says that in Germany many of the old “ stones of testimony,” or fragments of them (more sacred even than the whole stone), were built into church altars, and are now reverently touched by Christians. An ancient MS. of the Gospel (as among the Irish); a line of the K ̣ or ā n ; or a sloka (verse), of the Veda, is equally a fetish, and a dreaded object on which to swear, with a holy stone, or fragment of a lingam.

In all countries also vows are consecrated with the hand raised aloft, as by Median priests ( Rivers of Life , ii, p. 139, fi g. 222), or by Abraham (Gen. xiv, 22). Persians still swear by the king’s head, like Hebrews ; and others by their children’s heads. The Moslem swears by his beard, and by his family, or by “ the life of God.” Warriors swear by their weapons like Highland chiefs ; or the Indian noble of to-day by his sword. The old Norseman, according to the Edda, swore :— “ By board of ship, by rim of shield, By shoulder of steel, by edge of sword.\" In all cases the man swearing imprecates evil on himself and his children if he fails of his oath. Thus also Christians swore by relics, and feared punishment by the saints if they failed. The devout Hindu swears by the Ganges, as the Roman swore by the Tiber. The wife swears by her husband and sons ; the Brahman by his sacred cord, and cow ; the hermit by his tree ; the accountant by his books ; each and all by what is most dear and precious to them. Oaths are con fi rmed everywhere by blood, either by that of sacri fi ces smeared on the man who vows, or by his own (see Dr Trumbull, Blood Covenants , 1887). These rites are often shocking ones among barbarous tribes, and still survive even in Europe, and among Arabs. Men open a vein in the arm and suck the blood ; or they suck each other’s blood when swearing to be faithful “ brothers of blood ” to each other till death, as Sir S. Baker engaged himself to Rionga the African chief ( Times , 9th December 1873). Sir H. M. Stanley went through the same rite, each of the participants placing blood from his arm on the tongue of the other ; but he says “ there is nothing divine in the rite, but a beastly cannibalistic ceremony, by people delighting still in blood drinking : for the. aborigine sucked with the greatest gusto, believing in the ef fi cacy of blood as a pro- pitiatory power ” ; as imparting to him the qualities of a white man (see Eucharist).

Abraham “ cut a cove nant ” with his God (Gen. xv, 10) by dividing the sacri fi ces, according to the old custom of “ pass- ing between ” the parts of a calf, or other victim. Homer speaks of “ dividing the covenant ” : Herodo tos relates how Xerxes cut the eldest son of Puthias in two, marching his army between the two halves. The idea perhaps still survives in the broken coin which rati fi es a lover’s vow, he and his love keeping the two halves till they unite them again. Ō b. A widely used term for a spell, or a spirit. [In Hebrew Ō b or Ā ub means only a “ bottle ” ; and the terms Ba’al- ō b “ master of the ō b ,” and Ba’alath- ō b “ mistress of the ō b ,” puzzled the Greek trans- lators, who regard the word as meaning a “ ventriloquial demon ” speaking from the stomach of the wizard, or witch—whence the English “ familiar spirit.” It is, however, probably the Akkadian word ubi (Turkish boi ) for “ spell,” which became the Assyrian abutu (Hebrew ō both ) for “ spells,” “charms,” and “ binding.” This class of wizards therefore included “ the master of a spell,” and the “ mistress of a spell.”—E D .] Throughout Africa ob or aub is a common term for the “ spell compeller,” and for the snake used by wizards and conjurers. In India he is an “ Oub-w ā la ” ; and in the W. Indies the “ Obeah man ” mutters spells called obi (see Deane, Serpent Worship , p. 95 ; Edwards, Hist. Brit. W. Indies ; Folk-Lore Journal , June 1893). The Obeah wizards and witch women are crafty and merciless, and speak of Obi as occult powers. Those who have a wall eye, or who are crooked, or palsied in their limbs, are feared as witches used to be ; but others are of tall stature and fi ne physique, and make themselves terrible by paint, feathers, blood-stain ed robes, rags, shells, and charms, having long and fi lthy hair and smelling of assafœtida. They work in darkness, and carry eggs and shells, birds’ beaks, dogs’ teeth, or those of alligators, bits of horn, corks stuck fulJ of pins, earth from graves, and rag-bags full of dread charms which, if placed on roads or near doors, cause the timid inhabitants to fl ee terror-stricken ; safety can only be secured by employing a superior Obi, failing which misery and even death ensue : sleep, appetite, and cheerfulness, desert the victim who desponds and. sinks into the grave.

The Hebrews and Canaanites had many kinds of wizards, besides the “masters of the Ō b ” and the “ knowing ones,” including “ serpent users ” (Mankhash ī m) and necromancers (Isaiah viii, 19; xxix, 4) ; and this continued to be usual even in the 7th century B .

In Mongolia obo came to signify a cairn, or as the Abbé Huc calls it, “ a pyramid of peace ” (see Rivers of Life , i, p. 333; ii, p. 93) : spears and poles were stuck in, and around the Obo stone heap, among a people professing Buddhism, wi th bells, and streamers inscribed with prayers, to call the attention of the gods, like the ex votos on sacred trees, and cairns, in all parts of the world. Even the ancient Welsh knew the word obha as referring to some ancient religious emblem. Obeliskos. Obelisk. The Greek term for a monumental stone in Egypt. [Probably from a root ub “ up,” meaning something high.—E D .] The Egyptians called it Takhan. It was a development of the primitive erect stone (Hebrew Mas ̣ s ̣ ebah ; Keltik Men-hir) ; and its apex (Egyptian Ban-ban) was surmounted by a fl ame, or a bird, of phallic meaning (see Lingam). Plin y connects the idea of the phallus with the sun’s ray ( Hist. Nat ., xxxvi, 14); and obelisks are as old as the 5th dynasty (see Rivers of Life , ii, p. 305, fi g. 261) : they usually stood on truncated pyramids ( Academy , 2nd Feb. 1878), resembling Indian L ā ts ( Rivers of Life , i, p. 489, fi g. 186). Similar monuments occur in many countries such as Irelan d, Syria, Asia Minor, and India. Sir E. Wilson speaks of obelisks in the Fayoum oasis, sacred to Ptah, the phallic creator ; and they occur at Thebes, with tombs of the 11 th dynasty ; and in front of the temple at Deir el Baheiri which is sacred to Hat-hor (Athor) the “ abode of Horns.” Thothmes III (after 1600 B .

Wodin. The sky god of Teutons and Skandinavians. [The meaning of the word is doub tful: perhaps the best suggestion connects it with “ woad,” or “ dark blue.”—E D .] He has been con- nected, as a storm god, with the Sanskrit Vadha “ the slayer ” ; or again with Ud or Wud “ wet,” as the rain god. His cultus was not even nominally overthrown till about our 12th century. His conquest of the Van a, or water, gods is only for a time annually ; and hostages must be given to them. For the heaven gods arise out of chaos ; and Odin, at the well of Mimir (“ memory ”), gives his eye as a pledge to obtain wisdom ; but the Æsar (“ sprites ”) were not eternal, and an early poem says :— “ Once was the age when Yimir lived There was no sand, no sea, no salty wave; No earth then was, nor heaven above, Only a yawning abyss, and growth no where.” Odin is also called the\" one-eyed\" (his eye being the sun in the sky) : he is the husband of his sister the earth (see Frey), denounced as such by Loki (Dr Hahn, “ Teutonic Pantheon,” see Academy , 10th September 1887). To him we ow e the name of Woden’s day (Wednesday), which the Romans co nsecrated to Mercury. The West- phalians identi fi ed him with the “ Wild Huntsman,” and the Icelanders connected him with Mt Hecla, with its clouds of smoke. He was seen in towering clouds, riding a gr ey horse, and pursuing the “ wind- bride.” He wore a cloak of cloud and a grey hat. He rode on Sleipner the eight-footed white steed ; and souls who went to Odin went to heaven. He was the son of Bor “ the produced,” son of Buri the “ producer,” or otherwise the “ perfect man ” who sprang from the salt stones that Audhumla, the earth cow, licked. His mother was Bestla (or Belsta), “ desire,” daug hter of the giant BoIthorn. His brothers were ViIi and Ve, with whom his wife Freya consorted during his long absence.

Two ravens sat on his shoulders and told him all things. Lidskial, radiant with bright weapons, was the centre of his palace of Valhalla or Gladsheim. He never eats, but lives on mead (ambro sia .or Soma) served to him by his son Hermod. His eldest son, by Fiorgvin (the earth) is Thor, the god of thunder and rain ; and his second son is the beautiful Baldur, by Frigga, queen of heaven (see these names). He had other children— solar or nature powers—called Meile, Nep (father of Nanna), and Hildolf. Loki ( fi re) was his foster brother and his foe. Odin says that he hung thrice on the holy tree of Upsala, on which human sacri fi ces were hung. “ I know that I hung on a wind rocked tree Nine whole nights with a spear wounded, And (I) Odin offered myself to myself.” (See Sir G. Cox, Aryan Mythol ., i, p. 371; Karl Blind, Nineteenth 'Century , June 1879 ; Conway, Demonology , i, p. 57). This tree is the Yggdrasil or world tree, and “ Odin dropped from the tree as fruit from a twig ” (see Pur ū sha). He is also the “ giver of our wishes, and the All Good ” called Oski, and Wunsch (“ wish ”), or personi fi ed desire : for his power is in the Os ka-stein, or “ wishing stone,” which Grimm connects with the (phallic) “ wishing-rod ” of Hermes, and with the Osk-Meyjar or “ wishing maidens,” whose symbols are three nuts cast into the fi re. Mantled in cloud, he carries the magic spear Gun- guir. His throne is fl anked by wolves ; and his two ravens are called Hugin and Munr, which Grimm renders “ thought ” and “ mind.” His daughter is S ā ga (“ saying,” “ speech,” or the Logos), who is the godess of poetry, and the inspirer of all bards.

Dr Isaac Taylor ( Alphabet , ii, p. 225) considers that the strokes are numer als, denoting the corresponding letter of the Runic alphabet, wh ich—in Skandinavia—was derived from the Greek alphabet 'of the trader s of Olbia, perhaps as early as the 6th century B .

He was exposed when born, but grew up not knowing his parentage, and slew his father, marrying his own mother Iokast ē (or Epikast ē “ the very chaste ”). When the fact was discovered she hanged herself, and he blinded himself, and though king of Thebes, was tormented by the Erinues or “ furies.” He saved his country as a youth fr om the sphinx, whose riddle about the three ages of man he solved.

A Christian saint among Skandinavians, super- seding Thor, and Odin, and in character like the English St George. He was a warrior who trampled on trolls and dragons, scaring them with wind and thunder. Hence he is connected with bells (see Report of Viking Socy ., Jan. 1895). He is red-bearded like Thor, and fell from the church spire, or from heaven, when his wife called him. The mingling of Christian and pagan belief is common—as when the Rev. Baring Gould found Odin, Thor, and Loki still noticed (in 1858) on charms in Lincolnshire . The Virgin is also connected with Freya, and St Peter with Thor. The Norwegian legend of St Olaf makes him the Christian child of Harold Gramske, and of Asta his wife, persons of high lineage ; he was born in 995, and baptised in the 3rd year of King Olaf Tri ggvason, his relative and god-father, whom he succeeded after a youthful career of piracy. He persecuted the believers in the old Æsar faith, which had begun to reassert itself against Christianity. The pagans found an abettor in Cnut the Great of Denmark, and Olaf was forced to fl ee. He was about to go as a pilgrim to Jerusalem when he was commanded in a dream to raise an army and recover his throne. He had reigned 15 years, and now fell in his fi rst battle, on 29th July 1030. The Church proclaimed him a martyr, and extolled his sanctity and miraculous powers. His corpse—buried in a sand-pit—was dug up after a year, and the nails and hair were found to ha ve grown. His armour, and his heavenly banner, were gone ; but they duly reappeared later in various churches. His son, King Magnus th e Good, enshrined his corpse at the high altar of St Clement in Drontheim, where it wrought miracles ; and the costly shrine in the cathedra l became a centre of pilgrimage for the blind and maimed. Europe built many churches to contain his relics. His body and blood were found unchanged when the tomb was opened in 1567 ; yet this legend is now regarded as only a Norwegian folk- tale. His image is set up, by the older generation, in fi elds at seed time and harvest, and thunder is said to be due to Olaf’s blowing on his red beard. Fountains sprang up at his command, rocks were rent in twain, and trolls were turned to stone.

It was refused to Miltiades after the battle of Marathon, in spite of a victory that saved his country. The heads of the high-priests of Zeus were decked with olive sprigs, and the Roman Jove also wore them: the clubs af Bakkhos and H ē rakl ē s were of olive wood: the leaves, fl owers, fruit, and oil, were used in sacred rites. It was the tree of “ divine radiance ”—the source of oil, or ambrosia ; and unction continued even among Christians to be a symbol of life : for the olive was a phallic tree ; and part of the Cross of Christ, which brought salvation, was of olive wood according to some (see Oak). It was the tree of safety connected with the dove in the legend of Noah ; and olive sprigs avert the Evil Eye and drive aw ay demons from houses, gardens, and fi elds, especially about St Mark’s day when the corn ripens. When, on account of the outraged maidens Damia and Augeria, the Epidaurians suffered from dearth, the Delphik oracle commanded them to make statues of these virgins of olive wood from Attika, for which, the Athenians demanded sacri fi ces to be sent to Ath ē n ē and Erekhtheus. The nuptial couch of Odusseus and Penelop ē was of olive wood, and maidens used to go naked to olive trees, plucking and licking the leaves, and divining from them their marriage destinies. No immoral women might touch an olive tree, lest they should render it sterile (see Prof. A. de Gubernatis’ Mythol. des Plantes , s.v.). Olives: Mount of. This mountain, E. of the Jerusalem temple, had apparently an ancient Hebrew shrine (see 2 Sam. xv, 32), and on its W. slope Solo mon built temples for ’Ashtoreth, Milcom, and Molech. Hence it was called according to the later scribes (see 1 Kings xi, 5-7; 2 Kings xxiii, 13), the “ Mount of Corruption.” [Probably, before being so pointed, this only meant the “ Mount of Anointing.”—E D .] It became still more sacred after the 4th century, as having on its summit the footprints of Christ, though the Gospels made the Ascension occur near Bethany, which is not near the summit (Luke xxiv, 50). Other si tes were added later, including that of the Garden of Gethsemane (two such are shown in our time, the Latin site being quite modern), with the Tomb of the Virgin, and the Medireval chapels of the Pater Noster and Credo.

The mountain is also personi fi ed as the instructor of the lute-playing Apollo. It is now sacred to St Elias, and is a majestic pile, rising 9754 feet above the sea, bounding Thessaly, and overlooking the Makedonian plain.

A mystic invocation of the Supreme One, applied to Agni, Ganesa, and Krishna. In the Pur ā nas it is the title of the Eternal, and of Sri-Bhagavan-Siv (“ Siva the blessed deity ”), who is invoked by the syllable Om, uttered with bated breath, at the begin- ning of a discourse, while the word is written also at the heading of a document, just as the Moslem pre fi xes the Aleph (for Allah, “ God ”), or the Buddhist his sacred Svastika cross, or the Catholic bishop signs his name beside a Christian cross. The Jain also so uses the Om, or Em, as may be seen in copies of the Kalpa-Sutra, or Jain Bible : those who utter the word must bend low, and cover the mouth. Aum is also said to mean the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva ; yet is it the symbol of One alone. In the Bh ā gavad-Gita, Krishna says : “ I am the creator of all things, all proceed from me. . . .

Sir Monier Williams ( Buddhism , 1889) says that : “ It is certainly remarkable that the name Mani is applied to the male organ, and the female is compared to a lotus blossom in the K ā ma- S ā stras.

Suidas quotes D ē mokritos as even asserting that the Jews believed themselves to have been specially befriended by an ass, and that “ they worshiped the head of a golden ass, and every third year sacri fi ced a stranger to it near their temple.” Epiphanius, in like manner, speaks of Gnostiks who adored “ Al Shaddai, or Sabaoth, under the form of an ass ” ( Agst Heresies , I, ii). It appears also that “ Golden Set ” in Egypt, and among Hittites, had the head of an ass. The ass became a Christian emblem, since Christ was carried on one into Egypt, and rode on the ass into Jerusalem. The shoulder stripe is said to be connected wi th the cross ; but the Asiatic variety has no such stripe. The ass also is represented always with the bull, in pictures of the stable at Bethlehe m, on account of a favourite quota- tion (Isaiah i, 3) in apocryphal gospels. In the story of Bala’am also (Num. xxii, 21-33) the ass is able to see an angel, and to reproach its master with human voice. [Arabs still believe that asses, and horses, see spirits, and kneel down when they do so.—E D .] The “ Feast of the Ass,” on St Stephen’s day, survived in the Roman Church till the 16th century ; and vestiges of the custom are still found in some Continental churches. The special service included the chant beginning “ Ex Orientis partibus, advenivit Asinus ” ; and the refrain, sung in chorus, ended with an imitation of the bray of the ass. “ The missal ” (says Hone in his Mysteries) “ was composed by the bishop of Sens, who died in 1222, and it is adorned with the triumph of Bacchus, with whom are mingled nymphs, satyrs, and centaurs. A solemn hymn was sung to the ass.” The symbolic beast stood in the"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Onolatria 44 midst of the choir, decked with sacred vestments ; and the procession moved round it chanting this hymn. The rite went on all night and part of the next day, the singers being refreshed with wine, and the ass provided with provender and water, at intervals during the liturgy. In the middle of the service the anthem beginning “ Conductus ” gave the signal for the people to join with the clergy, in dancing round the ass and braying. After the rites we re concluded they went outside the church to dance, and sang indece nt songs, and then returning some would be stripped naked, and soused with water. This was rightly called “ The Festival of Fools.” Minucius Felix positively af fi rmed that the Christians of his day worshiped the ass. A Syrian bas-re lief of our 2nd century represents a man (the Onokoit ē s) in a long robe, with a cloven foot and ass’s ears, holding a book, and having above him an inscription stating that this is the Christian’s God. Tacitus believe d the Jews to share this worship. In a cell on the Palatine hill, at Rome, was found the rude sketch of a cruci fi ed fi gure with an ass’s head, and above it the words “ Ikthu. Alexamenos worships his God,” which appears to refer to the Christians, to whom Ikthus meant “ Jesus Christ the Son of God Saviour ” (see Renan, Marc Aurele , p. 64 : Josephus, Agst Apion , ii, 7 : Tacitus, Hist ., v, 3). The Christians of Verpna certainly continued what looked much like ass worship down to the 16th century ; and Voltaire also describes the rites of the “ Feast of the Ass ” on 14th January in France, with the refrain to th e chant “ Hez Sire Asnes ” ( Philosoph. Dicty .). But this cult is not peculiar to Christians, for in Persia the spring is still heralded by an ass festival, and the K ̣ adriyeh Dervish sect drive an ass into their mosks (see Lane, Mod. Egtns ., i, p. 307 : Prof. A. de Gubernatis, Zool. Mythol ., i, pp. 361-363). The Romanist Festival claimed to commemorate the descent of the Holy Family into Egypt when the Virgin rode on the ass. The ass was early connected with the sun. In Egypt statues of Set appear to have the ears of the a ss, as have also Assyrian demons. Midas in Phrygia, who turned all he touched to gold, had such ears. In Persia the “ three-legged ass ” (a symbol like the three legs of Sicily, or of the Manx, symbolising the sun), is said to walk in the sea. It has a horn of gold : “ its food is spiritual, and it is righteous ” (Bundah ī sh). The Gnostik Sethites are said also to have connected the ass with Seth, perhaps preservi ng Set worship. Rabbi Nathan said (see Hershon, Tal. Miscel ., p. 159) “ put not a wreath on the head of the ass as the heathen do.” Osiris also, in Hades, appears as an ass with the sun between its ears.

The god who attacks this serpent cries : “ Back thou eater of the ass, whom the god Chas, who is in Tuat, curses. . . . He who cuts thee off causes the eye of Horus to come forth ” (Renouf, Proc. Bib. Arch. Soc ., 7th March 1893). Among Hebrews however the fi rstling of an ass is redeemed with a lamb (Exod. xiii, 13), or otherwise must have its neck broken. Ishmael is described as a “ wild ass man ” (Gen. xvi, 12) dwelling “ east of all his brethren,” and he recalls the Ono-ke ntaurs (or “ ass man-beasts ”) of the Greeks, who appear in the Sept uagint version (see Lilith), though Ishmael is here called “ a fi eld dweller ” in the Greek. The wild ass, to the Hebrews, was the emblem of liberty. The Greeks considered it unlucky to go on if an ass bent its knees, or a female ass lay down, probably because of opposing spirits, as Hermippos relates in describing the doctrines of Pythagoras. In the story of Samson the jaw of the ass is a weapon, from which comes a stream of water to refresh the hero, at the “ well of the crier ” (Judg. xv, 19). The ass was also connected with solar deities, such as Bakkhos, and Silenus. The ass- headed fi gure also occurs very early among Greeks (see Mycenæ). Clement of Alexandria says that Scythians sacri fi ced the ass to Phoibos, and Strabo says to Mars. At Athens the holy offerings to D ē -m ē t ē r were borne on asses, as was the holy water at Jerusalem (see Heifer). In Persia the sacred ass guards the mythical well into which the sun is cast. The ass all over Asia is not only the “ crier,” but also the “ red ” or “ burning ” one. [Hebrew H ̣ amar , Sanskrit Kharas , “ ruddy,” “ ardent.”—E D .] It is also famous for phallic energy, and was adored as the symbol of Dionusos (see Rivers of Life , i, p. 155). The Hyperboreans (or Arctic people) are said to have offered hecatombs of asses to Apollo, and the enemies of Silenus were driven away by the bray of the ass, while the braying of Indra’s ass was symbolic of thunder (see Kentaurs). The Vedik name R ā sabhas for this ass signi fi es a tumultuous noise, and he is also called Gardabhas, from gard “ to bellow ” (see Zool. Mythol ., i, 365). The legend of Lucius (“ the golden ass ”), given by Apuleius, records how the hero— endeavouring to become a bird—is changed by the witch into an ass (as in the Arabian Nights also) during the night. “ The ass bearing mysteries ” also belonged to the rites of the Phallagia, in Greece, and in Rome. The Gandharva-sena, or “ leader of Kentaurs,” who insulted lndra, was born on earth, being a man by day and an ass by night : he was stabled by Sunder -sein, king of Ujjain ; and by this monarch's daughter he was thus the father of the hero Vikram- Ā ditya. lndra in his fury then destroyed Ujjain ; but his own ass is praised as the “ swift footed one ” (see Foot). Asses are said to have"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Ophir 46 been turned into beasts of burden because the gods were jealous of their powers. Hindu law directed the sacri fi ce of the ass as atonement for immorality ; and, in both Asia and Europe, the adulterer was paraded on an ass with his face to the tail—as practised recently in Piedmont—the tail being often fi ery (see Nik). The ass is also called the “ gardener,” and connected with fruit, and with the vine. Ophir. The region whence Solomon obtained gold. [In Genesis x, 29, it is mentioned with Sh eba, as though in S. Arabia.—E D .] The expeditions set out from the Red Sea (1 Kings ix, 26-28 ; x, 11 : 2 Chron. viii, 18), and “ Almug trees,” and gems, came also from Ophir : these trees have been thou ght to represent the sandal wood called Vulgu , in Tamil ( Pterocarpus santalinus ), which would come from India. The ancient Sabean traders may have reached the Indus as early as 1000 B . C ., and an overland trade with India in the 9th century B . C . appears to be shown by the representation (on the “ black obelisk ” of Shalmaneser) of apes, an elephant, and a rhinoceros. From Tarshish (Tarsus) also, Solomon may have obtained, by such overland trade, the “ ivory, apes, and peacocks ” (1 Kings x, 22 : 2 Chron. ix, 21) brought from India (see Peacock) : for these in the Hebrew bear names also known in India, as well as in Egypt (Hebrew hab , Tamil and Sanskrit hab , Egyptian eb , “ elephant ” : Hebrew K ̣ ō ph , Greek Kepos , Latin Cepus , Tamil Kapi , Egyptian Ka fi , “ ape ” : Hebrew Tukki , Tamil Tikai , “ peacock ”) : the name of the peacock especially is important, for elephants and apes would be known in Abyssinia and Nubia, whereas the bird (which is represented on the frescoes of Knossos in Krete) is of Indian origin, the name also appearing in the Mongol tokei for a bird, and in the Persian and Arabic tauwus “ peacock.” If the almug, or algum, tree be the sandal wood we must place Ophir at Abhir on the Indus (see Max Müller, Science of Lang ., i, p. 231 : Journal Rl. Asiatic Soc ., April 1898, pp. 253-257) : the Abiria of Ptolemy reached from the Indus mouths to Kushta (Kathi ā w ā r), so that it included (as mentioned in the Brihat S ā mhita) all the coasts of Surashtra. Lassen agrees that Ptolemy’s Abiria was Ophir ; and Josephus says that Ophir belonged to India ( Ant ., VIII, vi, 4). In the Septuagint Greek however the word S ō phir , or Souphir , stands instead of Ophir in all the passages cited (and in Isaiah xiii, 12) with exception of the fi rst mention of Ophir in Genesis.

Orchard. See Orkos. Or ē . Ori. A Keltik solar hero (see Ar, and Ouri). Origen. The celebrated Christian father whose opinions were condemned by the 5th General Council in 553 A . C . He was appa- rently born of Christian parents, at Alexandria in Egypt, in 185 A . C ., and, after persecution by the Church, died at Tyre in 254 A . C . His father’s name was Leonidas, probably a Greek : his mother, who taught him Hebrew, may perhaps have been of Alexandrian Jewish origin. He was the eldest of seven children ; and the father, who was poor, appears to have boen martyred under Severus in 202 A . C ., when his famous son was 17 years old. He was then studying under Pantamus, and Clement of Alexandria, and maintained the family by the sale of his father’s books, which brought a sum of about sixpence a day (then representing a considerably larger value) ; but for many years he walked barefooted, and wore a single robe, obeying the command not to have two coats. He attended the lectures of Ammonius Saccas, and thus became expert in the teaching of Plato, N umenius, the Stoiks, and the Pythagoreans, remaining at Alexandria till about 230 A . C . He visited Rome in the time of Zephyrinus, an d travelled in Arabia : he was asked by the Empress Julia Mammæa, mother of Alexander Severus, to teach her philosophy ; and in 216 A . C . he was in Palestine, so escaping a persecution in Egypt. But he was regarded by the Alexandrian bishop with distrust and jealousy, and on ly became a presbyter while absent in Greece, for which he was expelled by Demetrius—bishop of Alex- andria—in 232 A . C . He thus became a wanderer, and was at Cæsarea, in Kappadokia, during the persecut ion under Maximian, again visiting Arabia, as well as Nicomedia and Athens. He combatted the Uni- tarian views of Beryllus, bishop of Bostra in Palestine, and corresponded with the Emperor Philip Arabs, and wi th his wife the Empress Severa."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Origen 48 He was imprisoned, and maltreated, during the Decian persecution of 250 A . C .; and died four years later, under Valerian, according to the Panegyric of Gregory Thaumaturgus. Our information depends on extracts from his writings quoted by Basil, and Gregory of Nazianzen ; while Eusebius, in our 4th century, claims to have seen 100 letters in the library of Cæsarea of Palestine ( Hist. Eccles ., vi, 36,) and two of another collection at Jerusalem ( Hist. Eccles ., vi, 20); his other infor- mation being from “ those who had s een Origen.” Jerome depended on Eusebius, and on his uncle Pamphilus, who was martyred in 309 A . C .; a large proportion of his 6000 supposed works are apocryphal, and those known by the Latin translation of Ru fi nus are vitiated by the confession of the editor that he amended Origen where he was wrong or heretical. Origen is perhaps most famous for his study of the text of the Bible, and for his controversy with Ce lsus (see Celsus) ; but it is clear that his views were nearer to those of the Gnostiks, and Christian philosophers of his age, than to the narrow and ignorant orthodoxy which fi nally condemned him. He held that “ Christ was a ransom to Satan, not a sacri fi ce to please God,” which was a Gnostik belief ; and, like Aristotle, he regarded the soul as corporeal. From his work On Principles (vii, 1), it appears that he regarded the sun and moon as possessing spirits ; but he could have found no dif fi culty in the story of the Gadarene swine, since he says that “ some demons proceeded to such a pitch of wickedness as to assume (or be condemned to) the bodies of weasels ” ( Agst Celsus , iv, 93). He believed the name of Iesous to be powerful against such devils, even if pronounced by very wicked persons, which was apparently the view of Simon Magus (Acts viii, 13 : see xix, 15). He argued that there were Christian mysteries not fi tted to be revealed to the vulgar, just as there were “ secrets of the empire ” not to be generally known, and supreme secrets of pagan philosophy. His defence of Christia nity was founded on practical con- siderations : for implicit faith, in his opinion, induced the weak and licentious to abandon evil courses : “ We are well advised,” he said, “ of these things, and do professe dly teach men to believe without a severe examination ” : for the busy populace must not wait till they have opportunity and capacity for study : or in other words must accept authority without enquiry. If he denied to Celsus that Jesus was a carpenter we must conclude that the passage, in a work with which he appears to have been familiar (Mark vi, 3), either read otherwise in his time, or was regarded by him as a Je wish misrepresentation. Tradition (perhaps due to his enemies) accuses him of having carried out in early enthusiasm the extremest practice of preparation for heaven (Matt. xix,"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Origen 49 12), which would have been suf fi cient reason for refusing to ordain him (see Rivers of Life , i, p. 148). His banishment from Alexandria, in 232 A . C ., gave rise to “ dolor- ous lamentations,” which led to his being represented later as having become an unbeliever ; but he was in fact superior in learning and intelligence to the bigots who denounced him. The attack upon him continued for more than three cent uries, being due not only to his views as to “ faith ” and “ knowledge, ” but also to his doctrines as to the pre-existence of souls, their corporeal nature, and the nature of Christ ; the plurality of worlds, and the resurrection of the soul. The bishops of Antioch and of Alexandri a especially opposed him, yet Prof. Harnack says : “ Of all the theologians of the ancient Church he was the most distinguished. He was the father of the Church’s science ; the founder of a theology brought to perfection in the 4th and 5th centuries, and which still retained the stamp of his genius when, in the 6th century, it disowned its author.” He built on the foundations laid in a previous generation by Tatian, Athenagoras, Pantamus, and Clement of Alexandria. With the practical Christianity of his age he mingled Greek philosophy, and spoke of “ remaining ever in a placid, restful, and sorrowless condition, superior to surrounding evils,” whereby “ man can enter into the likeness of God, an d into blessedness ; and this is to be reached by contemplative isol ation, and self-knowledge, which is divine wisdom. The soul can thus be hold itself in a mirror, seeing the divine spirit if found worthy of such fellowship ; and thus discovers the secret path to participation in the divine nature.” He accepted Stoik ethiks, but mingled them with neo-Platonic mysticism, saying that : “ Complete and certain knowle dge can only rest on divine reve- lation.” He believed the Gospel, the 13 Epistles of Paul, one of Peter, and one of John, with the Apocalypse, and Acts, to be such revelation ; “ generally admitted to be authentic, and of apostolic origin ” ; other writings of the same class being in his eyes either “ unauthenticated ” or “ spurious.” The Canon of Euse bius was pretty much the same, and Origen, according to Dr S. Davids on, “ did not dare to depart from the recognised tradition of the churches,” and in respect to the Old Testament equally accepted Jewish tradition. Origen was the only well known Christian father before Jerome who appears to have had any acquaintance with Hebrew ; but bo th were rash in assertions as to history. Origen believed that Clement of Rome was the Clement known to Paul (Phil. iv, 3), but does not call him a bishop of Rome, though he appears as an “ apostle ” in our present text of Clement of Alexandria (see Donaldson, Apostolic Fathers , pp. 116-"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Orkos 50 119). He was a fi rm believer in miracles, de mons, angels, and divine voices ; he thought that the very st ars had souls, and that comets were sent by God to presage the rise and fall of nations, and the approach- ing end of the world. In his work Peri Arkh ō n (“ on principles ”) he treated of God and the world, of the fall, of spirits, anthropology, and ethiks ; and, in the fourth book, of the divinity and interpretation of scripture. Other works—the Stromata in 10 books, and those on Martyrdom, and on Prayer—have perished, only a few later quotations being left. Even in his lifetime his works were garbled by others ; but it appears that he believed in a Logos (not as being eternal but as a creation by God) and in a pu rely spiritual resurrection. In his time there were at least se ven Greek versions of the Jewish Scriptures : of these he selected and compared, in parallel columns, the four that he regarded as most important, namely what he called the “ Septuagint,” with the versions of Aquila, Theodotion, and Symmachus. This formed his “ Tetrap la ” or “ four-fold ” comparison, to which he added the Hebrew, and the Hebrew in Greek characters, the whole being known as the Hexapla or “ six-ply ” document. All this labour has perished, and we only thence learn that the Old Testament, in our 3rd century, abounded in variant readings due either to differences in the Hebr ew copies, or to differences of translation. The same, we know, was also the case with the New Testament, according to the notes of Origen, who wrote thereon many scholia, homilies, and commentaries. His work thus included both grammatical criticism, moral teachi ng, and secret “ pneumatic ” or mystic interpretation ; but what remains to us—being chie fl y in Latin translation—has been garbled by later orthodox scribes, so that we often remain uncertain as to the real ideas of Origen.

The hero was fi nally torn in pieces by. Thrakian women jealous of his charms, during orgies which recall those of the Phrygian Attus. His head fl oated down the Hebros river to the shores of Lesbos, and mysteries were connected with his shrine near Antissa. These were similar to .the customs of Pythagoreans (Herodotos, ii, 81,), his votaries being severe ascetiks who wore a di stinctive garb, while bloody sacri fi ces were forbidden. Orphik hymns are traced back as early as 550 B . C ., and were quoted by pagans in controversy with Christians, as typical of true belief about the ancient gods , much as their opponents quoted their own scriptures. Orpheus sang to the Argonauts the history of creation, and charmed the ship Argo from the rocks on which it stranded. The fi elds and meadows smiled, the rocks were split, and beasts and trees danced to the music of his heavenly lyre (the breeze) ; but the chief exponent of actual Orphik poetry was Onomakritos about 500 B . C . Prof. Müller ( Hist., and Lit. Ancient Greece ) says that the Orpheans sought to found their religion on the myth of Dion ū sos, whose body was torn and eaten raw (as Zagreus) by Titans, at the command of H ē r ē , while Ath ē n ē preserved his heart, and so brought him back to life. “ The Orphik brethren ” believed in an “ universal spirit ” or “ soul, which animated all nature ”—a Dion ū sos whom H ē rakleitos called Hades (“ the unseen ”) and whom Euripides called the Delphik Apollo. Herodotos (see ii, 51, 58) says that “ what Orpheus delivered in hidden allegories , Pythagoras learned on initiation into Orphik mysteries ; and Plato received a knowledge of them from Orphik, and Pythagorean, writings.” The Orpheans taught trans- migration of souls ; and at the ve rnal feast they assembled in white garments, and devoured the raw fl esh of the bull sacri fi ced to Dion ū sos. Mr Legge ( Scottish Review , July 1896) regards the Orphik mysteries of the 6th century B . C . as the source of those of Eleusis. Their Deus Pantheus (or universal sp irit) was Zeus, as the creator and ruler of the living, and Hades as the ru]er of the dead. The female receptive principle of nature they recognised as Aphrodit ē , Persephon ē , etc.; and Dioniisos appears to have been the mediator between man and the creator. They strove in fact, like others, to conceal their philosophy from the masses under familiar names, and to explain old myths spiritually ; and their practical teaching was ascetik, and .communistic, like that of the reclus es of the Egyptian Serapeum (see Pythagoras).

The spelling of MSS. letters in the reign of Elizabeth shows us how recent was the system, from which we have since then considerably diverged.

The Greek form of the name of the chief Egyptian solar deity, which appears in Phœnician alphabetic texts as Ausiri , and Asiri ; and in Egyptian as Uasir or Ā sir . [Probably Uasir, and Uasi (Osiris and Isis) both come from the root As —“ to breathe,” to “ exist ”—as signifying the chief male and female spirits.—E D .] Osiris and Isis, with their son Horus, form a triad ; and the parents are said to have been already we dded before they were borne, as twins, by their mother Nut or Neith (the sky). Osiris is especially the sun by night, dwelling in the und er world (see Amenti), but also stands between his wives, Isis and Nephthys, as representing the day god between dawn and sunset. He is the eldest born of Nut—the heaven—and of Seb, the earth : “ Lord of Amenti, of Abydos (Nefr Urit), and of all forces, the most mighty and exalted, and the saviour of the world.” Yet Horus is exhorted “ to restore his father to life ” (see Proc. Bib.. Arch. Socy ., June 1896), and he rises again after death. “I Osiris am yester day, and I know the morrow which is Ra.” For he was both son and father of Ra, and they proceed from one another (Renouf, Trans. Bib. Arch. Socy ., IX, ii, p. 283), a mystery which recalls that of the Christian Trinity. He is Ua (“ the one ”), and Neb-ua (“ the only lord ”) : at Karnak he stands on the disk, bearing crown and sceptre, and adored by all the chief gods as Ra-uasir, or Un-nefr, the triumphant king of gods, who alone can confer “ blessing, on earth and on man.” “ I am Tmu and Un ” (the setting and rising sun), “ the one, and one only, or Ra at his fi rst rising.” But the life of Osiris was never extinguished; though he"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Osiris 53 was torn in pieces by Set his body was again put together by Isis, who at length, after many wanderings, found the phallus at Philæ, and watched the mummy in its sacred ark at Thebes. Or, according to another legend, she found the sarcophagus in the far east (see Gebal) under the tamarisk, or the palm. Set (the later Semitic Typhon) discovered the cof fi n as he hunted by night in the marshes, and tore the body into 14 or 16 pieces, each of which was buried at a different shrine till Isis regathered the fragment s. Thus, like Attus, or Orpheus, or Zagreus, the god is torn in fragments—a myth apparently of the stormy season—and Osiris is repr esented as the swathed mummy like Khem, the ithyphallic god, recalling the swathed lingams of Polynesia, and of Ireland (see Muri). He is also dual, as Uasir-Aah (“ sun moon ”) or as Har-Set (“ day night ”), represented wjth two heads as a Janus. At On (Heliopolis) he is Ura “ the gr eat one ” ; at Thebes he is Se “ the child” : at Memphis he is Hapi (Apis) “ the bull.” He is the “ black, or blue-black,” like Krishna in India, while Set his foe is red, for this is the last hue of the setting sun : and Set bursts from his mother’s side a day after Osiris is born ( Isis and Osiris , commonly attributed to Plutarch, xii). As the sun, and the complete male element, Osiris is triple—Har, Kheper, and Tmu. At his tomb at Philæ the phallus of the god was adored, in the local ritual, with hymns “ sung by pure virgins ” (Mr Budge, in Arche- ologia , 1891). From these rites, according to Melampus, the Greeks derived their mysteries, and phallic processions. A legend rcported by Greeks ( Isis and Osiris , xxxv) tells how Typhon offered a golden coffer to any whom it might fi t. Osiris lay down in it, and Typhon closed and sealed it, and fl ung it into the Nile, whence it fl oated to sacred Byblos (Ge bal) as above described. The daily war of Set and Har is waged by the latter as the “ avenger of his father ”—the sun of yesterday slain, at night, by the “ black boar ” who “ eats the eye of Horus.” For this reason swine were sacri fi ced once a year to Osiris, as to Demeter at Knidos, or the boar that slew Adonis to Aphrodit ē . Osiris again, as a wolf, tore the giant Typhon ; or Set was bound and burned by Horus, but allowed to escape by Isis, as godess of night and of the moon ; wherefore Horus took the crown from her head, and gave her the bull’s head and horns (the crescent succeeding the full moon, and extinguished by the rising sun). Horus again slays the red boar , and Isis scatters its bones, but keeps the thigh ; and by hymns and spells calls her lord again to life. Osiris alone, of all the gods (Sharpe, Egtn.

Egyptian religion as solatmythology, connected with the Nile, the dark Typhon (“ the hidden one ”), and the Aithiopian (“ dusky faced ”) queen Ase or Ua s ̣ i (Isis). These powers, with 72 lesser gods (the Egyptian “ assessors ” in Amenti), made the ark from which the infant sun issues at dawn, or in the spring time. Osiris ruled 28 years (the days of the lunar month), and with Isis built the fi rst pyramids. But shrewd Greeks, not regarding the myths as poetry, told the priests of Memphis, as Xendphanes is said to have done, that if Osiris were a god he co uld not, suffer and die, and if only a man he should not be adored. Yet do we still chant in churches that “ God the Maker died, for man the creature’s sin.” An inscription at Denderah, with attached drawings, showing the sepulchre in which he was laid, describes Osiris who lies between the weeping Isis and N ephthys, while the dog Anubis watches over him. In another crypt he appears reviving under the care of these two wives, while Thoth pours ambrosial water of life upon him—the vivifying dew belonging to the moon god. He is said to have fi rst appeared as a man, then as a ram, a jackal, and a hawk, and thus became Horus (the hawk), “ the exact image of his father’s glory, and the scatterer of his foes.” In another chapel we see Isis and Nephthys gathering the members of Osiris, while a priest stands by; and fi nally they are all united in the swathed mummy form. In the last scene of eight we see the sacred emblems, the crook, and the whip, where- with he shepherds the pious, and punishes the wicked. The worship of Osiris spread, about the 4th century B . C ., far beyond Egypt ; it became popular in Rome; and even in the remote provinces on the Rhine, and the Danube (says Prof. Wiedemann), the subjects of the Roman empire raised altars to Os iris and Isis, and to Horus their divine child (see Denderah, Horus, Isis).

Oskan Latin continued to be used in Italy after the rise of the Romans, and Festus speaks of the Bruttii as having a Greko-Oskan tongue. Oskan inscriptions appear on Samnite coins about 90 B .

Pacha-kamak. The sun god of Peru, worshiped before the time of the Incas, who however revere d his shrines, which were palaces as well. The fi rst of these was in the valley of Lurin, S. of Rimak (Lima), and close to the coast town of Lura : it was of immense size, and the whole region was prosperous and civilised when the barbarous Spaniards arrived about 1530 A . C . The name comes from Pacha “ earth,” and Kuman “ animating.” The worsbip of Pacha-kamak here superseded that of Vira-cocha the sea god (Dr Réville, Hibbert Lect ., 1884) : and this creator of earth was a god of fi re, adored wherever the subterranean fi res of this volcanic region issued from clefts. He was thus a gloomy and violent deity, yet the teacher of useful crafts on earth, like other sun gods : and he is said to have three sons, Kon (or Vira-cocha), Pa cha-kamak, and Manko-kapak. He is also the “ speaker ” or “ sounder,” giving oracles out of the earth. Such deities, says Dr Rév ille (p. 192), belong to “ an ancient worship of sacred stones and rocks, many of which remained under the Incas.” “ Stones were also symbols of fi re ”—for fi re comes from the fl int. The names Pacha-kamak, and Vira-cocha, says Prescott ( Peru , p. 43), denoted “ the giver of life, sustainer of the universe, the creator, and the supreme.” He required no temples, for he was seen in any Huaka or sacred stone, in village, house, or cave ; but the Rimak shrine was the Makka of the West. “ He was the father of his people, the giver of light and warmth to men.” The Incas built a shrine to Pacha-kamak on the hill overlooking the older one in the sylvan valley ; and this included idols in fi sh form, and was extremely wealthy, as the Spaniards soon discovered. Roads beauti- fully engineered led, over almost precipitous mountains, to the abode of the god, and torrent gorges were spanned by bridges of wood and of stone : long suspension bridges (like those of E. Asia) were made of oziers, and the Spanish cavalry found it easily possible to cross these. Peace and plenty reigned in the rich valleys, and on the terraced hills, before the robbers who called themselves Christians arrived (Prescott, Peru , pp. 210, 211). They found the door of the inner shrine of Pacha-kamak set wi th gems, crystal, turquoise, and coral ; and within was an uncouth wooden monster, with a man’s head, in a dark cell reeking with the odour of the slaughter house (being a place of sacri fi ce), while gold and emeralds lay strewn on its fl oor.

Sanskrit : “ foot.” This is often an euphuism for the phallus, and the Hindu gods are represented with the foot covering the lingam (see Rivers of Life , i, pp. 98, 251, plate iv, 7, and fi g. 119). Siva is represented creating with his foot (ii, p. 454), and Vishnu’s foot is his common emblem ; the sacred feet are represented in the Argha (i, p. 36, fi g. 158 ; p. 159, fi g. 361), this symbol being transferred subsequently to Buddha. Beside the sacred pipal tree at Buddha-gay ā stands the lingam, and the impress of Vishnu’s foot. In the temple on a sacred mountain six miles distant, said by tradition to be as old as the time of R ā ma, the sacred Pad is in a silver cup, under a silver canopy, within a do med chapel, beside which rises a golden spire. The Indian Pad, single or in pairs, is found everywhere near the shrines ; and “ Paduka-puja, ” or “ foot worship,” is universal in commemoration of the last earthly footprint of some beloved deity or teacher (see Foot). The shrewd mercantile Jains show in one place—Memi-n ā th—no less than 1880 footprints of the saint so named (a follower of the 22nd Jina), and 1452 others of a saintly follower of Rishaba (see Jains). Sir Monier Williams found these covered with offerings of grain, fl owers, aud money ( Contempy. Review , Dec. 1879). Hindu girls wors hiping Hari (Vishnu), or Br ā t ā the creator, and praying for a perfect family (a good husband, seven wise sons, and two fair daughters), make two Pads of sandal-wood paste, and place them in a plate, with spices and fl owers (Mr C. S. Bose, Hindus as they Are ). Buddhists told Col. Symes (see Upham, Buddhism , p. 20) that Buddha’s foot is a sign of creation (see Adam’s Peak). The Siamese adore the footprint of their great teacher, on the Phr ā -bat rock near Bangkok, a natural depression which has been somewhat deepened by priests, who reap a harvest here from many besides Buddhists ; for the ancient cultus has not been displaced even after 1500 years of professed Buddhism. Mr Hallett ( Asiatic Quarterly Rev ., April 1887, p. 388) describes, in the delta of the Bangkok river, a temple with an image of Buddha, and a lingam adored by women outside it. Mr G.

A conical hill rises some leagues N.W. of his capital (Loph-buri); and on a rocky ledge on the slope the gorgeous Maha-dop pavilion was built : but in 1766 unbelieving robbers burned it, murdering the monks, and desecrating the holy footprint. The present shrine was not built till 1787, by the founder of the present dynasty ; but pilgrimages to this “ foot of Budh ” are traced even in 1600 A . C ., the chief season being the spring. The original object of worship was probably the natural lingamof the mountain peak ; but the pavilion is a “ half-way house ” to the summit, which is easily reached by steps winding under the cool shade pf the pipal and bo trees, being a lovely spot, where men may rest under the verandah roofs, or on the marble and sanded terraces. The inner dop , or “ dome,” rises some 100 feet above the shrine which is 30 feet square, and it is crowned with pinnacles and spires. The holy foot is 5 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 10 inches deep : the fl oor of tessellated marble round it is covered, in part, with a mat woven of pure silver: an everlasting fi re burns near. On a low dais, by the S. wall, “ there burnt,” says Mr Palgrave, “ dim lamps, candles, pastilles,” much as in Christian churches. The Phr ā -bat is edged with lotuses, covered with gold ; and in the sole are scratched markings for the toes, representing a right foot facing north : the Chakra wheel if! also marked on the sole. The worshiper approaches on his knees, touching the steps wi th clasped hands and forehead, and he remains prostrate in prayer and meditation before the golden lotus border, retiring slowly to rejoin rejoicing friends. “ All is bright orna- ment and glitter, mirth, music, an d laughter, nothing solemn, nothing mysterious, nothing awful, no dim religious light, no sacred gloom, no fear-inspiring rites, ” says Mr Palgrave. Col. Symes remarks that the Pa d symbols are generally accom- panied by small cones and pillars ; the sole of the foot is “ engraved into separate compartments,” and “ two convoluted serpents pressed beneath the heel ” (see Gen. iii, 15), while “ the toes are formed of fi ve conch shells ” in one case. Mr W. Crooke describes various examples of feet adored in the past, such as the sandal of Perseus (Herod., ii, 91), the Devil’s foot at Borrodah, that of St Remadi at Spa, the divine foot of Conn in Ireland, and that of Kapila (Mah ā - bh ā rata, ii, 271), of St Magnus at Kirk of Burritch in the Orkneys, of Sivaji at Ratnagiri, and Th ā na, or of R ā ma at Nasik.

The footprints of St Augustine were shown at Ebbis Fleet where he landed (Stanley, Hist.

Even John Wesley le ft his footmarks, near his birth- place in the island of Axholme, on the tombstone of his father (Mr E. Peacock, Academy , 18th Sept. 1886), and George IV left the print of his sacred feet on a rock in Kingstown Harbour (where he landed in 1821) to be visited by those suffering from “ king’s evil.” Fergus Mor Mac Ereas also left a booted impress on the high cone of Dun-add (see Scottish Review , Jan. 1888), and a pair of sacred footprints of Columba occur on the Green-castle road, N. of Londonderry, while single ones are found on the Mullach-lech (“ hill of the stone ”) in Monaghan, and on the Clare road. The “ coronation stone ” at Cashel, in Tipperary, was so marked till destroyed, in 1602, by Lord Mountjoy ; while another (see Mr Martin, Western Isles , p. 102) was on a karn on which the Lord of the Isles was enthroned : he had to put his foot in the print while receiving a cons ecrated sword sceptre, and a white wand. The footprint of St Radegonde at Poictiers was long called that of “ Our Lord,” as being impre ssed when he visited the saint. P ā li texts only recognise fi ve genuine “ footprints of Buddha”— the Pancha Prapatta ; but there are many others. Wandering non- Aryan tribes in India often told us of the footprints and handprints that they worshiped. Col. Conder notices those of Syria ( Pal. Expl. Fund. Quart.

The lotus on which he sits springs from the navel of Vishnu, as he reclines on the wa ters, and Vishnu is therefore Padma- nabha (“ lotus naveled ”), and his consort is Padma-v ā ti (“ lotus borne ”), as she too sits in the lotus. In Egypt also the lotus was sacred. The seeds are pounded and baked as bread, and the root, which is like an apple, is eaten, as are the broken up kernels of the rose lotus. The Egyptians held feasts in boats among the lotus fl owers (Strabo, XVII, i, 15) : they saw “ hope ” in its buds (Prof. A. de Gubernatis, Mythol. des Plantes , ii, pp. 199-211), and the “ Rose of Juno ” in its full bloom. In India it is Kam ā la the “ love fl ower,” perfumed by the breath of Vishnu. In the Amrita Upanishad the Y ō gi in contempla- tion is bidden to seat himself like a lotus : and sprigs are worn by love sick maidens to stay their pa ngs. When King Pandu tried to burn the sacred “ tooth ” of Buddha he saw it rise again in the centre of a lotus—the pistil of the fl ower being sacred also to Kal-linga worshipers. Br ā hma sleeps on the lotus for six months each year, and actively creates during the othe r six. The lotus also covers the Yoni of Egyptian female mummies, and Lotis was a nymph pursued by Priapus, and changed into a lotus, which was the garland of princesses and of maidens. Mr Aynsley ( Indian Antiq ., May 1886) describes a brass object from Ban ā ras which shows the symbolic meaning of the emblem : “ At the base of it is a bull from whose back rises a lotus bud which, on a couple of turns being given to it, opens its petals and discloses a small agate egg. Behind the bull is a cobra, with its body elevated as if in the act of striking. A ring which it holds in its mouth supports a small pointed vase, which is perforated at the lower end, so that a liquid may drop slowly and continuously on the egg ” (p. 124)."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Pagan 61 Pagan.

A castellated building rises above a precipitous ravine, and is now only the hiding place of robbers and wild beasts. Its lower terrace is of hard grey sandstone not to be found anywhere near Pag ā n, and the carving round the main portal, and the windows, is of exquisite beauty. Inside are galleries, huge columns, and a central hall. Pointed and rounded vaults roof it in, and on the S. side is a huge image of Buddha, while others appear with those of Hindu gods in the side niches. The edi fi ce leans against the precipice to its south ; and galleries lead into caves cut in the bill, such as are found in all the hills E. of Pag ā n, many being plastered an d covered with paintings and inscriptions. Mr Forchhammer identi fi ed among these the caves and temples in which fi ve Buddhist priests resi ded after a ten years’ visit to Ceylon (1171 A . C .).

He enumerates 125 slabs in this neighbourhood bearing dated inscriptions in the square P ā li alphabet ; and he considers that Pag ā n, like her earlier sister Hastina- p ū r on the Ir ā vati, or the later Tagaung in the upper valley of the Ir ā wadi, was built almost entirely by Indian architects.

The Buddhist rears his pagoda in the shape of a lotus bud rising into a spire, because Buddha was the lotus bud before birth, and, as they af fi rm, directed that his bones should rest in such a shrine.

The extreme grossness of the old Italian cultus, as evidenced by the remains in the Naples Museum, obtained from Pompeii and else- where, is well known. In the Florence Museum a huge phallus is borne by a lion, and garlanded with fruits and fl owers. The phalli at Hierapolis, in Syria ( Jer ā blus , or Karkemish), are described by Lucian ( De Dea Syria ) ; and one] 20 cubits high was borne through Alex- andria in the time of the Ptolemies, according to Athenæus. They were indeed symbols in all processions connected with the mysteries of creative deities, as elsewhere show n in detail. The phallus is still a common talisman in Italy (see Eye, and Isernia), and Sir W. Hamilton (see his letter to Sir J. Banks, president of the Royal Society, dated Naples, 30th Decemb er 1781) sent, from Naples, many specimens of phallic ex votos to the British Museum (see Payne Knight, Worship of Priapus , Bouton’s edition, 1876, plate xxvii). The phalli are sometimes entwined with a serpent, and others are winged ; one adorned with bells, and ridden by a female, occurs at Nismes. A cross of four phalli comes also from the same place ; and a favourite Mediæval charm, in Italy, was a hand with a ring above it, fl anked by two phalli (see also Fig). At Isernia, in the 18th century, these symbols were offered for sale publicly, being a palm in length, and sacred to St Cosmo and St Damian. Specimens which we have ourselves examined, among a strange variety of ex"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"P ā la 66 votos worn by Italians, are modelled after those found at Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Prestum : in many cases birds, and dog-like beasts, are represented with phalli as tails or beaks. The phallic cult in Europe continued down to 1400 A . C ., though denounced at Mans in 1247, and at the synod of Tours in 1396 ; the Council of Chalons, referring in th e 9th century to previous fulmina- tions against such rites, seems to have attempted to consecrate the Fesne or Pinne (see Fascinum), by the Credo and Pater Noster (Chiswick Press, 1865). In Midlothian, in 1268, the clergy instructed their fl ock to sprinkle water with a dog’s phallus over a wooden symbol of the same, in order to stop a murrain ; the same occurred at Inverkeithing in Fife 14 years later, and in Easter week priest and people danced round a wooden Priapus, the priest—when cited before his superiors—excusing himself on the plea of ancient usage, and going unpunished in consequence. In France girls dedicated their maiden robes to St Foutine, or Fesne (see also Deuce). Frey was adored as a Priapus in our 11th century (Adam of Bremen, quoted by Payne Knight, Priapus , p. 126). Remains, supposed to be Roman, have been found in the Thames, Ouse, and Seine, including charms and medals representing phalli. Samian ware in London, and in other Roman cities of Britain, repres ents objects as coarse as any in secret museums abroad. Even as late as the 17th century (says Dulaure) barren women scraped the wooden emblem of St Foutine (see Foutin), and drank the scraping s. At Embrun, in the Upper Alps, they poured wine on the Fesne, and drank it—the emblem being apparently a long pole passed through a tree or post, and constantly pushed forward as the end was scraped away by devotees (see Holi). Not long ago women used also to decora te a phallus at the ancient church of St Walberg in Antwerp (Payne Knight, Priapus ; 2 Kings xxiii, 7). Antwerp also possessed the “ Pr eputium Domini,” said to have been sent by Godfrey of Bouillon from Jerusalem, though it is not known how he got it; but there were no less than 12 of these in Europe. Dulaure describes the Fateaux borne in procession at the Fête Dieu, at St Jean d'Angeli (ii, p. 285), with the sweet cakes, or silvered niches (see Easter). At Brest, and at Puy-en-Velay, the emblem was a huge beam attached to the fi gure of a saint, and the shavings were used for philtres. Even in Wales, and in the Channel Islands, stone and glass “ rolling pins ” are kept as charms, and denote the same emblem ( Notes and Queries , 19th August 1899) : one near the Casquets was “ sixteen inches long by one and a half thick, of pale blue clouded glass ; and within a wreath in the centre is ‘ Love and be happy ’ ; at one end a ship under full sail ; at the other—"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Palaki 67 “ From rocks and sands and barren lands Kind fortune keep me free, And from great guns and women's tongues, Good Lord, deliver me.” [The Editor, in 1894, saw several of these glass charms, with ships and mottoes on them, in the cottages in N. Wales.] Aix in Provence, and Le Châtelet in Champagne, boasted each a Priapus. It bore the name of St René (“ reborn ”) in Anjou ; Greluchon at Bourges ; St Regnaud in Burgundy ; St Arnaud, and Guignole, in and about Brest : or St Gilles in Brittany. On the wall of Antoninus in Scotland the phallus is carved on a cippus, with the Latin words x. AN .

Palasa and Parna mean “ leaf ” : the tree is sacred, and the wood is used fo r consecrated vessels, and forms the sceptre of Br ā hma. The red powder used at festivals (see Holi) comes from the fl owers, and Buddhists say that when their master died the Pal ā sa ran blood. Many of the Bhikshus dye their garments from the blossoms. The Vedik legend relates how Indra or Agni, fl ying as a falcon to earth, bearing the Soma (or Ambrosia), dropped a feather and a claw. From the feather sprang the Pal ā sa tree, and from the claw the thorny Mimosa Catechu , which has red fl owers like the Pal ā sa, and red berries like the ash. The Pal ā sa furnishes wands to be set round cattle pens and corn st acks to avert evil ; and holy men strike the fl ocks with these to make them breed. The Kelts used the rowan, or ash tree, in the same way, placing the twigs round their beds as a protection against witche s (see Colors), and to keep off the evil eye, or setting “ care wands ” of rowan over doors, and using it for walking sticks, and to drive cattle (Kelly, Folklore , p. 163).

Pallavas. According to the laws of Manu, these were a hardy race of N. India (otherwise Pahnavas—see P ā hlavi), who were long bearded, and belonged to the Kshatriya, or warrior caste ; but, according to the Ram ā yana, they “ sprang from the tail of the cow.” They ruled Kuntala, or Oent ral India, from Elora and Ajanta on the W. to Orissa on the E. coast; their capital, Vid ā ta, or B ā d ā mi, being possibly B ā t ā ni. They seem to have moved S., being disturbed by the conquests of Darius I, and of the Greeks, and settled in Kanchi, and Vengi, being gradually merged in the Dr ā vidian popula- tion. A stone text of the 4th century represents P ā lavas as driven from Ranchi about 150 A . C . by the rise of the Kadambas. Sir W. Elliot ( Numismata Orientalia , 1886, p. 17) says that P ā lavas are noticed in these Nasik cave inscriptions with S ā kas and Y ā vanas (Scythians and Greeks), and, like Professor Dawson, he suggests that they were P ā hlavis or Parthians. Buddhists in the Madr ā s province of Kanchi-desa were called P ā lavas, and ruled from 200 to 1120 A . C ., till absorbed by the Chalukyas in 1150 A . C . Their capital at Vengi was taken from them by the latter after the 6th century, when they moved to Kanchi-p ū r (Conjeveram). They ar e believed to have begun the rock-cut temples of Maha-bali-piir (see that heading) about 400 A . C ., and the Chalukyas to have completed these after 700 A . C .

Greek Palaiolithik : “ the old stone ” age, or stage (see Neolithik), when men could only chip fl ints, and lived in caves and under natural shelters, eating shell fi sh, or slaying game with spears tipped with bone and fl int. Europeans had then no bows and arrows, nor any pottery, and do not appear to have buried the dead. Canon Isaac Taylor ( Contempy. Review , August 1890) believes them to have passed out of this stage some 20,000 years ago. Their remains are chie fl y found in S. Europe, in caves near Maçon, Mentone, and in Sicily, and they seem to have lived on the small wild horses (see Horse) : they appear after the Glacial age in the remains found in river drifts, and seem to have reached Britain without crossing the sea (see Geology), whereas the distribution of land and water in the Neolithik age of N. Europe was much what it now is. The Palaiolithik European had a long narrow head, with strong frontal ridges, a low forehe ad, receding chin, and large molar teeth : he was little over 5 feet in height as a rule ; and he has thus been often compared with the Eskimo, who are short and remarkably long-headed. In America, howeve r, the antiquity of human remains appears not to be so great (see Azteks), for in the caves of Britain (such as Kent’s cavern), of Germ any, and France, the animals among whom early man had to live present a strange mingling of various faunas, as described by Dawkin s ; the elephant, mammoth, hippo- potamus, and woolly-haired rhinoceros, occur with the reindeer, wolf, and brown bear, accompanied by chipped fl int weapon heads.

Palenque. A celebrated ancient city in the State of Chiapa, mid-way between the Bay of Campeachy and the Paci fi c Ocean. Many have regarded its sculptures, including cross-legged fi gures, as Buddhist (Vining, Inglorious Columbus , pp. 199-203. See Mexico and Uxmal). One of the pala ce bas-reliefs presents the head of an elephant, with a trunk but without tusks. The elephant was probably unknown in America in the age when this was carved, and the extinct mastodon of that continent had large tusks. Palenque is thought to be older than Uxmal. Its temples of hard stone set in mortar, and covered with cement, have stucco fi gures in relief, which represents a considerable advance in civilisation. The shrines are on spurs of the Sierra, overlooking vast forest-covered plains stretching to the sea. The chief temple is ca lled the “ Temple of the Cross ” ; for, on an inscribed altar slab (6 2 1 by 11 feet) is a central cross surmounted by the sacred Kwetzal bird, with human fi gures on either side. The fi gures generally are very like those of India (see Mr Vining’s cuts, pp 127, 128, 591-593, 603) and are all in high-relief ; the cross-legged god sits on a lotus throne, or on the back of a tiger, as at Boro-budur in Java. The sun shines on his breast : the serpent, lotus, and fl eur-de-lis, are above his head. The elephant head is yet more distinct at Uxmal, and there are many such fi gures in Yukat ā n, while we have also the “ elephant mound ” of Wisconsin, and stone pipes in Iowa of elephant form. In the town of Ocosingo, near Palenque, a winged globe over a doorway reca lls those of Asia (see Stevens, Yukatan , ii, p. 259 ; Vining, p. 130), and seems also to appear in a shattered sculpture at Palenque itself. Bancroft ( Native Races , ii, p. 782) has pointed out that the hieroglyphics of Palenque, and of ancient Mexico, appear to be analogous to the Chinese system of com- pound emblems arranged in vertical lines. Pales. See Pal. The Roman god of fl ocks and shepherds who, like many primitive deities, is both male and female. The rites of the Palilia (see Agonalia) were established by Numa, and began with lustrations or baptisms, including the leaping through fi res. On the 15 th April, at the Fordicalia, a cow in calf was sacri fi ced to Pales—the god of “ production ”—the calf being savagely cut out of the cow, and its ashes preserved by the chief Vest al till the 21st, when they were mixed with the blood of a horse, and bean ashes, burnt straw, and bean shells (see Beans) being used for puri fi cations(see Heifer).

Strictly speaking the land of the Philistim, or “ migrants ”—the Allophuloi of the Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Scriptures (see Kaptor ). The word is used as apply- ing to Philistia, or the S.W. plain, in a kuneiform text (see Deut. ii, 23 : Jer. xlvii, 4 : Amos, ix, 7). The Philistines bear Semitic names in the Amarna correspondence, and in the records of Sennacherib and of later Assyrian kings—that is between 1500 and 700 B . C .—and they adored the Babylonian and Phœnician god Dagon. The Philistine king in Genesis also bears the Se mitic name Abi-melek ; they were “ uncircumcised,” but may still have been of Semitic race. Like the Phœnicians they were, evidently traders and builders as well as agriculturists (Judg. xv, 5) ; but they retained an ancient Mongol superstition as to treading on th e threshold (see Dagon). The Greek translators believed them to have co me from Kappadokia ; and in Genesis (x, 14) they are connected with certain tribes in or near Egypt. They adored ’Ashtoreth, Derketo, and Ba’a l-Zebub, who were Semitic deities. P ā li. The language of the M ā gadha empire about 250 B . C . (see India). It was akin to Sanskrit (see Indian Antiq ., July 1882 ; Bengal Rl. Asiatic Socty. Journal , August 1882), and it is believed to have been the tongue spoke by Buddha in the 6th century B . C ., thus becoming the sacred language of Buddhism, and being carried to Ceylon in the 3rd century B . C . It has still a literary life even in Barmah and Siam, though no longer a spoken tongue.

It is traditionally said to have been worn by Linus the successor of St Peter, in an age when the cloak was the emblem of the Stoik ; but the later ecclesiastical garment, known as the “ pallium ” or “ pall,” became a mere strip of white wool, adorned with purple crosses and passed over the head. The Popes began to bestow a “ pallium ” on bishops appointed by the emperor as early as 500 A . C ., in token of recognition by the metro- politan ; but in 742 Pope Zacharias insisted that all German metropolitans must receive it from Rome, and the matter was con- sidered important by Nicholas I (858-867), and at the Synod of Ravenna (877) : this led to the great quarrel with the empire, when Pope Hildebrand in 1077 established spiritual supremacy ; and the Emperor Henry V renounced the right of investing bishops even with the ring and crozier in 1122, though their temporalities were still to be held from the secular ruler (see Agnes). The greatest im- portance is still attached to the Pallium as the symbol of obedience to the Pope. The woollen vestment is laid on the altar (in St Peter’s), of the crypt where the saint is supposed to be buried. It is blessed by the Pope ; and no metropolitan can ordain a priest, consecrate a bishop, or dedicate a church, till he has received it from Rome. He may not wear it outside his cathedral, save when Mass is said in the open. It is buried with him, or if he dies without burial it must be either buried or burned. Palladium. The protecting Ægis of Athene, represented on an early statue as her cloak or robe, which she holds out. She bears the spear in her right hand ; and the Pelopidæ said that their Palladium was the “ stiff bone ” of Pelops (see Bones), which (see Faber, Cabiri , i, pp. 346,410), gives a phallic mean ing to the emblem.

Prof. Benfey, in the intr oduction to his translation, says that it was “ originally a Buddhist work,” derived apparently from the 550 J ā taka (or “ birth ”) vicissitudes of the Buddha in former lives. These, according to Dr Rhys Davids (S ā takattha-vanan ā , “ birth- stories ”), reached Greece on the re turn of Alexander’s companions from India, about 300 B . C . (see Esop). Prof. Dowson believed the Sanskrit Pancha-tantra, as we now have it, to be a compilation by a Br ā hman—Vishnu-Sarman—about the end of our 5th century, and this to be the origin of the edition known as the Hitopadesa. Max Müller gives a very complete tabula r account of these works, and of their translations ( Chips , iv, p. 171), all the western versions being due to Khosru-Nushirw ā n, king of Persia, who sent his physician to India for the Pancha-tftntra, which he had translated into P ā hlavi between 531 and 579 A . C . This again was rendered into Syriak, and in 754-775 into Arabic, whence came, in 1080, the Greek version of Simeon Seth, and the Persian of Nas ̣ r-Allah, in 1118-1153. Other editions of the 13th century contain additional tales from various sources. The Sanskrit Badapa became Bidpai, Bilpay, and the French Pilpay in La Fontaine’s translation of 1668, which includes many variants and fi lls six volumes. The Arabic translation from the P ā hlavi, by ’Abdallah ibn el Mokaffa (about 750 A .

Mr Sen ā thi R ā ja ( Journal Rl.

A Pandya king (Sundara) at Madura is said to have impaled 8000 Jains ; and similar Pandyan persecution of Buddhists at this capital was going on when Hiuen- tsang was at Kanchi in 639 A . C . It was perhaps to these ancient non-Aryans that the story of the Pandus in the Mah ā -bh ā rata origin- ally referred. P ā nini. The fi rst great Sanskrit grammarian, whose date is important for the study of Vedik literature. Goldstüker says that he “ lived not later than 700 B . C .” ; but others say 500 or 400 B . C . Dr Bhandarkar (1884-1886) follows Yaska, author of the 1st Nirukta, or gloss on the Vedas, in giving 700 to 800 B . C . ( Indian Antiq ., May 1886). Dr Dhruva ( Bombay Anthrop. Socy. Journal , iv, 3 and 4) says that “ P ā nini seems to have known Sakalya, the only authority in Vedic literature that has been mentioned by name in the Aitareya Br ā hmana ” (a work not later than 700 B . C .) : he also says that Panini and Valmiki (the author of the Ram ā yana) “ belonged to the Vats ” (see Bhrigus, of whom they were a branch), and the in fl uence of the Bhrigus—according to Max Muller—is seen about 600 B . C . in comment on the Atharva Veda. The earliest commentator on P ā nini is probably Katyayana, who lived under the Nandas dethroned in 315 B . C . But P ā nini himself speaks of foreign Yava ā ani (or Ionian) alphabets (Max Müller). Mr Grierson ( Indian Antiq ., Aug. 1893) says that he must have lived befo re Gotama Buddha, but at a time when Sanskrit was known only to the learned. Dr Liebich says that : “ he taught the language known in India in his own time—in syntax practically identical with the Br ā hmanas and Sutras, and in grammar differing only from the former in the absence of a few ancient forms— noted by him as Vedic peculiarities.” The language of the Aitareya Br ā hmanas is older, that of the Bhag avad Gita later, and that of the Grihya-Sutras nearest to that of P ā nini. The fi xation of the fi rst of these would therefore indicate the earliest possible date for his writings. Dr Max Müller can fi nd no evidence of the use of writing in P ā nini's time ( Sanskrit Lit ., p. 311), but Goldstüker and others urge that his detailed criticism of word s, and of grammar, would have"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Panj ā b 77 been impossible in the absence of wr iting. [If therefore writing only came to India about 600 B . C . this would limit P ā nini to between 600 and 320 B . C .—E D .] The prevalence of the P ā li before 250 B .

India, which still bears witness, by its city mounds, to the numerous civilisations succeeding each other as new invaders came in from Baktria. Mounds above mounds are found at the favourite sites, round which towns still cluster by old wells where half the tribes of Asia have drunk, fought, and died. These mounds are often very extensive, that at Agroha (13 miles N.E. of Hiscar) covering 620 acres, and being 50 ft. high, while near Rohtak the Thehs , or “ mounds,” cover a square mile. After the Persians and. Greeks came swarms of Iatii, Xanthii, and others, according to Strabo, Ptolemy, and Pliny (see India), repre- senting a mingled Aryo-Turanian population. Three- fi fths of the inhabitants now speak Panj ā bi, which is as near to Hindi as Dutch to Flemish, the Hindi being spoken by only 2 millions in the Panj ā b, though by 50 millions in India generally. In the E. Panj ā b it is called the Brij-b ā sha, and the common Wid ū is the “ lingua Franca,” which is of Persian origin coming in with the Mah invasion, while the Pushtu is spoken near the Afgh ā n frontier, being also an Iranian Aryan dialect. Other dialects include the Mult ā ni, Pah ā ri, and Bagri. Some 15 millions speak Panj ā bi, but the Panj ā b literature includes ten languages. Of the 15 millions only 6 per cent. could read and write in 1881; and only 1 2 1 per cent. were under instruction. The oldest Hindi book in the Panj ā b is one by Chand Bardai of Lahore, about 1200 A . C ., and the earliest specimen of Panj ā bi is a life of Nanak (see Sikhs) about 1539 to 1552. But some 400 works in Urdu issue annually from the press, and the history of Yusufzai, by Sheikh Mali, was written in Pushtu in 1417 A . C . The Panj ā b is larger than Prussia, with a population of 25 millions, of whom eleven- twelfths are Sikhs, and the remainder Moslems and Hindus, by religion. There are 300 tribes and castes, th e bulk of the population being J ā ts—akin to the Gipsies. The herdsmen are Gujars from E. Tartary, mingled with T ā jiks, and Mughal descendants of Baber’s soldiers.

Pantainos. Pantæenus. The supposed preceptor of Clement of Alexandria, who began to teach before 180 A . C ., and fl ed with Clement, from Alexandria to Palestine, during the persecution by Septimius Severus in 202 A . C . According to Jerome Pantænus, while a missionary to India (or the East), found a gospel in Hebrew which had been used by St Bartholomew. Eusebius speaks of the writings of this Pantænus, but none of th em remain. The Roman Church has given him the 7th of July as his saint’s day. Panth. Sanskrit : one of the titles of the Saktis, or female principles (see Sakti). Pantheism. The doctrine of “ God in all things ” ; called also Ā kosmism (“ no Kosmos ”) : it is “ the shelter into which many philosophic minds have retired from the anthropomorphic and anthropo- pathetic (or rudely objective) religio ns of their day.” Spinoza, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, were true Pant heists ; yet Spinoza was called by Schleiermacher “ a god-intoxicate d man.” Spinoza’s God was omni- present, in fi nite, indivisible, self-existent substance ; visible in all forms and energies of nature. A spiritual and highly religious Pantheism was what he thus taught ; a God seen in all his works yet, as being thus identi fi ed with the universe of matter, said to be denied as personal. Anaximander of Miletos (610 to 547 B . C .) was the early Greek repre- sentative of material Pantheism; and the Y ō ga philosophy of India, about the 1st century A . C . (see Bhagav ā d-Gita) represents a spiritual Pantheism, which declares the material world to be Maya or “ illusion ” —the image in the mirror—man’s tr ue aim being to attain, through contemplation, an absorption into the in fi nite. Xenophanes (about 530 B . C .) founded the Eleatik school, and opposed the materialism of Anaximander. He saw intelligence and unity in nature, and so in- ferred the unity, but not the personalit y, of God. His phrase “ from nothing nothing comes ” was a motto for his followers ; but he was opposed by H ē rakleitos of Ephesus (500 B . C .), who is called the “ weeping philosopher,” and who argu ed that the All only attained to consciousness in man, not being sel f-existent, but absorbed (or latent) in matter ; whereas the Eleatiks held that matter was absorbed in God—or a mere appearance of a di vine reality. They were thus Theists, whose spiritual Pantheism survived in the neo-Platonism of Alexandria. [It was apparently the belief not only of Jewish philo-"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Pantheism 79 sophers but of Paul also (Acts xv ii, 28; Ephes. iv, 6), though con- demned by other Christians.—E D .] From this belief developed the theory of emanations, which took shap e in Gnostik systems, and in the Jewish K ̣ abbala. It was taught by Plotinus, Proclus, and Iamblichus ; and Christianity inherited the idea, though the voice was drowned by ignorant clamour, till thraldom became insupportable, and it once more pleaded for hearing in the 13th century, when a few here and there began to say that the Bible speaks of a God who is “ in all,” and who “ is Love ” ; in whom man can dwell, and God in man. This was enlarged upon later by Giordano Bruno (about 1600 B . C .), but he was burned alive, and silence fell on the Churches till Spinoza began to write. Pantheism is now more genera lly accepted as taught by Hegel, to whom God is most clearly manifest in man, but also in lower animals, in plants, and rocks, and everywhere in nature. “ Providence,” Renan wrote in 1877, “ is no other than the immutable, divine, most wise, just, and bene fi cent order of the laws of the universe . . . nature is an appearance, man a phenomenon . . . there is an eternal foundation, the in fi nite, the absolute, the ideal. . . . It is not reason but sentiment (feeling) that determines God. . . . Prayer to such an ideal can be only a mystic hymn . . . nature has arranged all, and has loaded the dice.” Thus the Theist touches th e borders of Pantheism ; he allows the God in all, though he would also desire to maintain a God outside all. Christians inclined to the ol d Pantheism of pagan philosophy, when speculation was not silenced by priest s : for many have felt that there is no escape from such belief if God is to be described as “ substance,” omnipresent and omniscient. Theism has been described as “ theology abhorring a vacuum ” ; but it is merged in the belief that “ God is in all ” ; or, as the old Pantheists expressed it, that “ all is in God ” ; while others said “ He is the All,” using capitals such as H ē rakleitos would willingly have adopted 2400 years ago, or Br ā hmans and Buddhists even earlier. A revi ewer of the Rev. Dr Hunt ( Pantheism and Christianity ) compares the distinction of Theism and Pantheism to the Roman dogma of Transubstantiation as contrasted with the Consubstantiation of Luther. “ Pantheism,” says Dr Hunt, “ is found invariably to be the ultimate utterance of reason on God, and on His relation to Nature.” Though he pleads for the use of capitals he gives up practically the idea of a personal God apart from the universe, yet illogically retains the idea of free-will. But of a God beyond the known and perceptible we can of course know nothing. “ In antiquity,” said the pious Theist, Francis Newman, in 1872 ( Miscellanies , ii, p. 205, published in 1887), “ the only school of thought, known to us, which understood the real magnitude of the"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Pantheism 80 universe, was practically A-theistic.” He refers to Demokritos and Epikouros ; but there was nothing moral in their allusions to “ mag- nitude and grandeur.” Some of the neo-Platonists strove to introduce a spiritual mysticism into Stoik ethiks, and some upheld the older Pantheism. The real home of Pant heism, as this writer perceives, was India, “ where it was taught that the Eternal In fi nite Being creates by self-evolution, whereby he become s, and is, all existence : that he alternately expands, and—as it we re—contracts himself, reabsorbing into himself the things created. Thus the Universe, Matter and its Laws are all modes of Divine existenc e. Each living thing is a part of God, each soul is a drop out of the divine ocean; and, as Virgil has it, the soul of a bee is ‘ divinæ particula auræ.’ ” [But it is dif fi - cult to understand what is meant by “ himself,” or by an “ ocean ” which is not a substance, yet consis ting of drops. This theory still vaguely maintains a personality, and does not merely teach the unending re-arrangement of the atoms.—E D .] Such was the conception of Jove in the Orphik hymns (Thos. Taylor, Hymns , p. 95). “ Hence with the universe great Jove contains The ether bright, and heaven's exalted plains The extended restless sea, and earth renowned. Ocean immense, and Tartarus profound, Fountains and rivers, and the boundless main With all that Nature's ample realms contain, And gods and godesses of each degree. All that is past, and all that e’er shall be Occultly, and in fair connection, lies In Jove’s wide womb—the ruler of the skies.” ” In Jove the male and female forms combine, For Jove’s a man, and yet a maid di vine.” “ Jove’s is the breath of all. His wondrous frame Lives in the rage of ever restless fl ame. Jove is the sea’s strong root, the solar light, And Jove’s the moon, fair regent of the right, And in Jove’s royal body all things lie, Fire, night, and day, earth, water, and the sky.” This fully elaborated Pantheism is the same that we fi nd detailed in the Bhagav ā d-gita, and in the “ Laws of Vishnu,” in India. The Deity is not conceived as corporeal and divisible, but rather as being all things, present everywhere and totally, with each being, though in different gradations of being; yet himself separate and apart from all—“ the source of multitude, yet himself perfect unity ” : which doctrine is about as incompre hensible, by a logical mind, as any Athanasian creed—as is inevitable when the thinker starts with the"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"P ā p ā 81 assumption of a being apart—a “ divi ne unity,” who is not a material being at all, and of whom we know nothing, because he “ is incom- prehensible ” in our modern meaning of the word. Pantheism so explained relapsed into the old Polytheism, which men could better understand—the observation of phenomena, without any attempt to connect them as a whole ; or among the few into Theism—the idea that a creator made a great machine, worked by forces such as gravitation, attraction, repulsion, or heat ; and that he left it to work by itself—except when at time s he interfered with its action. Thus the Vedantists said : “ Thou sittest aloof, not interested, nor moving, The ever-cold, impassive beholder of unalterable Law, Calm and solitary in thine unembodied unity, A something yet nothing, real only as the cause of all, Yet unreal because existing not as a Being, Untrue because without essence; th ough existing in thy Power, A part of thine imperishable soul embodied in Illusion. Thou art moisture in water: the light in the sun: The sweet scent of the fl ower; the harmony of the spheres.” So with stammering lips men endeav oured to picture an “ embodied illusion,” not perceiving with Anaxagoras “ that nothing comes from nothing ” ; or they conceived of a god who looked on what he had made without any anxiety about it, not rejoicing in his works as “ very good,” nor destroying them in anger. They came naturally to regard him (or it) as a “ something yet nothing ”—a great in- comprehensible, existing in dark solitude for a vast eternity, then suddenly—at intervals when Brahm wakes—creating a world or an universe. They forgot that they thus made him no longer an immut- able godhead, because one who thinks and improves : as when matter issues from chaos. The vague ideas which found full expression in Plato were opposed by the logical mind of Aristotle, as Christian vague mysticism is now rejected by the Monist. Francis Newman says : “ Whatever matter may be, it seems to follow that it is co- eternal with God . . . so that what we call Nature is inextricably interwoven with God.” He even admits that during the last century “ the pendulum of Theistic thought has oscillated very decidedly towards Pantheism.” More and more is knowledge seen to begin and end with natural phenomena ; and he allows that it must not be sacri- fi ced to any “ speculations about God.” P ā p ā .

An Apollo Opaon is here noticed in “ many inscriptions ” reading Opaoni Milanthio , after the name of a neighbouring village. Aphro- dite was called Paphia after this sh rine. New Paphos was in a fertile plain 10 miles inland of Old Paphos, which had a harbour at the mouth of the river Bokaros; it is now called Baffo. Greek statues in Cyprus often carry the dove of Aphrodit ē in their hands, at Paphos and elsewhere. Papias. This early Christian authority is known to us only through Eusebius “ the maker of history.” He is said to have been imprisoned at Rome about 160 or 168 A . C ., having been a bishop at Pergamum about 163 A . C ., and before that at Heirapolis, on the bor- ders of Phrygia, from 100 or 110 A . C . Irenæus, who was his pupil, calls him a “ saintly old man,” and Eusebius “ a hearer of John and an associate of Polycarp,” but also “ a man of small understanding . . . unversed in the Scriptures.” The Paschal’ Chronicle says that he was martyred at Pergamum in either 163 or 156 A . C .; but this is a yet later authority than Eusebius. A few quotations of his sayings alone remain. He is said to have stated : “ If I found some who had followed the fi rst presbyters I asked : what said Andrew, or Peter, or Philip, James, or Matthew and John, who were the Lord's disciples ? . . . I thought I could not derive as much advantage from books as from the living and abiding oral tradition.” But the results do not appear to have been satisfactory to later theologians like Eusebius."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Papuans 83 His famous lost work, An Exegesis of the Lord's Sayings (or Logia ), appears to have consisted of fi ve books ; and he is quoted as an authority regarding the writings of Matthew and Mark (see those headings), and refers to “ John th e Elder ” (see 2 John, verse 1). The Rev. Dr S. Davidson ( New Testament Canon ) says however that : “ Papias knew of no inspired Gospels.” He was mainly intent on the expected return of Christ, and on the millennium ; and pictured heaven as “ a pleasant place where we should eat and drink and enjoy our- selves forever.” He is made resp onsible for statements that John and James were killed by the Jews, and that those who rose at the cruci- fi xion lived till the time of Hadrian (or for over 100 years), while Barnabas the Just was forced to drink the poison of an adder—which would not have done him any harm —but was preserved by repeating the name of Christ. It is possible that Papias may have been born in 85 A . C ., and have perished in 163 A . C .; but it is unlikely that he could have known John, the disciple of Christ, as “ John the Elder ” (or presbyter) ; and the later a ccounts of this early witness are rendered untrustworthy by the garbled text of the Christian patristic literature. Papuans.

They warred with the Vrishna-vants, or sons of Varsha the rain god, with the Nahusha or serpent tribes, and with the Turvashu on the river Jamuna near Mathura (Mr Hewitt, Westminster Review , Septr. 1898, p. 27) : they were N ā gas, sons of the great snake to whom Kutsa was the divine priest of Indra, whose image (Maspero, Anct. Egt ., p. 316) was on the banners of Parthian cavalry ; and Mr Hewitt believes them to have been Parthians from near the Caspian Sea. Hindus believed them to be descendants of Pandu and of Parth ā or Prithi (“ mother earth ”), and “ descendants of the sun horse.” [Thus the term may mean on ly “ inhabitants,” unless it be a softened form of Patsu “ Persian.”—E D .] The Parthians fi rst appear in the 3rd century B .

The feast of Mas ̣ s ̣ oth (see Mass), or unleavened cakes, lasted from the 14th to the 21st of the fi rst month (Abib, or Nisan), begi nning, roughly speaking, about the 1st of April. The Passover was eaten on the eve of the 14th of Nisan. Colenso remarks ( Pent ., vi) that the Passover is never mentioned by any of the Hebrew prophets before the captivity, and they never allude to the story of its institution in Egypt; as dis- tinguished from the Mas ̣ s ̣ oth feast it fi rst appears historically in the account of Josiah’s reformation, about 620 B . C . (2 Kings xxiii, 22, 23) being then said to have been long in abeyance. [According to 2 Chron. xxx, 13, 15, however, bo th Passover and the feast of Mas ̣ s ̣ oth were celebrated by Hezekiah also.—E D .] The Passover was, and remains, a family feast, celebrat ed at bome, and not in the Temple. After the destruction of the temple the lamb was no longer eaten, but only bitter herbs, and sour sauce, with the unleavened bread. The shank bone of the lamb is placed on a plate to represent the victim. About the time of Christ the “ cup of blessing ” had become part of the rite (Mishnah Pesakhim), though not mentioned in the Old Testament. The Jews now sit during the symbolic meal, and even recline at ease, saying that this sy mbolises the fact that they reached “ the rest and the inheritance ” ; but the Samaritans, on Mt. Gerizim near Shechem, eat the roast lamb as of old with loins girded and staff in hand. The connection of the Passover with the slaughter of the fi rst born in Egypt may have given rise to the calumnious “ blood accusation,” still made .against the Jews by Christians, and traceable back to the Middle Ages. According to this accusation they were in the habit of annually killing a Christian child, to mix its blood with the unleavened cakes.

We only know of him from monkish legends of the 8th century (see Academy , June, July 1888). The Roman Church acknowledged him as a lowlander of North Britain, born about 372 or 387 A . C ., near Nempthur, or Banavan in Tabernia—now Dumbarton. His father was Calphurnius : his mother Otide, or Conchessa, was a sister of the French saint Martin of Tours, by whom he is said to have been ordained a deacon ; and his father is called the grandson of th e deacon Odesse, or Potitus.

He was captured by Irish pirates, and taken to Ireland as a slave. He was afte rwards, according to some accounts, sent as a missionary by the Pope (o r more probably by the Church of Gaul), reaching County Down in 432, and Armagh in 444. In 447 he was in Britain ; in 448 at Cashel ; in 455 he resigned the bishopric of Armagh, and visited Rome in 461.

The ablest of the founders of Christianity, well called the “ Apostle to the Gentiles,” without whom the faith of Christ would, perhaps, never have spread beyond J udea and Galilee, and would certainly never have beco me an “ universal religion ” : it would have died away, as did the E ssenes, and many other local sects in Syria. Paul made it wider, and imported into it some of the ideas of Greek philosophy, as studied by educated Jews like Philo and Josephus, unknown to the Galilean disciples who followed Peter the fi sherman. They spoke only of the divine Messiah, a son of David, born of a woman, who was cruci fi ed, buried, and came to life again, and whose immediate return they expected ; and of God as the God of Christ, and the father of all who believed. Paul, when he accepted all this, proclaimed Christ to be also the pre-existent Logos, or “ reason ” of God, whom he had seen in vision (1 Cor. xv, 8), or in ecstacy when caught up to the third heaven (2 Cor. xii, 2-4)—the perfect man who, by obedience, obtained favour with God, and thus pardon for sinners ; who instituted a memorial rite ; and who will come in spiritual form to reign over saints in spiritual bodies. [He also uses such words as Ai ō n and Dunamis , much as did the later Gnostiks ; and says that Jesus was “ cruci fi ed through weakness ” ; and that the Gentiles, no less than the Jews, are “ sons of God,” if they believe this gospel.

Yet he tells us that he took no steps to verify the great assumption, on which all his after career was based, and claims that he was divinely inspired to preach what was revealed to him—only meeting Peter and James three years later, and fourt een years afterwards going back to Jerusalem to tell these two disciples, and John, what he was preach- ing (Gal. i, 12-24 ; ii, 1-14), and ev en opposing Peter at Antioch : “ For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught, save by the revelation of Jesus the Messiah.” To Paul it could make little difference whether Jesus rose in a fl eshly or a spiritual body, but he certainly believed that in future al 1 were to possess some subtle and ethereal frame like Christ (1 Thess. iv, 15, 17 ; 1 Cor. xv, 42-57). His dif fi culty as to the “ Law ” which separated him from the Gentiles was very simply solved, by supposing that since all was ful fi lled, by the appearance of the Messiah, it was no longer binding (Gal. iii, 19). He felt that what he had to do was to reconcile Jewish legends and beliefs with Greek thought, an d to instruct absent followers, and inquirers, by his epistles : for he knew that in education he stood high above the original peasant di sciples of his new master. Many writings that were not Paul’s are believed to have been fathered on him (see Hebrews, Epistl e of). The so-called “ Pastoral ” epistles (to Timothy, Titus, and Philemon) are especially doubted as “ Deutero-Pauline.” We can indeed hardly call either Paul himself, or Christ, or the apostles, truly historical fi gures ; yet we have in the epistles, however uncertain we may be as to date and authorship, a record of early beliefs as to Jesus cruci fi ed at the Passover—a per- secuted Messiah, who, in Jewish estimation, must be of the seed of David, and who was expected to appear again within the lifetime of his disciples, and of Paul. The Ju dean converts, in his time, were content to add the new faith to the old : for in rites and worship they still thought of themselves as Jews. Baptism, and the Passover supper, were old Jewish customs, an d a bodily ascent to heaven was quite credible to those who lived in an atmosphere of apparitions and inspirations. Legends and traditions were real history to them, and scepticism as to these was blasphemy. It required the destruction of their temple and priesthood to em ancipate the masses, and to widen their faith into love of goodness and righteousness, independent of rites and sacri fi ces.

Irenæus, of whose actual teaching we know so little (see Irenæus), appears to have believed that Christ lived to the age of 50 years, thus experiencing all the trials of youth, manhood, and later years. If so, he would be cruci fi ed some 24 years before the fall of Jerusalem, and Stephen would have been martyred about 50 A . C . Paul’s con- version happened shortly after, and he must have preached for nearly 15 years, being fi nally killed under Nero according to general belief. Scholars of the school of Baur do not believe that he wrote all the 13 epistles attributed to his pen, but admit those to the Galatians, Corinthians, and Romans. It is clear that—as in the case of the Gospels—these have been “ harmonised ” by the alteration of words and phrases which later scribes thou ght it necessary to amend, in accordance with the prevailing views of Christians from the 3rd to the 5th century A . C . The Gnostik character of Paul’s teaching is, however, still visible in many passa ges, as when he tells the Corin- thians : “ We speak wisdom among them that are perfect ” (1 Cor. ii, 6). “ Though we have known Christ after the fl esh, yet now benceforth know we him no more. Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature ” (2 Cor. v, 16, 17) : for they are “ in the spirit ” (Gal. iii, 3), and the Hebrew legends are “ allegories ” (iv, 24). The real Christ “ born in us ” was, he thought, in each—a spirit or phantom Christ. Yet if Paul be the writer to Timothy, he does not speak of Jesus as divine. He invokes “ God, the Saviour of us, and of the Lord Jesus the Messiah ” (1 Tim. i, 1) : “ For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus ” (ii, 5). None are justi fi ed by the law (Rom. iii, 20), but are freed by Christ from its curse (Gal. iii, 13). We may believe that the early conversions at Antioch were due to Paul : the inhabitants were no t Jews, and in Judea the converts took much longer to cast off the honoured Jewish name, clinging to their Sabbaths and circumcision. The Passover became the “ Lord’s Supper,” but it retained its old sacramental character; even in Paul’s time the “ love feasts ” of the Gent ile converts were, on the other hand, the cause of many scandals (1 Co r. xi, 18-22), degenerating into communistic Agapæ. Paul, through his education, was fi tted to proclaim a Christianity which cultured Greeks might fi nd less dif fi culty in accepting ; and to the Gentile masses the marvels asserted were"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Pavaka 97 quite credible. But Paul rashly based his faith and hopes of the future on what was mere delusion—that Jesus when killed, and buried, rose on the third day to talk and walk with disciples in Judea and Galilee (1 Cor. xv, 4-7). He accept ed current reports of excited and credulous disciples, as proof that Jesus would “ return to judge the world,” for : “ If Christ be not raised your faith is vain ” (I Cor. xv, 17), yet Paul was ready to believe long before he had asked any of the older Apostles what they knew. He, like them, was a fi rm believer in supernatural agencies, phantoms , and spirits ; but we have no record that anyone who knew Christ saw him rise, or saw him at the tomb, unless we accept the later a ccounts about the poor hysterical Magdalene, who had believed herself possessed by seven devils : even she did not recognise him (John xx, 14), and according to Mark (xvi, 1 and 8) she could not have seen him at all, though the later addition (not in old MSS.) makes Jesus to appear to her fi rst (verse 9). To this witness Paul never alludes. Paul was better educated than most Hebrews, but still he scoffs at the learning of the Greeks (1 Cor. iii, 19 : 1 Tim. vi, 20), in texts which have done in fi nite harm, and which still cause much misery even to-day. He taught young converts that “ whatever is not of faith is sin ” ; that, like himself, they must believe, without evidence, all that popes or pastors might teach : for failing this, no matter how good might bc their lives, they were sinners before God, fi t only for eternal torment in hell, and not attaining to that immortality which Paul seems to have regarded as conditional (see Immortality). So greatly is he impressed with the idea of the immediate end of the world that he thinks there is no time for them to marry (1 Cor. vii, 26) : they ha d better remain like himself, content to become an itinerant preaching carpet-maker barely able to live. They should love their wives if they had any (Ephes. v, 28-33), for marriage is the mystical symbol of Christ and the Church, but women must remain in subjection (1 Tim. ii, 11), and never venture to speak in public (1 Cor. xiv, 34). Paul proclaimed the duty of submission to all authority, civil or religious, and forbade men to speak evil of any one : he believed that a good time was ju st about to dawn when Christians, caught up into the air, would reig n for ever with Christ.

C ., as Ta ō s for “ peacock.” In Tamil Togai is “ the crested one.” The Greeks considered Samos to be the home of this bird, whic h was the “ bird of Juno ” to Romans, represented at her feet as early as 250 B . C . The peacock, owl, and eagle, form a triad repres enting Juno, Minerva, and Jove. Sir George Birdwood thinks that the Phœnix was the peacock. The Persian “ peacock throne ” spread E. and W., and in a Roman zodiak the bird stands for Aquarius, and thus for the month of weddings in January and February—the Gam ē lion month sacred to H ē r ē .

C .) persecuted by the Catholic Church. He was a Welshman whose real name was Morgan, born at Bangor, and probably going to Rome with the retreating Roman legions about 400 A . C . The name Morgan became Marigena, or “ sea born,” rendered in Greek Pelagios, or “ mariner.” He became an earnest itinerant preacher, never apparently submitting to the bondage of priestly ordinati on, but discoursing boldly on what he thought good and reasonable, not avoiding fundamental dogmas, and seeking to explain the rites of the Church. St Augustine, whose views dominated the churches of Africa, at fi rst spoke with respect of Pelagius as a sincere Christian ; but Jerome abused and calumni- ated him. Rome began to persecut e him, and he left the city in 409 with his pious friend Cælestius, to go to Sicily and Africa, where he taught at Hippo and at Carthage, there meeting Augustine who was busy in opposing the Donatists. The saint turned his in fl uence against Pelagius and Cælestius, being alarmed at their ideas about original sin. Pelagius taught : (1) that Adam was born mortal, and that any sin of his consequently could not a ffect the rest of mankind who were naturally mortal and not doomed to die for Adam’s transgression, which had nothing to do with death : (2) that infants are born as innocent of sin as Adam was, and need no bap tism to remove any original sin : (3) that men lived sinless lives before Christ’s coming as well as after : (4) that Christ's resurrection had nothing to do with Adam’s fall, or with the resurrection of mankind : (5) that the effect of the ancient Law was the same as that of the Gospel, in the time before Christ had come : (6) that human nature could guide us in the path of goodness of heart and of life : (7) that God has given us free-will, but guides us in the choice of good : (9) and that herein lies the grace (or kindness) of God. Such views Pelagius eagerly preached in Africa and Palestine, but he disappears about 418 A . C . Pope Zosimus, and many reasonable Christians, long supported his views, but Zosimus at length gave way to the zeal of Augustine’s party, and condemned Pelagius, who quoted"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Pelasgi 100 Scripture in vain, saying that Ab raham was bidden to walk before God and be perfect, and that man ev idently could be without sin, for Zacharias and Elisabeth (parents of John the Baptist) were “ blame- less ” in regard to the Law and ordinances. Such quotations did not fi t the doctrines of the Church, and Pelagius was denounced as seeking to deny the need of grace, trusting to works and to morality rather than to faith—an attitude always hateful to priests. The Council of Ephesus, in 431 A . C ., condemned alike the moderate doctrines of Nestorius, and of Pelagius. Augustine had just died, and the Council was dominated by the fi erce Cyril of Alexandria, who “ represented man as morally dead, and semi-Pelag ians as morally sick.” We how- ever do not know exactly what he was teaching except from his Commentary on Paul’s Epistles, and a letter to Demetrius. His Oonfession of Faith had been already condemned by Pope Innocent in 417 A . C ., though Zosimus his successo r hesitated to pronounce judgment. Pelagius said that it was absurd to suppose that man propagates a sinful soul in his ch ild, for our souls come direct from God : thus he made God responsible for every act of man. He steered clear of the increasing belief in the dogma of Predestination ; and in this also he was out of harmony with the Catholic Church (see Smith’s Dict. of Christian Biog .). Pelasgi. An ancient people on the coasts, and in the islands, of the Mediterranean, as to whom we know just as little as did Dionusios of Hali, who laboriously investigated the subject, and could only say that they were autokhth ō noi or “ natives ” throughout Greece, penetrating later into the Peloponne sos, where—says Plutarch—“ they were like the oak among trees : the fi rst of men at least in Akhaia.” Pliny says that Arkadia (in the Pe loponnesos) was called Pelasgis ; and that Pelasgos was a lordly titl e, and the people descended from the daughters of Danaos : like the Greeks they had been instructed in arts and religion by Egyptians. Th ey were found also in Ionia, in Krete, and in Italy, where they mingled with Etruskans, Ligurians, and other early tribes. D ō d ō na was a famons Pelasgik settlement, and Thucydides the historian tells us that all Hellas (or Greece) was Pelasgik before the Trojan war—or about 1200 B . C . As Leleges the Pelasgi fought at Tray, and Larissa was the mother city of the race. Homer speaks of the tribe (Il., ii, 840) and of “ divine ” Pelasgoi ( Odys ., xix, 172-7), and they seem to ha ve come from Asia Minor to the West. [See Danaos.

In the Kaura valley Heian was accompanied by 8 or 12 attendant deities, symbolised by rude stones swathed in white or yellow cloth ; and the people cut off their hair and offered it to her with sugarcane and fl owers (see Hair) : the sugarcane is cut in lengths of about 6 inches, as also on Indian altars which we have seen.

Greek : a dove, “ dusky ” or “ lead-colored ” ( pellos ) : the wild pigeon, or the rock dove, found in the oak groves of D ō d ō na, and identi fi ed with wood spirits, and priestesses (see Dove). Christians also held the dove. sacre d, and Russians even now rarely eat it (see Pelias). P ē leus. A hero educated on Mt. Pelion by Kheir ō n the Kentaur, like Akhilleus and other he roes, in the cave still shown. He was the son of Aiakos, king of the Murmidons, at Phtheia, in Thessaly. The heroes came to his marriage with Thetis a Nereid, or river spirit, also the daughter of Kheiron, and P ē leus waged war with H ē rakl ē s. He was tempted in his youth (like Joseph) by Astudameia, the wicked wife of Akastos, son of Pelias in Iolkos. As he slept, wearied by the chase, on Mt. P ē lion, Akastos stole his sword, leaving him a prey to wild beasts ; but Kheir ō n, in the guise of Hermes, restored it, or got one for him from Hephaistos ; and Peleus slew both Akastos and his wife. Kheir ō n also gave him a divine lance, and Thetis bore him Akhilleus, whom she tried to destroy by fi re, and by boiling water, as (according to one le gend) she had done to seven other children. She deserted Peleus, but when wolves devoured the fl ocks on Mt. P ē lion she changed them into stones.

In mythology this bird is an emblem of parental love, since it wounds its breast that its young may be nourished by its blood. The origin of the story seems to be found in the fact that a ruddy patch appears on the pelican's brea st in the breeding season ; which shows us the close observation of th e ancients (Blyth : see Buckland, Curiosities of Nat.

Gods of the household (see Lares), adopted by Romans from the Etruskans, the word being probably Etruskan for “ spirit.” Two Penates usually fl anked one Lars, being fi gures of men with spears, horns, rods, trumpe ts, etc. The later Romans placed the shrine, with its ever burning lamp, by the main door of the house. This was copied by Christians, who placed lamps before the pictures and images of saints, though Theodosius II forbade the practice after 400 A . C . The Penates were often shown in a dancing attitude, like some Indian images of gods. The group of three (above noticed) represented Ce res as the robed Venua, fl anked by Pales and Fortuna. But Dionysius says that the Penates had no fi xed form, but were made of wood, stone, or metal, in the form of spear heads, horns, or batons, being thus—in early days—only emblems of the penis or lingam, such as were common to all early races (see P ā la). It was said that Dardanos brought Penates from Samothrak ē (see Kabeiroi).

[Learned opinions differ greatly as to the age and composition of the Pentateuch, just as in other cases such as those of the Zend-Avesta, or of the Vedas ; the cause, as the author shows under the head Bible, being the absence of early documentary evidence. The Greek and the Samaritan versions, of the 4th and 6th centuries A . C ., agree with the Hebrew except in minor details, showing the text to be substantially that existing in the 3rd, 4th, and probably 5th centuries B . C . There is no documentary evidence that the Book of Joshua ever formed an integral part of the Torah, or Law ; and the Samari- tans, about 300 B . C ., or earlier, while adopting the whole Pentateuch rejected every other book of the Hebrew Scriptures. The critical opinions are based, to some extent, on the use of the divine names Eloh ī m and Jehovah. They assume the authority of our present Hebrew text ; for the occurrence of these names in the Greek trans- lation of the Pentateuch is quit e different. The Greek Septuagint follows the same order as the Hebrew, except in the case of a few chapters (Exod. xxxvi to xxxix), where paragraphs are placed in a different sequence. The translat ion, made at Alexandria about 250 B . C ., was evidently careful, and from a good text. Dif fi culties of a practical and archæological nature are also found by Orientalists in adopting the latest conclusions of Western students. Thus, for in- stance, it seems unlikely that an elaborate ritual would have been arranged when the temple was in ruins during the captivity ; and the law that all clean food was to be consecrated by slaying the beast before the door of the tabernacle could clearly not have been carried out except in a camp. It is modi fi ed in Deuteronomy to suit the conditions of dispersion over the conquered lands. The language of the Pentateuch is, throughout, that known from inscriptions to have been used before the captivity, and not the Hebrew of Ezra’s days. No Persian words occur, nor are Pe rsians ever mentioned in the Law. The inscriptions of Tell Loh ̣ and of Nippur have shown the high antiquity of priestly rites in Asia ; and, as regards the civil law of the Pentateuch, the antiquity of similar enactments has been proved by the great discovery at Susa (see H ̣ ammurabi).

There is no evidence that the Levitical laws were known in the age of the Judges, or even of the Kings, or were observed by the nation ; and there is much that points to the opposite conclusion, in the historical books from Judges to Kings. There was no one shrine for all; and sacri fi ces were offered at Sh echem, Shiloh, Bethel, Gibeon, Bethlehem, Kirjath-Jearim, Nob, Gilgal, and on Mt. Carmel (see Bamoth), at various times. The Ark, fi rst established in the sequestered site at Shiloh, was capt ured by Philistines, and migrated afterwards to Beth-Shemesh, an d to Kirjath-Jearim, while the tabernacle is said to have been at Gibeon. David established a sacred centre in his new capital, and So lomon built a,temple to which all Hebrews were commanded to pay yearly visits ; but such centralisation ceased pn his death. The growth of science is now demolishing theology, and such questions are becoming matters only of literary interest. Dr J. W. Draper ( Con fl ict Between Religion and Science , p. 225), remarks that : “ It is to be regretted that the Christian Church has burdened itself with the defence of these books. . . . Still more, it is deeply to be regretted that the Pentateuch, a pro- duction so imperfect as to be un able to stand the touch of modern criticism, should be, put forth as th e arbiter of science.” “ For her the volume of inspiration is the b ook of Nature, of which the open scroll is ever spread forth before the eyes of every man ” (p. 227). Educated Jews themselves (see Jewish World , 30th April 1886), admit that the Pentateuch “ is full of legendary and mythic lore ” ; and such apparently was the conviction of early Jewish scholars, like Philo and Josephus, when they explained the early stories as purely allegorical. Spinoza believed that the Pentateuch was founded on older materials such as the “ Wars of Jehovah,” which it quotes as authority. Ewald supposed it to have had seven authors, and Colenso at least four, and these scholars believed it to have been compiled between about 800 and 600 B .

The school of Athenian philosophers who “ walked about ” the cloisters of the Lukeion (or Lyceum), in converse with Aristotle and his successors. The place was originally a covered gymnasium adjoining the temple of Apollo Lukeios ; but about 340 B . C ., intellectual discussion took the plac e of physical training, when the liberality of his royal pupil, Alexand er the Great, enabled the father of science—once a druggist—to devo te himself to research and specu- lation concerning natural and philosophical questions. [Aristotle, according to Apollodoros (140 B . C .) was born in 384 B . C ., and studied under Plato for 20 years : he became embued with Platonic ideas, but his own mind was far more practical than that of his master, and his aim became science, knowledge, and the study of reason, rather than mystic speculation about the unknown. In 343 B . C . he was selected by Philip of Macedon, as the tutor of the. young Alexander ; and Aristotle’s in fl uence on history was thus far greater than that of Plato. He taught in the Lyceum for 15 years after 337 B . C ., and died at Chalcis in 322 B . C ., being then 63 years old. The MSS. of his works lay buried for 187 years and were brought to light again in 100 B . C . We have 19 works of acknowledged genuine character, besides two that are doubtful, to say nothing of 18 that are spurious. The most important of the undoubted works are the Nicomachian Ethics, the Politics, and the Metaphysics, with the Essay on the Soul. Aristotle criticised the impracticable Republic of Plato, and as a politician up- held monarchy. His treatise on th e soul is not psychological : he believed every animate being to possess an Entelelcheia or “ ex- pression ”—an intelligence, or vital pr inciple, not material ; yet in the Ethics (IX, vii) he seems to regard it as material since he speaks of it as “ small in size ” ; this soul he believed, like Plato, to be a part of God : for all Nature is pervaded by Reason ; and the form is suited to the purpose (a teaching in which we see the germ of evolution properly understood) ; but as to a God outside the universe the teach-"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Peripatetiks 106 ing of Aristotle is as obscure as that of Plato, though he regarded the Theos as the unmoved mover of all, intent on self meditation (see Pantheism). Reason, he said, is peculiar to man, and not shared by beasts : it is connected with the et ernal, and it is both active and passive (Ethics VI, xi) ; but the acti ve alone is indestructible. True pleasure, he believed, is satisfac tion, and is found mainly in con- templation and in intellectual activi ty. The will is free, and all sane men, unless invincibly ignorant or brutish, are absolutely responsible for their own acts. His ethics therefore inculcate the most severe doctrine of iron and unforgiving justice. These conclusions he does not attempt to prove, but assumes them to be generally evident and accepted. His love of natural history made him the founder of modern natural science ; and, above all philosophers, he is careful clearly to de fi ne the meaning of every word he uses, as far as it is possible for the human understanding to limit, and logically to make precise, each idea. His in fl uence on European thought, and perhaps on that of India also, has thus always been greater than that of any other thinker, since he is welcomed by men of science as well as by philosophers.—E D .] The great founder of the Peripatetiks agreed with Platonists, and Stoiks, that the wise man must stri ve for virtue and right life, which are pro fi table to himself as well as to ot hers. He strove to be scienti fi c in his ethiks, as well as in his pu rsuit of natural science, and these noble principles were long maintained by his disciples. Theophrastos, his immediate successor, taught in the Lyceum from 322 down to 288 B . C ., and Strato—called the “ Physicist ”—followed till 269 B . C ., being yet more intent on clinging to the material side of the teaching, and saying that he knew nothing about the in fi nite and transcendental, or about souls : matter he thought has in itself the energy suf fi cient to account for all the phenomena of the universe. He did not accept the atomic theories of Demokritos ; but he followed Aristotle in saying that heat and cold were prime movers of the world, while ascribing the Entelelcheia to faculties of sense perceptio n. But after Strato no great Peripatetik appeared ; and Roman co nquests, followed by the spread of Christianity, silenced for a time the voice of Greek philosophy. The Church became a mighty engine of state, but science suffered eclipse until it was again taken up by cultivated Moslems, and by learned Syrian Christians, and at last revolutionised European thought through its introduction into Italy and Spain during, and after, our 13th century.

Like the Indian Sita she is the emblem of the seed buried in earth, and springing up again from below. [The derivation of the word is very doubtful : the Greek may be from the Aryan roots Bhar “ to produce,” and Sap “ to dig ” or “ cut,” meaning the “ seed-furrow ” ; and the Latin from Bhar and Sarp which also means to “ cut,” so that, like Sita, she is the “ seed in the furrow.”—E D .] As the bride of the ruler of Hades, she became also the Juno Inferna, queen of the underworld, and punisher of the wicked. She is said to have eaten the pomegranate in hell, so as to be forever con- nected with the lower world-where her roots remain. The Arkadians called her Despoina or “ mistress,” and others Kor ē “ the girl,” or Persephassa [another form of the same roots Bhar , and Sap —E D .]. By eating the pomegranate, given to her by Pluto, she became the mother of Erinues. Each country showed the place where she was seized by the infernal deity, but th e most famous site was at Eleusis (see Eleusis). In Sicily the “ fi elds of Enna ” were those in which she sported, among spring fl owers, ere she was laid in earth ; and special rites of Proserpina accompanied the fi rst sowings and reapings of the year.

The frieze which represents deputations from all parts of the empire, bringing gifts on the New Year’s day, to the king, is 50 ft. long and about 4 feet high. Each deputation is divided from the next by a tree, and a Persian of fi cial holds the leader of each by the hand.

A valuable text of Xerxes, in Babylonian kuneiform, was excavated near the great stair- case leading from the palace of Darius to the S.E. palace. This runs much as follows : “ A great god is Ah ū ra-mazd ā who created the earth, who created the heaven, who created men, who bestowed honour on men ; who bestowed dominion on Xerxes, as the only one among many kings, the only one among many rulers.

The great platform of the principal palace is 1430 feet by 800 feet, rising above the plain of the Kurus stream : the great stair is 22 feet wide : the gates were fl anked by colossal winged bulls, as at Nineveh.

He shut up Danae his daughter in a brazen tower, but Zeus descended on her in a shower of gold, or golden light, and she bore Perseus. [This legend of the princess in the tower is widespread, and is found in an early mythical tale in Egypt.—E D .] Mother and child were set a fl oat in an ark (see Moses), which Zeus guided to the island of Seriphos, where it was found by a fi sherman whose brother, Poludekt ē s, was king of the place : from this king Danae suffered persecution, and Perseus was sent when he grew up on the hopeless errand of bringing the Gorgon’s head (see Gorgon), which was to be a love gift to Hippodameia. He visited the Graiai, sisters of the Gorgons, “ grey women ” who had only one tooth and one eye among the three, an d, by stealing these, learned where to go : he received, by aid of Ath ē n ē , the magic helmet which rendered him invisible, and the winged sandals of Hermes, with the sword Herp ē (“ the shearer ”), and the mirror-shield of the godess, in which he could see Med ū sa (the “ maddened ” moon , or mortal godess), whom to regard direct meant to be turned to stone. He was thus able to cut off her head, which he ke pt in a magic bag. He is repre- sented as riding on Pegasos the winged horse while so doing. With it he turned to stone Poludekt ē s, and others ; and also the sea monster that was about to devour Andromeda whom he married (see Andromeda) ; and fi nally he wounded his grandfather Akrisios in the heel, with his arrow, and so became ruler of Argos.

The Aryan Persians (or “ bright ” race) fi rst appear as Parsuas S.E. of Assyria in records of Shalmaneser II about 836 B . C . The legend of the race (as given in the Persian Vendid ā d) traces them from the “ Aryan home ” (see Aryans) N. of the Kaspian, the fi rst lands occupied being in Sogdiana and Baktria, and the later ones in Hyrkania and Media : or otherwise the Aryan home was in Media (see Daitya), in which case they would have spread into Persia as an offshoot of the earlier Medes (see Persepolis). The old Persian shows that they were closely akin by language to the Vedik Aryans. The independent Persian monarchy was founded by Akhaimenes, the great great grand- father of Cyrus, about 700 B . C .; and the defeat of the Medes and conquest of Ekbatana in 548 B . C . (see Kuras) laid the foundation of the Persian empire. Teisp ē s, son of Akhaimen ē s, had two sons, the eldest being Cyrus, father of Cambyses, father of Cyrus the Great, whose son Cambyses was the last of the elder branch ; and the second being Ariamn ē s, father of Arsames, whose son Hystaspes was father of Darius I, the founder of the second Akhaimenian dynasty, who calls himself the “ ninth king ” of the Akhaimenian family, being the suc- cessor of Gambyses. The last of the dynasty was Darius III, defeated by Alexander the Great, and dying in 330 B . C . [The following is the actual succession : Cyrus died 529, Cambyses 521, Darius I 486, Xerxes 465, Artaxerxes I 425, Xerx es II (who reigned 45 days) 425, Darius II 405, Artaxerxes II 359, Ar taxerxes III (Okhos) 338, Arses or Arogns 336, Darius III 330 B . C .—E D .] Under Darius I the empire included Asia to the Panj ā b on the E., and Egypt. Before the rise of Akhaimen ē s, about 720 B . C ., Sargon speaks of “ 25 princes of the Medes ” as giving tribute to Assyria ; but Shalmaneser II (in 836 B . C .) yet earlier says that “ 27 princes of the Parsu ” were tributary to him. The capital of Cyrus, before 548 B . C ., was at Anzan (Malam ī r) north of Susa; and Sennacherib, in 700 B . C ., speaks of “ the people of Parsua and Anzan,” who seem to have aided him against the Turanian Elamites of Susa . In Sargon’s time the town of Shur-gadia (perhaps for Pasargadæ) was under “ the prefect of Parsua ” ; and Media rebelled on the death of Sargon in 705 B . C ., but succumbed to his son Sennacherib. After th e defeat of the Elamites, in 697 B . C .

In 681 his son Esarhaddon found all Media and Persia under Aryan rulers, and in 647 Phraortes suc- ceeded Deiokes (Dayukku), who was apparently the fi rst king of all Media, and was succeeded by Kuaxares who attacked Nineveh, but was repelled by Assur-bani-pal (668-625 A .

C .; but Astuvegu, successor of Kuaxares, was defeated by Cyrus in 552 B . C . Thus no Median empire ever intervened between that of Babylon and that of Persia (see Medes). On the death of Cambyses the throne was seized by a Magus, Smerdis—a Mede—but Darius was elected in 521, and restored the Persian royal dynasty after six mont hs of anarchy. By 518 he had quelled the revolt of Babylon, an d in 497 he set forth to conquer Greece with an army of half a million, but after his defeat at Marathon he made no further attempt ; nor wa s Xerxes more successful when he brought huge hordes from all W. Asia against Europe in 480 B . C . Yet his son Artaxerxes I, ruling from the Panj ā b to Egypt over an empire of some two million square miles, maintained an almost un- diminished power ; and Cymon of At hens sadly contrasted the treaty of Antalkidas, in the time of Artaxerxes II, with that made 60 years before with Artaxerxes I, so succe ssful was the Persian policy of sow- ing dissensions among Greeks, which led to their being con fi ned to Europe for more than a century unt il the rise of Alexander.

The mass of the inhabitants were Quinchuas, a long headed race like other American Indians; but the ruling caste, under the Inca emperors, were short headed. There had only been 13 Incas before Pizarro’s conquest of Peru in 1533 A . C ., so that they would seem to have arrived about the 13th century. Dr Brinton fi nds no connection between the civilisa- tion of Peru and that of Mexico, though the Muyzkas round Bogota have been thought akin to the Azteks.

The Incas made great roads, and suspension bridges ; they wore quilted cotton jerkins as armour—like the Mongols of the 13th century ; they had a post al system ; and Peruvian pottery is marked with the Indian Svastika cross. The Peruvians had monks, and nuns, and Buddha-like teachers ; they used, in addition to the quipu bead belts, a graphic system of hieroglyphics. Their legends included one concerning a deluge, and (like Hindus) they spoke of successive ages in which the world was destroyed, fi rst by famine, and secondly by fl ood. They baptised in holy water, and the Quiche calendar (given by Lopez) appears to be founded on the Indian calendar, which was derived from the Greeks, or from the Babylonians. Apparently therefore the Incas were mediæval conquerors of Peru coming from the S.E. of Asia.—E D .] Fire was worshiped in Peru and kindled from a large concave mirror. The new fi re was consecrated by human sacri fi ces. The Inca, his nobles, and his priests, enjo yed immunity from taxation in fl icted on their subjects. Their rites were mild as compared with those of the Azteks, and they usually sacri fi ced only llamas, birds, rabbits, and dogs ; but they ate the fl esh of such sacri fi ces raw. When fi rst known to Europeans they had reduced the sacri fi ce of children to a mere drawing of a little blood ; but when an Inca was ill parents willingly proposed to sacri fi ce their children for the “ great sun-father,” that he might re- cover. The custom of Sati (Suttee) seems to have prevailed as in India, and wives offered to die for their husbands. Thus there is much that points to this region having been civilised from the east of S. Asia, whereas the Mexican civilisation came from the N.E. of the Asiatic continent. Throughout Polynesia, as elsewhere shown, the Malay sailor race had been the chief civiliser s, even as far as Easter Island close to Peru. Perumal. Tirumal.

The story seems to have been considered important for the authority of the Western Church, because of the words attributed to Christ—“ On this rock I will found my Church.” Thus the Pope claims to be the successor of the fi sherman, using the fi sherman’s seal, and proclaiming that there is no salvation outside Peter’s barque. But Irenæus appears to have called the bishops of Rome (not then called popes or “ fath ers ”) the “ successors of Paul.” Peter seems to have gone as far as Antioch (Gal. ii, 11), and possibly to Babylon (1 Pet. v, 13), but his vi sit to Rome is only found noticed in the later religious romance called the Clementine Recognitions . He was the “ Apostle of the Circumcision,” and stayed no doubt in Palestine among the Jewish converts. In Romanist tradition he borrows, from the paganism of Italy, the keys and the cock of Janus, and becomes the “ doorkeeper ” of heaven—like Siva who is the Dvarka-n ā th or “ master of the door ” (see Door and Key). Dr Jessop, in his edition of Husenbeth’s Emblems (1882, p. 166), says that : “ Peter is seen with a ke y, key and church, key and double- barred cross, two keys and open book . . . keys and closed book, in ponti fi cals with the pallium, but crowned as a king, a church in his right hand and two keys in his left . . . keys held back to back giving the appearance of a cross held downwards,” for his legend says that he was cruci fi ed head downwards.

The fi rst Epistle attributed to Peter (who probably could not write at all, and is very unlikely to have written in Greek) is sometimes said to have been written for him by Silvanus (1 Pet. v, 12). It is not clear what “ king ” is intended (ii, 17), unless it be Agrippa I. Some regard it as a work of the Pauline school ; and others, like De Wette, call it “ spurious.” The second Epistle of Peter was very ge nerally rejected as such by early Churches (Eusebius, Hist. Eccles ., iii, 3), and is now very generally regarded as a “ pious fraud,” written in support of statements about Peter in the Gospels (2 Pet. i, 18, and the title “ Simon ” Peter, in i, 1). It was written in an age of heresy and disbelief, when the Agapæ had become scandalous (ii, 1, 13 ; iii, 3), when the Pauline and Ebionite fl ects were at variance (iii, 15-17) ; and it refers in a somewhat suspicious manner to the fi rst Epistle (iii, 1). The two Epistles can hardly have been penned by the same person, and the second is said to be clearly “ directed against fo rms of Gnosticism prevalent in the early part of the 2nd century.” Peter, Gospel of. A Gospel of Peter appears to have been known to Justin Martyr, Clement of Alexandria, and Jerome (150 to 400 A . C .). A fragment of a work bearing this name was found in 1891, in an Egyptian tomb at Akhmim, and is supposed to date as early as 120 A . C . This Gospel is noticed in a letter from Serapion, bishop of Antioch about 200 A . C ., to the church of Rhossos in Cilicia, and Eusebius seems to have seen a complete copy. The bishop of Rhossos who, at fi rst, seems to have believed in its authenticity fi nally condemned it, on account of some passages being tinged with Docetic heresy—that is to say, not accepting the actual humanity of Christ’s body, but regarding him as a divine phantom. Yet in 457 A . C . Theodoret, bishop of Cyrrhus in Syria, said that the Gospel of Peter was the only one in use among Jewish Christians in Syria and Palestine (see Mr S. Laing, Agnostic Annual , 1895). According to the author of Supernatural Religion however, the work no w recovered cannot be the work of Peter, “ for it belongs to the very end of the 1st or the middle of the 2nd century ” A . C .

C . had many gospels peculiar to themselves, and the so-called Gospel of Peter appears to belong to that class.—E D .] Dr Harnack attaches importance to this work, though it was not generally accepted by the Churches, because : “ It belongs at least to a time when the whole evangelical material was still in a state of fl ux.” Dr Dillon ( Contemporary Review , June 1893) says that “ this Gospel was the most formidable weapon of the Gnostic Docetæ,” by whom perhaps it was wr itten ; this would cause it to be accepted by the school of Valentinus about 140 A . C ., and might well bring it. under the ban of the Catholics in the 4th and 5th centuries, when the theory of Christ having had only a spiritual body was con- demned, during the process of reco nciling the older belief in his human character with the doctrine of the Logos. The legends of the Gospel of Peter are, however, no more dif fi cult to believe than the account of the Resurrection in Matthew, or of the Ascension in Luke. The Gospel of Peter is not in accord with any of the four Canonical Gospels in its account of the Cruci fi xion and Resurrection of Christ. It is clearly Docetic in tone, since it says, “ They brought two male- factors and cruci fi ed him between them, but he kept silence as feeling no pain ” : thus the cry “ My God, my God, why hast thou abandoned me,” and the last cry “ in a loud voice ” (Matt. xxvii, 46, 50 ; Mark xv, 34, 37 ; Luke xxiii, 46) are equally ignored with the conversation of Christ and the penitent thief (Luke xxiii, 42, 43), and with the pathetic forgiveness of his murderers (Luke xxiii, 34), or the anxious solicitude of Jesus for his mother (John xix, 27) broken-hearted at the foot of the cross, which traits have endeared his memory to many generations, conducing far more to th e spread of Christianity than any metaphysical dogmas. Such uttera nces of the dying enthusiast, who to the last had believed that Go d would save him, have created sympathy with his agonies in all ages, and are a “ main factor,” as Mr Laing says, “ in Christianity.” It is true that the accounts in the four Gospels differ so much as to ca st doubt on the historical accuracy of any of these reports, but they re present an ideal of character which has caused their general acceptance, and they are consistent with the general picture of Christ’s conduct. Peter’s account of Christ’s trial is equally irreconcileable with the other narratives. We hear nothing of the triple denial of his Master, or of the cock that crowed.

We however, the 12 disciples of the Lord (no mention is here made of Judas as a traitor), wept and lamented ; and each one grieving for what had happened went to his home ; and I Simon Peter, and Andrew my brother, took our nets and went to the sea ”—apparently the Sea of Galilee 100 miles from Jerusalem. Equally startling is the account of the burial and resurrection of Jesus. Peter says that after the Cruci fi xion : “ The scribes, Pharisees, and elders, hearing that the people were greatly agitated, assembled in council, and sent elders in fear to P ilate, saying ‘ give us soldiers that we may watch the tomb for three days , lest his disciples should come and steal him, making men believe that he has risen from the dead, and bring us into trouble.’ Pilate gave them the centurion Petronius with soldiers to watch the grave ; and with them elders and scribes went to the grave, and they . . . rolled a great stone, all present helping to fi x it at the entrance of the grave; and they put on it seven seals, and pitching a tent th ere they watched the grave. . . . In the night before the Lord’s day, the soldiers being on guard two and two about, there arose a great vo ice in heaven ; and they saw the heavens open, and two men descending thence with great light, and approaching the tomb. And the stone which had been placed at the door rolled away of itself to one side, and the tomb was laid open, and both the young men went in. . . . The sentinels woke the centurion and elders . . . and, while they we re relating what they had seen, they saw again coming out of the tomb three men, the two supporting the one, and following them a cross : and of the two the heads reached the heavens, but that of him whom they led overpassed the heaven ; and they heard a voice out of heaven say ‘ Hast thou preached to them that sleep ?’ and from the cross came answer ‘ Yea.’ ” Clearly there is reference here to the “ spirits in prison ” (1 Peter iii, 19 ; iv, 6). The whole legend is full of absurdities : yet it is equally dif fi cult to believe in a material being who passed through closed doors (John xx, 19), or in doors that opened of themselves (Acts v, 19 ; xii, 10 ; xvi, 27). Dreams are dreams, and one miracle is as stupendous as another : the talking cross, and the self-moved stone, are not more wonderful than the virgin birth of Christ in which all Europe professes to believe : he rald angels, the baptismal dove, the trans fi guration, the angels at the tomb, the resurrection and the ascen-"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Phallus 118 sion, the walking on water, and the expelling of devils or raising of Lazarus, with the wonders reported of Peter, Paul, and Stephen, are equally marvellous. All Europe still bows to the East as it declares that Christ “ descended into hell ”—which is not stated in the Gospels, or anywhere except in the dubious First Epistle of Peter. Mr Rendel Harris thinks that the incidents about the stone and the cross, in the Gospel of Peter, were suggested by the words of Habakkuk (ii, 11), “ the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it ” ; but if so what shall we say of ten quotations of prophecy in the fi rst three chapters of Matthew—except that such texts have been a fruitful source of later legends. Peter’s account precludes the possibility of many incidents in the canonical Gospels ; but Paul never refers to any of these marvels in the life of Christ from birth to death, excepting only his reappearance after cruci fi xion. The Gospel of Peter represents the vinegar and gall to have been given to hasten Christ’s death. It does not mention the episode of the penitent thief, but the legs of one malefactor are left unbroken that he might die a lingering death, beca use he had reproved the mockers, and this is in direct contradiction to the canonical statements. Dr Martineau, after reading this Gospel, said : “ All Biblical literature is overgrown with perfectly unparalleled legends, and we are often reminded of the sad confession of the writer of the Shepherd of Hermas —long considered inspired : ‘I never in my life spoke a true word. . . . I dressed up falsehoods as truths, and no man contradicted me.’ The New Testament has been made up not by supernatural dictation, critical discovery of authorship, and testing of contents.

These earlier pietists were content to preserve the ancient ideas as to the future found throughout their scriptures, and had no belief in a resurrection of the just. The Pharisees quarrelled with John Hyrcanus (135 to 106 B . C .), and looked for the appearance of a king of the house of David as foretold by the prophets : they were persecuted by his son Alexander Jannreus (105 to 78 B .

They divided into two great schools under Hillel and Shammai (see Hillel) ; and to them we owe the “ oral law ” (see Mishnab) and the greater part of the later Rabbinic literature. About the time of Christ they numbered some 6000 in Je rusalem, and had immense in fl uence, though political power lay with the Sadducees, as supporters of the existing form of government, and as aristocratic families (Josephus, Ant ., XIII, x, 6) who did not in sist on complete “ separa- tion ” from the rest of the world such as had already been taught by the followers of Ezra, under the Persians.

Philo. Called “ Philo the Jew ” and “ the Jewish Plato.” He was born about 10 or 20 B . C . (Josephus, Ant ., XVIII, viii, 1), and was a priest according to Jerome ( De Vir. Illustr ., 11). As far as is known he lived always in Alexandria, but in 40 A . C . he was sent by the Jews on an important deputation, to urge their grievances against the Greeks before the Emperor Caligula in Rome ; this is the only date"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Phoinikians 121 certainly known in his history. He was a great writer, and of good family, well acquainted with what was happening to his own race ; yet he never alludes to Christ at all, or to the spread of Christianity between 30 and 63 A . C . He busied himself with the endeavour to reconcile Hebrew tradition' with Greek philosophy, as many learned Jews had done for more than a cent ury before his birth. He has been called a “ multiple minded syncretist,” vainly attempting to fi nd a standpoint that would enable him still to be a Jew while accepting what was supposed to be science—the ideas of Plato, and of the Alexandrian Platonists. He thus be came the greatest of allegorisers, so explaining away the folk-lore of his Bible, and speaking with con- tempt of those who received it as a literal account of actual events. He identi fi ed the Logos of Plato with the Jewish conception of Wisdom (see Logos) ; but he would have smiled at any who main- tained that it became incarnate and was born of a virgin. He did not admit that God was the creator of man, but thought that he “ fashioned ” matter into a world. God, he taught, is unconditioned, but Hul ē (“ matter ”) and Ousia (“ being ”) formed the body of man, which (as Plato had also said) is th e prison where the soul undergoes probation. His works are of thr ee classes : (1) Questions connected with scripture ; (2) allegories to be understood in the holy law ; and (3) expositions of the scriptures to explain and defend them to Gentiles. His tract on the Contemplative Life (see Essenes) is regarded as a spurious work. With Philo the Logos was the “ im- manent reason ” of God, “ His son . . . born of the immaculate virgin Sophia (wisdom) . . . neit her unbegotten, as is God, nor begotten as we are.” The Logos is “ God and Lord ” ; and he speaks of “ the two potencies, goodness and power,” in equally mystic language : for in such allegorical expressions the theologian loses him- self. Into this theosophy of hete rogeneous materials Philo introduced some .of the wiser doctrines of the Epikureans and Stoiks. The heroes and miracles of his Bible be regarded with doubt ; and, as Dr Drummond says, he is by his own showing, “ a sceptic who really believed only in the uncertainty of all knowledge, and the duty of suspense of judgment.” He was a true type of the Alexandrian philosopher of bis day, holding outwardly to the old faith, but explain- ing away all that he could not credit, and so disposing, with skill and tact, of what had been regarded as divine revelation. The “ fruit trees in Eden ” were “ virtues plan ted in the soul by God ” ; the six days of creation (which we are now told were six ages) were, according to Philo, merely expressions for “ or derly creation ” ; for six is a sacred number signifying “ perfect production .” Thus he followed the Stoiks"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Phlea 122 in explaining away, rather than absolutely denying, the old myths. The dif fi culties to be surmounted were created by man himself, and were due to the advance of human thought and understanding, which rendered primitive ideas obsolete. Some have regarded his painful attempts to reconcile beliefs once de ar to him with later ideas as mere learned tri fl ing, whereby Abraham and Moses become Logoi, Isaac personi fi es “ laughter,” and Sarah is “ virtue ” ; but we may learn from Philo the follies into which we may fall when departing from the fi rm ground of real knowledge ; fo r he seems to have forgotten his own ruling “ to suspend judgment when evidence was wanting or insuf fi cient.” Nor did such tampering with tradition save his credit as a Jew. He was even imprisoned for a time, and is regarded by Clement of Alexandria as a Pythagorean. Phlea. A name of Persephone, “ fruitful ” (see Pal). Phlegethon.

The inhabitants of the coast lands of Syria who, as historically known from the 15th century B . C ., were Semitic. [Their language was then the same spoken by the Semitic Babylonians ; but about 800 B . C .—as shown by the alpha-betic texts of Samala in the extreme north—it stood half way between the Hebrew and the pure Aramean ; and in the Phœnician texts known between 600 and 200 B . C . it is yet nearer to Hebrew.—E D .] The Greeks connected the name with that of the Phoinix or “ palm,” and of the “ purple ” shell fi shed on the coast, but it may be the Egyptian term Fenekh, applied to th e inhabitants of this region. The word Pannag (Ezek. xxvii, 17) is also connected with the Phœnicians by Buxtorf. The ancient Akkadian Pin means “ a settlement,” and the Fenekh may have been “ se ttlers.” [As a Semitic word Fanah means “ sinking ” (Jer. vi, 4) or sunset, and Phœnicia was called in Akkadian Mar-tu (“ the way of descent ”) or “ the west,” answering to Akharu “ the west ” in Assyrian, while the Phœnicians were clearly a western branch of th e Semitic race of Babylonia.—E D .] These tribes are also called Kaft (see Kaptor) in Egyptian texts, and are represented on the frescoes of Thothmes III (16th century B . C .) with Semitic features and beards, so me of the priests having shaven heads."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Phoinikians 123 The Phœnicians were a great trading and sea-faring race, who came, according to Pliny and Strabo, from the Persian Gulf. They appear in the Homeric poems, in which the artistic metal work and beautiful bowls of Sidon are celebrated. In Greek mythology they were connected with Kadmos ( K ̣ edem “ east ”), and, according to Herodotos, Tyre was founded as early as 2750 B . C , in the opinion of its priests. Colonies were founded by Tyre in the W. Mediterranean even before the building of Carthage about 800 B . C ., and Phœnician in fl uence endured in the west for perhaps 3000 years. Mr Gladstone (on Homer as a Nation Maker ) says that the Phoinikes of Homer were “ merchants, pirates, traders, kidnappers, and buccaneers. With them is associated almost every rudiment of art and manners which we fi nd mentioned in the poems. For example—the art of naviga- tion, of stone buildings, of work in metals, with a close approach to fi ne art, of embroidery, of medicine, and of chemistry however simple ; the institution of the games, the importation of the horse, and the art, nay arts, of horse driving ( Il ., xxiii, 402-447, 566-601). Not that these belonged to the Phœnician sailors, but they belonged to the countries of Phœnician traf fi c, and to immigrants brought by their ships. . . . But the policy of the Phoinikes proper was to avoid inter- vention in quarrels not their own.” The pictures of gifts brought by Phœnicians to Thothmes III include artistic bowls and vases, and other work in stone and bronze, in gold and silver, which fully accord with such accounts, and go back some 400 years earlier than the sup- posed date of the Trojan war. The wealth of their temples, and their use of papyrus and of clay tablets, in the 15th century B . C ., are attested by the Amarna letters. [The oldest alphabetic Phœnician text is one found on fragments of bronze in Cyprus, but it mentions the town of Carthage, and is pro bably therefore not as old as the Moabite stone. Even if the town of Carthage in Cyprus itself be intended the date would be late, as that “ new city ” is only noticed in the 7th century B . C .—ED.] The Phœnician religion is indicated clearly by inscriptions, sculptures, terra cotta images found in tombs, and seals and signet cylinders, resembling those of Babylon. The Phœnician art was afterwards in fl uenced by Egypt, and gods like Horus and Bast were adored in Phœnicia. The principal gods included El for “ heaven ” ; Ba’alath, probably for “ earth ” ; Tammuz, Adoni, or Melk ̣ arth, for the sun ; ’Ashtoreth, for the moon ; Nergal, for “ hell ” ; S ̣ id or Dagon, for “ sea ” ; Hadad, for “ air ” ; and Eshm ū n (the eighth), as the god of “ health ” and prosperity.

The Phœnicians known to the Greeks appear to have been circumcised, and their calendar included at least two months (Bul and Ethanim) known to the Hebrews before the captivity. Their weights and me asures were also commensurable with those of Babylon, and like their alphabet were adopted by the Greeks. The Phœnician cosmogony (see Philo of Byblos) is preserved by Eusebius ( Præp. Evang ., i, 10) in its later form, and included 12 episodes : (1) from Kolpias and Bau (“ wind ” and “ the deep ”) came all, and they were generated by Mot (“ dead matter ”) in chaos, through the power of Pothos or “ desire ” ; (2) from these came two mortals, Ai ō n (“ age ” or “ antiquity ”), and Protogonos (“ the fi rst born ”), and Ai ō n found fruit on trees ; (3) Genos and Genea (“ man ” and “ woman,” see Gan) produced (4) Phos, Pur, and Phlox (“ light,” “ fi re,” and “ fl ame ”), who invented the fi re drill ; (5) Memrumos (“ deep water ”), and Hupsuranios (probably “ he who goes down ”), followed, and the latter dwelt at Ty re ; his brother Ousoos was his foe (probably the earlier inhabitant), and invented clothing of skins of wild beasts, and boats made out of logs on which he fi rst ventured on the sea.

[The legend goes on to speak of ’Elion (“ the most high ”) and of his wife Beruth (“ creating one ”), who dwelt at Byblos, where was the great temple of Ba’alath : they produced heaven and earth, who offered to them sacri fi ces and libations. The children of Heaven an d Earth were Ilos (El or “ god ”), Kronos, Betulos (the virgin), and Dagon (who is here wrongly identi fi ed with “ corn ”). The Greek legend of Ouranos is added ; and the children of Kronos are Persephon ē and Ath ē n ē ; while the son of Dagon is Demarous—probably the sacred “ tamarisk.” Byblos, founded by Kronos, is called the fi rst Phœnician city. It was highly important we know (Amarna letters from Gebal) in early times. Astarte, Rhea, and Dione, are also daughters of Heaven ; and by Heaven were invented the Baitulai (see Bethel) or sacred stones. The mythology mingles together the Semi tic and Aryan gods, and includes Pontos (“ the deep ”), with Tuphon (“ the north ”)—Sidon being founded by the former ; while Melk ̣ arth is formally identi fi ed with H ē rakl ē s, and is made the son of Dema rous, as many other sun gods were tree-born. Demarous also aids Heaven against the deep ; while Heaven is dismembered by Kron os, and fountains and rivers fl ow from his blood—a very evident myth of the “ time ” of rains. Astart ē , the horned ’Ashtoreth—identi fi ed with Aphrodit ē — fi nds a star, and therewith consecrates Tyre, reigning with Demarous and Adodos, or Hadad, while Kronos gives Attika to Ath ē n ē , Byblos to Baaltis (Ba’alath), and Berutos (Beir ū t) to Pontos “ the sea.” Taautes (Thoth) pourtrayed Heaven, and Kronos with four eyes and four wings ; and received Egypt as his kingdom ; by his command the seven Kabeiroi (or seven great gods), with their 8th brother Askl ē pios (or Eshm ū n), made a record of these things—showi ng the usual pantheon of 8 great gods.—E D .] The Phœnician beliefs as to the future are clearly shown by the text on the cof fi n of King Eshmun-’azar of Sidon, variously dated as of the 4th or 3rd centuries B . C . It was discovered by the Duc de Luynes in 1855, and is now in the Louvre. On this famous sarco- phagus, of semi-Egyptian form, we read (in the month Bul in the 14th year of Eshmun-‘azar, king of the Sidonians, son of Tabnit, king of the Sidonians) : “ I lie here in this cof fi n and tomb, in the place I have made. Remember thou this. Let no royal prince, or common man, open my tomb chamber. Let them not seek treasures, for none have hidden treasures here : nor let them move my cof fi n out of my tomb-chamber, or disturb my fune ral bed by putting another tomb"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Phoinix 126 above it.

The family built temples of ’Ashtoreth by the seaside Sidon, and of other gods, and made images of the godess, and of Eshm ū n, and Ba’al, ’Ashtoreth being described as the “ fa ce ” (or manifestation) of Ba’al. The pious king adds : “ May the lord of kings (perhaps a deity, or perhaps a suzerain) give us Dora an d Joppa (the S. plaiu), the fruit- ful cornlands which are in the plain of Sharon, and may they add them within the boundary of the land, that they may remain Sidonian forever. Remember thou this . . . else the holy gods shall cut thee off forever.” Thus to the Phœnician, as to the Hebrew, life in this world was the supreme good, and only a drea ry existence among Rephaim in Sheol would follow. “ As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away, so he that goeth down to Sheol shall come up no more ” (Job vii, 9). Phoinix. Phenix. A fabulous bird, emblem of the sun (see Peacock), described as an eagle with a star on its head (see Eagle) : it had a golden neck, wings of azure and fl ame colour, and a white and crimson tail. It made a pyre of aromatic woods and burned itself, fanning the fl ames with its wings. From the ashes came a worm which became the new Phoinix. This occurs once in 600 years (or in 340, 460, 500, 1461, or 7006 years) according to Herodotos, Tacitus, and Pliny. Hero dotos says that it came from the East to Egypt every 500 years, and buried its father at Heliopolis (the “ sun city ”) in an egg of myrrh—the sweet fl owers of spring. Its nest was in Arabia (the East), and here alone, according to one version, could a single Phoinix be born (see Minnesota Literary Digest , 1892). Tacitus says that it appeared in Egypt in 34 A . C ., and the learned said this happened only once in 1461 years (the Sothik cycle) when the Julian year came round to the same day of the true year. He says also that the fi rst Phœnix appeared in the time of Rameses II, who thus appe ars to have reigned about 1427 B . C .

Nat ., v, 41). The Armenians were a Phr ygian colony (Herod., vii, 73). [Plato (Cratylus) says that Phrygian speech was akin to Greek : the old word bekos “ bread ” in Phrygian (Herod., ii, 2) is from the Aryan root Bhag “ food ” ; and the Phrygian name for a god, Bagaios, is clearly the Aryan Bhaga for “ god,” being a title of Atus. Some remains of the “ Asianic syllabary ” occur in this region, but the Phrygian alphabet, after about 800 B . C ., resembles the early Greek, and like it is used in texts reading from right to left, and left to right, in alternate lines. About 8 or 9 Phrygian texts are known ; but, though clearly Aryan, they have not been read. One of them gives the words Matar Kubile —evidently “ Mother Kub ē l ē ” : another (M. Chantre, Mission en Cappadoce , p. 169) seems to read “ Vasthus the great man of Ionian birth, the lover of the god ”—a tombstone ; a third, at the tomb of Midas (Müller, Dorians , i, p. 9) contains the name of that monarch ; a fourth, found by Dr Ramsay, dedicates an altar.

Picts. The earliest known inhabitants of Scotland, found ruling in the 4th century A . C . by the Scots from N. Ireland ; nor were these Goidel Kelts able to drive the Picts beyond the N. border of Argyle- shire till our 6th century, so that th e name of Scotia for Scotland is not older than the close of the 12th century A . C ., having been applied to the N. of Ireland in the 10th century. Mr Skene says that the “ chief stronghold ” of the Picts, in the 5th century, was at Craig Phadraig, but. the clans only confederated for war, including “ men of Fortrenn ” in Perth ; of “ the moorland ” in Moray ; of Angus and the Mearns in Forfar and Kincardine ; and of Forthrife in Fife. Nor had the Scots a chief king (Ard-Righ) till Kenneth MacAlpine, in 834 A . C ., conquered the Picts on the Tay, and was crowned king of Scots and Picts at Scone ten years later. The old Pictish boundaries are still noticed in the Book of Deer granting lands to the Church in the 12th century. The Picts are thought to have been a small race, and Prof. Rhys considers that Pictish words occur in Aberdeen dialect, and that they were a long-headed dark race in Pictavia (from the Clyde to Caithness) : the Norsemen seem to have called the country from Oaithness to Sutherland the land of the Pechts (probably “ small"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Picus 129 folk ”), and it is impossible to suppose that the word was Latin, meaning the “ Picti ” or “ painted ” people.

They have been thought akin to the Eskimo, or to the Lapps. Macbeth, king of Scotland (1040- 1057), is said to have been a true Pi ct of Moray. The Picts entered the Shetland Isles, and are believed to have there found an older savage race of small dark men (p erhaps distant cousins), resembling the Neolithik people of Europe, and brewing an intoxicating drink from heather. The Picts in turn were here conque red by Norsemen. Picus. Latin. The “ woodpecker.” According to the legend, King Picus (“ the pecker ” or “ pi ercer ”) was changed by Ceres into this speckled bird. In Piedmontese the piciu is also the phallus (see Prof. A. de Gubernatis, Zool. Mythol ., ii). Indra also assumed the form of the woodpecker. Suidas speaks of a Zeus Pekos in Krete. Pliny says that the woodpecker opens secret places by aid of an herb that waxes and wanes with the moon, and that anyone who takes honey from a hive on a woodpecker’s bill will not be stung by bees. But St Epiphanius regarded this bird as a devil hiding in secret places. It is connected with the Yunx (Torquilla or “ wry neck ”) which was the “ bird of love,” the favourite of Adonis (see Academy , 7th March 1885). The Yunx was also sacred to Dion ū sos (Brown, Great Dionysiac Myth ., i, pp. 339, 340), as represented on a Greek vase. “ It used to be tied to a wheel, and whirled round to assist amorous incantations,” so that, in Pindar, it is the “ maddening bird of love ” of Aphrodit ē .

In the simile of the cave ( Republic , bk. vii) Plato represents himself as on e who had seen realities, while other men were only studying the shadows on the wall; but whether he really travelled in Egypt, Cyrene , Sicily, and Italy, after the death of Sokrates in 399 B . C . is doubted. He was born about 430-427 B . C ., and died in 347 B . C . His mind was impressed by the Pytha- gorean philosophy; but in the name of Sokrates he teaches a vague and stupendous mysticism. His theory of a model republic perhaps best explains to us why (as he complains) philosophers had no in fl uence with practical men. He proposes to breed a ruling caste as men breed cattle, and to deceive the masses by rites and allegories. Whether he fully believed the doctrine of transmigration (see Er) which he teaches, thus seems doubtf ul, but he held that death is the anastasis , or “ standing up,” when the soul escapes from its prison in the body. He held as a patriot that all Greeks should refrain from civil war, but the barbarian (that is the Persian) is a natural foe { Republic , bk. v), so that his humane ideas are limited to one small race. Among the dialogues the most famous of all are perhaps the Phædo, Phædrus, and Timæus. His doctrine of the Logos, and of the Idea, supposes a divine emanation of which each idea (thing, reality, or individuality) is a part, while material phainomena, or “ appear- ances,” are delusion. According to the Phædo the “ child within ” is born in successive bodies, and the soul commands the body, which is its garment—but one ill- fi tting. There are many mansions, and unless puri fi ed by philosophy the soul may be reborn in some lower form. Wherefore retreat from the world an d contemplation are needful. In the Phædrus we gather that the eternal soul is distracted by the war of desire against truth, and may pass nine stages of puri fi cation. The Timæus is the favourite dialogue, in which we learn that souls are part of the divine soul, that reason and science are our best guides, and that immortality is conditional. God is not the creator of every individual life ; but from a matrix of matter the archetypal form was produced, and the idea thence apparently derives its visible body. The conception of God is vague, and Cicero thought Plato obscure.

This Pliny, like his uncle, was a learned man and a statesman : he was an orator, and has left us 10 epistles, of which the last describes the customs of humble Christians—serving maids and slaves—in Bithynia about 104 to 111 A . C . He wrote from that province to urge that mild measures would suf fi ce, and to say that men we re beginning to buy sacri fi ces better than before—to the satisfaction of the priests—but the evidence in favour of this letter is slight, and many consider it a forgery, though Renan accepts it. Aubé in France, and Baur in Germany, regarded it with suspicion, because not found in early editions of Pliny’s letters. It was fi rst published in the beginning of the 16th century, from a MSS. in Fr ance which is no longer extant. Aldus Manutius published it in 1588. Bishop Lightfoot (see Apostolic Fathers , I, ii, p. 44) admits that : “ amidst many spurious, and question- able, stories of persecutions allege d to have taken place during the reign of Trajan, only three are reported on authority that can be trusted . . . the Christians forgot nothing and magni fi ed everything . . . . Tertullian got his knowledge from Pliny and Trajan, and Eusebius from Tertullian.” The latter says merely that Pliny condemned some Christians to death, and degraded others from their of fi ces. We can hardly imagine a Roman governor, acquainted with the law, asking the emperor, “ am I to punish these poor people ?” But the letter is not of great importance, for we may admit that Christians existed on the shores of the Euxine, or in Anatolia generally, by this time, being regarded by the Romans as a Jewish sect—as Nero thought them, in 64 A . C . in Rome. An experienced statesman like Pliny, then 50 years old, appears to know nothing more about them than that they were a secret society, and assemb led to “ sing hymns to Christ as to a god,” sharing a common meal of an innocent description. Plotinus. A learned philosopher, and pious Theist, born at Lukopolis in Egypt about 203 to 205, and dying in Oampania in 269 A . C . He is known to us only by the account given of him by his pupil and life-long friend Porphyry (in 233 to 306 A . C .). See Porphureos.

At the age of 28 he had found his vocation as a te acher of philosophy, and at 39 he accompanied the emperor Gordian III to Babylonia and Persia, in order to study the wisdom of the East : af ter his return he taught philosophy for 24 years. The story of his death (see Conversion) shows us that he adopted the Indian idea of Yoga , seeking in ecstatic states for union with deity ; but the account by Porphyry contains the super- stitious marvels of ordinary legend—t he soul of Plotinus departing as a serpent or dragon (see Rivers of Life , ii, p. 243). Plotinus bade his disciples, male and female, to refrain from politics, as distracting them from true religion and practical work. He was intent on mystic contempl ation ; and Porphyry, with others, asserted that he wrought miracles which astonished the Egyptian priests, calling up gods and demons. The Delphic oracle announced that the soul of Plotinus rested fo rever with the blessed. Even his .enemies allowed that he was the pu rest and best of men. The key- note of his teaching (see Prof. E. Caird, Gifford Lectures , March 1902) was the idea of obtaining a “ sense of God,” beyond knowledge or power of explanation, through ecstas y such as Paul also describes (2 Cor. xii, 2), and which Indian hermits, and Moslem S ̣ ū fi s, alike have sought, or the Christian who believe s that he holds communion with the Holy Ghost. The philosophy of Plotinus, says Prof. Caird, was a “ summary and concentrated expression of the whole movement of Greek philosophy. Plotinus repres ented the universe as distributed into a series of stages, or degrees of reality, reaching from matter to God ” : he was not content with Plat o’s doctrine of the reality of the idea, and the illusory and temporary character of the phenomena, or with Aristotle’s hints as to the struggle of the intuitive perception (or hereditary experience) with reason ; but, regarding mysticism (and trance) as higher attainment, he up held it against both materialism and idealism. The material world, though reduced to one of shadow and appearance, was still a state of existence, outside the spiritual, through which the One who is above all being, and all knowing, is approached ; while thus conceiving of an Unity beyond all differences he yet “ altogether failed when he had to think positively of that Absolute in his relation to the fi nite world.” Dr A. Harnack, writing on Neo-Platonism ( Encyclop. Brit ., 1884), says that though we may assume the school to have known the doctrines of both Judaism and Christianity, yet “ it is vain to :search Plotinus for evidence of any actual in fl uence of Jewish or"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Plough 134 Christian philosophy.” The founder of the Neo-Platonic school of Alexandria was Ammonius Saccas (who died about 245 A . C .), and he is said to have been a Christian by birth who relapsed into heathen- ism. The Platonism of Philo was a distinct and earlier Jewish deve- lopment, but Origen, and Plotinus we re the most distinguished teachers whom Saccas in fl uenced : both were fervid pietists, and believers in, the attainment of communion with the Supreme Being through ecstacy. Both held that not only does man not live by bread alone, but that he moreover does not live by knowledge only, but by that which is above knowledge—a mystic and passionate belief which has always deeply impressed the imagination of mankind, ignorant of the comparative history of religions, and of all faiths except their own. The existence of an immortal indi viduality, Idea, or Soul, is the fundamental axiom of such systems. Plotinus called it “ the image and product of the motionless ability ” ( nous ), and like it immaterial. The original unity, or being, produc es this Nous, as the archetype of all existing things (a Platonic doctri ne). It is the Idea, at once Being and Thought, the sum of the ideal world. The Soul is the idea emanating from the Nous, as the No us emanates from the One. The Nous is indivisible, the Soul may ei ther preserve its individuality or may attain to being absorbed in the Nous, but if it unites with the material world it become s disintegrated by corporeal forces, and “ must retrace its steps back to the Supreme Good.” Such was the strange mysticism, based on the idea that material phenomena are mere illusory shadows, and spiritual essence the only reality, which Plotinus, and his disciples, sought to inculcate. They redeemed their teaching by calling on all to practise virtue, and to aim at likeness to the ideal God, with whom they must harmonise and strive to unite. The old ethiks were taught, and the old asceticism and puri fi cation of the body by penance and austerities. Thereby, said Plotinus, we may become as nearly as possible what God is. The Nous was a kind of personal god; the Logoi which it in cluded are gods ; the stars are gods. Plotinus was not a dualist ; but a rigid Monotheism was to him a very bald conception : nor was he truly a Pantheist. He saw a meaning in popular myths, and some say he believed in magic, sooth- saying, and prayer. Aurelius, who seems to have valued the opening passage of the fourth Gospel, and Po rphyry who criticised the Christian Bible, modi fi ed the teaching .of Plotinus, some of whose works are said to have in fl uenced the spiritual history of Augustine. Plotinus in short was the great mystic of the third Christian century. Plough.

He had a long and important public car eer before so retiring, and as a philosopher is said, by some, to have been the preceptor of the emperor Trajan, who raised him to consular dignity, and occasionally employed him as an imperial messenger (or commissioner) to the provinces. The exact date of his death is unknown ; much that he wrote is lost ; and some works. (like that On Isis and Osiris ) are doubtfully authentic ; but his library must have been extensive, for he is said to quote 250 authors, in addition to the results of his own researches during travels that extended over perhaps 50 years. The fi rst edition of his works in Europe was published in 1470 A . C ., in two volumes, and the Greek text in 1517. Plutarch was more concerned with ethiks and practi- cal conduct than with religious speculation, and regarded reason and philosophy as the best guides. Like others he sought to reconcile old myths with the conception of a single God, and he agreed with Plato as to the immortality of the soul. Po. See Bo. A Chinese corruption of Buddha. Poligar.

The Rev. Dr Sanday, writing for the “ Christian Evidence Society,” says that “ Polycarp knew no t of any canonical scriptures ” : he was a catechist, deacon, and elder, and fi nally bishop of Smyrna, where he was martyred in his 86th year. He is believed to have been born before 69 A . C .—which appears to be somewhat early if he really visited Pope Anicetus (156 to 166 A .

He was involved in the disputes as to the celebration of Easter, and he is said to have called Marcion the “ fi rst born of Satan ” (see Marcion). “ He who falsi fi es the sayings of the Lord,” said Polycarp, “ after his own pleasure, and af fi rms that there is no resurrection and no judgment, is the fi rst-born of Satan.” His works included an Epistle to Philippi ; but the Epistle of Ignatius to Polycarp is of very doubtful authenticity, as is also the Epistle of the Church of Smyrna to the Church of Philomelium, about the martyrdom of Polycarp, which exists in Greek and Latin MSS. About three-quarters of the Epistle to Philippi was published in Greek in 1633, and the enlarged Latin text in 1498. Eusebius seems to have seen a Greek fragment of such an epistle, and Irenæus attributes it to Polycarp (iii, 3, 41) ; but, like other early Christian works, it seems to have been enlarged and garbled by later scribes. It appears to infer acquaintance with the Gospels, and with the Epistles of Paul and Peter which (see Smith’s Dicty. of Christian Biogr .) is regarded as “ the natural tendency of a forger of later date.” Irenæus is said to have been sent by Polycarp as a missionary to Gaul in 157 A . C ., when he must have been very young. The account of the martyrdom above noticed states (xv, 15) that th e soul of this martyr was seen to escape in the form of a dove. The legend preserved by Eusebius is of the ordinary type. “ When the pyre burst into great fl ames those of us privileged to see it witnessed a great miracle . . . the fl ames presented an appearance like an oven , as when the sail of a vessel is fi lled with the wind ; and thus formed a wall round the body of the martyr, and he (Polycarp) was in the midst not like burning fl esh, but like gold and silver puri fi ed in the furnace. We also perceived a fragrant odour like the fumes of in ceuse, or some other precious aromatic drugs. At length the wi cked persecutors, seeing that the body could not be consumed by fi re, commanded the executioner to draw near to him, and to plunge hi s sword into him ; and when he had done this such a quantity of blood gushed forth that the fi re was extinguished.” Polynesia.

In 1901 British India showed an increase of 4.44 per cent. of population. Out of the total of over 1500 millions more than 400 millions profess some form of Christianity, and 300 millions regard themselves as Buddhis ts, while the Jews do not appear to exceed about 10 millions. Studies of Christian and Buddhist beliefs are thus of chief interest. The total Moslem population cannot be placed lower than some 200 millions, of whom at least 55 millions are in India (see Short Studies , p. 469). Brahmanism represents a some- what larger total of population, leaving about 400 millions, or less than a third of the population of the world, to include Zoroastrians, and Confucians, Taoists and pagans.

He died in Sicily about 306 A . C ., having gone there by the advice of Plotinus, because he was in low spirits, and contemplated euthanasia, believing that his work was done. He tells us that Greek astronomy, and the zodiak, came from Babylon, and that Eudo xos, Aratos, and Hipparkhos, only enlarged and improved the Babylonian cycles. He leant to the philosophy of Pythagoras, esteeming him next to Plotinus. He says that he only once attained to the communion with Deity which his master so frequently enjoyed. He is said to have written 15 works about the Christians and Jews, and he was the fi rst critic of the Book of Daniel, showing—like modern criti cs—that its prophecy describes the history of the Seleucidæ down to the death of Antiochus Epiphanes ; He rejected the gospel narratives, though allowing the existence of Jesus, and Theodosius I caused his writings to be burned in con- sequence. Like Plotinus he was a Neo-Platonist, and believed in an immortal soul, and in a Supreme In fi nity. He thought that he had once seen God in ecstacy, and had received divine communications. Like Plotinlls he was much respected by Greeks and Romans, and by the learned in Alexandria, teaching that “ man is placed under natural, civil, and divine laws.” Sorrow was a more wholesome discipline than pleasure in his belief, and the cultivation of the soul in the practice of virtue more import ant than the training of the body. His poor health induced melancho ly, and was doubtless due to his austerities and trances. To Porphyry, says Prof. Harnack ( Encyclop. Brit ., xvii, p. 336), “ belongs the credit of having recast and popularised the system of Plotinus.” His aim was practical religion, and the salvation of the soul ; but he fell into the fatal fallacy of mystical exaltation like many earlier Buddhists, and Christian hermits ; and evil, he said (like Plato), was due to the desires of the soul, and of the fl esh, which must be severely disc iplined by asceticism. His work Against the Christians was full of bitter criticism, and he was regarded as a rabid enemy of their faith. But, like the work of Celsus, that of Porphyry was suppr essed by the dominant Catholic party, and we depend on extracts given by Lactantius, Augustine, and Jerome. He desired to preserve, and to defend from Christian attacks, all that he thought best in Greek religion and philosophy, and he gave a new impulse and directio n to Neo-Platonic doctrines which were developed especially by his pupil Iamblikhos.

Homer says that he built the walls of Troy ( Il ., xxi, 46), and Hesiod that he made the “ dungeon of the Titans ” : for Hades is beneath the sea. Positivism. The “ Systeme de Philosophie Positive ” of Auguste Comte, which is commonly called the “ Religion of Humanity.” The Rev. Principal Tulloch ( Edinburgh Review , 1868) says that “ it not only contemplated the whole circle of human knowledge and activity, but furnished the only effective prin ciples for the reorganisation of both. It based the reformation of life on the demonstrations of science. Comte claimed to be a reformer on this very ground. . . . Positivism therefore . . . is a connected system of thought. We may take certain parts and leave others, but th is is to mutilate the scheme of the Master . . . it can only be fairly judged as a whole.” We must so study it without being deterred by the vagaries of its votaries, or the strange details of their worship an d liturgies : it is only thus that we can understand its in fl uence. None who have studied Comte’s great work can fail to recognise his services to science : “ all who have done so would feel that to regard him merely as the author of a new religion would be to do injustic e to his position as a scienti fi c thinker.” Miss Harriet Martineau, who translated Comte’s work, speaks of “ the vast range of knowledge through which she was carried so easily and entrancingly.” She thought that “ before the end of the (nineteenth) century society at large will have become aware that this work is one of the chief honours of the century. . . . As M. Comte treats of theology and metaphysics as destined to pass away, theologians and metaphysicians must necessarily abhor , dread, and despise his work. . . . They are no judges of the case. . . . We fi nd here indications in passing of the evils we suffer from our low aims, sel fi sh passions, and proud ignorance; and, in contrast with them, animating displays of the beauty and glory of the everlasting laws, and of the sweet severity, lofty courage, and noble resignation, that are the natural consequences of pursuits so pure, aims. so true, as those of Positive Philosophy.” Mr Herbert Spencer, who owes much to Comte as regards both religion and philosophy, has been th ought to give him scant praise, yet he says : “ To M. Comte . . . is due the credit of having set forth"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Positivism 141 with comparative de fi niteness the connection between the Science of Life and the Science of Society. He saw clearly that the facts presented by masses of associated men, are facts of the same order as those presented by groups of gregar ious creatures of inferior kinds, and that in the one case as in the other, the individuals must be studied before the assemblages can be understood. He therefore placed Biology before Sociology. . . . We must not overlook the greatness of the step made by Comte . . . the introductory chapters of his Sociology show a breadth an d depth of conception beyond any previously reached. . . . His way of conceiving social phenomena was much superior to all previous ways ; and among others of its superiorities was this recognition of the depe ndence of Sociology on Biology ” ( Sociology , pp. 328-330). Huxley often expressed indebtedness to Comte, and speaks of “ the impression which the study of Comte’s works left on my mind, combined with the conviction, which I shall always be thankful to him for awakening in me, that the organisation of society upon a new and purely scienti fi c basis is not only practi- cable but is the only political object much worth fi ghting for.” Most of the great thinkers of our day, whether Christians, Theists, or Agnostiks, bear similar testimon y to Comte, including Mill, Bain, Lewes, and Sir D. Brewster. They regarded his method as the true one to teach us why we must act morally, and not follow blind desire or impulse. The multitude dislike metaphysical theories, while regard- ing theology as only for Sunday use, and hating cant. Honest teachers thus welcomed ethiks founded on real experience, and dissociated from beliefs as to the unknown. The su ccess of Positivism is not to be measured by the number of its professed disciples, but by its in fl uence as a leaven that leavens the thought of the age. Auguste Comte was born of good Catholic and royalist parents, in January 1798, at Montpellier in France, educated at the town school, and admitted at the age of 16 into the École Polyteclmique in Paris. There he headed a mutiny which broke up the school. For two years he followed various employments, and by 1818 had become the friend and disciple of Henri Comte de St Simon, who, as Mr John Morley says ( Encyclop. Brit .), was “ an artist in social construction.” Comte confesses that to St Simon he owed his initiation into philosophy, yet he does not usually speak of him with gratitude, and he felt that the poetical count was lacking in scienti fi c and political stability. He began early to see that political phenomena are subject to laws like others : that the true aim of philo sophy must be social progress—the reorganisation of moral, religious, and political systems. Comte thought little of Plato, and regarded Aristotle as the prince of true"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Positivism 142 thinkers. In 1824 he broke with St Simon ; and, in spite of poverty and family objections, he made his unhappy marriage in the next year. In 1826 his lectures on Positive Philosophy attracted Humboldt and other learned men, but brain troubl es were then followed by melan- cholia. He was however able to resume his lectures in 1828, and published his Course of Positive Philosophy in 1830, the sixth and last volume appearing in 1842, when he separated from his wife in consequence of constant jarring of their tempers. Meantime he held various appointments some of them under Government, and was fairly happy and well off. In 1848 he founded the Positive Society, and delivered gratuitous lecture.s on as tronomy and other subjects, seeking to improve the level of general education in France. At this time (when about 50) he is described as “ short, rather stout, and sleek looking, always carefully dressed in black, and clean shaven.” He was generally poor, but in receipt of from £80 to £200 a year subscribed by such literary friends as J. S. Mill, Grate, and Littré, to whom however he proved anything but grat eful. His resou rces, and memory, were marvellous, but his style was heavy and dull, though (as Mr John Morley says) it impresses the reader with the magnitude and import- ance of the undertaking, and by the visibly conscientious grasp. He read only two or three poets—notably Dante—and also the Imitatio Christi . He was accused of assuming “ high ponti fi cal airs.” He became infatuated with Madame Olotilde de Vaux in 1845, on account .of a small work that she wrote, and he was inconsolable when she died next year, and visited her tomb th rice a day, passionately invoking her memory. His System of Positive Philosophy began to appear in 1851, the fourth and last volume being published in 1854. He had gathered disciples round him in 1848, who formed a kind of church, and seem to have adopted a strange formula of invocation : “ In the name of the Past and Future, the se rvants of Humanity come forward to claim as their due the general di rection of the world.” Direction is not usually the duty of servants ; but the leaders declare that “ their object is to constitute a re al providence in all departments, moral, intellectual, and material. Co nsequently they exclude, once for all, from political supremacy all the different servants of God, Catholic, Protestant, and Deist, as being at once behindhand, and the cause of disturbance.” In 1852 Comte issued a Catechism of Positivism , thus walking in the mazy ways of the old systems that he strove to overthrow. He died of cancer on the 5th September 1857—a day which his followers always commemorate. He was a fi rm believer in a “ spiritual power,” concerning which he published Considerations as early as 1826, which Mr Morley re-"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Positivism 143 gards as “ one of the most remarkable ” of his essays. In the 5th volume of his Course he says that : “ Catholicism reconstituted on in- tellectual foundations will fi nally preside over the spiritual reorganisa- tion of society,\" an idea which in later years led him into mysticism. [It is a dream, as Zola has shown, that has charmed many minds .among those to whom the inner facts of Catholicism are unknown.— E D .] He taught that the Positivist must be content to restrict him- self to the observation of natural law, while the Theologist, or the Metaphysician, speculates as to ca use : this was an approach to the Agnosticism of to-day. Comte pursued the study of such law into the department of social and political sc ience, calling on students to analyse collected facts as we analyse chemical compounds. He lays down as a “ cardinal truth, that the improvement of the social organisation can {mly be effected by moral develo pment, never by changes in mere political mechanism, or any violences in the way of an arti fi cial redis- tribution of wealth.” Socialism must mean the victory over self-love, and that of Altruism over Egoism (or love of others over sel fi shness) ; and we must appeal to the most powerful element in human nature— the heart or feelings. But this appeal, he added, had been abused by the Church, since intellect was made the slave of feeling instead of its willing minister. He further upholds that “ we must acknowledge and give complete submission to a Power without us—that is humanity past, present, and to come, conceive d of as this Great Being.” His Positivism (claiming to restrict itself to actual knowledge) is thus based on a “ conception ”—“ a true Great Being within us, whom we must >constantly aspire to maintain and even improve.” This system, says Mr Morley, is “ Utilitarianism crowned by a fantastic decoration ” : for Comte admits that “ utility remains the test of every institution, im- pulse, and act.” The outcome in plai n English is stated by Mr Morley. “ Society can only be regenerated by the greater subordination of politics to morals, by the moralisation of capital, by the renovation of the family, by a higher conception of marriage, and so on. These ends can only be reached by a hear tier development of the sympathetic instincts. The sympathetic instincts can only be developed by the religion of humanity.” It was scarcely worth while to waste a long life in writing and lecturing to pr ove this, adding a new being, or incomprehensible providence, called “ Humanity,” to puzzle the world.

Mr Morley concludes : “ We have said enough to show that, after per- forming a great and real service to thought, Comte almost sacri fi ced his claims to gratitude by the invention of a system that, as such, and independently of detached suggestions, is markedly retrograde.” He almost dei fi ed woman, and his history teac hes us how impossible it is even for a great thinker to advance beyond the in fl uences that have surrounded him, and which ha ve formed his experience. Potakara. Potaraka. The sacred mountain of the “ god who looks down ” (see Avalokit-Isvara), whether at Adam’s Peak or at the Potala of Lh ā sa (see Lamas). Pothos. Greek : “ desire ” (see Bu), a form of Eros (see Phoinikians) produced by the wind that blew over Chaos, as we read in the Theogony of Hesiod, “ From Chaos, Erebus, and ebon Night, Sprang Night and Day and shining air These to the loves of Erebus she gave.” Pra-bhava.

Sanskrit : “ Right hand forwards” (see Dak- shina). The Moslem Taw ā f, or circumambulation of the shrine, is performed in the opposite di rection (see Sir R. Burton, Pilgrimage to Mecca , ch. xxvii). The same traveller at Dahomey found that the soldiers walked round him keeping him on the left, but round the king keeping him on the right. The consecration of a Roman Catholic Church begins by going twice round it in procession with the left hand nearest it, and a third time in the opposite direction. On the fi rst two rounds the bishop begins at the north side (or Gospel side) of the altar, and returns to the south side ; and on the third he reverses this also. Pra-dh ā na. Sanskrit. The primary material, the “ matrix ” of Plato, a kind of paste ( Kalka ) in which good and evil are mingled, identi fi ed with Vishnu as existing in all things, and differing from Pra-kriti in being inert.

He is represented with a yellow crown, a girdle over the shoulder, and a bow of sugar cane, strung with bees (see K ā ma) : the quiver has fi ve arrows for the fi ve senses, these being tipped with fi ve fl owers. His standard has on it a fi sh, or a woman, and he rides a parrot (see Parrot). The name signi fi es superlative brilliance. Praj ā -pati. Sanskrit ; “ The lord of progeny,” or the creator. A Vedik god who became Br ā hma, and Indra, or drove the chariot of Siva. It became a general title for all creative gods (Muir, Sanskrit Texts , iv, pp. 17,49, 156,190). The legend states that he seduced his own daughter—for matter, whence creation is produced, is also the creation of the deity. Prajna. Sanskrit ; “ fore-knowledge ” ; the source of all supreme wisdom, especially that of Adhi-Buddha (“ the eternal wise one ”) in Tibet. Prajn ā -Paramita. Sanskrit : the “ perfection of fore-know- ledge.” An early Buddhist sacred writ ing, which teaches the illusory char- acter of all things, and Pyrrhonism rather than Nihilism (see Pyrrho) though Br ā hmans called such writings Nastika (“ nothingness ”), and said the authors were “ believers in an universal void ” (like the Aiyin or “ nothing ” of the K ̣ abbala); for the term is also said to be no more the name of a reality than is the Bodhisattva, or “ Buddha-hood ” to which it attaches. The germs of these doctrines are found by Burnouf in Buddhist Sutras, but Gotama himself knew nothing about such mysteries. Prakrit. See India. A general term for dialects superseded in literature by Sanskrit as the sacred language. The three great Prakrits, which long survived, were the Magadhi, S ā uraseni, and Mah ā - rashtri. Buddhism was spread abroad in many Prakrits, and in Dr ā vidian as well as Aryan dialects. P ā nini, and Katy ā -yana, in the 5th and 4th centuries B . C ., were grammarians who studied the Prakrits ; and Vararuchi was the author of the Prakrita-Prak ā sa, tracing their connection with Sanskrit (see Ā s ō ka). Prakriti.

A deity of the Lithuanians, on the W. borders of Russia, who on account. of the wickedness of the world sent the giants Wandu and Wejas (“ wind ” an d “ water ”) to destroy all.

A “ supreme Buddha ” who has reached the fi nal stage beyond that of Arahats, though they have attained Nirv ā na ; which seems to show that Nirv ā na is not extinction of in- dividuality. Pr ā na. Sanskrit : “ breath,” “ life ”—the supreme name of Br ā hma, and according to Vedantists one of the fi ve vital airs. In the Atharva Veda a hymn, probably as old as the 9th century B .

It is still so called, and is a very holy place of pilgrimage for Hindus, the word signifying “ sacri fi ce.” The legendary Sar ā svati is here said to join the other two rivers under ground, whence the place is called Tri-ven ī or “ triple braid.” When Akbar built his fort here in 1572 A . C ., the temple and tree must have been close to one of the rivers, for the emperor’s historian (’Abd el K ̣ ā der) says that natives cast themselves from the tree into the river. The river wall was found so hard to build that a Br ā hman had to be buried alive in the foundations before they would stand fi rm. At present the shrine, with its Aksheybat or “ undecaying banian tree,” is in the British fort. The tree is in a pillared court, but is sunk below th e ground level, shrouded in dark- ness and mystery, and all the more wo rshiped by tens of thousands of devout pilgrims. Heaps of human bo nes lie round it, testifying to the ghastly faith, which is only prev ented by British authority from resuming its old rites.

The situation between the rivers is regarded as perfect by Br ā hmans, and gifts here offered are, accordin g to Hindus, worth a thousand in any other place. The great river has often altered its course, and may some day overwhelm the shrine. Prayas. Sanskrit : “ atonement.” An offering of Soma to Agni is called Prayasitta as atoning for sin—an Indian Eucharist. Prayer. The natural cry for help of children in the darkness. It is an invocation, or an incantatio n, to draw the attention of a deity, or a spell to compel his presence and help. It becomes a talisman to ward off evil, as the Om of the Hindu, or the Ave of the Romanist. In Egyptian teb-teb is to pray, and some think Thebes was so named as a place of prayer. The sturdy Aryan stood to pray, with extended arms raised to heaven. The Oriental falls fl at on his face, in presence of the dread power whom he invokes. Others kneel to show their humility, or strike their foreheads on the ground ; the eyes must be cast down or closed , and the hands placed in the attitude of supplica- tion. Ignorant and humble persons de sire to learn some short formula acceptable to the gods ; or to have prayers made for them by persons better instructed, or more holy ; or to get them written in the proper words. Hence also the short formul a is again and again uttered, in “ vain repetitions ” like those of the Pater Noster, and Ave Maria. The Rig Veda directs that the G ā yatri prayer be repeated 3000 times to the sun, to atone for neglect and guilt ; but the fi rst line of the Mantra, or charm, is suf fi cient to represent the whole. In China the supplicant repeats “ Omito Fo ” (for Amita-Buddha), and in Japan “ Nama Am ē da Butsu,” or “ honour to the In fi nite One.” In Tibet the famous formula is “ Om ! ma ni padmi hum !” (see Om). The praying machine is the strangest of religious inventions, with its musical barrels driven round by the wind, or even by steam. The idea appears to be that prayers, thus brought to the sight of the deity, have been written in better words than the poor supplicant could himself frame—which is the argument in favour of all liturgies. But some swallow written prayers as pills, or forcibly spit them out at the image of the god. Mechanical prayer is not con fi ned to Asiatics, in a sense ; for priests are paid to repe at over and over again masses for the dead, much as the Tartar causes prayer for himself, and for the dead, to revolve in the drum driven by the water wheel. In East and West alike acted prayers are represented (as of old) by rites and ceremonies—as child ren play at events which are half real to them—and thus the wishes of the tribe are"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Prayer 148 clearly symbolised to the deity, and his attention is attracted, while offerings appease his anger (see Sacri fi ce). The supplicant may sit raising hands and voice to call his god, while his petition fl utters on a tree hard by, or revolves in the praying wheel ; and on the wild mountain side little bells tinkle on a bough, to call the attention of gods and of men. The modern Japanese hides the prayer wheel which he has adopted from others (Miss Gordon Cumming, Contemporary Review , Oct. 1888). At Pekin, in the Hall of Buddha (Fu-ku), are two great circular buildings, each 70 feet high, and each over an equally gigantic fi gure of Maitreya—the future Buddha ; these enclose great rotary cylinders, fuIt of niches for images of Buddhist saints, on which strips of paper, inscribed wi th prayers, are fastened. Thus, when the drum revolves, homage is done to all the saints at once. “ Some Lama monasteries deal thus with their 128 sacred books, and 220 volumes of commentary ” ; thus revolving libraries serve instead of reading the Scriptures, as revolving prayers serve for spoken petitions. Dr Edkins saw such a revolving library in the Ling-yin monastery at Hang-chow ; and another, octagonal in form and 60 ft. high, in the Wutai valley where there are 2000 Lamas, and upwards of 300 prayer wheels. One monastery uses the st eam of a kettle, which is ever boiling to make tea, in order to turn the wheel above, suspended from the ceiling (see Wanderings in China , ii, pp. 194, 195). Monks are paid to look after such machines, by gifts of food or otherwise ; and prayer poles are common near inns, or meeting places of pilgrims and merchants, where travellers have not much time for prayer. The wind fl utters the prayers on these poles, but the Tchu-chor, (or Indian Chakra), is more usual, being either a cylinder that can be turned by hand, or merely a wheel, connected with the Buddhist “ Wheel of the Law,” as signifying the religious cycle. The pilgrim Fa-Hien found these in use at Lad ā k in 400 A . C .; small attached bells attract good spirits, and frighten demons away. Some travellers carry the Tchu-chor with them, as containing prayers mo re elaborate and spiritual than any they could utter, which have been written for them by saintly monks, who are found at most shrines selling these, and also others written on fl ags to be placed on the poles and trees. Those who believe in gods listening to prayers think of them as neither all knowing, nor unchangeabl e : they hope to persuade them to change the laws of the universe in their favour, or to remind them of the supplicant’s existence. They ask the deity, as the bishop of Meath said ( Times , Oct. 1886), “ to adapt Himself and His actions to the varying actions and choices of His rational creatures.” The bishop acknowledges that, “ on grounds of pure reason,” we cannot expect such"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Prayer 149 adaptation. Hence prayer is regarded as an aspiration, bene fi ting the supplicant by reminding him of one who, he believes, will care for him, rather than as it request for something which may not be good for him. Buddha long ago argued that a prayer could tell God nothing that he did not know, nor al ter his intention ; and he therefore recommended men only to meditate, an d aspire to that which is good. Yet his disciples are not content so to do, fearing many spirits, and seeing demons everywhere ( Journal Anthrop. Instit ., Nov. 1882, p. 118). Among them, as with us, the wicked are often more prayer-ful than the good. The robber prays, in church or temple, before he sets out to murder or to steal, and all gamblers keep charms, and divine emblems near them, such as are found in every pirate junk. Most worshipers prepare themselves for prayer, by some puri fi ca- tion or change of dress. Anciently they stripped off all their clothes, or painted themselves ; and in time they put on their richest robes and jewels, to appear before the de ity in their best. The Jew still puts on his Tallith and phylacteries, and the priest his sacred garments, and symbols. The prayer usually begins with laudatory epithets, applied to the god, these being frequently repeated, as representing what is most admired in the divine characte r—qualities of power and pity, of wisdom and love towards those who serve him, or hatred of those who do not believe. The actual petition comes at the end, after the deity has thus been propitiated. The more savage the worshiper the grosser is his fl attery. Yet even savages write beautiful prayers (see Khonds, and Patagonians). The savage strive s by importunity, by gifts, and by tortures or humiliations, to bribe his god, or to compel him in pity to interfere. His attention must be ar oused, as when Elijah said to the priests of Ba’al : “ Either he is talkin g, or he is pursuing, or he is in ajourney, or peradventure he sleepeth and must be awaked ” (1 Kings xviii, 27). Some simple people, like children, have even whipped their gods to make them listen, by fl ogging the image. The gods who failed were cast aside, and successful gods are still promoted by the emperor to higher honours in Chin a. The gods receive what man most prizes, be it children, cattle, or wealth. But most races some- what distrust the sense of justice and the attentiveness of their gods. They think best to employ his favourites—priests or saints—to inter- cede in their behalf. The Hebrew s so. sought for intercession by a prophet (Gen. xx, 7 ; 1 Kings xiii, 6). Christ did not recognise the nece ssity of any public rites, or liturgies, or litanies. He bade men not to use “ vain repetitions.” He told them to pray in private, and to defer to the will of their Father. But the ignorant still attempt to revive the older idea of"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Phr ē n 150 importuning God till He is weary and grants what is asked. We can well remember, as a zealous subscriber to the orphanage of George Muller, which was said to receive Hs funds in direct answer to prayer, that we well knew what was expected of every convert, as to enlisting the sympathies of all whom he could in fl uence, representing the urgent needs of the institution. In 1883, Sir F. Galton ( Macmillan’s Magazine ), gave statistics to show that prayer did not affect the chances of life. Kings and nobles, who are most prayed for, with magistrates and clergy, are really the most short-lived, though sur- rounded with every circumstance favourable to their health, such as wealth, care, and ease. Insurance companies do not ask less payment from them than from others. C hurches are not more safe from fi re and storm than theatres, nor are misssonary ships safer than those of pirates and slavers. Yet men and women still fall down before stocks and stones, and ask that the universe may be deranged for their bene- fi t. Prayer is only possible to those who believe in a personal God outside his creation, able to change its mechanical action in a moment, and often so doing. The seven petiti ons of Christ’s prayer (Matt. vi, 9-13 ; Luke xi, 2-4) may have been put together by himself, or by his disciples ; but they are all anci ent Hebrew petitions. The Revised Version (on evidence that is much disputed) has gone back from the words “ Deliver us from evil ” to reassert the existence of a mythical devil. Prayer used always to be conjoi ned with dances and song, also with bodily mutilations (gashings and burnings) in time of great trouble, and with sacri fi ces, including hecatombs of human beings, or other bodily offerings (see Gosains). It was thought pleasing to the gods to degrade the body, and to thwart the natural affections : to live a life of solitude and prayer, in sordid misery. The more ignorant the race, the greater is the number of spirits, saints, and intercessors invoked. Hell resounded with prayers, such as that of the rich man to Abraham, begging for a drop of water. Cruel indeed was the deity who could hear such cries unmoved in a heaven of rest ; nor need we wonder that men prayed for the dead and for the cessa- tion of the useless misery that they had imagined. Phr ē n. Greek : “ mind.” From the same root come the words Phron ē ma for “ desire,” and our “ frenzy,” signifying violent emotion. Paul distinguishes the Phron ē ma of the fl esh from that of the spirit (Rom. viii, 6). Plato speaks of the soul struggling against desire. Aristotle ( Nicomach.

The Greek phallic deity. The word compares with the Norse Friofr , “ fruitful ” (see Frey), and this god of gardens was identi fi ed with Hermes, and Pan, and was called Fecundus, and Mutunus. He was the deity of all production, seen even in the sun and moon (see P ā la). Prith ā . Prith ī . Prithu. Prithivi. Words for the earth godess in Sanskrit, equivalent to the Norse Freya as meaning “ pro- ductive ” (see Bar). The earth mother (or cow) is usually Prithivi, daughter and consort of Prithu, the lord of earth, and fi rst of human kings. She is also the wife of the Pandus or “ ancients ” (see Pandu). Prithu is descended from the Ikshvakus or “ sugar cane ” race, and he introduced fruits and vegetables. Prithivi as a cow fl ed from him (like Io), but begged for a calf, when Prithu produced Sv ā yam-bhu Manu, the “ self-existent man.” She then gave milk : the gods, N ā gas, and men were thereby nourished, and earth was at rest. Prithu has a genealogy of seven gene rations from Pururavas, and his brother is Nish ā da, who sprang from the thigh of their father Vena. Prokn ē . Greek : probably “ dew-born,” from Prokos a “ dew- drop,” the root in Sanskrit being Prush “ to sprinkle.” She was the daughter of Hers ē (“ dew ”) and of Erekhtheus (“ the earth man ”), wronged, according to the Thrakian legend, by her husband King Tereus. She wept to death, but was changed into a swallow, the bird of spring. Her sister is Philomela the “ nightingale.” Prokris. Greek : “ dewy.” See Prokn ē . She was the wife of Kephalos (“ the head ” of the sun), slain with the spear of Artemis, by Kephalos himself, whom she jealously watched as loving E ō s, the “ dawn.” The magic spear and hound which she received from Artemis, or Hekat ē (the moon) were used against her. She hid in the thicket (where the last dew remains at dawn), and died of the sun’s spear, or ray. Promakhos. Greek : “ fore- fi ghting,” a title of Ath ē n ē . Prom ē theus. See Pramatha.

In Vedik mythology Agni (“ fi re ”) is the messenger of the gods, bringing the divine fi re to earth, for the Bhrlgus or original men : for Indra fi rst made fi re by rubbing together two ( fl int) stones. Even the wild Maoris, Australians, and Iroquois of N. America, have legends of a hero who stole the fi re of heaven for men. Prom ē theus is a Titan, or giant of earth, and is said to have pitied men living like wild beasts in cold sunless caves : wherefore he stole “ a ferule of fi re, and took it to earth,” teaching them to cook food, to reap and plough, to make houses and ships, to discern the seasons, and to cure di sease by roots and herbs. He was thus the friend of man, and became Providence or “ forethought.” He was the son of the Titan Iapetos loved at fi rst by Zeus, and then condemned to torments. The sun—H ē rakl ē s—found him chained to the icy crags, his liver renewed daily when eaten by the eagle, and released him by permission of the go ds : for the sun frees all from the grasp of winter. Prom ē theus foretold to Zeus that his son would dethrone him, but refusing to say mo re, was cast into Tartaros.

The belief that men are able to foretell events is common to all religions, and must stand or fall with belief in revelation (see Inspiration). The ecstatic state was induced by music (2 Kings iii, 15) ; and Saul, under the in fl uence of the “ spirit of Elohim,” tore off his clothes and lay naked for, a day and a night (1 Sam. xix, 24).

Thus “ Jeremy the prophet ” is quoted (Matt. xxvii, 9) in connection with the “ potter’s fi eld,” whereas in the Hebrew the words occur in Zechariah (xi, 13), being correctly rendered “ cast it into the treasury ” ( K ō neut ē rion in the Greek trans- lation), and having no connection with a “ potter ” at all. We do not know if Christ himself spoke of the law as written by Moses (he seems often to have referred only to “ them of old time ”), or attributed the Psalm (cx) to David speaking “ by the Holy Ghost ” : these testimonies of prophecy to himself may be the wo rk of disciples, but Bishop Gore is constrained to say that such statem ents are untrue if they were really uttered, though they were common be liefs among the Jews in the times in which Christ lived. The Hebrew prophets predicted events about to happen, as did Muh ̣ ammad when he foretold the victory of the Greeks over the Persians. Sometimes they were right in their fore- casts, sometimes they were wrong ; they foresaw nothing that human sagacity might not lead them to ex pect. To satisfy us that a real prophecy has been made we require (see Mr. W. R. Greg, Creed of Christendom , pp. 128, 131) to have precise information on four points : (1) What event it was intended to predict : (2) that the prediction is precise and not vague : (3) that the event is shown to have occurred exactly as predicted : (4) that no human sagacity would account for the forecast. We moreover require evidence that the record is ancient, and not the result of reco llections after the event, or of later tradition. Mr Greg says that “ it is probably not too much to af fi rm ,that we have no instance in the . . . Old Testament ” meeting these requirements. [The famous predic tion of Jeremiah (xxv, 11 : see Dan. ix 2) was evidently believed in the 2nd century B .

Dr Cheyne ( Wisdom of the Old Testament , 1886) thinks that the remarkable “ Praise of wisdom ” in the fi rst nine chapters, “ preluding the anthology ascribed to Solomon,” is as early as the 7th century B .

The second part ends with the statement that “ the prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.” Critical writers, however, attribute few Psalms to the period preceding the captivity, and regard most of them as of the Makkabean age.

We read also of Israel in trouble (xxv, 22), and of a tabernacle instead of a temple (xxvii, 5 ; see xliii, 3). In the th ird hook the temple is described as plundered (lxxiv), which fi rst happened when Shishak invaded Palestine after the death of Solomon. The tone of the Psalm against Ephraim (lxxviii, 9) is not such as would have been probable till after the separation of Israel and Judah.

The Psalms of the fourth and fi fth books are generally acknowledged to be those of the temple after the captivity. The Psalms also differ much in the use of the names Yahveh and Elohim, and in one case we have a double recension giving these name s as alternatives (xiv, liii). One of the later Psalms (cviii) is also made up of two old ones (lvii, 7-11 ; lx, 5-12). The most recent discovery is that of Mr J. W. Thirtle ( Psalm Titles , 1904) in connection with the titles.

They include Miktam “ engraved,” or “ written on a tablet,” and Mashkil “ selected.” Mr Thirtle points out that the fi rst part of the title often belongs to the preceding psalm (compare Habakkuk iii, 19), and so arranged they are appropriate to the contents. Thus ’Alamoth (Psalm xlvi) means “ girls,” and it is natural that Psalm xlv should be sung by the bride’s companions. The title Yonath ’al Merhuk ī m , “ the dove at distant places ” (lvi), appears to apply to the preceding Psalm, in which the dove in the wilderness is noticed (lv, 6, 7). The discovery also aids us to understand the titles Sheminith (“ eights ”), and Shoshann ī m (“ sixes ”), which, when properly applied, refer to Psalms divided by the Selah, or “ pause,” into groups of verses of eight and six lines respectively. We moreover thus escape from the double authorship ascribed to one Psalm (lxxxviii) as the title now stands. These remarks point to the antiquity of the titles ; but they do not of course prove that the ascription of any Psalm to David is certain. Nor do the words Li David (“ belonging to David ”) of necessity mean that he wrote the ode, for in one case (xx) the Psalm is clearly “ for ” and not “ by ” David, ending as it does with the words “ Lord save the king, hear us when we call.”—E D .] Psalms of Solomon.

Pshent. See Pasent. Psukh ē . Psyche. Greek : “ the soul ” (see Spirits, and Soul). The radical meaning of the word is “ breath.” The Greek myths concerning Psyche and Venus, an d Psyche and Oupid (Eros), are sometimes beautiful and instructive, and the early Christians seem to have adopted them (see Cupid). Psyche was the youngest of three daughters of a king, whose beauty roused the envy of her sisters and even of Aphrodit ē herself, who treated her as a slave (for Venus often enslaves the soul). Grief and care, the cruel ministers of Aphrodit ē , set her impossible tasks : sh e was to draw water from a fountain guarded by dragons, to c limb inaccessible mountains, to seek sheep with golden wool, to separate the mixed grain in huge heaps, to descend to hell and fetch a box which none must open. Aphrodit ē had ordered her son Eros to inspire Ps yche with love for the vilest of men, but Eros loved her when he sa w her. Psyche in her curiosity opened the magic box, and was overpowered by the vapour that issued thence. Eros quickened her by a to uch of his arrow, and carried her to a cave on a wild mountain, where (others said) her parents hid her to frustrate the prophecy of an oracle which foretold for her an unhappy marriage. The jealous sisters told her that the lover who came to her in the darkness was a hideous monster. Eros had said that if she ever saw him clearly he must leave her (for mystery is needful for love) ; in her curiosity she again transgressed, and trembling as she saw her beautiful and divine lover, she let fall on him the oil of her lamp, when he at once fl ed. But Eros per- suaded Zeus to save her from cruel Aphrodit ē , and Hermes was sent to take her soul to heaven, where she dwells with Eros, their children being “ Love ” and “ Pleasure.” The allegory sbows us the growth of the idea of Love (human and divine) in communion with the soul (see Bear and Urv ā s ī ).

They are rude savages, worshiping trees, especially those of the Ficus genus, under which they place lingams, yonis, and heaps of stones. The word in the plural is Puliyar. They say that the stones represent the “ author of all good ” (Rev. S. Mateer, Travancore , p. 37). They are a degraded people, oppressed, and oppressing others.

The word (like Pyrenee) appears to come from an old root for “ hill.” [Akkadian bur “ hill.”—E D .] In Babylonia these stepped monuments (Ziggurat) were roughly oriented with the angles to the cardinal points ; in Egypt the sides faced the four points. The pyramid reached India from Babyloni a (see Architecture), and America probably from India ; for the Mexica n Teo-kalli or “ god's house,” with its steps leading up, resembles the la ter shrines of Barmah and Java.

Siva as the “ ancient.” Purgatory. See Hel. This idea would naturally arise from man’s sense of justice, as heaven became too holy for the imperfect, and hell too horrible to be the fate of the erring. Among Hindus there were many hells, but they are no more eternal than the gods. The Romanist thus believes that ther e are two : one eternal, the other merely “ purging ” the imperfect fo r admission, after punishment, to rest in heaven. Buddhists and Christians alike elaborated these tem- porary hells in the Middle Ages (see Upham, Buddhism : Coleman, Hinduism ). The purgatory of St Patrick (see Mr T. Wright, Legends of Purgatory, Hell, and Paradise , 1844) was famous from the 6th to the 17th century A . C .; nor is it yet forgotten. In 1880 we saw the pilgrimage starting fo r Lough Derg in Donegal, and heard of the miseries endured. The sacred cave on the island appears to have been an old mephitic cavern, like that of Delphi, and some were asphyxiated in it, till the power of the vapour began to decrease in our 17th century, as it did at Delphi about the Christian era. The entrance was lost sight of, and vainly sought by foreign pilgrims ; and Pope Alexander VI, regarding the whole legend as imposture, ordered the rites to cease, which was effected by St Patrick's day 1497. Yet we fi nd the wonders of Lough Derg still denounced by the Pope in 1742, and attested by learned doctors of theology. Indeed, “ two or three years after this date Pope Be nedict XIV preached, and published at Rome, a sermon in favour of Patrick’s Purgatory ” (Wright, p. 159). “ This revived the pilgrimage, and the Irish priesthood rendered futile all attempts to destroy it.” They found that the old cave was closed because it was not a real one, and the old belief was revived. The proprietors received some hundreds a year from thousands of pilgrims, and ballads were circulated celebrating the marvels of the sacred cavern. Literature about pu rgatory and hell began to be the rage in the 13th century, and they continued to be described in the 14th by Dante, and by others down to John Bunyan about 1660. Purgatory is exclusively a Romanist dogma.

Yayati was the son of Nahusha (the snake) son of Ā yas, son of Pururavas (see that name). The family was that whence sprang the great lunar race of Kurus and Pandus (see Br ā hma). Puru gave his youth and vigour to his father, who gave it back after 1000 years when he wearied of the world, and thus Puru was made superior to his brethren, as monarch of Prat- ist ā na. The Puravas at fi rst aided the Tritsus, Arnas, and Chitra- rathas, who were Aryans according to the Rig Veda ; and the sons of Puru’s brethren, Druhyu and Turvasu, were Bhojas (“ cowboys ”), and Yavanas or “ Greeks ” : those of Anu were outcasts, but the Puravas were apparently “ citizens .” All these tribes, or classes, spread along the valleys of the Indus and Jamuna, and in the Panj ā b.

The language of Afghans, regarded as a pure Aryan dialect between the Persian and the Sanskrit. Darmesteter says that it is derived from the Zend (or old Persian) as spoken in Arakhosia, and is only distinct after about 300 B . C . The Afghans include all the tribes ruled from K ̣ abul, and the Path ā ns, Pushtus, Afridis, and Waziris (see Major Raverty, and Sir Thos. Holdich, Journal Rl. Geogr. Socy ., Oct. 1898 : Jan. 1899 ; Journal Anthrop. Instit ., Aug.-Nov. 1899). Pushtu, or Pakhtu, according to Da rmesteter, comes from Parshti or “ Persian ” ( Afghans , 1890), and applies to the highlander, as con- trasted with the Tajik lowlander. They are the Parsu ē tai of Ptolemy, and the Paktues of other Greek writers. The Pushtu and Pakhtu dialects use the older Iranian P for the modern Persian F . Pakhtu prevails in the Suleim ā n ranges ; but here Greeks settled largely, and Dr Bellew proposes to recognise them in such Afghan tribes, as Ludi (Lydians), Suri (Syria ns), Ghilji (Kilikians), Batani (Bithynians), Muzazi (Mysians), Pamuli (Pamphilians), and Yani (Ionians) (see Journal Rl. Asiatic Socy ., March 1892). The Path ā ns are Parthians (see that heading), and the Parshti become the Par ā sa, or Prasii, of the Ganges valley, called Pharasii by Ourtius, showing the spread of the Persians far East. Many of the Pushtu-speaking people declare themselves to be descendants of the Be ni-Israil, or Jews, as for instance the Durani dynasty, rising in 1750 A .

There was probably a strong Aramean element in Persia (see P ā hlavi) from an early age, and in the Middle Ages there were many trib es of Jews in Baktria, whence arose the legend of the “ lost te n tribes ” beyond the Oxus—well known to medireval Jews.

C .) went with Alexander the Great to India, and returned to Greece, where he lived in poverty but much honoured. He left no writings, but—like Timon of Phlious (325 to 285 B . C .) who ridiculed philosophy—he appears to have been an Agnostik, teaching that we know nothing really of the nature of things, and should with- hold judgment, and maintain a calm and imperturbable serenity. His skepticism extended even to doubting the truth of doubts. Pythagoras. Much of our knowledge as to this Buddha of the West comes from Iamblikhos, who was a Neo-Platonist of Syria, a mystic disciple of Plotinus living 900 years later than Pythagoras. Pausanias says that Pythagoras was “ of the house of Ankaios . . . his father being Mnesarkhos, son of Euphron, son of Hippasos, who fl ed from his home in the Peloponnesos to Samos, on the rise of the H ē rakleidai.” Hippasos seems to have founded the sect which developed into the philosophic sch ool of his great-grandson, but he was drowned for writing his Mustikos Logos , becoming a martyr to popular and priestly prejudice. He ventured to suggest that a sphere consisted of twelve pentagons ; but it was a day of small things, and he was regarded as an impious enquirer into the mysteries of nature. He laboured at the foundations of a vast pyramid on which a Buddha, a Christ, or a Mul,mmmad, might hereafter stand to be worshiped by all. Hippasos seems to have settled in Magna Grecia (S. Italy), and to have founded the sect in Crotona and Metapontum. They taught that tire was the origin of all things, the Arkh ē or “ beginning,” and that all things are in constant motion following fi xed laws (as Diogenes Laertius tells us) ; but this Arkh ē was material, and not a fanciful system of “ numbers ” as Pythagoreans taught a century later. [The name Puth-agoras may signify a “ gatherer of deep wisdom.” It has also been explained by the Sanskrit Budha-guru , “ teacher of wisdom.”—E D .] There are many legends of this teacher, who is said to have tamed wild beasts, to have appeared in two places at once, and to have had a golden thigh ; he was also a prophet foretelling the future.

In the time of Pythagoras, Buddhism was spreading in India (see Buddha), and his ascetik philosophy much resembled that of the Buddhas. Xenophanes, one of the early Eleatik school then fl ourishing in the West, speaks of Pythagoras, as does Herakleitos ; and his philosophy in fl uenced Sokrat ē s, Plato, and Aristotle ; but it is chie fl y set forth by Diogenes Laertius, Porphyry, and Iamblikhos, who seem to have drawn from a work on Pythagoras by Aristotle. Mnesarkhos, father of Pythagoras, was an engraver of seals and amulets, and a merchant. He is also called Marmakos, and D ē maratos, and is represented as a Tyrrhenian. He traded in Magna Grecia, and Pythagoras as a youth seems to ha ve accompanied him, and to have learned much in Egypt, and Babylo n, studying geometry, astronomy, and religion, till—at the age of 40—he had become famous for his knowledge. He has left us no writings, any more than did Buddha or Christ, and he came to be regard ed as an incarnation of Apollo, just as other great teachers—even including Muh ̣ ammad—have been dei fi ed. His face shone like that of Moses ; and Abaris the Scythian hero fl ew to him on a golden arrow : his real history is thus obscured, as in other cases, by myths that have gathered round his name. The secrecy which is said to have marked the Pythagorean teaching was no doubt necessary among wild and fanatical populations ; but Pytha- goras, like Apollonius of Tyana, seem s to have lived quietly intent on acquiring knowledge ; and among modern Buddhists the monks and nuns of the Vih ā ras, or monastries, have nothing to reveal to those who do not desire to join their faith. The Pythagorean philosophy was founded on numbers—as, for that matter, is the chemistry of our own time—and much was taught as to odd and even numbers , and opposites ; as also among Buddhists we fi nd many categories and lists, and many contrasts such as Aristotle also enumerates. Th e number “ seven ” was sacred, and called “ Parthenos ” or virgin, because indivisible though including one, two, and three. The universe is said to bave been conceived of as a sphere with a central fi re, and Pythagoras spoke of ten spheres, heavenly orbs, or concentric regions—one of stars, one of fi ve planets, one of sun, moon, and earth, and one of the Antikhthon, or “ anti- earth,” the fi ery centre. This rude system included such elements of truth as to cause Copernicus to be afterwards called a Pythagorean. In religion this philosopher taught the existence of the soul, and of heaven and hell, with metempsychosis, or migration of the soul through many forms, including those of the lower animals. The severe"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Pythagoras 165 asceticism of the Pythagoreans reappeared in Orphik and other mysteries, so that their beliefs closely resembled those common among Br ā hmans and Buddhists quite as earl y in India. They also im- proved the study of mathematics, before the appearance of Euclid and Arkhimed ē s (see Aristotle, Metaphysics , I, v). Pherek ū d ē s of Suros was teaching metempsychosis in the same age, and is said by some to have been the instructor of Pythagoras : they both differed from Gotama Buddha in holding strongly the belief in a Theos or personal God ; and, according to La ctantius, Pythagoras spoke of God as supreme, invisible, void of passion, and not “ an object of sense ” : “ an universal intelligent spirit, giving life to all nature, and per- vading it ; not sitting silent and apart ”—a view which was then very common all over Asia, as were the ascetik rules regarding food, abstention from fl esh especially on certain days, and entirely from fi sh and beans, which Pythagoras is said to have commanded (see Beans and Fish). H ē rakleitos says that this great teacher was “ a man of singular abilities, and great attainments,” and several im- portant propositions of Euclid are a ttributed originally to Pythagoras, with theories as to medicine, and the arithmetical relations of musical scales. We wonder not therefore that he was believed to hold com- munion with the gods, especially with the Hyperborean Apollo, and to have had the gift of prophecy. Buddhism was perhaps already penetrating among the Dacæ and Getæ in Europe (see Essenes). Grote assures us that Pythagoras “ was no impostor, but the revealer of a good life calculated to raise men to a higher level.” He was believed to have founded the school of Orotona, but Ritter thinks that the system had obtained a footing in Greece and Ionia before it spread to Italy. All religious systems are gradually evolved, so that there was a Buddhism before Buddha, and a Christianity before Christ. In Crotona (Müller, Dorians , ii, p. 189) Pythagoras sought peacefully to organise an ideal kingdom of peace, which he could not found among the ever warring Greeks. His eloquence and example induced the citizens to aban don luxury and vice, and to lead a pure and peaceful life. Thus Crotona became the Nalanda of the West. Like the Essenes four cent uries later men here advocated a common purse, and—as in Sparta or in Krete—they held communal meals in public, eating at one table, but preserving great temperance. Nor were women excluded : for, like Buddhism, the Pythagorean teaching was extended to both sexes, as far as the rules of social polity were concerned. Politics, sc ience, and the arts, were equally taught with religion and ethiks.

The student was directed to maintain silence for fi ve years (see Apollonius), such as Buddha is said to have observed for seven years. After this. probation he was said freely to behold the face of the master, who thought it vain to attempt his education till then. The initiation into all the usages of the sect then followed, and employment in accord with ascertained abilities. Daily gymnastic exercise was prescribed, and many abstained from all animal food. These rules may be found also among Spartans and Orphik initiates, and to some extent in Krete. The teacher aimed at a high standard of bearing and character, personal and public conduct—re fl ecting, as Pythagoras said, the harmony of the universe. He himself refused to occupy any of fi cial' position, but urge d other men to become Prutan ē s, and serve the state. He called himself only a Philosophos , or “ wisdom lover,” and desired to see a new Dorian state in Italy ruled by an aristocracy of talent (K. O. Müller, Dorians , iii, pp. 9, 16). The ideal was too advanced for the age, and the severity of the system roused the wrath of the ignorant in Crotona, and in neighbouring cities, leading to a rebellion in which the Senators and Senate-house were burned, an d some say Pythagoras himself and all his works : but others that he withdrew to Metapontum, and starved himself to death. He is supposed to have left a wife and daughter, if not two sons ; the sect survived for some centuries, and was merged fi nally in that of Plato. Aristotle instituted a comparison between the teaching of Pythagoras and that of the Timæus (see Plato). It recognised the unlimited, or eternal, in time, space, and motion, and the unity of the universe as God, who is both in fi nite and one in number. It recognised the monads, or indivisible atoms, as the base of a ll forms, calling them “ indivisible particles like mathematical points in void space,” yet not without magnitude, though in fi nitely small. It acknowledged the wondrous potentiality of matter, able—as Anaximander said—“ to produce every variety of manifestation ho wever contrary to each other ” —the primeval something (Apeiron or Arkh ē ) being capable of eternal production from the “ Absolute and Divine Unity.” The Pythagorean strove to show this from the law of numbers, and from the harmony of the universe, much as Drummond speaks to us now of the “ Natural Law in the Spiritual World.” It gave rise to many mystic ideas, as when Pythagoreans dedicated the angles of a triangle to Rhea, D ē met ē r, and H ē stia, those of a square to Kronos, Hades, Pan, an d Dionusos, or the dodecagon to Zeus.

They taught that “ the universe is imperishable and unw earied, subsisting from eternity to eternity, controlled by one akin to it . . . eternal, abiding, and unmoved.” The divine ideal “ was not a germ, or principium , whence all sprang,” but was the soul of the universe, good and evil being the creation of matter, which obstructs the efforts of the divinity. From the universal soul our souls have sprung, as Aristotle says, being “ motes seen fl oating in the sunbeams.” The simile is rude, for such motes are often but dead matter. Yet without matter there is no beam. The Pythagorea ns, like Jains or Buddhists, strove to rise to the contemplation of the “ higher wisdom,” which was greater in their eyes than that of earthly creatures. Happiness, according to Pythagoras, “ is the perfection of all the virtues—the harmony of the soul-when a serene and tranquil mind seeks to unite itself with Deity, and to divo rce itself from the corporeal prison, yet not by committing suicide which is unlawful.” Ascetik practices were commended, as tending to such tranquillity, and music was to be cultivated as in fl uencing man in the control of his passions (though Plato makes distinction, as regards music suitable and unsuitable). Those who failed in such control must undergo the severe discipline of rebirth in lower forms, or even the pains of Tartaros. Python. The word meant “ stinking ” according to the Greeks : the python slain by Apollo being a marsh dragon, and the pythoness of Delphi living in a cave full of mephitic vapour. It may, however, in both cases signify one dwelling in a cavern (see Put). Pyx. A “ box ” to hold the consecrated Host, or wafer, when reserved, as by Roman Catholics, in order that it may not be destroyed or polluted : for mice and even dogs had been known to discover the bread and to devour it. A canon by Ælfric (957 A . C .) states (see Notes and Queries , 2nd Oct. 1897) that : “ Some priests reserve the Housel that was hallowed on Easter Day over year for sick men. But they do very greatly amiss who cause the holy Housel to putrefy, and"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Quail 168 are unwilling to understand how great satisfaction the penitential directeth in relation to them if the Housel be putre fi ed, or musty, or lost, or if a mouse eateth it, through carelessness.” About 1420 (Myre’s Duties of a Parish Priest ) we read : “ Do up so that Sacrament That it be sure, in such way That no beast touch it may. For if were eaten by mouse or rat Forty days in penance There shall be for that mischance.” The Pyx, in the form of a dove, was therefore hung by a chain over the altar. The commonly sung Protestant verse accused the Romanists of such practices. “ They make a god for mice and rats And say the same is He.” Anne Askew the martyr, in 1546, said that it was falsely suggested to her that she had asked, “ Whethe r a mouse eating the host received God or no ?” Bishop Stephen Gardiner said, “ Believe that a mouse cannot devour God,” yet that “ Chri st’s body may as well dwell in a mouse as in Judas.” Friar Peryn (according to Bale) proclaimed that ! the sacrament eaten of a mouse is the very and real body of Christ.” . . . “ Yet is Christ’s body not then consumed.” These are dif fi culties roused by the dogma of Transubstantiation. Q The letter Q is the guttural K ̣ oph , or hard K ̣ of Semitic alpha- bets, the Greek Koppa , which soon fell out of their alphabet as unnecessary. It is not used in Etruskan, Umbrian, Oskan, or Messa- pian inscriptions, but occurs in the oldest Pelasgik alphabet of Italian tombs, and was included, in its original place before R, in the Latin alphabet, as Q, with the sound of K followed by U as a vowel.

The sun and moon complained to Vishnu, and he assumed the form of the lovely ma id Mohini, persuading the Daityas to permit him to distribute the Ā mrita or nectar. Rahu saw that she passed over the demons, and he a ssumed the disguise of a god, and sitting among gods he received his share ; but Vishnu cut off his head which, while the body fell to earth, became immortal in heaven, and was always at enmity with the sun and moon.

Sanskrit : Raja-putra or “ king’s son.” A powerful race in India, claiming descent from the sun, moon, and fi re, and by faith followers of the sainted Agastya of Mt. Abu in Rajput ā na. They have striven for some 2000 years for supremacy in India, calling Ayodha, or Oudh, their cradle-land. In our 7th century the State of Oudh is said by Hiuen Tsang to have been 667 miles in circuit, and was ruled by Rajput Bais, one of 36 solar clans. The race seems to have extended over most of Gangetic India, and was connected with the legendary glories of M ā gadha, and Math ū ra. The rulers however were not of the same race as the ruled, and only a tithe of the inhabi- tants of Rajput ā na are Rajputs, ruling Dr ā vidians. Their language is Hindi, and they have long held orthodox Aryan faiths. They have a;ways been ruled by independent Rajas or Peshwas, allied for self- defence, and friendly to the D ā syas or non-Aryans (see Mr C. Johnston on “ Red Rajputs,” Asiatic Quarterly , Oct. 1893). The J ā ts and other tribes have mingled with the Rajputs ; but, according to the Vedas and Upanish ā ds, the latter are essentially a rohita , or “ ruddy,” warrior race, striving for independence against Br ā hmans ; and the Raja-rishis (“ royal saints ”), or Rajaniya-rishis, are prominent sages in the Vedas, including Manu, Ida, and Visva-mitra , to whom probably the Gayatri, or ever holy “ mother of Vedas,” is to be ascribed : for, as Mr Johnston says, “ did not Br ā hma sit at the foot of the Kshatriya (or warrior caste) in the words of the greatest Upanishad ?” The oldest of Rajput dynasties—the R ā nas of Mewar (Ud ā ip ū r) still unite priestly and royal powers like Roman emperors. In east and west alike priests have ever attempted to prevent the monarch from being also the head of the Church. But Visva-mitra was the son of the king of Kan ō j, and also the hotri —priest or seer—in the legend of Haris-chandra. In the Rig Veda (iii) he demands of Indra the rank of both Raja and Rishi, and in the Aitareya Br ā hmana he appears as pre-eminent in knowledge of the mysticism of the Upanish ā ds.

The Yadu, or Chandra-vansa (“ moon race ”), includes (1) Yadus , with 8 clans, descended from Krishna, under the Bhatta chiefs in Katch and Jeysulm ī r ; (2) the Tuars descended from the somewhat mythical monarch Vikram- ā ditya of Malwa (56 A . C .) : III. The third rank is that of the Agni-kulas, with 4 tribes, descended from Agastya a celebrated Rishi, who is said to have written parts of the Rig Veda ; they include (1) Pouars or Prumars , with 35 branches from the Indus to Malwa ; (2) Parihara , with 12 clans, some, like the preceding, being Moslems ; (3) Chalukyas , with 16 branches (see Chalukyas) ; and (4) Chohans , with 24 clans, who once ruled in Delhi, founded Ajmir in 145 A . C ., and ruled in Kota, Bundi, Jhalore, Sirohi, etc. For at least 18 centuries all kings and rulers of India have desired alliance with the blue blood of the three solar families of the fi rst class of Rajputs ; and Mosl em emperors not less than Dr ā vidian rulers have begged the hand of so me Rajput princess. Scions of imperial Delhi, not less than wild Bh ī ls, or Gonds, glory in a Rajput descent, often through a stolen Rajput mother. Often have we seen a naked savage with only a belt for his ever open knife, bow and arrow in hand, draw himself up proudly, and exclaim “ I am a Rajput ” ; and though non-Aryan, hi s claim is often allowed by pure Rajputs as real. Even the proud “ Lord of Amber ” (Jaipur), of the solar Rajput race, submits to be installed by a wild non-Aryan Mina, who marks his forehead with blood drawn from his great toe. Yet there is no more exclusive race than the Rajput of the fi rst class, who—proud of his lineage—will die rather than do anything he thinks mean or unworthy, though the cruel torture, starvation, or murder of an enemy is of no account in his eyes. Many noble qualities, much generosity and dash, distinguish the Rajput : the saddle, spur, and spear are his, though we have now induced some 80 or 90 of the tribes to pursue agriculture and trade. Many of their proud chiefs will not hold intercourse with any of lower rank except in presence of an European, to say nothing of eating, or of inter- marriage, with them.

We have seen Moslem Rajputs guard- ing the relics of some Hindu pir or ancestor; and non-Aryan Rajputs adoring the spirits of the woods, and engaged in the -coarsest rites of serpent and lingam worship, abhorrent to the pious Hindu. Along the R ā vi river in the Panj ā b there is a large population of Moslem Rajputs. In Agra and Allahabad, where 2 4 1 millions are called Rajputs, they are of many sects and races: and in the Sont ā li districts of the south, many non-Aryans clai m the name, having been ruled by Rajputs, before their power was brok en by the Moslem invaders about our 13th century. The Rajputs of Agra and Mathura gradually spread over the deserts, and bright oases, of Rajput ā na, which they called Marusthi (“ the region of death ”) a name no longer applicable, as we know from fi ve years’ experience even in time of famines in India. The desert air invigorated the Rajput, who pushed east to rich M ā lwa, and south to the richer Gujer ā t and Kathiawar, showing great capacity in war and government. The royal saints Vikram- ā ditya, and Sali-v ā hana, whose eras are acknowleged throughout India, were Yadu Rajputs. The Agni-kulas of Mt. Abu became “ regenerated Br ā hmans,” and yet earlier were Langas, a sect of Chalukyas who opposed the Bh ā ts (see Balfour, Indian Cyclop .; and Sir W. Elliot, Numismat. Oriental .). From these also came the lesser chiefs of Rajist ā n, and hundreds of others ruling willing subjects, Aryan or non-Aryan, from Delhi and the Indus to the Ran of Katch. An Agni-kula ruler of Malwa (some say in 840 B . C .) founded the famous fi re shrine of Ujjain, connected wi th the legend of Arjuna. The Rajputs, united under one Peshwa or chief, vainly disputed empire with Britain in the perilous days from 1790 to 1804 A . C . (see Rattas).

A great Indian hero represented as the 7th incarnation of Vishnu, the incarnation of “ kindness ” or love, usually called “ R ā ma the dear one, friend, lover, and husband.” He appears to be connected with the moon (Chandra) by the lunar race. His father was Dasaratha (“ ten chariots ”), and his mother Kaush-alya of the “ tortoise house,” or race. He appears to have been an actual ruler of Ayodha, or Oudh, successor (and enemy) of Parasu- R ā ma, the 6th incarnation of Vishnu (see Parasu), living at the end of the Treta-yuga, or second age of the world, and inculcating Vedik rites against the older nature worshi p. His prowess, as a youth, in bending the bow of Siva at the great festival of the Svayam ā r, or “ maiden’s choice,” won him as a bride Sita, daughter of a kinsman the rich Mah ā -raja, Janak, of Mithila, or Tirhut. He was the eldest son of his aged father, who had three wives. After long supplication, and a horse sacri fi ce (see Asva-Medha), they all became mothers : Kus ā l ā (or Kaushalya) bore R ā ma : Sumitri bore Lakshman and Sutraghna ; and Kakai (or Kaikeya) bore Bharata. The last named wife was the favourite of Dasaratha, who rashly vowed that her son should be his heir ; and Kakai induced the king to exile R ā ma to Central India when he became famous . Thus with Sita he went into banishment for 14 years, to the grief of the nation : his brother Lakshman went with him, and the three dwelt in the Dandaka forest, between the Jamuna and the God ā veri. He is represented as a hermit, preaching gentleness to wild N ā gas among the wildernesses, hills, noisome jungles, and black plai ns of Rewa, followed in spite of his remonstrances by the gentle and faithful Sita.

For R ā ma was loved by Surpa-naksh ā , a Rakshasi queen of Rakshasa demons, sister of R ā vana, the demon king of Lanka, or Ceylon. She failed to seduce him, and then attacked Sita, when Lakshman (R ā ma’s half-brother and faithful comr ade) cut off her nose and ears. In revenge she induced R ā vana (the Indian Pluto) to carry off Sita (the Indian Proserpine), and he appeared at the hermitage as a mendicant, and so bore her away. R ā ma set out to seek her in the S.E., threading the valley of the God ā veri, and passing through Central India to Duma-gudem, and thence S. W. to Pampasara, high up on the Kiskindya mountains of the Tumbadora. He every- where found subjects of R ā vana ; but he was aided by the monkey god of winds (see Hanum ā n), whose monkey subjects—marching through Mysore— fi lled up the “ monkey bridge ” to Lanka—the rocky straits called “ R ā ma’s bridge ” (R ā ma-Sar ā m), whereby he reached R ā vana’s capital, which he invested, and after many battles recovered Sita uninjured, while Hanum ā n set fi re to Lanka with his fl aming tail. Sita then passed through the fi re, as an ordeal to prove her innocence, and Agni (the fi re god) restored her to R ā ma. Bh ā rata abdicated in his favour, but Lakshman became the actual ruler, as R ā ma was intent on religious duties. Yielding to the doubts of his subjects about Sita he sent her to the hermitage of V ā lmika, at Chatra-kuta, where she bore to him the twin sons Kusa and Lava, and where for 15 years they were educated by the traditional author of the Ram ā yana epik. According to one legend they were recog- nised by R ā ma after great feats in recovering the sacri fi cial horse, defending it against even their uncle Lakshman.

India ), and in the latter part of his life settled at Sri-rangam, on the Kaveri, near Trichinopoly, where he converted millions to his faith, establishing 700 monastic teaching centres, and accepting converts from all classes. According to the K ā nara account of his life (Divya Charitra), he was the son of Sri- kesava Ā ch ā rya and of Bhumi-devi (“ the earth godess ”), and an incarnation of the great serpent (see Sesha) ; he worshiped Vishnu as Sri-ranga-n ā tha, lord of Sri-ranga, the place where he composed his chief works, after completing which he set out to travel and teach. He called his chief disciples by su ch names as “ lotus,” “ mace,” “ disk,” etc., according to the chie f emblems of Vishnu. He converted thousands of the worshipers of Siva, notably at the shrines of Tripati ; which so angered the Chola monarch, that R ā ma-n ū ja was forced to fl y to Mais ū r (Mysore), where he converted the Jain ruler. Four of his monasteries still remain ( Imp. Gaz. India , iv, p. 307). He rejected the philosophy of Kapila, which taught the reality of perceptions, and preferred a more mystic belief in a modi fi ed unity of creative power (see Ā dvaitya). The supreme spirit, according to R ā ma-n ū ja (see Fraser, Lit. Hist. India ), is both the cause of the universe and the material whence it is. created (a Monist philosophy) ; this supreme being is to be adored as Vishnu, by all who seek heaven, and freedom from re-incarnation, through reunion with deity. He taught that “ Vishnu—or N ā r ā yana—was the all-wise, all-merciful, and all-"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Ram ā yana 179 powerful : all that is meant by ma tter and soul.” These “ lay dormant till. creation occurred, by God’s spir it through his own volition, acting 0)1 unevolved matter and non-manifest soul.” Soul therefore—as in the speculations of Vedantists—was a force latent in matter. R ā ma-n ū ja embraced the doctrine of Bhakti, or “ faith ” needful to all, as it was taught by his predecessor and learned fellow- countryman, Sankar- ā ch ā rya, in the 8th century A .

C ., though, as in the case of most sacred compilations, there are evident later interpolations, as in Book VII, some of the fi rst chapters.” The language is Sanskrit, and not the Pali of the 3rd century B .

The Epos of V ā lmika consists of 50,000 lines, divi ded into sections which begin with R ā ma’s boyhood and end with his ascension. Hindus are never tired of reciting its beautiful measures, or of pondering on its myths. Br ā hmans teach that : “ Whoever devout ly reads or repeats it often, will be liberated from sin, and from its effects, and will be exalted with all his posterity to the highest heaven.” In the 2nd chapter Br ā hma says : “ So long as hills and streams endure, so long shall the Ram ā yana be loved by earth’s sons and daughters.\" Rambha.

Tradition says that the R ā mn ā d Rajas began the shrine (on a much older one) in our 11th century : the work was stopped by Moslem persecution in the 12th and 13th centuries.

The nation .of about three millions consolidated in resistance to the Mongol inva- sions ; but the true Mahratta warri or class never amounted to more than half a million. Nearly all the nation professed Hinduism. The typical Ratta is a small, wiry, active man, impatient of discipline, but keen sportsman, a willing herdsman, and a good gardener or labourer.

Prof. Max Müller ( Gifford Lectures , 1885, p. 35) quotes Cicero as deriving the word from relegere “ to gather ” or “ arrange,” being the opposite of negligere “ to neglect,” as meaning “ observance ” of established rites and moral laws. Aulus Gellius uses religens as Dpposed to religiosus , saying : “ it is needful to be careful ( religens ), but be not religious ” ( religiosus ) : the fi rst conception of religion, therefore, was not either a “ binding together,” or a “ binding back ” (restraint), but “ care,” “ regard,” and “ rever- ence ” : not blind faith but due observance of duty to others. Belief is a geographical accident, but true religion is found everywhere (see Morality). We distinguish Religion, as a reality, from Religions which are the superstitions of various races. [In the present work the author traces the growth of religion, from the early Animism of savages, believing in countless spirits inhabi ting organic bodies or inorganic objects, followed by Polytheism , the belief in certain great gods— especially of heaven, earth, ocean, hell, sun, moon, and air—who control lesser spirits. This st age is followed, among Hebrews, Moslems, and others, by belief in One God , as the single creator and ruler, author alike of good and evil. Among Hindus, Greeks, and others, Philosophy taught the existence of a spirit apart from matter, yet animating all ; and modern Monism —denying this doctrine —speaks of a single force in univers al matter. But these beliefs have little connection with the sensu of Duty to fellow-men, or with the religion of love taught by Buddha and by Christ. See such articles as Agnosticism, Morality, and Conscience.—E D .] Religion, from the fi rst, was so far connected with ethiks that fear of unseen spirits\" restrained\" the strong from injuring the weak ; but among the masses it consisted in a sel fi sh anxiety as to the future of their own souls. To please the gods they tortured their own bodies, and fl attered deities from whom they sought favours (see Prayer) : they even consecrated vice (see K ̣ adesh and Sakti), and disregarded the ethikal experience of the race ; or said that the soul could not be de fi led by the deeds of its enemy the body. The puri fi cation of savage religion was due to increased loyalt y to real ethikal teaching, accom- panying increased knowledge and civ ilisation. Popular belief, as the sanction of conduct, has always lagged behind the thought of the wise."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Religion 183 In East and West alike Religion, or Faith, has been regarded as know- ledge, and as mysterious Revelation, though founded on ignorance. It is a rule to live by, and affords a ho pe after death ; it is a key to unlock the secrets of the spiritual and material universe, in the belief of the religious. “ Here it is asso ciated with work, and kindness : or there with rest, and wisdom; here admired for its simplicity, there for its complexity ” (Mr E. G. Browne, Persian Literature ; Journal Rl. Asiatic Soc ., Jan. 1898). As the child obeys, either with fear and trembling, or with love, so man was bidden to obey the gods : for this is “ the beginning of wisdom.” There was in this no thought of duty to others, and the life of the pious was often one of seclusion. Yet their meditations led to what we now s ee to be true Religion. Confucius, Gotama, and Christ, thought indeed of their fellows ; but the Churches were more intent on the mysterious and unknown. The wisdom of the Greeks was “ foolishness ” not only to Paul, but to Augustine, Calvin, Loyola, and Luther. The faith of a babe was more true than the thoughts of a genius ; and Religions thus became the enemies of actual knowledge. So in time, under ignorant guides, they became merely dead forms, or engines of priestly tyranny ; as when the ancient public confession of sin, before the cong regation, was changed to the secret confession to a priest, which is the foundation of ecclesiastical power. So gross was Christian ignorance, under such a system, that in 451 A . C ., it is said, many bishops co uld not sign their names. Religion, according to such priests, consisted, not in a good life, but in man’s conception of his relations with an Invisible, Almighty, Incomprehensible Power, controlling his destiny. Yet Christ said : “ Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things that I say ” (Luke vi, 46). Thus a religion, as usually understood, is a Faith, or belief in some authoritative statement regarding supposed wonders ; and irreligion is want of belief in these. Faith is regarded as a special gift or faculty, not as a su bmissive acceptance of statements made by human teachers. Such assertion must, however, always create A-theism, or denial of the dogmas accepted by others. Good Christians doubted not that Gior dano Bruno, and Galileo, however virtuous their lives, were children of Satan, like Luther ; and calumny has always been the secret weapon of priests in resisting knowledge. The ignorant who poisoned Sokrat ē s were not more fanatical than Augustine, when he said of great men like Aristotle that “ they are predestinate to eternal fi re with the Devil.” Hobbes, whose skep- ticism was the natural reaction from such teaching, says pithily that : “ Religions are only superstitions in fashion, and all superstitions religions that have gone out of fashion.”"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Religion 184 Many Christians have agreed with Loyola, the creator of Jesuit- ism, that “ the highest virtue in a Christian is the sacri fi ce of the intellect.” Thus the poor Agnostik’s doubting (or we may say doubt- ful) soul must be saved by tormen ting his body, in order that Truth may be established by Faith, and not by knowledge. The belief in a soul is the origin of such evil (see Soul). But true Religion, in the belief of the wise of all lands and ages, lies not only in good thoughts and good words, but in the resulting good deeds. As a contemporary of the mammoth and the cave bear, ma n, cowering in caverns, lived in fear of the terrible facts of nature that surrounded him. He imagined every phenomenon to be due to the irresponsible action of some in- dwelling spirit. He therefore strove to appease such by offerings and good words. But he had as yet no conception of law in either society or nature. The further we go back in the history of man the greater do we fi nd to be his dread of gods and devils. The common idea of savages having no religious concepti ons is due to their concealing them from strangers ; and those who live lo ng among them tell us otherwise. Religion, with its tears and cries, wa s the offspring of ignorance, help- lessness, and fear, till man became bolder through experience and success. But men still inherit the ideas of the past, with its prayers, sacri fi ces and sacraments, fetishes, gods and demons. These too are fortunately ever changing and dwindling, as man advances in real knowledge, and rises to the conception of abstract ideas, and of con- crete science, though hindered by hi s fears, heredity, and imagination. Yet the old emotional rites, and consolations, cling to many who are good and loyal, and who feel that without all that they have loved and believed since childhood they cannot live at all. Religion, said one who was once a fearless Agnost ik—though afterwards a believer in “ astral bodies ” and “ divine in carnations ”—did not descend as an angel, rainbow-crowned, from heav en, but arose a shapeless monster amid human fears of the unknown. It was a pestilence walking in darkness, a terror which crafty teache rs used, to gain power over the timid and credulous. The early gods were deities of wrath demanding victims ; seen in lone places, or in fevered drea ms which were real to man in his childhood. Visions of the night are fo und, in every historic faith, to be the basis of belief (see Dreams). The soul in sleep wanders to the other world (see Soul) ; the “ cloudland of the shades.” Every angry cloud or torrent, stormy Ocean, weir d mountain, dark forest or savage beast, every frowning cliff or cons picuous tree or stone, had its in- dwelling dangerous spirit. To appeas e these, and, to secure the pre- sence of more kindly spirits, sacri fi ces were offered, and images and"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Religion 185 shrines were made. The gods were sought in their favourite abodes, or given a habitation near the villa ges, where they could easily be found. With the appearance of the art of writing, their ways and natures were de fi ned for the instruction of the race. But while Faiths spread rapidly, true religion was a much slower growth : the good heart and life are rare among savages : the steadfast pursuit of duty, and the. hatred of all that is fals e, mean, and cruel, are the ideals of civilised man. Whatever is good in the ideas of the past must be dear to good men ; and to them the real Science of Religion is the ordering of practical methods of increasing goodness. But they must also shrink from all that has been found bad and useless in the past, recognising with Bacon that : “ It is better to have no God at all than a bad one.” Yet the race could not go further than its civilisation allowed : the religion of the time was such as co uld be grasped. Mr F. Jordan says that, though “ self-seeking priests may have contrived the reli- gion, cruel men thrown their cruelty into it, yet good men also threw in their goodness, and acute men their acuteness : while strong men bent it to their purposes ; and schemers to their schemes or fancies ; until we see in the modern Christian a newer natural man, carrying the older natural man on his shoulders ” ( Agnostic Annual , 1895). No historic religion is either entire ly false or entirely true. It is founded on facts more or less misunderstood. Even Hell seemed evident to those who saw the sunset fl ames when the gates of Hades opened to admit the sun. The untrained imagination peopled the universe with spirits, and told th e story of the universe, from the mystic void of the beginning to the thronged eternity yet to come ; true treasures were placed in earthe n vessels ; and true thoughts were said to be due to divine inspiratio n. False and foolish. superstitions are natural and inevitable growths : the vague, earnest thought of the past is not to be scoffed at or despised, but must be studied and appreciated aright : the Science of Religion must be studied, like other sciences, by a comparative system : the germs of truth must be sought in other faiths besides that of our fathers. Fear dies down as man gains courage through knowledge, and stands upright instead of falling on his knees to ghosts. Ther e is no greater trial for a truly religious man than to fi nd himself obliged to give up the faith of childhood, whether in Christ, Muh ̣ ammad, or Br ā hma. Th.ere is no greater courage on earth than that of refusing to listen to the heart, when the reason shows us that it has set its love on. things unreal. The world regards the recreant as a mi screant, when he seeks truth in order that he may once more believe (see Prof. Max. Müller, Fort- nightly Review , Feb. 1897). Creeds are but the dogmatic crysta-"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Religion 186 lisations of growing belief, which th ey tend to kill. Alexander von Humboldt analysed positive religions as including : “ First, a code of morals nearly the same in all : secondly, a theological dream ; and, thirdly, a myth or historical novelette.” Religion cannot be fi nally settled, for the price of truth is eternal vigilance (see Creeds and Sabellius). “ If,” says Huxley, “ the religion of the present differs from that of the past, it is because the theology of the present has become more scienti fi c than that of the past ; because it has not only renounced idols of wood and stone, but sees the necessi ty of breaking in pieces the idols built up of books, and tradition, and fi ne-spun ecclesiastical cobwebs ; and of cherishing the noblest, and most human, of man’s emotions, by worship—for the most part of the silent sort—at the altar of the Unknown.” But religions are still disconnected with ethiks ; and a Br ā hman friend used to say to us that “ he knew of no immorality in either the services or rites of his temple or faith.” He thought that the worshiper might descend to any degradation, provided that it was prescribed by the commands of the deity. Such argument sanctioned the customs of Agapæ of old, as it does those of the Sakta sects of to-day. Faith and submission are thought greater than reason ; and the gods are to be pleased by imitating what man bas said to be their nature. The true religion, or restraint of moral force, guiding us in daily duty, needs no priest, and no prayer or public rites. These established themselves in the past , till religions became organised tyrannies. Children who were taught to love and obey their parents, and to revere the wisdom of ancestor s, were thus mistaught to forsake those who knew and loved them be st, to listen to the priest (see Conversions) ; but they were also taug ht to be true to the traditions of the hearth, and to do nothing that could tarnish the honour, or betray the trust, of the tribe or race : their religion told them that they too must be good parents, kind masters, helpful to the weak, the aged, or the stranger. This (even from the earliest known times) was true religion, growing side by side with superstition and priest-craft. The simple joys and griefs of birt h, courtship, marriage, and death, were bound up with natural religion, very different to that of the sacraments by which men strove to stave off sorrow, or to secure happiness. Spiritual tyrants interfered alike with natural affections and with sorrows ; and founded their power on the fears of the heart ; pointing to the dangers of the futu re, and offering the desired immor- tality, and reunion with the loved and lost, as the rewards of obedience to themselves, or to their God. Th ey added certain legends of heroes, and of gods incarnate, as evidence that what they taught was true."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Religion 187 But a good Brahman confessed to us that : “ The worship of the gods is one thing, and our conduct outsid e the temple is quite another.” Priests strove to weave these two strands together, but it was a weaving of iron and straw, of childish legends with the realities of man’s actual life. Religion grows and becomes greater, while creeds wane and wax feeble, in spite of every attempt to fi t them to the age by spiritualising their ancient crude assertions. The moral element is the breath of life to every faith ; and when dogma crysta lises it leaves us the dead body of an aged superstition. The inevitable law of growth and decay applies to religion as to all other phenomena. The stars themselves are no more eternal than the words of ancient Bibles. Rude tribesmen have often expressed to the author their wonder, and sorrow, at the “ want of religion ” exhibited by those who did not believe in all the spirits, and demons, whom they feared, in rocks and streams and trees. It is not many centuries since our own ancestors used to punish legally beasts, and trees, and stones, that had injured men ; a century ago a cart wheel was whipped and burnt in Ireland for hurting a man’s leg. The dog who bites the stick that struck him looks with awe and love at the master who trains him in youth, and tends him with mysterious power in sickness. He pines for the loved presence, and fears the wrath—whether just or unjust— of his lord. So too man gazes wistfully at the power that he may not understand, though the popular belief that “ man is the only religious animal ” is vain. The Guiana Indian is nearer the truth when he speaks of “ man and other animals.” We cannot lay our fi nger on any one cause, or pl ace, or time, as showing the fi rst birth of Religion, any more than we can point to the fi rst man ; we may trace the history of a single god but not the origin of the idea of a spirit. We only know that souls and spirits were material beings till quite recent times (see Soul). The most widely separated races constantly exhibit most striking si milarities in rites and beliefs, the reasons for which have as yet been little studied. The wild man, little as he knows the powers that man can develop, is ever ready to believe a new tale about some demo n or monster. He cannot under- stand the thought of such reasoners as Marcus Aurelius, Kant, Spinoza, or Herbert Spencer, but he—like a child—delights in the new fairy story, though he often does not accept the moral attached. Hence book religions—Christianity and Islam—spread among savages, but make no converts among the older civilised peoples—Jews, Parsis, or Hindus.

It is the townsman only who, though often retaining his beliefs, is able to learn the new knowledge of his time. The “ fair old myths have served their purpose well ” ; and, as Miss Naden makes the old Roman philosopher say to the priest— “ There is room for all : the world is wide. Zeno was great, and so perchance was Christ. And so were Plato and a score beside.” “ If I were young I might adore with you, But knowledge calms the heart, and clears the eye. A thousand faiths there are, but none is true, And I am weary and shall shortly die.” Great minds in every age have derived their religion from their hearts. Marcus Aurelius, the noble Stoik emperor, in spite of “ that fi erce light which beats npon a throne,” in spite of knowledge of the world which makes men cautious an d cold, never lost the warm heart, or allowed the ethikal conscien ce to become dim. He stood half way, in time, between Christ and the civil establishment of the Church. Few have attained to the moral sublimity of his thought, however little it was appreciated by the new sect in whose favour he refused to alter the laws of the Empi re. He accepted no dogma : for as Renan says, he held that “ where the in fi nite is concerned no formula is absolute. . . . He distin ctly separated moral beauty from all theoretical theology,” and urged that Duty is independent of speculation as to a First Cause. In his meditations he reproaches himself with having “ forgotten that holy relationship which should ever unite each man to the whole human race.” Matthew Arnold calls him “ the most beautiful fi gure in history ” ; Niebuhr fi nds in him the noblest of characters ; Rena n says that “ his religion is the real absolute religion—that which results from a high moral con- science placed face to face with the universe ; a faith which is of no race, neither of any country ; one which no revolution can change, nor any discovery affect.” Herakleitos, in the 6th century B . C ., thought that all religions were mental diseases, which the wise should try to assuage, since it was impossible, he said, wholly to suppress them. They were natural phenomena like fl oods or pestilences. Feuerbach, some 2000 years and more after H ē rakleitos, called religions “ sacred but un- doubtedly radical evils, inherent in the sick and weary heart of man,"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Religion 189 and perhaps the chief source of his misery.” Kant said that they were “ worse than valueless save when they inculcated morality, which however they usually falsify and destroy, by basing it on a desire for a reward, or the fear of a hell, or on supposed divine command.” Fichte said truly that : “ Religions were not instituted in order to guide our lives ; though, in a corrupt state of society, they called in ethics to impart moral sanction to their fables and superstitions.” Thus in Egypt we fi nd noble ethiks mingled with magic charms and incantations, great thinkers side by side with priestly fanatics and believers in dogma, which is the grave of truth. A simple faith in God and goodness is never welcome to those who desire to preside over mystic rites, and to lead an obedient people. The popular voice is against the thinker ; and popu lar opinion gives power to the established hierarchy : to the pastors who taught their childhood. Thus was it said that knowledge “ puffs up ” (1 Cor. viii, 1), while “ kindness builds up ” : the “ wisdom of the world is foolishness with God ” (iii, 19), and with it faith has nothing to do (ii, 5). Men should become “ little children ” not only in innocence but in knowledge. Paul learned little from Gallio (Novatus brother of Seneca) when he freed him from persecution, but smiled at his enthusiasm. Yet the ideas of a “ Judge of quick and dead,” and of a \"risen Lord,\" were immenseJy old in Egypt, and well known to cultured Romans. It is a grave question how far men and women really believe in their religions. The attitude of most is that of Mde. de Stael : “ I do not believe in ghosts, but I am very much afraid of them.” The masses, not under any strong emotion, think it can do no harm to believe in Bibles and marvels ; and their hearts tell them that many truths are taught in such sacred books ; but dogmas bring skepticism, in the East as well as in the West., though those for which men once bled and slew are now thought of little importance. The poet bids us “ leave there thy sister where she prays,” be it in a Chinese joss house or a temple at Ban ā ras. Thus the eyes of all are averted from that which might lead to true knowledge, and the advance of the race. The statesman argues that “ some sort of religion ” is needful to keep the masses quiet and happy in docile ignorance ; all but the few among rulers of mankind think inquiry and religious changes dangerous—as indeed they are ; but sel fi sh statecraft has often proved to be a storing up of evils against a day of wrath.

This may seem astonishing to many. To me it is evident that this contrivance was fi rst adopted for the sake of the multitude. For, if it were possible that a state could be composed of wise men only, there would be no need, perhaps, of any such invention. But . . . there is no way left to restrain them but by the dread of things unseen ” (Polybius, Hist ., end of Book vi). Yet by the time of Augustus the temples were falling into ruins ; and the most prosperous period of ancient history was during the reign of the philosophik Antonines. The masses are now seeking for a new and reformed religion, suited to the real beliefs of the age—a “ renovated Christianity,” not one of rites and mysteries, but divested of miracles, and shorn of dogma. Such is the teaching which men crowd to hear, though women may still cling to the beautiful legends of the past. They feel that this is the answer to the teaching of science ; and this ethikal religion cries, as of old, “ We must increase and you must decrease.” The old watchwords have lost their power—nay even their meaning is forgotten. Even the shepherds are now smitten, and the fl ocks are scattered. Religions are crumbling ; but true religion is as fi rm as of old. Sin is no longer disobedience, but disloyalty to a loving Father. The fall of man gives place to the rise of man. The fi gures of Buddha, and of Jesus, loom as large as ever. The Jewish Jehovah take s rank with many other national gods. It is felt that man may be disloyal to moral law even when not breaking those of the state or of the decalogue, but beyond this sin has now no meaning. Yet to call such religion Christianity is historically impossible (see Christ), for it is the religion of all the greatest teachers of the past. Christianity is a de fi nite belief in certain dogmas as to a Trinity, an incarn ate God, a devil, heaven, and hell ; and none of these dogmas belong to the really felt belief of the new age. Max Müller says that “ the hi ghest morality, before the rise of Christianity, was taught by men to whom the gods had become mere phantoms, and who had no altars—not even one to the Unknown God.” Fichte taught that all true “ religion is knowledge—the garnered materials collected by the senses, and matured by the thinker into abstract concepts.” But what the world calls religions demand from us belief in certain statements abo ut beings, events, and doctrines, said to be attested by inspired writers. “ Credula mens hominis, et"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Religion 191 erectæ fabulis aures.” Men and wome n are at heart Transcendentalists, striving to reach beyond experience . Yet, as Max Müller says, know- ledge cannot reach the gate of reason till it has passed the gate of the senses. We must beware of metaphor, and cease to speak of “ mansions in the sky,” if we would tread on solid ground. Science must govern our beliefs, if our morality, and our religion, are to be founded on knowledge and experience. Some have sought a new name for the new Religion ; but it is better to keep the old one, while putting away childish things ; for from the beginning there has never been a really new Religion, and all faiths have followed the universal law of evolution. “ He who knows only one Religion knows none aright.” Theism was a material advance on the older beliefs, yet it was found that the deity receded further the more the idea was studied, till some said that man only worships what he does not understand. Reason alone is not a certain guide, for it is liabl e to fail, and to run into errors not perceived tm long after. An univers al religion must give scope to all our activities, and must fi nd a place for a Spurgeon, and a Stanley, as well as for a Darwin, or a Bradlaugh. The culture that dispels ancient musions does not entitle us to say they had no use or founda- tion. Reverence becomes the thinker who knows that man’s power of thought is limited by his nature . But “ science has never destroyed a fact, or discredited a truth ; her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.” She has nothing to say to the dreamer or the fanatic ; nor to the scoffer and pessimist. She leaves us only, as one of our greatest teachers said, “ at the portal of the unknowable.” The astronomy that destroyed astrology did not affect the stars, nor will any discovery of truth injure true religion. For, as Huxley warns us, speaking of science, “ its subj ect matter lies within the boundaries of possible knowledge ; and, unless its evidence satis fi es the conditions which experience imposes as the gu arantee of credibility, all beliefs are void of justi fi cation.” It took long ages to reach the conception of One God, which arose from the study of nature. It must take many more before men conceive the idea that the life of the universe is not apart from the material universe itself, and get rid of the many illogical conclusions that are still drawn from the ancient doctrines. The in fl uence of religions has so far tend ed to separate men of various races and lands. “ The chosen people ” must drive out all others, and “ Christ’s kingdom ” must overthrow all other kingdoms. The tendency is to bind men socially into riva l bands, and to develop caste. The schools of metaphysics in like manner are rivals. True religion must tolerate and unite rather than divide."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Remphan 192 The theologian of the day calls on governments, and synods, to free him from the bondage of dying creeds and standards. He attempts to adapt himself to the present by a semi-scienti fi c treatment of the “ bases of belief.” These “ halfway- houses ” are very ancient features of the natural history of religions ; and it is an ancient objection that physical science also rests on hypoth esis. But true knowledge is that which has passed beyond the theoretic stage to demonstration. We grope and stumble, yet we advance. As children waking we once saw the frosted pane covered with beauti ful forms, but saw nothing beyond ; the day comes and these vanish as ghosts, and we see, beyond, the fl eecy clouds to which they may have fl ed; but that which is beyond the clouds we cannot see through the soiled glass of our window. So too with true religion, the fairies fa de away, and the sun rises ; but the purpose that we fear is still hidden from our understanding. We may acknowledge then that every religion was an attempt to realise the highest aspirations of the race and age. The ideal of rude tribes is an autocratic rule, and such races worship an autocratic god. The age which acknowledges the duty of securing happiness for all, as far as it can be attained, worships a Father who has patience with his children. It proceeds, as Herbert Spencer says, to “ formulate our ignorance in terms of knowledge ” : or as Pope wrote— “ Thou great First Cause, least understood Who all my sense con fi ned To know but this th at thou art good And I myself am blind.” Yet must we remember what 'Omar Khayyam wrote, more than eight centuries ago— “ The moving fi nger writes, and having writ, Moves on ; nor all your piety or wit, Shall lure it back to cancel half a line, Nor all your tears wipe out one word of it.” Remphan.

These Rephaim lived in Bashan in the 22nd century B . C . (Gen. xiv, 5), aud Repha was a Philistine giant (2 Sam. xxi, 16, 18).

The usual word in the Greek of the New Testament is Anastasis or “ standing up ” ; but of Christ it is said that he “ awoke ” ( ē gerth ē ) : the idea presented no dif fi culty to those who believed that souls can quit and return to their bodies (see Soul) ; but Paul apparently believe d that the resurrection was in a spiritual body (see Paul) ; he did not suppose that any but the pious would so rise. The author of th e third Gospel, however, believed that Christ rose in the body (Luke xxiv, 39), as did also the author of the fourth Gospel (John xx, 27). The author of the First Epistle of Peter (iii, 18) says that Christ “ being put to death in the fl esh ” was “ quickened by the spirit.” “ By man (1 Cor. xv, 21-22) is the waking of the dead ” whom Christ “ will make live,” in incorruptible spiritual bodies (44, 52). The son “ quickeneth whom he will ” (John v, 21); but according to the Apocalypse the rest of the dead will rise after the 1000 years of Christ’s rule (Rev. xx, 5), being subject (as in Egypt also) to a “ second death.” In Daniel (xii, 2, 3) “ some ” are said to rise, to glory or to sham e, but not all.

It is traditionally believed that this “ John the Theo- logos ” was St John the Apostle, but the book found it hard to gain admittance into the New Testament Canon, being only one of many similar works (see Apokaluptik Lit. and Enoch). The Apocalypse was rejeeted by the Council of Laodicea in 363 A . C ., and had been de- nounced by Dionysius of Alexandria and others in the 3rd century, but it was admitted by the Council of Carthage in 397 A . C . Chry- sostom nevers mentions it in any of his works, and the Alogi (or deniers of the Logos) said that it was written by the Gnostik Cerinthus. Dionysius also (about 240 A . C .), “ the ablest bishop of his age,” says that some called it “ a forgery of Cerinthus.” It is not found in the Peshito Syriak version, yet Justin Martyr (according to our present text) is supposed to quot e it. Dionysius showed that the style forbids us to suppose the author to be the same who wrote the gospel and epistles of John, and tnought be was “ another John.” Eusebius appears to follow Irenæus in attributing it to St John, who —being a Galilean fi sherman—probably could not write at all, and is very unlikely to have known any Greek. The details of the visions often coincide in a remarkable manner with those of the Persian Apocalypse, which we now have in P ā hlavi (see Raman Yast). Tradi- tionally it is supposed that St Jo hn was exiled to Patmos by Domitian, and that the book was written about 95 A . C ., but the statements of the book itself would point (xi, 7-9) to a date about 74 A . C . (see xvii, 11), or at least not later than the accession of Titus in 79 A . C .

Mount Stuart Elphinstone, Hist. of India , 1874, pp. 140, 247, doubts the astronomical arguments for fi xing the date of the oldest Veda, supposing that they may have been due to calculating back to a traditional age. The statements refer to the heliacal rising of Canopus, and to the position of the colures (equ inoctial and solsticial points) with reference to the lunar mansions.

The hymns are in praise of elemental gods, and of the Soma drink (see Soma) : the prayers are petitions for earthly blessings ; but Varuna “ the sky ” is dimly fi gured (X, cxx) as a great “ One ” who lay in the primeval chaos. “ In the beginning there was neither nought nor aught. There was then neither sky nor atmosphere above. There fi rst was darkness hidden in darkness, gloom in gloom. Next all was water, all a chaos unformed, in which One lay in the void, shrouded in nothingness.” Millions still repeat the G ā y ā tr ī or “ Mother of Vedas ” (III, lxii, 10), the ancient chant beginning “ Let us meditate on the excellent glory of the divine vivifying sun. May he enlighten our understandings.” Tree worship (I, cl xiv) is noticed also in the Rig Veda, and in the Upanish ā d comment we fi nd that the Pipal, or fi g, is identi fi ed with Br ā hma as an oracular tree. But the chief deities are those of sun, fi re, dawn, and rain. The hymns are arranged according to the gods addressed, or according to metre ; the books have a decreasing number of hymns in each, and the longest hymns in any book come fi rst, or if two have the same number of verses, that with the longest verses comes fi rst. It is thus clear that they were deliberately arranged, and the same system is found in the K ̣ or ā n where historical order is not followed, but the longest surahs come fi rst as a rule.

A mediæval legend relates that a knight who put his ring on a stat ue of Venus could not get it off again, and was so wedded to the st ony godess. So too monks were dedicated to the Virgin (see Sir G. Cox, Aryan Mythol ., i, pp. 278, 352). The ring was a wedding emblem among the Romans long before Christians adopted it. The Huguenots, and many Presbyterians, regarded it as a Popish emblem. The Pope wears the “ fi sherman’s ring,” and every bishop is wedded to his Church by a ring. Odin too had his magic ring. The symbol wa s not adopted in Christian marriage till our 10th century, but was directed to be used by the Council of Trent in the 16th century. The “ ring of Solomon ” is the Pentacle, or fi ve-rayed star, a well known Masonic sign. The legend of Samael who stole this ring by aid of Amina, So lomon’s concubine, is found in the K ̣ or ā n, and was taken from the Talmud (Tal. Bab. Gittin.). In many legends (such as that of Croesus) th e ring thrown away is swallowed by a fi sh, which brings it back to the owner. Rings with inscribed gems were common talismans. The Roman Church recognised rings for special purposes, such as “ cra nium rings ” for headache, “ cramp rings,” and others. “ Ring-stones ”—or holed stones to be passed through, or for swearing—are co mmon among Kelts and others. The ring is the necklace of Harmonia, and the Kestos of Venus. Rita. Sanskrit : “ right,” “ righteousness,” originally the “ straight ” path of the sun, or other road. Indra “ walking in the path of Rita ” recovered his cows from the cave (see Max Müller, Hibbert Lect .). Thus Rita becomes the “ eternal foundation of all that exists.” Varuna (heaven) is said to “ support the seat of Rita,” whose “ horn is exalted far and wide, and the sun surrounds him with its rays.” Mitra, and Varuna, proclaim his praises, and the good follow him ; but An-rita (the “ un-right ”) is the mother of Naraka (hell), and the way of Nirita or death. The Persian Asha answers to the Sanskrit Rita, as meaning “ righ teousness,” and is called “ he who created the world,” and “ whom the universe follows ” : “ all is the creation of Asha, and the good try to follow him to the highest heaven —his abode. Through Asha the world grows and prospers ; all must strive to become possessed by Asha.” Rivers. See Bridges, and V ā na.

All rive rs had their temples, the river gods being male, while the deities of springs and wells are female ; witness the grave river god of Trajan’s column. The Persians held water sacred, but accounted for its drowning men by supposing a demon to live in it (see Nik, and Nix). Rod. An universal symbol of power—the magic staff. Rhab- domancy, or “ rod magic,” is a large subject. It is connected with the club (see Danda) and mace (see Dor-je). Among Hebrews we fi nd the rods of Moses, and Aaron, an d the staff of Elish’a, and among Christians the rod of Joseph. Acco rding to Jewish legends the rod of Adam was created on the eve of the Sabbath (or with Adam), from a myrtle tree in Eden : it descended in possession of Enoch and Noah, and became the mast of the ark (a phallic symbol as the sari or “ mast ” still is among Arabs) : on it Abraham engraved the name of Yahveh ; Jacob received it from Isaac (Gen. xxxii, 10) and it became the “ rod of Judah ” (xlix, 10) : Jethro took it to Midian when he fl ed from Egypt, and Moses received it from him. It guarded his chamber as a fi ery dragon, and devoured the rods of the Egyptian magicians. Jethro had planted it in his garden, and would only give his daughter (S ̣ ipporah “ the bird ”) to one who could uproot it. The angel of death feared to touch Moses because of the holy name on this rod (see Moses). The monks of St Catherine's monastery, at Sinai, still show the “ tree of the rod,” as well as the “ burning bush ” (Mr Israel Abraham, Proc. Jewish Colle ge, Dec. 1886). This rod, with the shoes and robe of Moses, was placed in the Ark. Solomon also had a magic rod (see Jerusalem) ; and the “ rod in Zion ” (Psalm cx, 2) is said to mean the Messiah.

They were given alms, and set to protect fi elds or to do the scavenging of villages. They might be shot, and only the head Rodiya was allowed to approach near enough to a Hindu to receive orders. They must shout to any at a distance lest he should come too near them, and their cattle must have bells for a like reason.

The fi rst Romans were mere shepherds whose chief dwelt in a hut, and whose Forum, in the valley between the Capitol and the Palatine, contained a temple of Vesta also of wood and thatch : their pecunia or “ wealth ” consisted in the pecus or “ cattle ” of the tribe. They dei fi ed their city founder, as in later days they dei fi ed emperors ruling half the old world, making Augustus a son of Apollo. In his days the temples had become neglected (as Horace tells us), and the in fl uence of Greek philosophy had already been felt. With- out this change, and the gradual decay of primitive superstitions which Polybius (see Religion) though t so useful, the spread of Chris- tianity, under the great Antonines of our 2d century, would have been impossible. But the old creed did not entirely die. By the 4th century Christians had begun to mingle the pagan rites with their own. The Pope became the Pontifex Maximus : the Cardinals replaced the Flamens : Peter with his keys replaced Janus : the Virgin mother was the old Lucina : and the “ birthday of the unconquered sun ” became Christmas day.

A fi ne specimen of such a stone pillar exists at Whitby Abbey in Yorkshire. Many Roods are inscribed, and they are often near a sacred well, to which the name “ Rod-well ” thus applies, as at Weymouth in Dorsetshire, or at Priest-side near the Solway (see Proc. Socy. Antiq. Scotland , 1886 ; Academy , 8th April 1890). The Rood in Edinburgh old town, and that at “ Holy-rood ” Palace, are other examples. The English churches had “ Rood-lofts ” or galleries across the entrance to the chancel in which stood a cross (see Notes and Queries , 16th June 1900), and the present Rood-loft of St Paul’s Cathedral in London was solemnly consecrated. The Solway Rod-well claims a history going back to 680 A . C ., and the Roods of Whitby and Bridlay are equally ancient. The Solway Rood was 12 ft. high, and a cross was added later, the stones being tongued together. Many English Roods, and miraculous cruci fi xes bearing the name, were destroyed in the time of Henry VIII as being idolatrous. Queen Margaret of Scotland (1050-1090 A . C .), the wife of King Malcolm Oanmore, came from Hungary, and is said to have brought thence to Edinburgh the famous “ Black Rood,” making for it a little chapel in the castle : it was a gold cross in a black case : this relic was lost in 1346 at Neville’s Cross, when David II violated the peace of St Cuthbert. The wonder-working ivory fi gure of Christ, on this gold cross, which was 3 or 4 ft. high, was set with diamonds. Every church had its Rood, and a chapel of Holy Rood stood, till the Refor- mation, in the nether kirk-yard of St Giles, while another existed still later in Greenside valley, N. of th e Calton hill outside Old Edinburgh (see Rivers of Life , ii, p. 357). The Roods were accompanied by fi gures standing beside the cross, as in Roman Catholic countries generally ( Scotsman , 11th September 1886 : Napier, F OLK -L ORE , p. 164). The stone pillars at mark et crosses were however often ancient pagan monuments (see Maypoles), afterwards converted into crosses. Rosaries. These are widely distributed, strings of beads to aid the memory, in repeating prayers, or divine names. The system— like that of the abacus used for ca lculation—is very ancient, and connected with the knotted cords ( quipus ) which, in Peru, and among American Indians, were used even to record history by aid of various colored threads ; or with the Wampum belts having similar use. In Japan also such quipus have wooden slips tied on, which are marked with hieroglyphics, serving as charms (see Dr E. B. Tylor, Early Histy. of Mankind , p. 156 : Bourke, Medicine Men of Apaches ,"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Rosaries 204 ch. ii : Report of Smithsonian Instit. Bureau of Ethnology , 1892). In 668 A . C . Theodorus, archbishop of Canterbury, denounced “ all knotted ligatures ” (see Knots) : yet ro saries appear to have been used by Christians in the East as early as 366 A . C ., and the rosary of 55 beads (see Beads) was brought to Eu rope by Peter the Hermit in 1090, while the larger rosary of 150 is ascribed to Dominic de Guzman in 1202 A . C . The latter is marked off into decades by a larger bead, rose, or tassel, for th e Pater Noster; while each smaller bead is an Ave Maria : fi ve decades (50 beads) are a “ chaplet,” and three chaplets a rosary. The Brahmans, attaching importance to the repetition of holy words as charms, used.. from early times a Japa-m ā la or “ prayer- necklace ” with tens, and hundreds, of beads. In such repetitions the fi rst words suf fi ced, and the sacred Mantra (“ charm ”) from the Rig Veda was reduced to the words “ O di vine giver.” Rosaries are noticed among Jains, in literature of the 2nd, or 3rd, century B . C . The worshiper of Siva rehearses if po ssible all the 1008 names of his god, and calls his rosary “ the eyes of Siva ” (Rudr ā ksha). It is composed of berries of the elœocarpus , each bead recalling the fi ve austerities of Rudra which must be practised. The worshiper of Vishnu gives his child a rosary of 108 Tulsi seeds, and teaches it to lisp again and again the words “ Sri Krishna saranam man,” or “ blessed Krishna refuge of my soul.” The Buddhist rosary, in India and Tibet, has also 108 beads, (or 9 × 12) while the Saivite total (1008) is a multiple of the sacred number seven (7 × 12 × 12) ; the L ā mas tell their 108 beads (see Waddell, Lamaism , pp. 150, 202) said to recall the attributes of Buddha, as denoted by symbols on his sacred footprints. They say that he commanded the use of the rosary in one of his sermons, which was accepted at the fi rst council after his death, and came to them from India. Many Easterns never cease to tell their beads while working or walking, or even when talking ; we have often noticed them muttering invocations amid business requiring all their attention, or automatically moving the beads of the theng-wa or Tibetan rosary. Originally no doubt the string was hung with charms, such as all early peoples use against witches and the ev il eye, as is still usual in Asia and in Africa ; and the theng-wa still begins and ends its string of beads with a small lingam. Siva, as Bhairava “ the terrible,” is repre- sented with a necklace of human skulls. Tam-din, the special protector of L ā mas, has a blood-red rosary. The nuns of Chërës ē chant the name of Avalokit-Isvara as a Buddha or a lotus, by aid of the rosary.

Rose. From the earliest times a maiden has been called a “ rose- bud,” and a bride a “ rose.” The dawn is also rosy, and the sun is the rose of heaven ; but the fl ower—known to later Jews—is never men- tioned in the Bible, for the “ rose of Sharon ” is the narcissus. This fl ower was the “ ruddy ” emblem of the Thrakian Sabazios, and the Dion ū siak festival—the Latin Rosalia—s urvives in the “ Domenica del- la rosa ” (“ rose Sunday ”), while Pentecost is called “ Pascha Rosata ” from the fl owers borne before the host. Rose leaves in baskets are commonly used in Italian fêtes, being emptied on to processions, as the Romans showered them on guests at feasts : the paths of brides and of heroes were also st rewn with the rose petals. The “ Golden Rose ” has been a much-prized gift of Popes to kings and princesses even—it is said—since our 7th century. In the 11th century Urban Il gave one to the Count of Angers : in the 12th, King Louis of France received another from Pope Alexander Ill. In the 14th century Urban V decreed that a golden rose from St Peter’s altar should be annually given to some worthy prince or princess. The custom was con fi rmed by the decision of a Papal council in 1740. On the 4th Sunday in Lent the altar of St Peter’s is decked with roses, and the golden rose is placed on it. The Pope perfumes it with musk, incenses, and blesses it, as typifying the rod from the “ root of Jesse.” It is carried to the Sistine chapel, fi xed on an arti fi cial rose stem set with jewels, and anointed with th e holy chrism. Other emblematic fl owers are sometimes added, and a natu ral rose is placed within it : the whole is called “ a symbol of the Almighty, of His glory, the light of heaven, and of the presence and resurrection of Christ.” The Rosa Mystica is also the Virgin Mary.

Sanskrit : “ the roarer,” an early Vedik god. The name also applies to Siva. The Vedik Rudra is the thunderer. The ancient fête (see Times of India , 19th Aug. 1892) is still held in his honour, and called the Ati-rudra, when he is invoked as patron of craftsmen such as cartwrights, carpenters, smiths, potters, hunters, and watermen. Like other thunderers, he is a crafty smith and merchant, a god of foot soldiers, and of all who use the bow, sword, and spear. His voice is heard in battle, and in the drum. He is also a patron of all night robbers, of beggars, and Fak ̣ ī rs, and he is present in houses, fi elds, rivers, fountains, winds, clouds, grass, the green tree, or the falling leaf. He dwells especially in forests and solitary places, or in lone mountains. The Yajur- Veda speaks of 100 Rudras. The Ati-rudra sacri fi ce is accompanied by the repetition of 1361 prayers daily, for 11 days : the offerings, which are of clari fi ed butter, and black sesamum, amount to 2,357,20 l in all.

The dominant race in Russia belongs to the Aryan Slav family : they are divided into white Russians on the W., little Russians in the S., and great Russians on the N.E. In the N.W. are the Finns, Esthonians, and Livonians, who are Turanian in origin. S. of these, on the W. border, there are Poles and Letts ; the Lett, or Lithuanian, being now regarded as perhaps the most archaic of Aryan languages. The Tartars on the E. borders of European Russia, include Kumuk, N ogai, and Kalmuk Mongols, W. of the Caspian Sea, with Bashkir, Votyak, Cheremiss, and Pe rmian Tartars further north, near the Voguls, and Ostyaks of Siberia. Among these Turanians there are still many survivals of primitive paganism (see Sacri fi ce). The Greek Church in Russia exercises a severe tyranny, which has led to the creation of many heretical sect s, some 40 of which are vigorous and aggressive. Their peculiarities are often due to an absurdly literal understanding of Biblical language. Mr Wallace ( Russia ) speaks especially of the Moravians, and of the Molocans or “ milk drinkers,” who are stubborn “ quakers of the steppes,” preaching communism, and distributing their goods, like Pop of, among the poor : they have often been exiled for their faith to Siberia. The Stundists have itinerant priests, who much resemble in their teaching George Fox, the founder of the English Quakers in the 17th century. M. Leroy Beaulieu ( L’Empire des Tsars ) has described many other sects (see Times , 22nd Oct. 1889) : “ For the great mass of the people,” he says, “ the Middle Ages still last.” The oldest and most powerful sect is that of the Raskolniks, who even claim descent from St Cyril, and St Method, and will not allow either Greek or Latin words to sully their Slav liturgy.

The “ Deniers ” say that since the early days of the patriarch Nikon, who attempted to reform the Greek Church, nothing sacred remains on earth : they seek refuge in mystic inter- course with Christ. In the 19th century a Don Cossack founded the “ non-prayers,” so that the latest outcome of Raskolnik reformation is Rationalism, for they say that we are now in the 4th—or winter— age of the world (see Kalpa), when prayer and rites have become useless. The Khlysty are Flagellants, founded by Daniel Philippovitch, and by a serf named Ivan Souslof, who professed to “ see God ” : the mediæval custom of fl agellation, thus revived, spread even among the educated. The Shakouny are Shakers, or Jumpers, appearing fi rst under Alexander I : they meet at night for convulsive dances, and are suspected of licentiousness and vile cruelty. The Skoptsy are self-mutilators, who fi rst appeared about 1770, their Messiah being an illiterate person named Selvonof, and their prophetess Akoulina Ivanovna : even now they have not been entirely suppressed by the knout. A more favourable example of such heresy is found in Soutaief (the reputed teacher of To lstoi), who disputed the right of the village popes to burial dues.

Sabbath. Hebrew : “ rest.” The Hebrew Sabbath was the 7th day of their week ; the Babylonian Sabbatu was the 15th day of the month, or full-moon day, and was not connected with any week of seven days. [Much that has been written on the Babylonian Sabbath is misleading. The texts are given in the original characters by Dr T, G. Pinches (see Proc. Bib. Arch. Socy ., Feb. 1904, pp. 51-56). The word is written (K. 6012 + K. 10,684) Sa-bat-ti ; but the Sa is not the sign for “ heart ” with that sound, and the explanation of the word as derived from the Akkadian Sa-bat “ heart rest ” is not supported. The root Sabat “ rest ” is common in Semi tic speech. In Akkadian the Sabattu is rendered Ud-Cus , “ rest day ” ( Cuneif. Inscrip. from Bab. Tablets , xii, pI. vi, line 24). It is also rendered um nuh ̣ , libbi , or “ day of rest within ” ( i.e. , “ indoors,” “ at home ”). The chief days of the month were the 1st called “ the great day,” the 9th called Beti (perhaps “ supplication ”), the 15th or Sabatti , the 19th called Ibbu (“ white ”), and the 25th or “ old moon ” day. From another text (W. A. 1., iv, pI. 23: see S. A. Smith, Miscel-"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Sabbath 211 laneous Texts , pI. xvii, line 24-xviii, line 4) we fi nd that the 7th, 14th, 19th, 21st, and 25th days of the month were called in Akkadian Ud-Khulik . This has been generally rendered “ evil day,” but is eXplained in Babylonian by the words Sulum “ rest ” and Sila “ quiet ” (otherwise read limnu “ evil ”) ; and it is clear that the Ud-Khulik was not regarded as unlucky, for it is called a “ fortu- nate day.” The text in question says : “ The 7th day (of the month) is a great day ( Rubbatu ) of Marduk and Zirpanitu, a fortunate day, a Khulik day ” (probably meaning therefore “ glad day,” from the Akkadian Khul “ to rejoice ”) : the text continues : “ The leader of a great people shall not eat fl esh that is cooked by fi re, that is roasted (apparently meaning hot meat), sha ll not change his dress to put on white, shall not make an offering. The king shall not ride in his chariot, shall not speak of fi cially ” : (the next clause is doubtful but seems to mean that no proclamation is to be issued) : “ the doctor shall not lay his hand on a sick man. It is a day un fi t for business. The king shall bring his offering by night (after or before the end of the “ day,” which lasted from 6 A . M . to 6 P . M .) : he shall sacri fi ce before Marduk and Istar, his prayer is (then) acceptable to God.” It is clear that the 7th day was one of complete rest, but this was the 7th day of the month—not of the week—and is not the Sabbatu, which was the 15th.—E D .] The Hebrew Sabbath is said to have been instituted to com- memorate the rest of Elohlm after the labour of six days of Creation (Gen. ii, 2), and it was blessed by Yahveb (Exod. xx, 10,11). It was especially a day of rest for slaves and beasts (Exod. xxiii, 12), other- wise said to be instituted in memory of the slave labours in Egypt (Deut. v, 15). It is not known how early the institution of a day of rest may have been known in Babylonia, as the tablets regarding it are not of high antiquity ; but apparently it was of Akkadian origin (the Ud-Cus ), and it may therefore have been adapted by the Hebrews from Babylonian practice. Among the Jews the Sabbath is not a day of rigid abstinence from all forms of amusement, but only a day of complete rest from the work of the week. The Mishnah (Sabbath) commends the wearing of ornaments ; and rejoicings were regarded as proper to the Sabbath. It was a festival, as among Roman Catholics, and it was not until the Reformation that the substituted “ Lord’s day ” (the 1st instead of the 7th day of the week) began to be called the Sabbath or “ rest day,” and to be observed by Calvinists, and Puritans generally as a solemn day, on which every form of amusement however innocent was unlawful—a doctrine which has no foundation in the Bible statements, or in Jewish custom. Luther said : “ If any-"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Sabeans 212 where the day is made holy merely for the sake of the day ; if set up as an observance on a Jewish base ; then I order you to work on it, dance on it, ride and feast on it, and do anything that shall remove this encroachment on the liberty of Christians.” The Puritan would not approve of Christ’s eating br ead with the Pharisee on the Sabbath (Luke xiv, 1), but rather agrees with the rigid Talmudic rules, which made the Sabbath a burden instead of a rest, and led to Christ’s saying that “ the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath ” (Mark ii, 27). The Judean Christians observed the 7th day as the Sabbath, and this practice survived. very late among Christians in Egypt. The Gentile Christians—followers of Paul—seem early to have observed the “ Lord’s day,” or 1st day of the week (on which day he was said to have risen from the dead), instead of the 7th day. The week was not an early institution among most nations, but the 7 days rudely coincided with each of the 4 phases of the moon. The Babylonians more exactly observed the days of the lunar month. Paul taught (Colos. ii, 16) that no man was to ju dge another as to his observance of the Sabbath. The Lord’s day was not established till 321 A . C . The Moslem day of rest is the Friday, but Sunday is called by Syrian Christians Yam es Sebt , “ the day of rest.” The word Sabbath has no connection with the word Sab’a , “ seven.” Sabeans. The inhabitants of Saba or Sheba, in Yaman or S.W. Arabia. They were a great trading people (Ezek. xxvii, 22 ; Job vi, 19 ; see Gen. x, 7, 28), being appare ntly both Turanian and Semitic. Agatharkhos, about 80 A . C . (“ Periplus ”), said that they had a settle- ment at Rhapta, subject to Mephartes, king of Yaman ; and in Ptolemy’s geography (about 150 A . C .). Rapta is shown on the E. coast of Africa, about 9° S. latitude, pr obably at Quiloa, some 150 miles S. of Zanzibar. In this region ther e were two cities called Sabi ; and Sofala also bears a Semitic name (Heb. Sheph ē lah; Arabic Si fl eh “ lowland ”), so that the presence of Sabeans near the mouth of the Zambesi in our 2nd century is indicated, accounting for the Zimbabwe ruins of Mashona-land. The Abyssinian texts show the presence of Sabeans, who ruled there and in Yaman down to our 7th century. Their alphabet-the south Semitic-is traced back to the 3rd century B . C .

Arabic : S ̣ abi ū n , “ washers,” or “ baptisers,” a sect in Mesopotamia, of Gnostik origin, of whom some 5000 are now left along the Euphrates and Tigris (see Journal Rl. Geog. Socy ., November 1891). Their ordinary language is now Arabic, but they possess MSS. of our 16th century in the old Aramean dialect, which was their sacred la nguage ; while their alphabet was also of Aramean origin. They are classed with Christians and Jews in the K ̣ or ā n (xxii, 17, etc.), as the “ people of a Book,” whom Muh ̣ ammad distinguishes from pagan unbelievers ; for “ Every people shall be judged by its Book.” They turn to the N. star in prayer, and baptise every Sunday, dipping themselves in the river naked, inside a small wattled hut ; they then put on a white robe, and sit down before their tabern acle, blessing, and blesse d by their brethren as they pass. The Sidra Rabba (“ great collection ”), or scripture of the sect, is placed on an altar and read. Their high priest takes two live pigeons, and fi xing his eyes on the pole-star, throws them towards it, saying : “ In the name of the Living One, blessed be the primitive light, the ancient light, the divinity self-created.” The reading con- tinues while they prepare the Petoh ̣ ’ Elayat , or “ high meal,” which is their communion or eucharist. A charcoal fi re is lit in an earthen- ware stove beside the altar : some barley is ground, and oil is squeezed from sesame seeds ; dough is thus kneaded into wafers, or cakes, about the size of a fl orin, and these are baked in the stove. A deacon takes a pigeon from its cage, cuts its throat, and gives the cakes to the priest, who drops on each four drops of the pigeons’ blood to form a cross. A wafer is put in the mouth of each worshiper, as the liturgy proceeds, with the words : “ Be thou marked with the mark of the Living One.” The four deacons then walk round behind the altar, and digging a hole they bury the pigeon.

From this Trinity sprang Yu-shamin (“ Jehovah of the heavens ”), and Manda-H ̣ aya (“ the messenger of life ”), who is the mediator. But Yu, attempting to supersede the Supreme God, was banished to the region of “ inferior light.” Manda rests in the bosom of “ Primeval Light,” and became incarnate as Abel, Seth, and John the Baptist. Adam and Eve were imperfect creations of ’Atika (“ the ancient ”), who was the “ third life ” or Demiurge, and all their progeny were accursed except Abel, Seth, and John, even including Yish’u Masih ̣ a (“ Jesus the Messiah ”) : even Ruh ̣ a (“ the spirit ”) who created man (Gen. i, 2) is called “ a female devil daughter of K ̣ in ” (Cain), who became “ mother of the stars by Ur (“ fi re ” or “ light ”) her own son.” The stars therefore are the cause of all evil, and of men’s passions, except the pole-star, which is “ the central sun, the jewelled crown which stands before the door of Abathur,” who is “ the father of the door.” The under world is full of wicked spirits in various hells. Hibil (Abel) descende d there, and rejoiced Manda by his victories over death : he carried off Ruh ̣ a thence. John the Baptist is said to have baptised Yi sh’u in error, for he was an in- carnation of the planet Mercury, and therefore sinful. There are, however, various sects, following various writers, among the S ̣ abians. Some near Babylon know no Bible legends according to Mr W. S. Blunt (see Bedouins , i, p. 195), but say that their ancestors once ruled the world, when there was only one God, and one language : they founded Egypt and Damascus, and only left the latter city when expelled by Tartars who plundered it, retiring to the deserts when the Khalifah was established at Baghd ā d (apparently about our 11th century) : they are still searching for the original Syrian copy of their scripture, but have a later one which their priests read in the original language, and which all S ̣ abians understand. Mr H. Rassam ( Trans. Bib. Arch. Socy ., VIII, iii, 1885) speaks of these mystics as followers of Mandai-yah ̣ i (“ the messenger of life ”), who is represented as a disciple of John the Baptist. S ̣ abians of the Lebanon had the custom of eating locusts and honey sacramentally, on alternate days, and were called “ Chaldeans.” The S ̣ abians believe in a resurrection and fi nal judgment, and say that their eucharist of bread and wine was fi rst instituted by God in Eden.

The new year feast of St John, that on the 5th day after baptism, and the Dehmeh Dimas (a term of unknown meaning), are their great festivals, according to their Sheikh at Baghd ā d. In our Middle Ages the S ̣ abians were found near H ̣ aran and Edessa, in N. Mesopotamia, but were nearly exterminated by the Moslems. These H ̣ ar ā nis spoke Aramaik, and had temples. [St James of Seruj about 500 A . C ., notices the gods of Har ā n including Sin, and Ba’al-Shemin—E D .]. They had a square shrine for the sun, and an octagonal one for the moon. Jupiter and Mercury were symbolised by triangles, Mars by an oblong, and Venus by an oblong with a central triangle. These S ̣ abians spoke of “ sacred allegories not to be explai ned.” They claimed to be “ ancient and enlightened,” and had been numerous in 830 A . C . A Persian author of 1790 speaks of S ̣ abians, in Khusist ā n, as half Jews and half Christians, sun worshipers who daily baptised in the river. Evidently the old Mandrean doctrine was syncretic, like so many other Gnostik systems (see Gnostiks). Sabellius. A pious and energetic bishop in the Libyan Pentapolis, whose heretical views sp read to Asia Minor, and Rome, about 180 to 220 A . C . In the beginning of the 3rd century the Trinitarian dogma was not as yet est ablished as the orthodox teaching, and the majority of Christians were zealous Monotheists, or Unitarians, like later Moslems. They were divided into two schools : (1) the Adoptionists who regarded Christ as a man who became divine by the indwelling Holy Spirit, or Logos, at his baptism ; or (2) the Modalists who regarded him simply as God incarnate, a view which was generally held in Rome under the bishops Victor and Calixtus (190 to 220 A . C .), whence they were called Patr i-passians by their opponents, or those who believed that “ the Father suffered ” on the cross. Hippolytus, who controverted this view, was called a Di-Theist, or believer in “ two Gods.” Calixtus endeavoured to establish a com- promise, and Novatian (in 250 A . C .) established (in his De Trinitate ) doctrines which fi nally found favour at the 1st Council of Nicea in 325 A . C . Sabellius regarded Calixtus as an apostate, as he held the strictest Modalist belief himself. His views found no favour in the West, and were opposed by Dionysius of Alexandria in Egypt. Origen was an opponent of the Sabellians, and in 268 A . C . the Homoousion formula (teaching the “ same substance ” in the Father and the Son) was still regarded with disfavour at Antioch, as being Sabellian. The Uio-pat ē r or “ Son-Father ” was, by the latter, regarded as a single being. The Father, Son, and Spirit , were thus consecutive energies,"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Sabines 216 representing the Creator, Redeem er, and Life Giver. All these dif fi culties arose from the theory of divine incarnation in a human form. Sabellius relied on such texts as “ thou shalt have no other gods before me ” (Exod. xx, 3) : “ the Lord our God is one Lord ” (Deut. vi, 4) : “ beside me there is no God ” (Isaiah xliv, 6) : “ the Father is in me ” (John x, 38) ; bu t his views became obsolete in the 4th century, as the Trinitarian dogma developed, in formulæ intended to unite all schools of Christian thought. The Sabellians compared the Father, Son, and Spirit mentioned in the Gospels, with man as consisting of body, soul, and spirit. They seemed to approach Gnostik belief in successive emanations, and thus Tertullian, writing against the Sabellian Praxeas, condemned him while admitting that “ this heresy sprang out of a desire to maintain orthodoxy.” The anti- Gnostik party was strong in Rome in the end of our 2nd century, and Noetus, the Asia Minor bishop, was called there a “ Patri-passian.” But many good men regarded Trinitarian dogma as a relapse into Polytheism, as did Muh ̣ ammad, and claimed to be true Monotheists, such as the Ebionites really were. Christ to them was a good man inspired, or possessed, by the Holy Spirit, and not a God (see Paul). A Roman inscription of 1742 shows that such views survived till very recent times. Sabines. The Sabini were an Aryan people near Rome, who combined with the Latini to overcome the Turanian Etruskans, in the lowlands (see Italy and Rome). Sabiria. See Siberia. The Sabiroi, or Saviri, were a tribe driven W. to the Don river by the Avers, about 450 A . C . (see Sir H. Howarth, Journal Rl. Asiatic Soc ., Oct. 1892). Other Sabiri were found by the Russians near Tobo lsk, in the Khanate of Siberia, whence aJl N. Asia has in time come to be called Siberia. They were northern Huns of Turkish race, driv ing before them the Saroguri, and Urogi, with other tribes, and settling in the Kuban Steppes N. of the Kaspian Sea. They appear to have been the founders of the Huns of Sarmatia, who invaded Persia and the Roman empire in our 5th century. Sabors. See Savars. Sacraments. Rites of sancti fi cation by vows and sacri fi ces among Romans. The Christians originally had only two sacraments, namely Baptism, and the Lord’s Supper.

The Roman Church, when established, very justly regarded all vows as sacraments. Hence among Roman and Eastern Catholics alike there came to be 7 sacraments, namely, Baptism, Con fi rmation, the Eucharist, Marriage, Extreme Unction, Penance, and Orders. The practice of anointing the sick was ancient (James v, 14), as was that of mutual confession of sin (verse 16). The bride and bridegroom sought the blessing of the bishop, and the Church gradually usurped civil authority over marriage. All rude peoples have had many sacramental rites, to render the vows of believers bind ing, and many bad communion rites also (see Eucharist). Sacri fi ce. That is consecration of a victim—a rite common to all early religions. [The four chief fe atures noticed in this and other articles (see Atonement, ’Az ā zel, Crosses) include : (1) the feeding of spirits on the spirit-essence of offerings, in tombs and shrines ; (2) vicarious sacri fi ce for self-protection, at fi rst of human victims, and afterwards of animals ; (3) communion rites, to acquire the powers of a superior being—human or divine ; (4) self-sacri fi ce, to secure salva- tion, gradually modi fi ed to self-morti fi cation. The late survival of the older savage ideas is also here traced, and existing sacri fi ces are described.—E D .] The belief of Babylonians and A ssyrians as to vicarious sacri fi ces, apparently human, is shown by a well-known text (K. 5139) ; and, by seal designs, it also becomes clear that human victims were offered. [The details of translation are somewhat uncertain, and the word uris ̣ u —thought to mean “ offspring ”—may be only an “ absolving ” victim, while risa-nasu is now said to mean “ bearing (sin) on the head.” The text may be thus rendered :— 1. “ Let the High Priest proclaim that : 2. The victim ‘ bearing on the head ’ for men. 3. The victim for his soul he gives. 4. The victim’s head fo r man’s head he gives. 5. The victim’s neck fo r man’s neck he gives. 6. The victim’s skin for man’s skin he gives.”—E D .] Such human sacri fi ces continued among the Phœnicians down to 400 A . C . Eusebius says that they “ annually sacri fi ced their only, or eldest, sons, and most lo ved friends,” to Mel k ̣ arth, placing the bones in a sacred bronze ark.

Among the Hebrews we have three well-known instances—the sacri fi ce of Isaac ; that of Jephthah’s daughter ; and that of Saul’s sons (2 Bam. xxi, 9), who were hanged by the Gibeonites to stay a famine : their bones were collected and buried, “ after which Elohim was entreated for the land ” (verse 14). The chiefs of the tribes of Israel were also hanged “ before Yahveh ” (Num. xxv, 4), to atone for the worship of Ba’al-P’eor ; and the law of the Kherem , or “ setting apart,” of victims (Levit. xxvii, 29) prescribed that “ none devoted, whic h shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed but shall surely be put to death,” with which law the con- duct of Jephthah agrees (Judg. xi, 30, 34, 39). Later commentators endeavour to explain away the sacri fi ce of a daughter, which resembles the Greek instance of Iphigeneia ; but we know that the Hebrews continued to burn their children in honour of Moloch as late as 600 B . C .; just as the king of Moab sacri fi ced his son in time of extremity (2 Kings iii, 27). The gods were attracted by the smell of sacri fi ces, as we read in the legend of Gilgamas in Babylon, and in the Bible where it is written that “ Yahveh smelled a sweet savour ” (Gen. viii, 21) ; but human sacri fi ces to Moloch were forbidden by the Law, and denounced by the prophets (Jer. vii, 31 ; xxxii, 25). The idea of the vicarious sacri fi ce of Christ fi nds little support in the New Testament, though we read that he said he came to give hi s life to ransom many (Matt. xx, 28 ; Mark x, 45) ; for Paul only speaks of the atonement, or “ reconcilia- tion,” received through Jesus (Rom. v, 11), as the propitiator (1 John iv, 10). [The high priest Caiaphas was apparently thinking of political expediency, and not of vicarious sacri fi ce; when he said “ it is ex- pedient for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not ” (John xi, 50).—E D .] Yet it was only those who strove to understand spiritually the mystic saying as to “ eating the fl esh and drinking the blood ” of Christ who found it a “ hard saying ” ; for the savage rites of communion were familiar to the ancient world. It was but slowly that the average Jew began to understand that no good God could delight in burnt offerings, whether of men or of beasts ; that cond uct was more important than sacri fi ce ; that “ the blood of bulls, and goats, and the ashes of an heifer ” (Heb. ix, 13) could not remove sin ; and that many sacri fi ces were of no avail (Isaiah i, 11-17) ; though their Psalmist told them this (Psalm 1, 7 -15), saying (xl, 6) that burnt o fferings were not required.

If sacri fi ce of what is most precious to us were wrung from us by any power—God, fi end, or priest—its moral worth would be gone. It would be neither an act of love, nor one of duty, but a mere commercial speculation dictated by motives of fear, or by hope of reward. It is needless to describe the endless human sacri fi ces of savages in Dahomey, or Ashantee, or Amer ica (see Azteks, Khonds) ; for we fi nd them surviving to a late age among races claiming a higher civilisation. The inhabitants of Borneo secured the stability of their principal pile-dwellings by driving the fi rst pile through the body of a maiden, as the only means of pacifying the earth godess; but after- wards substituted a slave, and since the advent of Europeans have even found a pig to be suf fi cient. At the close of the Barmese war, in 1854, the king resolved to secu re better luck by changing his capital from Amarap ū r to Mandalay ; and, though professing Bud- dhism, he sacri fi ced scores of Buddhist subjects under the foundations. Men were buried alive in great oil vats specially made, that their spirits—sacri fi ced to earth—might haunt and protect the walls of the city. We were on the frontier at the time, and heard the details daily. Fifty-two men, chosen as being without spot or blemish, were selected to be so buried under the gates and bastions, and four others under the throne. When dangers again threatened the dynasty, seven years later, these vats were opened to make sure that the bodies were still there, for bribes might have se cured the escape of the victims. Two were found empty, and the royal Pohnes, or astrologers, decreed that men, women, boys, and girls, and Kal ā s or foreigners—one hundred of each-must be sacri fi ced at once, or otherwise that the capital must be abandoned. One hundred were actually buried by these “ good Buddhists ” before the British gove rnment interfered, telling the king plainly that his dif fi culties were due to himself and not to his subjects (see Shway Yoe, The Barman , chap. xxii). In Byblos the Phœnicians immolated boys in honour of Adonis. The Taurian Artemis, and Artemis Orthia, demanded human victims. The Thessalians offered the best of their race to Peleus and Kheir ō n. The Scythians immolated strangers only to their Diana. Syrians offered virgins to Pallas; and the Phrygians burned themselves for their Tellurian Kub ē l ē . The islanders in the Cyclades vied with each other in offering women and children to their deities.

The Carthaginians continued these terrible rites till a Roman governor, in our 2nd century, hanged their priests. But Rome her- self had been equally savage in earlier times. To secure the founda- tions of public buildings a bride used to be sacri fi ced, and the Romans drowned the cries of the victim with the sound of fl utes and trumpets, and boisterous laughter. They co ntinued to offer human victims down to the 2nd century B . C .; and it is said that as late as 186 B . C . the fl esh was sacramentally eaten in honour of Bacchus. The fi rst edict against these terrible rites appears to have dated from 76 B . C . ; being due to the desire of the people, and not of their priests. In the time of J ulius Cresar two men were publicly sacri fi ced by the pontifex and fl amens of Mars ; and even Augustus sacri fi ced many at the altar of Julius. Boys were sacri fi ced in the time of Cicero ; and the Catiline conspirators offered up a slave, and drank his blood to ratify their vows. Augu stus and Tiberius were the fi rst emperors who succeeded in suppressing these cruel rites. From a decree of Charlemagne in 789 A . C . we see that human sacri fi ces were still common in his barbarous empire, especially among pagan Saxons. They did not begin to die out till the 9th century. Unable to prevent the sacri fi ce of cattle at ancient shrines, Gregory I (600 A . C .) instructed his missionaries that these were to be offered up to God and to Christ, at the new churches which often were the old sacred circles (see Church). St Jerome says that the Druids, or “ enchanters ” (see Druids), not only offered human sacri fi ces but ate the fl esh and drank the blood. Throughout pagan Europe such rites were common, and indeed few churches appear to have been founded without the shedding of blood. St Columba is said to have buried his brother under the foundation of a church in the 6th century ; but gradually a horse, or a lamb, was substituted ( Rev. Celtique , vi, 121 : Academy , 31st July 1886). The skeleton of a cat was quite recently found carefully built up in the wall of a house in Limerick, apparently through the same idea of placating the earth-spirit. The led charger at an of fi cer’s funeral is only the last relic of the horse sacri fi ce at tombs of Scythian chiefs. Mr E. Dunn ( Notes and Queries , 28th July 1888) says that, at the burial of the Queen’s huntsman in 1886, “ the favourite charger of the deceased was shot previous to the funeral, and the ears placed on the cof fi n when in the grave, and buried with him ” at Ascot—so hard do such rites die even in the great centres of our civilisation. Children were buried, only a few centuries ago, to steady the foundations of sacred buildings (see"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Sacrifice 221 Caxton's Chronicles of 1480) ; and we have details of a yet later attempt to repeat this rite in Wales ( Notes and Queries , 3rd Nov. 1888). With music, and solemn ch ants, and rites of circumambula- tion, the chief Druid used to advance on the poor bound victim, and stabbing him through the bowels, left him to die. Only in our 1st century did the Romans succeed in suppressing the human sacri fi ces of our ancestors at the expense of occasional rebellions : they were forced to burn the Druids in their own fi res, and to destroy their groves and altars ; but their object was political rather than humane, for they found these priests too powerful. That these ideas of sacri fi ce are even now hardly extinct we see from many recorded instances. In the Isle of Man ( Notes and Queries , 27th July 1902) we read that the Manxmen were much afraid of the wrath of ghosts because, in 1859, Messrs Oliver and Oswald had explored a chambered tomb near the Tynwald Mount ; and a farmer, offered a heifer as a burnt sacri fi ce, to appease the anger of the dead. A calf was burned alive at Sowerby near Halifax in 1824, and a more recent instance in Devonshire is mentioned. In 1852 (see Notes and Queries , 23rd April 1887) a Highland youth was injured by a cart. A wizard named Adam Gordon told him that this was “ no accident,” but a “ sacri fi ce for sins of omission,” because he had broken up fresh land without offering a victim. Such cases he said were the invariable result of this neglect, as when Lowlande rs who “ acted like brute beasts ” would build bridges without sacri fi cing. The sacri fi ces he said were “ due to the devil ”—the so-called “ gude-man of the croft.” The cure be offered was to walk ro und the injured youth seven times “ Deasil-wise ” (see De-suil), touchi ng the limb, and chanting a hymn to the Trinity. Human and animal sacri fi ces are still common in Russia, and the blood of the victim is often drunk. During the famines of 1892 and 1894, among the Votiaks (who are Turanians), eleven persons were sentenced to penal servitude fo r life, and others were sent to Siberia, because they believed that their god Kourbane (“ earth- spirit ”) demanded a human victim every year, and one besides in order to induce him to abate the scourge of death. In the latter year they “ carried off a peasan t named Matounine, hanging him up by the feet to a tree; half cut his head off (taking care not to sever it completely from the trunk) : opened the breast, tore out the heart with their hands ; and then, as they danced round the image of their god, besmeared it with the blood of their victim.

The Spaniards found similar cruel rites in Mexico and Peru, in our 16th century. The victims were fattened for the sacri fi ce (see Peru). The Rev. Baring Gould says that “ among Iroquois, when an enemy was tortured the savage executioners leapt round,” crying “ Great spirit we slay this victim that thou mayest eat his fl esh, and be moved thereby to give us luck, and victory over our foes.” Sir Spencer St John (H.B.M. Consul -General in Hayti) told us, in 1884, of most awful religious rites and sacri fi ces which came under his own notice, among Hayti natives who spoke English and French, and were tolerably educated, and well-to-do. In 1888 again, a pious fanatic here tore the heart out of a living person, and drank the blood in the name of his god. A poor deluded woman boiled her own child (others say the child of a neighbour who consented to the sacri fi ce), and ate the body as a religious rite, in presence of a sacred serpent. Lice ntious rites (see Sakta) followed this horrible deed, and Christian rule rs were found to minimise or to deny the facts (see Voduns). The Hindus have now passed to the substitution stage of sacri fi ce, though some still offer human victims. Non-Aryans even, under government pressure, are so advancing (Dr R. Lal-mitra, Journal Rl. Asiatic Socy ., xlv, parts 1 and 3, 1876, and Rao Bahadur-Deshmukh, Anthrop. Journal , Bombay, ii, 1887). But on arrival in India (see lndia and Vedas) the Aryans, who were no “ mild Hindus,” accepted all the rites of human and animal sacri fi ce that they found in the land. Mr Deshmukh classi fi es sacri fi ces as follows : I. Non-Aryan in honour of such gods as K ā li, Bishna, Bh ā va, etc. : II. Aryan including the Tantrik, and the Vedik : the latter are again divided (1) Srauta , or those of the Scriptural Srauta-Sutras ; (2) Sm ā rta or traditional rites required by the Smriti “ traditions,” and by the later Pur ā nas (see Tantra). According to the Rig Veda, Manu who was saved at the Deluge, fi rst kindled the sacri fi cial fi re (V, i, ii), just as Noah does in the Bible, or the Babylonian Deluge hero in the myth of Gilgamas. When Br ā hmanas, and Sutras were written, the rites were still coarse and rude. In the Bh ā gavata-Pur ā na we read that Vishnu was to be worshiped during the Krita age by meditation : in the Treta age by sacri fi ce ; in the Dvapara age by adoration of images ; and in the Kali age by praise and prayer. This was apparently written for Vedik Aryans in the Kali age. The Sutras (like Leviticus) lay down all details concerning sacri fi ces—the kind"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Sacrifice 223 of animal ; its color and purity ; the mode of killing and cutting it up (at which the Br ā hmans were very expert) ; and the parts fi t for sacri fi ce, such as gods (and probably Br ā hmans) liked best. The whole Vedik system of sacri fi ce is based on worship of the household fi re (see Ag) ; and the kind of wood to be used, and the utensils, are carefully described in the Sutras. Some ancient sacri- fi ces, such as that of the horse (see Asva-medha), and of the ox (the S ū la-gava sacri fi ce), with the object of producing a son, are forbidden in the Kali age ; but the hawk sacri fi ce (Syena-y ā ga), and the Parjan-yeshti rite, to bring rain, still continue. The hawk was held to grant victory over enemies. A horse sacri fi ce was celebrated however as late as 1728, when the great Jai-singh of Jaip ū r (a scienti fi c astronomer) founded his capital. Goat sacri fi ces were quite recently celebrated at Poona, and Alibeg. From the life of Sankar- ā ch ā rya, the great Vedanta teacher (see that heading), we learn that bloody sacri fi ce was still regarded as scriptural in our 8th or 9th century. He insisted on its occurring on pure earth as laid down in the Vedas, just as among Hebrews an altar of, or on, earth was prescribed (Exod. xx, 24). Mr Deshmukh says that Buddhists, and Jains, fought for 1500 years against the bloody rites and caste tyranny of the Br ā hmans, till in our 10th century the D ā ya-dhamma (or “ religion of mercy ”) pre- vailed, and Buddha became a Hindu Avat ā ra, or incarnate deity. The change (as in other creeds) was gradual and slow : the victims continued to be brought to the alta r, the rites were enacted symboli- cally, and the animals then loosed. At last only images of the victims were presented to the deity or to the fi re—a practice still known. On the death of a great personage a bull, instead of being sacri fi ced, is let loose : and instead of a goat a pumpkin is cut up, and offered with Mantras or “ charms.” The older substitution was that of the horse (or in Abraham’s case of the ram) for the human victim. The Hindu now replaces the lamb by offerings of fruits, fl owers, and grain. The gods once ca nnibals are now vegetarians. Among the rude non-Aryans, or the half-Hindu races, in the native states of India, goats, sheep, and fowls, are still sacri fi ced at solar festivals—especially at the Dasara fete sacred to K ā li (see Durga). It is still dif fi cult to prevent the Bangas, even in Calcutta (their K ā li-ghat), from following their hereditary tendencies, which have overcome fear of punishment even as late as 1892, when a boy was sacri fi ced at the little shrine of K ā li close to the walls of Fort William, where the lieutenant-governor of Bang ā l resides.

Bhagav ā n and K ā li must have the choicest of the fl ocks; and fi elds ; for hungry priests must live, and the stranger at times must be regaled ; so that Amber has still his daily sacri fi ce at noon (see Amba). We have witnessed the Dasara fêtes during epidemics of cholera and small-pox, in honor of the deities who control such disease ; and such sacri fi ces are made whenever new lands are reclaimed, or great droughts occur. We have seen the victim’s heart torn out, and the blood sprinkled on the fi elds, while the head is hung up by a holy fi re kept burning for two weeks. To remove this head would mean, in spite of our police, that the transgressor would be murdered, just as if he had removed a lingam stone. Sir Edwin Arnold ( India Revisited ) exaggerates, we must hope, when he says that-at the siege of J ā isal-mir—24,000 Rajput women and girls were put to a voluntary death, by Johur —a ceremony of sacri fi ce—some by the sword, and some by fi re, after which the husbands and fathers, with leaves of the Tulsi plant in their turbans, and sprinkled with yellow powder on faces and garments, went out to die for their faith. “ Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum.” Our government, in 1850, succeeded in persuading the Khonds to discontinue their usual human (Meriah) sacri fi ces, but they no doubt continue in secret. In 1830 the Raja of Bustar (a Khond state, about 100 miles N.W. of Vizagapatam) sacri fi ced 25 men to K ā li, called locally Dant-Isvari (“ Siva’s tooth ”) from the lingam in her shrine. Since 1842 a guard has been placed over this temple, to prevent such an occurrence in future, and the Raja has been held responsible. In 1877 a Gossain of Ban ā ras sacri fi ced a boy of twelve to Siva, in order to fi nd treasure ; in 1883 a Banya (or tradesman) family of twelve persons committed su icide to “ please the gods ” : and not long ago creditors in N.

Mr Desbmukh ( Journal Anthrop. Socy ., Bombay , Feb. 1882) says that it used to be quite usual to bury a woman in the foundations of any very important building ; and Sir Bartle Frere (who was nearly 40 years in W. India) says that : “ No Rajput or Mahratta fortress could be built with any certainty of permanence or safety—in popular estimation—till the head man of an ancient tribe—usually a Bhil—was buried in the foundations of the keep, or other prominent part.” He might however give his son as the corner stone ; and the same idea is found among early Malag ā sy tribes, Siamese, Barmese, and othe rs. Such then are the innumerable miseries that man has in fl icted on his fellows, and on dumb beasts, on account of his belief that “ without blood there is no remission of sins ” ; that a substitute must be offered for himself ; and that union with a deity must be attained, in some mystic manner, by eating his fl esh and drinking his blood, or partaking (as among Azteks) of some food symbolising the divine body (see Crosses). We have seen that suicide to please the gods is a rite of self sacri fi ce. Self torture also is held to compel deities to grant marvellous powers to ascetiks ; this being a modi fi ed form of self sacri fi ce. Men threw themselves down to die under the wheels of the cars bearing arks of the gods (see Arks), and fl ung themselves from precipices, drowned themselves in sacred wells, or crawled for many miles on their bellies to the shrine (see Ban ā ras). Just so the pious Kelt still crawls on his bleeding knees up the steep rocks of Croagh Patrick, which looks out over the Atlantic in Connaught, with the approval of his priests, at the feast of the pattern or “ patron ” saint, who here ex- pelled snakes and toads from Irelan d. The Sicilians still scramble every year, for many miles over hill and dale, to the shrine of the Madonna de la Catena (“ Our Lady of the Chain ”), on the occasion of her “ festa ” in September ( Times , 21st February 1891). They think to please her by carrying in their hands a piece of soft wood ( sferza ) the size of a penny, stuck with 40 or 50 pins, with which (like Ba’al priests or Dervishes) they stab their shoulders, breasts, and legs, with wild shouts, encouraged by women who supply them with bread and wine. A priest leads the bleeding procession, out of which many fall exhausted or dying. Entering the church they are joined by the women, and all alike crawl towards the high altar, licking the dirty fl oor of the church with their tongues as they go. Mrs Stevenson ( Athenæum , 23rd June 1883) describes a similar scene in the cathedral of St Nicholas of Bari, in S. Italy.

They rejected all the foreign beliefs of the Pharisees, as to resurrec- tion and traditions not written in the Law, and believed in Free- will—God not being to them the author of evil. Josephus says that they “ persuaded none but the rich,” and being of the aristocratic class, and better educated than the Rabbis, they accepted the political realities of the age, so that the high priests under Herod and the Procurators were Sadducees, and the Pharisees were excluded from political power. Christ, in teaching a spiritual resurrection and kingdom of God, rejected alike the teaching of the Sadducees and of the Pharisees. The later K ̣ araites are often regarded as Sadducees (see K ̣ araites), and the Sadducees are said to trace their origin to a certain S ̣ adok ̣ (Zadok) of the 2nd century B . C .

The Sakti is the female “ energy ” of a god, in Hindu systems, answering to the Phœnician Peni (“ face ” or “ mani- festation ”), as in Peni-Ba’al a na me of Ashtoreth, or Peni-el “ the appearance of God ” : both are based on the idea that matter is female, and the spiritual reality male. Hence the Saktis are the patronesses of material production, and their rite s are grossly naturalistic. Hindus speak of nine Saktis as Grama-deva tas, or “ earthly godesses ” : and Sakti is said to meau “ attachment,” or “ conjunction.” The Saktya sects are numerous and unde fi ned; and their secret rites celebrate the worship of the godess personi fi ed by a naked girl, who is supposed to be in a state of hypnotic trance, and unconscious of what occurs, and who is called a Y ō gini or female Y ō gi (see Yoga), or otherwise a Kund, or Panth, personifying the Yoni. It is said that every third person in Lower Bang ā l has, at some time or other, taken part in Sakti rites, which are in fact a reversion to barbarism, and resemble those of Australians and other savages. They are founded on the licentious portions of the Tantras, which treat of the worship of K ā ma-devi, the godess of love (see Tantra) : many Saktyas endeavour to justify their orgies by appeal to the passage in the Veda which speaks of the divine spirit who “ felt himself alone, and desiring to create . . . formed within himself the productive princi ple. . . . He wished, and his body parted in twain, when the male and female Sakti appeared . . . united themselves, and produced all things ” : they say “ Why should we not try to imitate the gods ?” So scriptures, as “ oft veiling mysteries least understood,” are made to sanction every horror of which a race is guilty ; but such rites are much older than the Vedas, and are not justi fi ed by them.

The Y ō gini may be a Sudr ī , or Br ā hman ī , or a dancing girl, or milkmaid, for caste is set aside. A Brahman may preside, but the lowest Pariah is admitted ; the rites are celebrated at night, an d all are bound by vows of secrecy. The girl, though naked, is covered with jewelry, and is afterwards richly rewarded. She is incensed and decked with fl owers. On the second night another Y ō gini is adored by an equal number of men and women, all being naked. The details of these orgies are given by many writers (see Indian Antiq ., May 1881 ; Mr S. C. Dutt, India Past and Present : Atkinson, “ Himalayan Tribes,” Bengal Rl. Asiatic Soc. Journal , i, p. 84 ; Sellon’s Annotations ; Abbé Dubois, India ; and Wilson as above). In Bang ā l and Mais ū r the Saktyas, according to Mr Dutt, are Siva worshipers, and call them- selves either Dakshin-Ach ā ris, or Bam-Ach ā ris (“ right ” and “ left ” hand Ach ā ris), but these distinctions are gradually growing faint. The Saktyas call themselves also Bhairavas (“ terrible ”), and Viras (or “ strong men ”), regarding all who do not belong to their fraternity as Paçu or “ tame beasts.” The leader will sometimes select his own wife as the godess ; but if the Y ō gini has not been previously initiated she is made an adept by a Mantra whispered in her ear : for every- thing that is done is accompanie d by hymns and prescribed gesticula- tions. Even Moslem women are sometimes participators. The female initiates are called Bhairav ī s and Naiyikas (see Rig Veda, II, viii, 13, 14) ; the meetings occur in lonely places, and even at burning grounds. They are ostensibly ri tes to secure power against evil spirits, and the adept is said to be seated on a corpse to which offer- ings are made.

The heroine in K ā lid ā sa’s celebrated drama of the “ Lost Ring.” She was the daughter of Visv ā -mitra, by Mena an Apsara or beavenly nymph, deserted by her parents—the father being an ascetik—and fed by birds, till the infant was found by Kanwa, a great sage, and a descendant of K ā syapa, who took her to his hermitage, near the M ā lin ī river, where she was tended by Y ā vanas or Greek foreigners. Dushyanta, the king of N.W. India, while hunting in the forest saw her, and they fell in love. They were united by a Gandharva marriage, or mutual agreement, and he left with her a ring which belong ed to him, on returning to his kingdom. She set out to join him, but accidentally offended the sage Durv ā sa, and his curse rendered the king forgetful of having ever seen her before. She went back to the forest, where Men ā her fairy mother tended her, and where her son Bh ā rata was born. Dushyanta was a descendant of Puru (see Br ā hma), and so of Buddha (or the planet Mercury), the son of the moon, who wedded Satya-vrata the “ true one,” daughter of Manu. The lost ring was found by a fi sherman, and taken to this king, who then remembered Sakuntal ā , and disguising himself sought his wife, and acknowledged Bh ā rata as his son and heir.

There are many imitations, but the real fossil is said to be the only stone directly created by deity : for Vishnu, by aid of Maya (“ illusion ”), took this form to escape from Siva, who however pierced it with innumerable small borings. These, and the threads or corrugations of the shell, constitute its value as a charm, since all such knots and convolutions are powerful against th e evil eye, witches being forced to count them (see Knots).

Hindus strew salt round babes, and newly we dded couples. Ezekiel speaks of this custom (xvi, 4). Christians co nsidered that babes should be salted until they had been baptised, and when taken to be shown at various houses the owners put salt into their mouths, while mothers placed salt in the cradles, or on the infant’s brow, feet, and hands. Salt was thrown on the hearth whenever any of the family set out on a journey, or when milk was spilt. Holy water also requires salt; and plates of salt were placed on corpses (see ’Az ā zel). It was very unlucky to spill salt at table (as we see in Leonardo da Vinci’s picture of the Last Supper, where Judas is spilling the salt) : and oaths were con fi rmed by a “ covenant of salt.” The “ salt-spell ” was a well known rite in cases of sickness, and salt was of ten. mixed with saliva—as in the Roman Oatholic rite of “ Sal et Saliva ” ( Annotated Prayer Book and Administration of Baptism ). Salt was the emblem of fi delity, and of wisdom : and was the sign of regeneration, and of vital power (see Grimm, Witch of Canemorto ). The hearth and door should be sprinkled with salt at weddings (Napier, Folk-Lore , pp. 33,47,139).

The wizard priests of Mongolia are now known as Samans : the Buddhist Sraman was a “ worker ” or mission- ary. The Tartar stone, or sacri fi cial post, is also called a Saman. Shamans (or Kams) were a class cre ated by Tengri (the Turanian heaven god) “ to struggle with evil spirits, which arose in the east,” good spirits being found in the west. The Samans are also called Oyun by Yak ̣ ut Turks, and Tadibi by Sa moyeds. They have magic rods, and many charms and amulets. They dance wildly, beating magic drums ; and they fall in fi ts, relating, when they recover, their journeys to the realms of Erlik the god of the under world (Akkadian Arali “ Hades ”), whose abode is guarded by dogs whom they appease with food and drink. Erlik also delights in strong drink. The Shamans are both male and female, and are decked with snakes, strips of fur, and little bells. They wear conical helmets of iron, with deers’ antlers, and carry wands with horses’ heads. Their loose dress is of leather, with gauntlet sleeves ; on the arms and back are plates of iron. Small fi gures of men and animals hang from the collars, and leather streamers on the back ; while a dragon surmounts the helmet. The divining rod is hung with bells and tassels, and is swung about in blessing or cursing.

Every tribe has its chief Shaman, who arranges its rites, and takes charge of its idols ; and under him there are local and family priests or wizards, who regulate all that concerns birth, marriage, and death, cast horoscopes, and purify man, woman, and child, animals, food , and offerings. None may pitch a tent, or taste food, till the Shaman has consecrated the place or the meal (Howarth, Indian Antiq ., Feb., March 1883).

Th e female Shamans are as conspicuous as the men, though generally the Mongol women hold an inferior position. The Lamas and Bonzes mingle Buddhism with this early Turanian paganism, but the strict Buddhist calls his monk a Hlaba. In 1882 the Rev. J. Gilmour wrote that : “ One half the males among Mongols are Lamas, who are utterly degraded in morals, and now addicted to drink. . . . Buddhism has largely effaced the war- like aggressive character of the tribes, and owing to Russian in fl uence it is now no uncommon thing to meet educated, intelligent, and wealthy Mongols throughout Asiatic Russia ” ( Among Mongols , 1883) : yet Sr ā mans are to be seen of fi ciating at the ancient shrines and trees, “ to please the people,” as they say, and as we have seen English clergy of fi ciate at the holy well of Tissington ( Rivers of Life , ii, p. 380). White is the sacred color througho ut Mongolia, at both fêtes and funerals : men step aside respectfully to a white horse, or throw them- selves fl at before a white mare : the silver birch is holy ; and milk is the chief offering to the gods, larg e bowls being presented to heaven, earth, mountains, and rivers. A bowl of the “ fi rst milk ” of the new grass season is thrown spinning towa rds the southern sky. If it falls upright it is accepted, but if it is overturned a sheep or goat must be sacri fi ced. At all these rites images of Buddha are constantly in use. At the Sanga-h ā ra, or “ white moon ” fête in autumn, goats and sheep are offered to all gods. One god is called a Nagit, and is robed in rags, and placed in a Yurt or round hut of sticks, felt, and feathers, near a Shire , or sacred circle, where the refuse of the sacri fi ces is burnt.

No one may remove the Gurs or sacred poles from the Yurt or the Shire , nor touch the gifts tied to them. They are left to the winds and the birds. At the great Sul-bunda fête the Ongon-murin (“ God’s horse,” a well- bred stallion) is sacri fi ced (see Asva-m ē dha), on the death of its owner, until which time it has been held sacred, and few have been allowed to ride it. Nor could it be sold or given away, being reserved for sacri fi ce in time of danger or distress. The sacred cairns (see Ō b) and sacred trees are decked with rags, ribbons, and hair from the mane or tail of a horse, and are places fo r prayer, as when the uncle of Tchengiz Khan vowed to decorate a tree, which vow he ful fi lled after victory, attributing it to his own piety in his harangue to the troops, who danced round the tree ( Indian Antiq ., March 1883). The winds and the waters must be consulted before a hut is erected. Sir H. Howarth says that there is a considerable Mongol literature connected with this subjec t, as also with augury by the bones, entrails, and fl ight of birds, or the rites necessitated by spilling milk. It is death to lean on a whip which has beaten a horse, or to touch it with an arrow; to beat a ho rse with a bridle, or to tread on the threshold (see Mongols) : any who spat out meat that choked him used to be dragged through a hole dug under the tent, and was then mercilessly executed. The soul of the Shaman remains on earth to plague mankind. He must therefore be buried at a distance, on some high place, as he maintains his evil power over the living. Samaria. Samaritans. The city of Shomron (“ watch tower ” in Hebrew), whence the province of Samaria was named, was built on a low hill W. of Shechem, by Omri, king of Israel, about 915 B . C . (1 Kings xvi, 24). There is a small village at the place, with ruins of Herod’s temple to Augustus, an d of the 12th century church of St John the Baptist, over a Jewish tomb. The head of St John was the chief relic, but was also shown at Damascus. The city was taken by Sargon in 722 B . C ., when King Hoshe’a was taken captive. Sargon says in his record : “ I o ccupied the town of Samaria, and took captive 27,280 persons, and t ook from them 50 chariots, but left them the rest of their belongings. . . . I placed my governor over them, and renewed the obligation imposed on them by a former king.” The captives from Hamath were transferred to this town (see 2 Kings xvii, 30) with others, in 715 B . C .; hence Josephus speaks of the Samaritans as Kutheans ( Ant ., IX, xiv, 1), and as Sidonians in the 4th century B . C .

Sanballat (Neh. ii, 10; iv, 7; vi, 2; xiii, 28), a leader related by marriage to the high priest Eliashib, in the time of Nehemiah, gathered a number of Israelites in the J;Iauran, according to Samaritan tradition, and brought them to Shechem, where he built a temple (see Gerizim) on the sacred moun- tain where Joshua had erected the Tabernacle. Josephus says that this temple was built about 335 B . C .; and it was destroyed by John Hyrcanus in 109 B . C . ( Ant ., XIII, ix). The Samaritan remnant in Shechem was cruelly persecuted by the Romans, and by Justinian in the 6th century A . C . They appear to have prospered under the Moslems, and spread over a great part of Palestine. They had still a synagogue in Damascus, and another in Alexandria, as late as the 17th century ; but their synagogue was taken from them by Moslems at Shechem ; and the present buildin g is a poor modern house in the town, the older one being called H ̣ izn Y’ak ̣ ū b outside the city—the supposed site of “ Jacob’s grief ” on the loss of Joseph—which is now a mosk, having a Samaritan text of the 6th century in the wall of the minaret. The sacred sites include Jacob’s well, the tomb of Joseph, the mosk of Jacob’s pillar at the foot of Geriz ī m, and the tombs of the sons of Aaron further S.E. at ’Awertah (see Geriz ī m) ; these are fully described in the Memoirs of the Survey of W. Palestine (see vol ii, and Col. Conder’s paper on “ Samaritan Topography ” in the same Memoirs ). The synagogue contains three ancient MSS. of the Pentateuch (see Bible), which is th e only Hebrew scripture accepted by the Samaritans, who say that the Jews have changed the text, reading Ebal for Geriz ī m (Deut. xi, 29). They date the apostacy of the Jews from the time when ’Eli established a rival tabernacle at Shiloh, instead of Joshua’s at Shechem. They preserve the ancient alphabet of Israel as used before th e Captivity, instead of the Aramean character adopted by the Jews after the Captivity : and they celebrate the Passover in strict obedience to the Law, with loins girt and staff in hand (see Passover) ; they do no t use the phlyacteries (see Phulak- teria), or the Ethrog lemon of the Jews : the latter symbol, used at the feast of Tabernacles, being noticed by Josephus as early as the 2nd century B . C . There appears to be no doubt that the Samaritans established themselves independentl y at Shechem under the Persians ; but it is quite possible that their priests were of the same family with that of the high priest at Jerusalem in the time of Ezra. The Jews accuse them of worshiping a dove on Geriz ī m (probably referring to their legend of a messenger do ve sent by Joshua to Nabih ̣ (Nobah ̣ ) the ruler of Gilead), and of saying that the goat Ashima created the world—because they read Ha-Shem (“ the name ”), just as the"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Samaria 238 Jews read Adonai , instead of pronouncing the sacred name of Yahveh. The Samaritans imagine that their oldest MS. (which is perhaps of the 6th century A . C .) was written by Abishu’a, the son of Phineh ̣ as, son of Aaron : and another by the high priest Nathaniel, who died 20 B . C . The fi rst MS. of the Samaritan Pentateuch known in Europe came from Damascus in 1616 A . C ., and the comparison with the accepted Hebrew text, and with th e Septuagint, gave rise to many controversies. The language is Hebrew—with some dialectic pecu- liarities—and the variations are of very minor importance. Another MS. called the “ Fire tried,” is in book form. It consists of 217 leaves (from Gen. i, 29 to Deut. xxx iii, 29), and, though named from a legend that it came unhurt out of the fi re, in the days of “ Zerub- babel the Jew,” it is comparatively modern. In addition to these, and to modern prayer-books, the Samaritans possess two other works of interest. The fi rst is their Book of Joshua (published by Juyn- böll) : and the second is the Samaritan Chronicle (published by Dr Neubaur) : these bave been described, and the topography minutely studied by Col. Conder. The Samaritan Book of Joshua is a work of about the 13th century A . C ., and contains various legends connected with the conquest of Central Palestine, which are not in the Hebrew Joshua. The 12 stones of Gilgal are said to have been carried to the top of Geriz ī m ; and the foundation blocks of Justinian’s fortress on the mountain—just N. of the bare sacred rock with its single cup-hollow—are pointed out as being the actual stones from Jordan. Joshua and his army were imprisoned by magic in K ̣ eim ū n (Jok ̣ neam on the Kishon), when fi ghting giants in Galilee, but were delivered by Nabih ̣ from Gilead, who was warned by the messenger dove. The later part of the work refers to the schism of ’Eli, and to the return of Israel under Sanballat ̣ to Shechem ; and it goes down to the time of “ Alexander of the two horns,” relating the legend of his being borne in a box by eagles. The Samaritan Chronicle is a much more valuable work, begun apparently in the 7th century A . C ., and gradually added to by successive high priests. It contains an allusion to the Cruci fi xion of Christ, and a full account of Samaritan prosperity in the time of the fi rst Khalifs of Damascus. But the Samaritans are now a poor and decaying race, only about 150 in all being left at Shechem—the modern Nablus. The Samaritans had originally no belief in any resurrection of the body, or Messiah, but held that there were many angels and devils. According to Ep iphanius, however (310-403 A .

He will be a son of Joseph, not equal to Moses, but recovering the Ten Commandments from under the twelve stones, togeth er with the golden vessels of their temple. He will reign 110 year s, and will be buried beside the tomb of Joseph. The world will then come to an end, having existed for 7000 years. Samas. Shemesh. Samson. Semitic names for the sun.

They are surrounded by a great circle of spectators, and sway to and fro beating drums, and saluting the four quarters of the horizon. Each dancer then takes a girl on his left arm, and the whole proces- sion moves slowly round, perspiri ng under the sun. On another occasion a dance round a tree with branches loaded with cocoa- nuts, yams, streamers,and fl owers, is described, the tree being 75ft. high, and set in the centre of the village (see Gonds, and Maypoles). The missionary (p. 169) says : “ At the opposite end of the village we saw four girls, beautifully tatooed, coming along dancing, followed by 30 men also dancing and beating drums, and two girls in rear.” The girls wore short petticoats, and th eir female relatives were anxious that they should distinguish themse lves by correct mo vements.

The Samoan or Navigator Islands are a group of 13 in Melanesia, the three large on es being Samoa (Sawaii or Pola), Upoln (or Oyalava), and Tutuila or Mauna. The people, though physically well made, are lazy, and are now dying out. They now number only 26,000, of whom 2500 are labourers imported from other islands. They have decreased by one-half between 1840 and 1890. They are regarded as representing the most ancient Polynesian type (see Melanesians), intermediate between the Papuan to the W. and the brown race to the E.

According to the Samoan cosmogony, from Leai (“ nothing ”) arose fragrance, and dust, the perceptible and obtainable or earth (Eleele), and then rocks, stones , and mountains. Maunga (a mountain godess) had a daughter Fasiefu. A piece of dust settled on the fl ower of a sugar cane, and produced three sons and one daughter. All natural objects have sex, and the three Mahs—or high conical rocks—married earthy stones, high winds, and fl ying clouds. Tangaloa (perhaps the Turanian Tengri) is th e heaven god, wedded to the lower sky, which is the “ bestower of the dew of life.” Ana wedded to Sina is a male god. Papa is the rock god, and La or Ra is the sun. Sami is the ocean ; and Ma-sina is the m oon. Du is a worm or serpent god, or a “ man.” These deities were at peace till the winds disturbed them, when L ā and Ma-sina fl ew aloft, and there was general war till fi re and water produced a rotting debris, whence came maggots, and from them At and Fu, the fi rst human beings. No man knows the origin of Tangaloa. His daughter was a spirit who fl ew about the fl ooded earth as a bird (Turi), searching for land, which he gradually formed for the maggots. The loose rocks also produced fi re, and thence came a man Ariari, who made a woman out of a cuttle fi sh. But some say that man was formed from a kind of mussel shell. He has a soul (Ang ā nga) which “ comes and goes,” being a kind of vapour. The gods in council decreed that man's life should end like the fl ame of a torch. Tangaloa had a son Moa, produced by the rocks in the centre of the earth, and a daughter Lu—otherwise a son, who married the ocean and settled the land. These gods are incarnated in various beasts, birds, fi sh, or shells, called Aitu. The hut temples adjoining the Maras have sacred wells and cups ; stones, shells, skulls, etc., are hung up inside. A pole is set up on holy days, with a skull and streamers on the top. May-Day is a special fete througho ut Polynesia (see Union Islands) : wine is poured on earth, or sprinkled towards heaven, arid the sacri- fi ces are eaten.

The house of Fe’e, described by Mr Turner, was a circle like Stonehenge (p. 31). He is also a land god as Moso, symbolised by a stone, but incarnate in many forms, such as a pigeon in a wooden bowl decked with white shells, or as a man, or the tree Moso with. fragrant yellow fl owers.

Pava is represented by the taro leaf, and is a war god visible in the rainbow, which fl ies from Tangaloa, or the sun.

There were many war gods among a race seldom at peace, but the deities have now been almost effa ced by the Christian missionaries (p. 46). The owl was a symbol of Tonga, and men beat their foreheads with stones till blood fl owed, in his honour. Tangaloa, the “ unrestricted being,” is also the Turu or snipe, a bird worshiped in the May fetes ; and a sort of communal meal or eucharist is then eaten, none being absent from home at this season. In January Tonga is worshiped as Aitu-teh “ the great god ” (p. 204). The sacred emblems include the turtle, eel, butter fl y, and heart ; and there are some 50 tribal and family gods. Circumcision is a Samoan rite (compare Australians). Fire ( a fi , api , ai , or ahi ) is also worshiped (p. 116), and is connected with burial rites, the body being embalmed. Oaths are taken on a stone covered with sacred grass and anointed. Augurs are consulted as to war. “ Chastity is ostensibly cultivated by both sexes,” but is not really common (p. 91), and women often plea d (p. 200) that they “ become pregnant by looking at the rising sun,” so that children of the sun are often found.

The Rabbinic legend says that in one stride he could pass from Zoreah to Eshtaol (Judg. xiii, 25). He is announced by an angel, and his strength is in his hair (or rays) : he slays the lion like other solar heroes, and burns the crops with fi re. He also dwells in a cave, and sleeps in Gaza—the extreme west—appearing in the morning at Hebron in the east. He is tempted by Delilah in the vine valley of Sorek ̣ , and then becomes weak, his hair being shorn. Delilah represents the Omphal ē of the Greek legend of H ē rakl ē s.

The bridegroom’s sister carries a Kodi (which means both a basket and the Yoni), covered with the Mantri-Kodi or sacred cloth, to the bride’s room, and there is always a lighted taper beside it, and a small phial of oil.

The great Master, and his disciples whose relics lie in the buried caskets, are not forgotten ; but they are known only to the pilgrims from Ceylon, Barmah, or China, and to the European student of Buddhism : the people of the place know nothing of the faith or of its history. Relics of historic importance were here fo und by Dr Peterson the Professor of Sanskrit, to the Elphinstone College at Poona ( Times of India , 2nd April 1892). Two of Buddha’s disciples were here buried about 400 B . C . The Council of Patna, under Ā s ō ka in 241 B . C ., revised the Buddhist Canon, and included a work called the Questions of Upatissa . This disciple was called Sariputa on admission to Buddha’s ()rder, and he agreed with a friend Mogalana that whichever of them fi rst found salvation would tell the other. They died soon after each other, at a great age, sh ortly before Buddha himself, having been his chief disciples after Ananda whom he loved. In 1853 Major A. Cunningham, of the Bengal Engineers, dug into the mounds surrounding the central Sanchi Tope, and found a shaft with a slab at the bottom, under which were two large stone boxes. The southern of these bore on the lid the name of Sariputa, and the northern that of Mogalana. The fi rst contained a steatite casket enclosing two fragments of sandal wood : a fragment of bone less than an inch long, and seven precio us stones, were also found in the casket ; the sandal wood is supposed to have come from Sariputa's funeral pyre. In the other box was a similar casket, with two fragments of bone each half an inch long. The fi rst casket was marked in ink, inside the lid, with the letter Sa , and the second in like manner with Ma , for the names Sariputa and Mogalana. Dr Bühler, and others, agree that the great Tope at Sanchi is ()]der than 260 B . C ., and probably as old as 400 B . C .; the stone railing round it is perhaps as old as 20 or 30 A . C . (Gen.

Out of more than 400 in- scriptions at the site, 378 have been read, including Ā s ō ka’s edict about making a road for the processions of monks and nuns (see Academy , 17th June 1893). In the sculptures of the Tope, Buddha appears as a prince, not as an ascetik, and many of them represent J ā taka tales —that is stories of his previous lives. The evidence so collected appears to show us that the actual relics of Buddha’s chief disciples were here enshrined, long before Ā s ō ka’s time, and are to be added to an actual relic of Gotama Buddha himself (see Kapila-vast ū )."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Sancus 246 Sancus.

Sanskrit. See Deva-nagari, Kharoshthi, and India. The sacred Indo-Aryan language is the sister of the Zend in Persia, but it appears not to have been reduced to writing till about 600 B . C ., and was fi rst grammatically studied with the Prakrits, or dialects, by P ā nini—per- haps as late as the 4th century B . C . “ The whole Sanskrit literature which we possess,” says Prof. Max Müller ( India , 1883), “ with the exception of the Vedic, and earliest Buddhistic, cannot be older than about 400 A . C .” ; and again he says ( Biogr. of Words , 1888, pp. 83, 233) that : “ In India we fi nd no trace of books before the 5th century B . C .” In the 3d century B .

The literary speech is thus traced from the 4th or 5th century B . C . to the 1st century A . C . (Kanishka), and to the 2d (Rudra-d ā man’s in- scriptions). The so-called “ ungra mmatical ” Prakrits are those used by Ā s ō ka about 250 B . C ., and include the G ā th ā (“ song ”) dialect, which was scholastic. The “ grammatical ” dialects are of three classes : (1) the P ā li as written in Ceylon in 88 B . C .; (2) the Magadhi as written in 454 A .

But the characters on the Harpa seal, found in ruins ne ar Lahore, belong to the alphabet in which Sanskrit was written, and General Cunningham said that “ they cannot be later than 400 to 500 B .

The use of Sanskrit as a sacred language led to its being carefully preserved by priests till it became “ essentially a Br ā hman language, with its roots deep down in the traditions of the Vedas.” Of the Pr ā krits, as used on monuments between 250 B . C . and 300 A . C ., M. Senart also says that : “ The inscriptions show no trace of difference of dialect, or other appreciable variation, even between the most ancient and most modern.” These are all earlier than the age of the Sanskrit “ renaissance,” and of the oldest known Sanskrit MSS.

This Hindu saint, though a Brahman, dis- carded caste : he made no preten ces of secret wisdom : he was no Guru-ji or dispenser of charms, as many Sany ā sis are : he broke caste rules daily, and declined to be called a Guru : he disclaimed the possession of occult knowledge or powers : he worshiped many deities but none in particular, nor was he a Vedantist : “ he accepted all the doctrines, the embodiments, the usages, and devotional practices of every cult : each in turn was infallible to him.” His religion was ecstacy, and Hindu deities were to him a force “ tending to reveal the supreme relation of the soul to the eternal and formless ”—according to the somewhat occult expressions of Mr Mozumd ā r. His disciples said that when in ecstasy his features would grow stiff, his eyes sight- less, tears would run down his pale rigid yet smiling face, while he seemed unconscious. Then he would “ burst out in prayers, songs, and utterances, the force and pathos of which pierced the hardest hearts.” His words were not merely vague hypnotic talk : for they expressed the most sublime ideas of goodness and purity, with poetic diction strange to any but Oriental ears. He refused to found a sect, and left no writings : he described himself as a “ frail half sunk log of wood, fl oating on life’s troubled stream.” He cautioned all to “ beware of Gurus,” and not to come to him for salvation—“ they will drown me without saving themselves.” The Bandh ā yana may be called the Bible of Sany ā sis, and was known already in the 5th century B .

[This is not apparently a contemporary work.—E D .] The following examples show the nature of the document, as rendered by G. Smith : “ When the moon in its whole mass and the under part is full ; and a clear sky above and behind ( i.e . in the west) makes it large and bright, an omen for Sargina. He marched to the west : he swept the west ; and his hand captured the four quarters.” “ When the moon is like a cloud, and the orb has no horn, on the right (south) of the orb opposition is made, and on the left against it the seven confront.

Sargina came forth : he smote their bodies ; and accomplished their destruction.” The events which are thus connected with astrology by so me Babylonian priest include : (1) A victorious campaign in Elam ; (2) another in the west ; (3) the foundation of Agadhe, and submi ssion of all Babylonia : Agadhe was peopled with conquered races ; (4) and (5) campaigns in the west ; (6) a mutilated record ; (7) a campaign of three years, in which Sargina penetrated to the “ sea of the setting sun ” or Mediterranean, where he set up statues : he carried the spoil to Babylonia ; (8) the enlargement of the palace of Agadhe ; (9) the revolt of K ̣ astubili of Kazalla (in Kappadokia) : Sargina wasted this land with fi re and sword ; (10) the attack on Agadhe as above ; (11) the conquest of Subartu.

A fi ne cylinder of hæmatite, found at Kurion in Cyprus (Menant, Recherches sur la Glyptique Orientale , p. 73), bears this name in early, but not very archaic, characters : the text reads : “ The scribe, the king’s son, servant of th e divine Sargani, the king of Uru ” (or “ the illustrious ” king) ; and this evidently belongs to the later Semitic period, when Sargani was dei fi ed ; it certainly does not attest the conquest of Cyprus by Sargina.—E D .] This remarkable cylinder represents a fi gure of Gilgamas on each side of the inscription : he kneels on one knee, and holds a vase whence three streams are issuing, which are drunk by a bull below. Whether or not we accept the date given by Nabonahid for Sargina (to which there are some as tronomical objections) it seems clear that this ancient conquero r, who had become a legendary fi gure when the story of his birth was written, must have lived at a very early historic period (see Loh ̣ ).

According to the Tantras, there are 50 such places, called Pitha-sthana, and Sati is here identi fi ed with Devi, and Uma, as being the wife of Siva or Rudra. As Uma she is the “ mother,” and a daughter of Himavat (“ the snowy ”), and of Mena. She is the type of the Sati or “ true ” widow, supposed to show her fi delity by burning herself to accompany her husband to the other world. The rite (Suttee), which is not found in the Vedas, is said to have been fi rst established at Deo-garh, where the Chita-bhumi represents “ Sati’s ashes ” (see Deo-garh). It is said that Satis have never been very common in India, and not more th an 800 cases of widow burning have occured in any year. Most castes now disapprove of the practice, which is ancient since wives, and sl aves, were slain at the tomb among Scythians, Kelts, and others. Sati stones are common in India by the roadside, or in villages and fi elds, near holy wells and streams : they bave usually the forms of a man and woman. Some Sati s have shrines, where any glass beads, rings, or links, which the widow had with her on the pyre are consecrated as relics ; and where offe rings of rice, milk, cloths, sandal wood, etc., are made for the cure of various ailments. But no virtues are supposed to exist in the ashes of the widow herself. Capt.

The supposed disgrace of having no children, and the possibility of starvation, are indeed the inducements to the widow for self-immolation. On the husband’ s death she distributes jewelry among relatives and Br ā hmans, puts on a yellow cloth, and goes with a smiling face to the burning ground. She prays for her Raja and people, and mounts the pyre, after she has circumambulated it three times, with music, prayers and pr aises.

The early Roman god of “ sowing.” He is perhaps the Keltik Seatharan (from S ̣ eath, “ fulness,” and Aran, “ corn ”)—see Vallancey ( Col. Hibern ., iii, p. 413; iv, p. 3). The Saturnian age was represented to be a golden age. The Saturnalia were festivals when great licence was permitted, and which took place in the end of December, as soon as the winter solstice was passed. Thus Saturn is a god of the new year, and of the fi rst sowings. But in the time of Lucian he was identi fi ed with “ a baleful star with black fi res,” being the Babylonian Adar, and planet of evil in fl uence (see Ki ū n). Saturn (San ē ) among Hindus is said to hate mankind, and to cause family sorrows thro ugh wanton cruelty, but his power over any individual lasts only 7 2 1 years. Ptolemy’s astrological period of 465 years for the reign of Saturn is a multiple of the same period. But there is no escape from San ē , who chained Vishnu to a rice mortar, drove Siva mad, and changed Siva’s son Kartekeya, or Subra- manya, into a Vengai tree.

The term includes all those who devote attention to morality, and pr actical virtue, whether as Theists, Atheists, Skeptiks, Rationalists, or Agnostiks, all alike discarding the legends of popular creeds, and the superstitions of the past, and tolerating differences of opinion as to metaphysical speculations. They are abusively called In fi dels, or persons who have no faith—commonly understood to mean “ unfaithful,” be cause rejecting the popular beliefs of those among whom they happen to dwell. But Christ was called a blasphemer, and Sokrates an Atheist, Muh ̣ ammad an in fi del, and Buddha a heretic. Every great master was in his time regarded with pious horror by the ignorant. All these and others dated their new birth from the dawn of true religion in their hearts, when they became free from the dogmas of religions which sought to explain the great problems of life. Secularists usually continue to call themselves Christians, though indifferent to the teaching of the Churches about a “ fall,” and a “ redemption,” or eternal torture of the majority of mankind in fl icted by a supreme, almighty, just, and merciful father. They regard man as rising rather than falling, saved by his own efforts rather than by his beliefs. The founder of popular secularism in England seems to have been Mr George Jacob Holyoake, who formulated the system while imprisoned, with his friend Mr Charles Southwell, for blasphemy in 1841-1842. But such be lief is as old as Confucius in China, and lay at the root of the Stoik philosophy of Marcus Aurelius. It was voiced in the life-Iong cry of Thomas Paine : “ The world is my country, and to do good is my religion.” Mr Charles Bradlaugh and his party (from 1865 to 1880) did more than any others to advance secularism, which may now be regarded as one of the religions of the world—the Buddhism of the West, which has a strong hold on thousands who do not confess the name. Mr Holyoake wrote a pamphlet called Paley Refuted ; but yet earlier the Diegesis of the Rev. R. Taylor, B.A., of Trinity Co llege, Cambridge, was written in his cell in Oakham Jail, in February 1829, and Holyoake followed up, and systematised ideas which Ta ylor could not recommend to his own generation ; for he taught that Theocrasy meant priestly power, which checks human efforts to do good.

It is more reasonable and reverent to confess that we do not understand, and more modest to remain silent when speech involves self-contradiction . There is but one virtue—work— though there are many precepts : there are many fi nger-posts, but only one path to truth. There is but one philosophy to many theologies, and its name is Fortitude. Secularists do not encourage those who merely scoff at the past, or those who are merely indifferent and neutral. Their aim is to educate the ignorant in true morality, and their endeavour is to bene fi t mankind. Secularism lays stress on practical work as well as on free though t, and on the study of all sciences as “ the available providence of man.” It is a creed of self-help, guided by ethikal principle, and is unconcerned with doubts, making that as to which there is no doubt the bond of union between its members. The Secularist says that in thus promoting good he must be following the will of God if there be one, and is fi tting himself for a future life if such is to be expected. As rega rds such matters he says that : “ We can judge of the suitableness of the house we desire to live in, and can improve it, though we may never know the architect.” He accepts whatever is shown by human experience to be true in any Bible ; but .he is concerned only in provin g the truth of his own principles, and not that of Bibles. The principles of secularism have been put in practice in France for the last 20 years. In 1885 we fi nd issued the 40th edition of the First Year’s Course of Instruction—Moral and Civic , in “ ac- cordance with the law of the 28th March 1882.” In this children are taught “ our duties towards ourselves ” as follows : “ As you grow older you become more se rious. Consider what your duties are. You have duties towards yourselves, that is to say towards your bodies, and towards your souls.” The teacher then shows that attention to health gives the best chance of long life, while to ful fi l your duties to your soul you must cultivate your intelligence, and fi ght against evil inclinations and idleness, sel fi shness, vanity, anger and hatred.

In America the teaching of Col. Ingersoll has been much the same (see American Truth , August 1888). He says that : “ Secular- ism embraces everything that is of any real. interest or value to the human race . . . all that tenqs to preserve or increase the happiness of some sentient being. . . . It is the religion of this world, and if there is another, ne cessarily the religion of that as well. . . . It teaches us to be g ood here and now.” The mind of man is incapable of fi nding a nobler incentive to action than this, which embraces the broadest and fullest human love. Secularism represents a religion that has been always and everywhere practised : it is not one to be kept out of school, or out of society, as a danger, or to be restricted to select coteries . It is the duty of the Secularist to take part in the settlement of po litical and social problems, and to appeal to reason by calm discussi on. But science and secularism are naturally opposed by prejudice and habit, by heredity and the prepossessions of childhood. Prof. Huxley complained that the legends of Genesis closed every door leading to the fi elds of biology and critical history. The American Secularists have therefore striven to free their country from aB clerical domination, or ecclesiastical privilege. The Canadian Secular. Union of Toronto published (in September 1888) their Principles and Explanations , including six on which all were agreed, though in minor points there may be difference of opinion : (1) That we have real knowledge only of this life ; (2) that reason aided by experience is the best guide of conduct ; (3) that our chief duty is to promote the general well- being of society ; (4) that for this object human effort, based on knowledge and justice, is the only reliable means ; (5) that we can judge only by results : what conduc es to general wellbeing is right, and the reverse is wrong ; (6) that science is our Providence (or Provider), and on it we should rely in time of need.

In character he resembles the Akkadian god of ocean judging men in the deep (see Ea). He had al ready been adored in Rome as early as 80 B .

Nothing but broken pottery was found in these passages, but at the entrance of one of them are two votive texts scratched by pious visitors in the past.

Serpents. See N ā gas. Serpent worship appears to have originated in fear, but there are g ood as well as evil serpents. The cult is found everywhere, and from the earliest times. The serpent is the Agatho-daim ō n, or “ good spirit ” ; and, with its tail in its mouth, is an emblem of eternity. It is also the symbol of wisdom, passion. vitality, and the phallus—especially the cobra when it rises and expands its hood. All that winds and is long and narrow becomes a serpent in mythology. It is the lightning and the stream, the encircling ocean, and the cloud which swallows the waters. Serpents creep into holes, and guard hidden treasure, th ey also poison and slay, and are found especially in hell. The Persian snake (see Azi-dah ā k) is the Vedik Ahi the “ throttler,” who is the enemy of the sun god. The wicked serpent (see Vritra) is forced by Indra to yield the waters which it retains. The Egyptian demon snake (see Apophis) is slain by the sun god, as the python is slain by Apollo. If the American was amazed at the rattlesnake, no less was the Hindu at the cobra. The Egyptian placed the sacred asp in every shrine, and on the head- dress of gods and kings. In China the dragon king is the most important deity (see China), but if he fails to send rain when entreated his shrine is uncanopied, and exposed to the scorching heat of the sun : the Tieh-pai, or iron well-covering of his sacred spring, is removed to the altar of heaven, and the abbot of the Taoist monastery in the Dragon and Tiger mountains is deprived of his salary (see Miss E.

The renewal of the serpent’s youth, by the sloughing of the old skin, may account for its being an emblem of eternity, but the terrible poison of its fangs was the cause of its being fi rst propitiated. Its heart and liver were valuable remedies, and it twines round the staff of the god of healing (see Askl ē pios). Its eye was dreaded on account of its power of fascination.

A Sakya youth discovered a N ā ga maiden sleeping by the sacred lake of the Lan-po-lu mountain, to which he was borne by the Hansa or sacred goose : he consented to marry her if made king of Udyana. The N ā ga-raja is slain by a magic sword with which the hero also cuts off the nine dragon hoods of his bride, who bore him a son called Uttara-sena. The dragon of Pen-dragon is equally important as an emblem in the Keltik legends (see Arthur). The Theban dragon king, whom Kadmos conquered according to a Greek legend, dwelt by a well, and thence issued a stream forming the marsh where Apollo slew the python. The dragon Ladon guarded the sacred tree (see Hesperides) : Jerusalem also had a dragon well, and the intermittent fl ow of the Gih ̣ on spring (see Jerusalem) is said still to be due to a serpent which swallows the waters when awake. The dragon of St George also caused dearth ; and on the Rhone, according to Gervasius, the water dragons might be seen on clear nights sporting in human forms, in the depths under the castle of Tarascon, where St Martha gained a victory over a legendary monster : they also fl oated in the form of gold rings, or goblets, on the surface, and enticed women whom they carried off. The Tyrolese speak of a dragon who “ eats his way out of the rock ” when the intermittent spring of the Bella, in Krain, begins to fl ow. The Maltese also have a Dragonara spring, which issues from a cavern, with noises said to be due to th e snorts of the dragon. The Norse"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"Serpents 270 spoke of the “ Wurm-bett,” or “ serpent's bed,” as the place of gold, with a dragon guardian. Among Christians the good serpent rises from the chalice held by St John, and the evil serpent is Satan, the dragon of the Apocalypse. The author of the “ Wisdom of Solomon ” speaks of those who “ worship serpents void of reason,” but this cultus was ancient among Hebrews (2 Kings xviii, 4). Tertullian says that Christians called Christ the “ good serpent,” and some Gnostik sects consecrated the Eucharist by le tting a serpent crawl over it. In Mexico the “ House of Serpents ” was a temple in which they were fed on human blood, and at Oholula a winged serpent was adored. In Whyda, Africans call the serpent of their god Dangbe “ the chief bliss of mortals,” and he has 1000 wi ves, many dedicated to him from childhood, while priests appear to be the actual fathers of his children. Bacchus took serpent form, and snakes crept out of sacred baskets in Greek mysteries. Herodotos makes a serpent woman the queen of the Scythians whom H ē rakl ē s wedded. We wonder not therefore that the Poles still worshiped serpents a century ago, like the Norwegians and Lithuanians in 1550 A . C . Down to our Middle Ages the Livonians still sacri fi ced beautiful women to serpents. Irish sacred stones are covered with serpents, though St Patr ick is said to have expelled them. Many heroes were the children of serpents, and in the mysteries of Sabazios (or Dionusos) a serpent was allowed to crawl over the breast of the initiate. Rome fought under serpent standards (see Rivers of Life , i, p. 134, fi g. 53) while Wessex had a golden dragon said to have been captured from the Kumri, an d the Welsh red dragon symbolised the sun ( Welsh-English Dictionary ). At Westminster the banner bearing the dragon was used on Easter Eve, and in the Sarum Pro- cessional the rubric says that “ before the new fi re is blessed . . . the snake ( coluber ) goes fi rst, with an extinguished three-branched candle- stick borne by a boy,” for the snake candlestick was used till modern times (see Notes and Queries , 15th Oct. 1887). Other Christian standards represented the serpent and the dove with the cross, or the dove, with the olive branch, the lion and serpent. Some early Christian sects (see Gnostiks) were known also as Ophites or “ serpent worshipers.” Children suffering from worms were brought to churches which possessed emblems of serpents—as the Israelites in the desert gazed at the brazen serpent when bitten by snakes (Prof. A. de Gubernatis, Zool. Mythol ., ii, p. 416). A twisted bronze serpen t brought from Constantinople in 1001 A . C ., was enshrined in the basilica of St Ambrose at Milan as the “ serpent of Moses,” and thus a type of Christ as the healer of the nations. Serpent worship is unnoticed in the oldest—or Rig—Veda, but"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Serpents 271 appears in the Atharva and Yajur Vedas, and is fully developed in the Grihya and other Sutras, which are the manuals of modern Br ā hmanism. The Aryans thus gradually adopted a cult which was ancient in India before they entered the land (see Dr Winternitz, Der Sarpa-bali , 1888). Teutonic mythology is full of serpent lore, and Lombards retained serpent worship till the 18th century. In the 17th century a priest of Benevento told the reigning Duke Ronald, that : “ if he did not cease to worship a sacred tree, and an image of a viper, his capital would be attacked by an army from Constantinople.” The required promise being given the priest cut do wn the tree, and the foe retreated, but the duke and his court scoffed, an d continued to adore the serpent. The priest by aid of the duchess at last melted it down, the image being of gold and silver ; and church vessels were made of it ( Academy , 23rd May 1878). In Kashmir (Hamilton’s Gazetteer ) there are said to be 700 shrines for serpent worship ; and in Fiji the god Ndengei is a serpent, who receives the souls of the dead whom he judges ; but it is not easy to reach him as the way is barred by a giant with an axe, and if he wounds the poor soul it is not allowed to appear in the place of judg- ment. Serpents are equally adored in America (see Navajo) especially in the wild mountains of New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and British Columbia (Mr E. G. Squires, Serpent Symbolism , 1851). Captain Bourke ( Snake dances of the Moquis of Arizona , 1884) describes the rites of Comanches, and other branches of the great Shoshone (or “ snake ”) stock, which is found fr om the Mexican frontier to British Columbia (Prof. Keane, Academy , 22nd Nov. 1884). Capt. Bourke saw 100 snakes collected a day or two before the fêtes, to be released after a solemn dance and procession : “ the dancers did not seem to fear them, but pranced about holding the wriggling reptiles even between their teeth : yet they are venomo us, and were neither drugged nor deprived of their fangs. Young and old people held even seven or ten, in their hands, and wound round their naked bodies. The spectacle was an astonishing one.” The snakes writhed as the dancers passed slowly along a rectangle, being na ked save for a cotton snake-painted kilt and red buckskin mocassins. Th eir bodies were painted a greenish brown, with broad white armlets : fox skins dangled behind them, and their elf-locks were tufted with scar let parrot and woodpecker feathers ; their faces were painted black, with white on the lips, chin, and neck ; and rattles clanked at their knees. These rites in August are intended to propitiate the rain god, for which reason the dancers, the sacred stones, and the totems, are all daubed with green clays. Prof. Keane ( Journal Anthrop.

Bourke, accompanied by the sun and moon, the morning an d evening star, and the Pleiades. Some Moquis collect their serpents “ in cloths emblazoned with seven suns.” Dr Brinton ( Myths of New World , p. 112) compares this snake dance to one among the Italian Abruzzi mountaineers : “ Once every year the peasants walk in processi on, carrying round their arms, waists, and necks all the snakes they can fi nd. They observe this custom in the belief . . . that it will bring them good fortune, especially in love.” The Greeks did the same in their mysteries, and the Moslem Dervishes also carry and devour se rpents. Similar rites occur in Africa, Madagascar, Polynesia, and Peru. Alvarez describes a snake- house in Peru, where he found “ an enormous serpent daily fed with human fl esh, and which delivered oracles.” The Christianised Indians .of Central America still celebrate snake rites before rude altars in .circles, at Easter, and in November at the Feast of all Saints. Viands spread out for the deities are stamped with the fi gure of a serpent. The serpent appears with a male and female fi gure also at Palenque. In Ireland the Gadel-glas was a green snake god ; and Keating ( Hist. of Ireland , p. 143) says that “ the Milesians used no other arms on their banners but a serpent twisted round a rod.” Yet no snakes existed in Ireland itself. Nunez de la Vega, bishop of Chiapa, speaks of the Naquals (apparently a N ā ga sect) in Mexico, who pre- sented children before the Naguel when seven years old, in con fi rmation of vows taken by the parents : the child was made to embrace the snake, and told that “ it is an angel sent by God to watch over its fortune, protect, and accompany it: that it must invoke it on all occasions ” (O’Brien, Round Towers , p. 500). The Aztek god Tezkatli-poka was a sun serpent calle d the “ Lord of Hosts ” ; and his consort, Chihua-kohuatl, was a female serpent, who produced the male and female ancestors of man (see Kuetzal-koatl). The Mexican temples were carved over with snakes, like those of India, the great portal was often a snake’s jaws, and the sacred drums were wound round with snake skins (Bancroft, Native Races , ii, pp. 578-584). Live rattlesnakes were kept in these shrines (Fergusson, Tree and Serpent Worship , i, p. 39).

Such a fi gure—with a double tail, as also found at Kan ō j in Oudh—is called a Sirena (siren) by Neapolitans, and is worn as a talisman. The Basque provinces in the S. of France pre- serve many serpent legends : the Pic du Midi is said to be sacred to the “ sky dragon,” perhaps in connection—as in the Him ā layas— with serpentine streams. Serpen t mounds, and serpentine avenues, have been erected by early tribes in all parts of the world, like that of Loch Nell. Dr Phene describes one on the estate of Dochfour in Inverness, which is called the “ Cnoc-an-sithean ” or “ fairy mount ” ; it is surrounded with rude-stone monuments. He examined another, south of the old Castle of Skelmorlie, in a dark glen opening into the Frith of Clyde. The serpent mound has here the head to the east, and this formed the circle of sacri fi ce on a rude stone platform, having St Fillan’s well to its south, and the bay of St Meigles to its west. The head is about 100 feet in diameter : the body is S shaped, and ends abruptly near the sea, about 400 feet W. of the head, in which Dr Phene, the discoverer, found a few charred bones. We found another example of such a mound S.W. of Dun-staff-nage, on a bleak hill called Ti-noigh by old men at Oban. It is of earth and stones, and is connected with what are called locally “ Druid graves ” (see Druids). Dr Phene (Archæolog. Congress, 1888) stated that within 30 years he had examined arti fi cial serpent mounds, and avenues, in America, China, Skandinavia, Central and South Europe, and India : and he alluded to a “ vast serpentine form ” on the way from Argos to Epidauros (see Askl ē pios). The “ Dragon Way ” leading to the royal tombs of China is fl anked by huge statues of animals, as the serpentine ave nues of Karnak in France, and of Hardw ā r in India, are fl anked by rude menhirs. Road stones and boundary stones, in many parts of the world, are carved with serpents, which are also connected with cave carvings (see Elora). The serpent is everywhere adored by man, from the earliest ages, as the emblem of life. Set. Sut. Sutekh. The Egyptian god of sunset, night, and fi re, who gradually became the evil deity (see Bas), from whose sweat evil plants, trees, and animals were produced.

The Etruskan Sethluns was also a fi re god (see Etruskans). Renouf ( Trans. Bib. Arch. Socy ., VIII, ii, p. 20) speaks of “ Sut th e enemy of Ra,” and says, “ he is associated with Akar, god of dusk and gloom,” who is smitten by Ames or Khem, “ the friend of the sun.” His consorts are Sekhet and Nephthys, godesses of sunset. He is lord of the west, and of the desert, but was worshiped before the Hyksos age in Egypt ( Proc. Bib. Arch. Socy ., Feb. 1886), and seems only to have become hateful in the time of the 18th dynasty, having been the sole deity of the foreign Apepi. He is attended by Samiu, or “ dark ones,” who became goats shedding blood on the approach of Horus—evidently as dark clouds of sunset or sunris e. The Gnostiks, who were called Sethites, seem to have preserved the worship of Set. Seth. Hebrew. The son of Adam. The name means “ founda0tion,” according to Lenormant (see Sat). Shaddai. Shed ī m. Hebrew. The word shed signi fi es a demon (see Sed), apparently a “ de stroyer ” (Isaiah xvi, 4), or perhaps a “ power ” ; and the He brews were forbidden to sacri fi ce to Shed ī m (Deut. xxxii, 17). Shaddai is a name for God in the Book of Genesis, and in Job especia lly, rendered “ almighty ”—Arabic Shad ī d “ strong.” Shah-namah. The great Persian epik on the legends of the race, composed by Firdusi about 1000 A . C . The author says that he collected all known traditions, “ no ne worth knowing being forgotten,” but that “ others have said before me ” what he tells. The general subject is that of the wars of Ir ā n, or Persia, with Tur ā n beyond the Oxus, or of the Aryans and Tartars : but the heroes belong to the older mythology of the Zend-Avesta, the chief ones being : (1) Jem- shid the Zend Yima and Vedik Yama, the fi rst man ; (2) Ferid ū n, the Zend Thraetona, and Vedik Trita, or Traitana, who is Indra ; (3) Rustem, or Garshasp, the Zend Keres ā spa and Vedik Krisasva, an Iranian H ē rakl ē s ; with other fi gures of early Aryan legend (see Zoroaster).

Dr Carroll, superintendent of the Religious Department of the 1891 census, says that it is the olde st of the communistic societies in the United States, properly called “ The Millennial Church, or United Society of Believers ” ; and fi rst organised at Mt. Lebanon at New York in 1792. They are followers of Anne Lee, who was born at Manchester in 1736, and died in America in 1784. They regard Mother Anne as the second incarnation of Christ on earth. She was a Quaker who had a vision of Christ when in prison, in which he told her that man can only be reconciled to God by celibacy. She settled at Watervliet, New York, in 1775. Those who joined her in England were noted for violent manifestations of religious fervour, and were called “ Shaking Quakers.” They are strict celibates, wearing an uniform style of dress, and using the “ yea ” and “ nay ” like other Quakers, but not the “ thee ” and “ thou.” They believe themselves to be in constant communion with spirits, and hold that the second coming of Christ is already past. They reject the Trinity, and regard Christ as both male and female, but think that the soul preserves its sex eternally. They worship God only, and both men and women are admitted to the ministry. There is little audible prayer at their Sunday meetings, but much singing, marching, and dancing to music. They numbered only 1728 at the census of 1891, but in 1875 they appear to have numbered 2415 person s, having then 18 communities, now reduced to 15 in all. Shamans. See Samans. Sh ā mir.

Other very sacred places are Nejif, where ’Ali was murdered, and Kerbela, the scene of the fatal battle. The faithful who cannot be buried at these sites endeavour to procure earth thence, to be placed over their graves. The Moslem be liefs of the Persians were early affected by the survival of the old Mazdean ideas, and later by the philosophy of Buddhism. About 800 A .

These were early religious emblems, such as the Aigis of Greeks, and the Ancilia of Romans. The double triangle, forming a six-rayed star, is a favourite sign of masons and others, and is called the “ Shield of David ” (see 1 Kings x, 17 : xiv, 26). The Ancilia at Rome were borne in procession by the Salii, who clanged them with sticks (see Salii), dancing, and singing the Assamenta : the fi rst of these shields was made by Nu ma, and 11 were added later.

They are also called the Monto sect. Shin- shiu signi fi es “ true doctrine ” ; and they teach men to “ help one another,” and to believe in Amita Buddha (or Amitabha) “ the boundless one.” This sect was founded about 1260 A . C . by Shinran- Shouin, and now owns 14,500 monasteries and schools, superintended by 150,000 teachers of both young and old. The adherents number about 6 2 1 millions. They teach a high morality, and faith in the “ Perfectly Pure One,” trust in whom will secure future salvation. None are required to be celibates ; and innocent pleasures are not condemned ; but men are told to re frain from evil, from drunkenness and licence, and to study Buddha’s words which are able to make them wise. Their High Priest Akamatz said to Miss Bird ( Japan , II, letter lii) that this will withdraw them from misery inherent in this life, and give them the tr ue end of righteousness, which is rest—a Nirv ā na where individuality may indeed cease or lie latent. “ You believe (he said) in one God and in a Christ : so do we, for in Amida we shall have immortality, though the soul may have to undergo many transmigrations. Yo u believe in a personal Creator : we only know of atoms produced by spirit. When we die we hope to become Buddhas incarnate, like the great teacher, fi nding joys in good deeds, and dwelling forever in a Paradise of purity. But to do this we must be pure here, and ever working and preaching righteousness. He who dies impure, but in faith, must be puri fi ed through many changing animal forms ; but even to them Buddha will convey such teaching as they can receive.” To Sir E. Reed the same High Priest said (Reed’s Japan , i, p. 84) that : “ The state of our present life has its cause in what we have done in our previous existe nce ”—a doctrine which seems to have been recognised by the Jews (but denied by Christ) when they asked “ Master, who did sin, this man or his parents, that he was born blind ?” (John ix, 2). The Shin-shu Bonza added, “ our present actions determine our future state, and will produce here, and here- after, suffering or happiness. All se ntient beings have an interminable existence ; and the dying in one form, and being reborn into another, can only be escaped by cutting off the causes ; that is, the passions of anger, covetousness, etc. : then shall we attain salvation or rest— that is, Nirv ā na. It is very dif fi cult to control the passions, but Amita Buddha does—of his boundless mercy—in fl uence all who rely upon him. . . .

The Bonza admitted to Miss Bird that what Christianity and Buddhism alike had to fear most, was the philosophy of Mill, Huxley, Spencer, and Darwin, which had, he said, stimulated inquiries that these old faiths could not answer. But he considered that Buddhism, after Confucianism, can best reply to Materialism, for Buddha’s moral teachings were higher than those of Christ, whose teachings he thought powerless. Shin-to. The old animistic faith of Japan, which is closely connected with that of China and Korea. The word is Chinese itself, from shin , chin , or jin , “ spirit,” or “ being ” (a very ancient root : see Spirits), and tao or to “ a way.” The Japanese translate it Kami-no- Michi, “ the way of the gods,” that is to say divine service. Shin-to beliefs have become mingled with th e teaching of Buddhism, and with the ethiks of Confucius (see Japan). There are Shin-to teachers who inculcate not only reverence for the Kamis, or gods, but also many good maxims, and cleanliness in food and person. They say that the pious should not only do no murder, but that they should not even go near blood, or touch the dead : that it is well not to taste the fl esh of any four-footed beast, except wild deer ; or, if such fl esh be eaten through necessity, men should be held unclean for 30 days ; and those tasting fowls for two hours. These ideas were probably im- ported into Japan by Buddhists ; but the Buddhism of China and Japan—reaching the latter country a thousand years after Gotama’s death—is but a poor and corrupt travesty of his teaching ; and the founder would no more have recogn ised himself in Amita-Butsu than Christ would have recognised his teaching in that of the Vatican Pontiff. Shin-to teachers—as the two creeds began peacefully to develop side by side—took up the harmful doctrine of the ascetiks, who regarded man’s nature as depraved, and needing supernatural renovation ; a change which weakened the ancient self-con fi dence and loyalty (Palgrave’s Ulysses ) as, about 700 A . C ., Shin-to began to blend with new foreign teaching. In ou r 13th century the bitter bigotry of the Buddhist priest Nichiren vi olently dissolved the alliance of such beliefs ; and the inherent an tagonisms were revealed. But rulers and ruled are now content that reverence, obedience, patriotism, and loyalty should be taught, no matter whether by Buddhists, or by the priests of ancient Animistic deit ies, adoring stones, and idols, and sacred mirrors. The native Shin-to shrines are generally simple thatched buildings"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"Shin-to 280 of white wood, containing the Lares and Penates of the race. But Buddhists expected the rich to provide a gorgeously painted, carved, and gilded pile, full of relics and images, and of sacred books. Shin-to shrines are usually in a sacred grove with, if possible, a beautiful sur- rounding park, through which winds an avenue spanned at intervals by the symbolic Toriis , or skeleton gateways, which are emblems of the “ door of life,” and sacred (like the mirror) to Kwan-on, the kind queen of heaven. In each temple there is a Miya, or holy place, usually closed, and supposed by trav ellers to contain some kind of fetish. Before this the worshipers bend low, whispering their wishes to the god. These gods (already mentioned under Japan) are for the most part kindly ; but evil (as among Chinese peasants) is attri- buted to evil spirits who take the form of the fox (Ma), and tempt to sin. The fi gure of a fox is plaeed near temples to scare these devils away. The Japanese hold that the preservation of their empire de- pends on obedience to the Shin-to faith, which has for 14 centuries maintained the power of the Mikado, and which restrained the growing tyranny of a feudal nobility. The doctrine called Riobu-shin-to was promulgated, in our 9th century, by a monk named Kukai (or K ō b ō -daishi), who tried to show that the native gods were those of the Buddhists, compounding these beliefs with Confucian ethiks. Buddhism was then the established creed, and eight principal sects had arisen, of which the most important was that of the Jodos or Puritans. This was resuscitated in the 13th century by Shin-ron, “ the divine one ” ; but philosophy—especially that of the Chinese teacher Chu-he—then began to undermine the older faiths, as education advanced. Till the 16th century monarchs lavished money on temples and monasteries, after which the decline of Buddhism began ; and on the restoration of the Mikado, in 1868, all public grants were disallowed ; and Buddhist religion was fi nally dis- established on 1st January 1874 (see Encyclop. Brit ., 1881). Kioto the capital still however remains a stronghold of Japanese Buddhism (see Times , 28th October 1889) ; every sect has here its cathedral, and the city is the goal of Buddhist pilgrimage from all parts of the empire. It is usually held that there has been a general decline of Buddhism (and Miss Bird found many of its temples deserted) ; but since 1880 this faith seems again to have gained on the Shin-to beliefs. Under the Tokugawa usurpers it was specially favoured, while the new government since the revolution has rested chie fl y on Shin-to. But among the Buddhist sects the Shin or Broad Church, and the Nichiren or Calvinist, are more powerful than would be supposed from their numbers."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Shin-to 281 The old sacred palace of the Mikados is now untenanted, and has become a sight to be seen by Euro pean and native tourists, who may walk in its gardens and sacred groves, and gaze on the royal chapel where lies the holy stone-talisman of the empire, which the sun godess Amu-terasu gave to her son, the fo under of the Mikado’s family. It contains also a model of the sacred mirror (see Japan), and of the sacred sword. These were ancient emblems also in the West—the mirror of Hathor, or of Venus, and the sword of Mars adored in Scythia. Sacred stone menhirs are not uncommon among the Shin-to worshipers of Japan. One of these is described by Palgrave ( Ulysses , p. 234), under a pine tree outside the city of Nara. “ It is a single cube of uncarved, uninscribed, an d nnornamented stone representing Kai-kwa-Tenuo, the fourth of the sun gods.” Another huge oval stone represents Ama, the “ mother ” and favourite godess of the land, stand- ing near the shrine of Kami-no-Jinga, the Oko-no-In or “ holiest of holies.” It is swathed round with grass ropes, and protected by a fence ; having been continuously worshi ped at this site, it is said, since 711 A . C . The usual care and cleanliness of Japanese shrines is here notable : the well-kept roads, and ev er present Torii gateways, leading to the stone. The mingling of ancient and modern ideas in Japan is also seen in the province of Is ē , at Yamada, on the S. shore of the gulf of Owari, reached in 12 hours, by rail and steamer from Kioto. The town is 2 miles from the shore, and is a great Shin-to centre, where as yet, in 1886, foreign architecture had not intruded. Devout pilgrims were there to be seen thronging the shrines, and the “ two very ancient divine palaces,” which ar e second to none in the empire. Of these the Geko, or “ outer,” dates from 478 A . C .; and the Naiku, or “ inner,” from 4 A . C .: thus representing a cult as old as Christianity. In the Naiku palace is the mirror of Kwan-on which is never seen. So numerous are the other gods that (according to Hirata, a Japanese of the 19th century) we can only address the chief ones by name, and must embrace the rest in a general petition. After adora- tion in the palace of the Mikado-Kami (“ divine emperor ”) we must then pray in the Kami-dana (“ god-pl ace ”), or family shrine, at home. But we must remember always that the Mikado prays for us better than we can for ourselves. We mu st rise early and after ablutions, and cleansing the mouth, must worship in the direction of the province of Yamato, striking the palms of the hands together, and bowing the head to the ground. The ignorant pray to sun and moon, but the educated only to gods dwelling in these orbs. A special prayer is devoted to the great unseen god and godess (heaven and earth, as in"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Shin-to 282 China, and among Mongols) who ordain all that is unaccountable otherwise. “ Mind not the praise or blame of fellow-men,” says Hirata, “ but act so as not to need to be ashamed before the unseen gods.” “ To practice true virtue stand in awe of the unseen, and that will prevent your doing wrong ” (see Reid’s Japan , i, p. 45). The Shin-to ritual, or liturgy, is very long and complicated, but its chief burden consists in prayers for food, with thanks and praises. The creed however (says Sir E. Satow) is “ an engine for reducing the people to a condition of slavery.” The revolution of 1868 has now reduced it to an useful political sy stem, instilling feelings of loyalty, and maintaining a conservatism whic h is very useful at present. “ Setting aside,” says Sir E. Reed , “ the mere mythological extrava- gances of the sacred books, which seldom have much to do with the practical religion of any country, and judging the Shin-to faith by its fi rst fruits, we must acknowledge that it possessed the power of a real religion, and that its operation was for the advantage of the country.” Though the ritual was elaborate, this faith accustomed the people— before free-thought became so co mmon—to very simple forms of worship. The rinsing of hands and mouth, the gift of a coin, a clap or two of the hands, the bending of head and body, with a few short words of prayer, contented all the gods : though a long and weary pilgrimage might have to be made to the place where alone, according to the priests, the deity was to be found. Bodily puri fi cation, and avoidance of the unclean and of the dead, were inculcated (as among Akkadians, Indians, Persians, or Je ws) ; and the priest must cover his mouth as he offered, to the gods, fr uits of the earth or products of human handicrafts—a practice perhaps of Buddhist origin, due to the fear of destroying insect life. “ Even for food,” says Sir E. Reed, “ neither cattle nor sheep were killed till ‘ civilisation ’ introduced the improvement.” The Shin-to morning prayer—after the ablutions—is addressed to the region (Yamato) where deity became incarnate (as Christians turn to the east) ; and bowing to the ground the worshiper prays with joined palms saying : “ Deign O Ame and Kuni (heavenly spirits) to bless me, by correcting any unwitting faults ; and prevent the calamities which evil spirits might in fl ict; and give me long life ; and repeat my humble prayers to all the spirits, as put forth through thy holy spirit.” This is the kind of prayer daily o ffered in the Kami-dana, or family shrine in every house (Reed’s Japan , i, p. 360). Many of the emblems, ceremonies, and practices, are common to China and Japan. The Torii or symbolic gateway (also found in China) is said to mean a “ bird rest ” : for birds perch on it ; but it is"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Shin-to 283 perhaps connected with the Indian Dv ā ra or “ door ” ; and Siva is the Dv ā rka-N ā t, or “ lord of the gate ” of life. There are often avenues of these (see Miss Bird’s Japan , i, p. 357), especially at the great Inari Fox Temple at Fushima, where they number by hundreds, being of both wood and stone. Ex-votos are hung on them, and to “ pass through ” them brings luck. During the Christian persecutions of the 16th and 17th centuries the sign of recantation was to pass under this Shinto emblem. The “ gate-keepers ” are also a very usual feature of these shrines. Sir E. Reed describes them as “ grim giant gate-keepers, or Nios, carved and colored, with cruel art, into triumphs of the hideous and demon- iacal.” [This also is a very ancient symbolism, such demons being intended to frighten away evil spirits of less terrible appearance (see Lamas). They are carved on the sides of the sun god’s throne at Sippara (900 B . C .) in Babylonia, and are mentioned in Akkadian magic texts as sculptured on the walls of houses. They also guard the entrance to a rude rock-shrine, of “ Hittite ” character, at Boghaz- keui in Armenia.—E D .] These Nios are placed under the Toriis to guard the gate : one of them (Reed’s Japan , ii, p. 26) is colored red, representing Yo the male principle ; the other is green, representing In the female principle (Yo and In being the Chinese Yan and Yin for male and female : see China). This coloring is the same as in India (see Colors). The images of the gods are screen ed off by wire : for Buddhists and others have a habit of chewing a written prayer, and spitting it at the idol : if it sticks the prayer is accepted, and if it falls is rejected. On the altars are laid .boxes for money gifts ; and outside the temples are huge poles inscribed with sacred texts. In one case Sir E. Reed found a prayer wheel (as in Centra l Asia) erected before the Asakusa temple, and another at the Hakodach shrine (see Prayer). In such wheels, or drums, prayers written on paper are left to be turned round by the wind—and are so repeated—while the attention of the gods is also called by jingling rings, by be lls, and by clapping the hands, by both Shin-to worshipers and Buddh ists. Those suffering from any bodily ailment rub the corresponding part of the god’s image. Incense, and censers, abound in these temples, and lanterns of every hue are hung outside : some of paper with gr otesque designs ; others of bronze or stone—as at Mirjajima where they are said to date from 600 A . C . In one of these, at the Dai-butso temple, a man could stand upright. Pictures of no mean quality, repres enting emperors, and poets, are also hung in the temples, where are found bronze vases, historic relics, and swords of heroes.

Pyramidal pagodas also are added, one of which, in Kioto, is said to be 180 ft. high, with a base of 18 ft. square. In the Buddhist temple of Horinji, on the other hand, a bone of Buddha is shown in a crystal globe every day, that men may believe he really came in the fl esh ; and in the Nara temple of Dai-butso is a gold and bronze statue of Buddha, seated on the lotus, which fi gure is 63 2 1 ft. high from the seat to the top of the head, above which is a halo 14 ft. wide, and from this rises for several feet a fl ame-like glory, arching over the fi gure. The lotus has 56 leaves each 10ft. by 6 ft. It is said that this was made in 743 A . C ., and that 450 tons of metal were used for the fi gure, which is exquisitely put together. This calm ascetik fi nds himself in rather strange company, fl anked by a large image of Kukuzo on one side, and by the godess Kwan-on to his left. She has also a bronze shrine close by, with a wooden image said to date from the 6th century A . C ., or before the introduction of Buddhism into Japan. The relics include four pieces of bone of Buddha, with vessels, and censers, which he is said to have used (as genuine perhaps as some Christian relics), and a sacred stone with one of his foot-prints (though he never was in Japan in the fl esh) : also a “ bell, or sounding plate, and fi ve metallic mirrors over 1000 years old.” A mythological picture, in this semi-Buddhist semi-Shin-to shrine, explains the origin of the temple, in connection with a sacre d log, shown as borne by a crowd urged on by a leader armed with a gohei , or symbolic thursos. In the Kiyomidzu temple grounds at Kioto, near a water-fall with three streams, in a grandl y wooded amphitheatre, are two pagodas, and a “ ten-leaved To ”— or stone pillar with “ horizontal leaves.” Into these the worshipers fl ung stones—as throughout Western Asia and in pagan Europe (Reed’s Japan , ii, p. 223). Miss Bird, like Father Krempfer two centur ies earlier, found near Shingoji “ immense upright stones, without characters, but with rude carvings of the sun and moon ” (Miss Bird’s Japan , i, p. 283 ; Krempfer’s History , ii, p. 417). Sir E. Reed speaks of another stone, with a pine tree that spoke by the power of the sun god, and so saved life (Reed’s Japan , ii, p. 289). Dr Krempfer also describes the house- hold gods, such as Giwon the “ ox-headed Prince of Heaven ” (like the Hindu horned Daksha), who wards off small-pox ( Sekhio ) ; and another, “ a huge hairy being, with a large sword held up with both hands.” He notices sacred foot-p rints (ii, pp. 514, 518), and the Susu-notsi, or famous Stone of Susu, in the Fatzman temple, sacred to the god of war. It is “ a smooth black stone,” and over it were “ a drawn sword and two carved fi gures of horses.” Miss Bird mentions a sacred ark “ carried and followed by priests"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Ship 285 in capes and stoles, over crimson chasubles and white cassocks.” She was told that it contained “ the names of people, and the evils they feared.” This the priests were about to throw into a river (see Arks) to prevent these evils occurring. Most of the old shrines of Japan, whether Aino or Shin-to, seem to be on hills, and connected with sacred trees which are adorned with straw ropes and tassels. The curious custom exists here—as among Azteks—of nailing ef fi gies (of sinners) on such trees (see Crosses). Miss Bird was shown an image of an unfaithful husband so cruci fi ed (Japan, i, p. 385). This had been done at night by a woman, who thus appealed against him to the gods. In the Buddhist shrine of Niko our traveller threaded her way to this temple of “ sunny splendour,” through the gorgeous Torii gateways, porches, vestibules, and co urts, covered or hypæthral, to fi nd in the interior of the dim golden shrine a mirror on a black lacquer table (pp. 108-112) : for the temple had belonged to the Shin-to faith, but was visited in 767 A . C . by Shodo-Shoin, a Buddhist saint, who persuaded the natives that their deity was only an incarnation of Buddha, so that they now speak only of Amitabha as a “ being of immeasurable light.” In 1617 the hill slopes near this temple of Niko were chosen by royalty as a cemetery, and King Iye-yasu was here enshrined as a deity, “ the light of the East and Incarnation of Buddha.” An Imperial envoy visits the spot yearly, bearing a sacred Gohei wand, of gold, adorned with paper shreds. The Shin-to priests have superseded the Buddhists, and Miss Bird, in 1878, found here all the paraphernalia which are common in Romanist Churches. Holy men, in cassocks of brocaded amber satin, with violet stoles and hoods, and white chasubles, moaned out the complicated ritual, and chanted softly—in an unknown tongue—before altars perfumed with incense, and lighted up by large candles, telling their beads, and waving their arms in various devotional attitudes, calling on their gods, and on the great Buddha, to pity them, and to save them from misery, and from the torments of Hell—about which the “ Wise Guide ” never professed to know anything when he was on earth.

In the geography of Ptolemy the countries on the Gulf of Siam are called Samarade, which name is found in the ancient P ā li and L ā u palm-leaf records of S. Siam. The inhabitants of Siam are of Malay stock, with a strong infusion of Hindu blood. They call themselves L ā u or “ people ” (the Akkadian lu and ulu ) ; and Ai-lau signi fi es a “ male person.” The Tais or “ free ” men come from S.W. China, and the earlier Sh ans, or Shan-tais, from Barmah. According to Prof. Terrien de la Coupèrie, 30 per cent. of Siamese words are Chinese. The States of this peninsula asserted independence as early as 1550 B . C ., according to Chinese accounts, and down to 255 B . C ., when the elder brother of the Chinese emperor founded the kingdoms of Y oue and Hou, on the frontiers of Lu-chuan. As early as 600 B .

The Karens are distinct from the Shans (see Karens) though also a Mongolic race. The Shans, Shams, and Siamese, worship trees, stones, and sacred footprints of Buddha, also conical hills, and serpents. They (like Mongols) allow none to tr ead on a threshold, and no corpse to pass over it. The placenta of infants are buried under it (see Door). They are acquainted with the name of Ti, or Shang-ti, for God (see China), and, like the Barmese, they believe the soul to be a butter fl y (see Butter fl y). The old men, according to Col. Woodthorpe ( Journal Anthrop. Instit ., Aug. 1896), tie up the wrists of all who return from a funeral, lest this butter fl y should escape. They carry lighted candles with the corpse, and walk round it, and round their sacred trees and stones, fi ring off rockets as the mourners separate. They have taken caste ideas from India, and pray in Buddhist monasteries, for some da ys, before starting on any important expedi- tion.

The population of Siberia includes the Samoyeds on the N.W., with Ostyaks to the south : in the centre are the Yakuts—a Turkish race from Central Asia—and S. of these the Tunguse, while in the E. are the Chukchis. All these races are of Turanian origin, now mingled with Russian Slavs of Aryan stock. The Siberians are supposed to have b een converted to Christianity by the latter, and according to Nordensk iold their baptism is “ an amusing combat between a cold water dip and a lump of tobacco ” (see Voyage of Vego , ii, p. 14). Samoyeds and Chukchis are in reality pagans, who worship strange idols, to which they add “ Russian gods,” or pictures of saints. They make p ilgrimages to visit gods, to whom they offer sacri fi ces.

The people are crushed by the tyranny of Shamans (see Samans) and live in terror (see Journal Anthrop. Instit ., Nov. 1894).

The best known are in Greek, by Alexandrian Jews (see Apokruphal Literature), and these cl aimed to be prophetic. Clement of Alexandria appealed to such wo rks to convince the heathen that there is “ one God, and true predic tions of future events.” In 1715 Whiston, the translator of Josep hus, wrote in “ vindication of the Sibylline oracles.” Their character is fully discussed by Ewald, Friedlieb, and others (see Drummond, Jewish Messiah ) ; some were written by Christians, or Christian interpolations introduced into Greco-Jewish hexameter poems. They include paraphrases of Bible narratives concerning the history of Israel. There are 8 still extant out of 14 such works, the oldest being supposed to belong to the 2nd century B .

The remaining 5 are attributed to our 3rd cent.ury, aud are the work of Christians : the 8th contains acrostics on the titles of Christ, and on the Cross.

Castellio then pointed out that many passages, at least, must be spurious. Possevin the Jesuit attributed the interpolations to Satan. Blondel, a French Protestant, fi nally, in 1649, was the first Christian who boldly con- demned the whole literature as a tissue of forgeries.

Sikanian leaders bore the names of Elumnos, Aigestos, and Akestes, which appear to be Greek. Akestes is called the gran dson of the god Crimlsus, and settled on the river Crim ī sus. His mother was a Trojan woman named Sagesta, or Egesta—the name of a town near Elume, which in the days of Æneas was peopled by fugitives from Troy, after the war which was due to the refusal of the Trojans to reward Poseid ō n, and Apollo, for building their walls. Aigestos was otherwise the son of a bear or of a dog—a common Asiatic legend. These legends point to immigration from Asia Minor.

B ā ber—who, as a boy, had failed to hold Samarkand—seized K ̣ ā bul, and Ghazni (1504-7), and afterwards regained Bokh ā ra and Samarkand (1507-1514) : in 1526 he defeated Ibrah ī m Lodi the last Afgh ā n prince of Delhi and Agra ; and after the great battle at P ā n ī pat he thus became the fi rst Mughal emperor, and Moslem ruler of India, though Isl ā m had then been preached for some 500 years in the Panj ā b. The period of"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Sikhs 292 N ā nak’s activity thus coincided with that of Baber’s conquests. Ac- cording to the Janam S ā khis, or “ Sikh biographies,” N ā nak was of Kshatriya caste, and of the Vedi-Khatri sect—a Hindu, and the son of K ā lu-Vedi who was a village accountant ( patw ā ri ) at Talvandi, now N ā nk ā na, on the R ā vi river near Lahore. From childhood the future founder of the Sikh faith was dreamy and emotional ; as a youth he began to see signs and wond ers : he frequented the society of Fak ̣ ī rs whom he assisted, and at the age of 15 he misappropriated— for their bene fi t—money given to him by his father for purposes of trade. He was then sent to friends at Sultanpur, entering the service of the Naw ā b, Daulat-Khan Lodi. Again he began to give all he had to Fak ̣ ī rs (mendicants) ; and one day while bathing in the river, as a religious rite, he felt a sudden divine inspiration. Tradition says that he was then “ translated to the gates of Paradise, and by God#s comma nd given a goblet of Amr ī t ā , or the water of life. He drank it, and the Lord said : ‘ N ā nak I am with thee . . . whoever shall take thy name I will make happy ; go repeat, my name, and cause all to do so ; remain uncontaminated by the world . . steadfast in almsgiving, in ablutio ns, in service, and in remembrance of Me. I have given to thee my own name (G ū ru-S ā hib). Do thou this work.’ ” When he recovered from this trance he uttered the keynote of all his future teaching, saying, “ There is no Hindu, and no Moslem ” ; hearing which the people went and complained to the' Khan. He told them not to mind what a Fak ̣ ī r said, but later on, when a K ̣ ā d ̣ i (or “ judge ”) objected, the Khan ordered N ā nak to appear before him. Placing a Fak ̣ ī r’s staff (Muttak ā ) on his neck “ B ā ba the Guru ” appeared : he was or dered to gird his loins and to abandon the staff, and then placed honourably in a seat near the Khan, and the K ̣ ā d ̣ i was instructed to examine him. It was then that N ā nak astonished all men by a disq uisition on universal religion, lasting till the time of afternoon prayer, when he (a pious Hindu), accompanied the Khan to the mosk. Tradition says that he there demonstrated supernatural powers, by reading the K ̣ ā d ̣ i’s thoughts, and that the latter fell at his feet crying, “ Here is one favoured by Allah.” After a short exhortation by N ā nak, the Khan also did him reverence, and the whole congregation of Sheikhs and Sayids cried aloud, “ Khuda (God) is speaking to us in N ā nak.” The Hindus were indignant at the supposed conversion of N ā nak to Isl ā m, and Jairam his wife complained. But he declared that he was still a servant of Paramesur (“ the Supreme ”), whom he regarded as the same as Allah. He continued to cry more strongly than before, “ There is no Hindu ; no Moslem ; but one God the"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Sikhs 293 Father of all.” Daulat-Khan cont inued to be devoted to the new teacher, who went forth on his missi on to convert India. He soon won many leading Sheikhs (“ elders ”) , and Pirs (“ religious leaders ”) ; and Isl ā m accepted him as a Dervish (or one “ taught ”), in Delhi and P ā nipat. At Ban ā ras he was very graciously received by a learned Pandit, who however objected that, as a Bh ā gat or devotee, N ā nak had no s ā lagr ā m , tulsi plant, tika , or rosary. Yet he was converted, as were many Y ō gis, Khatris, necromancers, and other Hindus. It was at Ban ā ras that the real religious education of N ā nak began, under the guidance of learned followers of Kab ī r, who was (in 1410 to 1430 A . C .) the most celebrated of twelve disciples of R ā manand (1400 A . C .), and a convert from Isl ā m to a form of Vishn ū va monotheism. The history of Kab ī r (in the Bhakta-m ā la), and the record of his doctrines (in the Sukh Nid ā n), shows that he was an ascetik (like S ̣ ū fi s among Moslems, or Sany ā sis among Hindus) ; and it appears (from a short poem which N ā nak included in his Adi-Granth) that Kab ī r traced his spiritual descent from two former Gurus (or “ teachers ”), one being the Br ā hman Jai-deo (1250 A . C .), and the other Nam-deo, who was a calico printer living about 1300 A . C . All these again were apparently disciples of R ā ma- nuja, a Dr ā vidian who lived about 1150 A . C .: for they all alike taught the brotherhood of man and the unity of God—whom they called Hari or Vishnu. Kab ī r in the 15th century was teaching in Ban ā ras, M ā gadha, and Gorak-p ū r, and claimed that : “ by his love of religion, and the favour of the Gurus Jai-deo and Nam-deo (or N ā m ā ), he had attained to a knowledge of God (Hari) as the supreme mind, or soul, from which our souls proceeded, and into which we should fi nally be absorbed.” This, he a dded, could only be accomplished by faith (Bhakti), and not by any rites or austerities—a faith that respects all forms of life, and which leads to the performance of all life’s duties, without self-seeking or greed of gain. It was the ancient teaching of Buddha, and of the Jains, which had created Neo- Brahmanism and Vedantism, and also (later) the Pantheistik S ̣ ū fi -ism of Isl ā m, and the Moslem philosophy of Baghdad. This shows that what we made the motto of our Rivers of Life in 1880 is true : “ There has been no entirely new religion since the beginning of the world.” For a new faith is at the summit of a pyramid, the founda- tions of which lie deep down in earlier human thought, and is waiting for a Buddha, a Muh ̣ ammad, or a N ā nak, to give it form and voice. The fi rst Moslem conquerors of India (see Rev. T. Hughes’ Dicty. of Islam ) coming from Samarkand, and Persia, were steeped in S ̣ ū fi"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Sikhs 294 philosophic mysticism, such as we fi nd in the poetry of Fird ū si (1000 A . C .), S’adi (1250), and H ̣ ā fi z (1360 A . C .) ; and they rested on Allah rather than on Muh ̣ ammad. Fird ū si cries : “ The height and the depth of the whole world have their centre in Thee, 0 my God ! I do not know Thee who Thou art ; but I know that Thou art what Thou alone canst be.” H ̣ ā fi z even called himself a “ disciple of the old Mage ” (Zoroaster), and a worshiper of the “ supreme ” Ahura- mazd ā , yet he earned himself the title of Prince of S ̣ ū fi poets (see our Short Studies , pp. 525-528). Like the Druzes, and Bat ̣ an ī n, and other Moslem heretics, such philosophy recognised the elements common to all religions, while rejecting all dogmas. Such then were the in fl uences that surrounded N ā nak at Ban ā ras, especially through the teaching of Kab ī r’s disciples. They are evident in the Adi-Granth, which he wrote about 1540 A . C . N ā nak’s successors, down to Gu ru Arjun (1600), and Govind Singh, taught the same doctrines. The latter on his death-bed in 1708 said : “ I acknowledge no Smriti s (traditions), Sastras, or Vedas (inspired writings) : all these speak variously . . . I recognise all as Thee.” It was a pure S ̣ ū fi Pantheism that denied the existence of anything apart from deity. In N ā nak’s Bible we read : “ Thou art I : I am Thou—where is the difference ? The One dwells in all, is con- tained in all.” Of this too ’Omar Khayyam speaks fi ve centuries before N ā nak. The idea is equivalent to our conception of the absolute, and all-pervading, unity. “ The Guru or Divine One,” says N ā nak, “ is Isvar, Vishnu, and Br ā hma, yea the great mother P ā rvati—neither male nor female but both : the Ligh t of Life. And I am the servant of the beloved one, and long to meet my Lord.” In this we see the intense mysticism of syncretic S ̣ ū fi -ism : of Mazdean-Moslem Pantheism. The poetic structure of a great part of the Granth is also evidence of Persian S ̣ ū fi in fl uence, as Nanak confesses when he says : “ The True One is found by the S ̣ ū fi s who keep fast to his court ” (Adi-granth). At Ban ā ras N ā nak gained the sincere friendship of the learned and famous Moslem P ī r named Sheikh Far ī d, who travelled and taught with him for twelve years : and 142 stanzas by this Sheikh were included in the Granth, though he called his god Allah instead of Hari. This alliance, however, estranged the Hindus, who manifested their dislike by purifying the gro und near their dwellings, where the Guru had trodden. Yet within a generation they had begun to reverence, if not to worship him, as in the case of many another prophet. On one occasion N ā nak was seized with others who were"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Sikhs 295 captured by soldiers of the Emperor B ā ber, but when recognised was at once released, and respectfully saluted by Moslems and Hindus alike. Sundry miracles are said to have been wrought, and many converts were made among the learned Pandits, the J ains, and the R ā kshashas (“ demons ” or demoniac al Hindus), for even the devils confessed his divine character. As Buddha is represented in his legend to have taught in Ceylon, so N ā nak is said to have taught at Makka ; and—according to Moslem converts—to have upheld the K ̣ or ā n, and the intercessory powers of Muh ̣ ammad, believing in Paradise, as Moslems and Hindus still alike do : wherefore both alike honoured him at death. Like a good Hindu he chose to die on the banks of the R ā vi, the river of his birth-place : there (like Buddha under the S ā l trees) he sat down under a sacred S ā rih tree surrounded by his Sikhs or “ disciples,” who mournfully besought his guidance for their future. Though his sons were beside him he turned to the Guru Angad, whom he bade all to obey, adding that those who had honoured their Guru would no doubt care for his children. The Moslems begged to be allowed to bury him, and the Hi ndus to burn his corpse ; but the B ā ba (“ father ” N ā nak) said : “ Let Hindus put fl owers on my right side, and Moslems on my left side, and whichever of these are found green at my death may show who is to have the body.” He called on the assembly to repeat praises to God, and, as he fell back, a sheet was spread over him. When it was removed—says the story—the body was gone, and all the fl owers alike were green. The mourners prostrated themselves and worshiped, and each branch of his disciples removed its own fl owers. This miracle is related by the Rev. T. Hughes, from a legend found in an India Of fi ce MS. of 1728 ; but the same story is told of Kab ī r. Nanak’s translation (recalling those of Enoch, Moses, and Elijab) took pl ace amid a literary and civilised people in our 16th century, if we are to believe the tradition. N ā nak throughout his life had always been a pious, pure minded, and good man ; he was the husband of one wife ; and his children respected him, though he placed them under Angad, an illiterate friend, whom he chose as his successo r because of his devotion to the cause, which had been amply proved by many trials. N ā nak himself must have been educated in the literary calling of his father, the village accountant : for his expressi ons and doctrines show acquaint- ance with Hindu writings of the century preceding that in which he lived. His own tastes, and his literary friends, made him an excep- tionally well educated man, especia lly as regarded Eastern religious ideas and ethiks. Even when young he had become a recognised"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"Sikhs 296 religious leader, and had actually been worshiped while living. He was styled B ā ba (“ father ”), Lord, Prince, Saviour, N ā nak-Narinkar, “ The One.” Yet he forbade men to use such epithets, desiring only to be called the Guru or “ teacher, ” and calling his followers Sikhs or “ disciples.” He made no attack on the national faith, nor did he secede from it ; he desired only to widen and improve it, as Buddha had desired, or Paul who remained a Jew though a Christian. He wished to destroy Hindu dogmatism, and especially the caste system, which excludes from salvation all not born as Br ā hmans. On this he insisted in the Oranth, saying : “ In the other world there is no caste . . . those learned in Vedas, and Mullahs, or Sayids learned in the K ̣ or ā n, overlook the essence-the worship of Hari or Allah. . . . We claim brotherhood with all. . . . He alone is the true Mullah, P ī r, S ̣ adik ̣ , S’adi, or Dervish, who knows Allah or Hari, and has aban- doned self : who fi nds support in Him, the One, the Almighty, and Incom prehensible.” This lofty spirituality, based though it may have been on fanciful ideas, lifted him far above the trivialities of the Hindu Pantheon, or the Moslem beliefs in heaven, hell, angels, and devils. It killed his early reliance on rites and monkish au sterities, which he found to be practised by every sect in Ban ā ras, except the philosophic followers of Kab ī r and R ā manand. His fervid spirit soon recognised the trans- forming force of their teaching, wh ich he understood better than his predecessors. Among the keen intellects of Bang ā l and M ā gadha the Persian theists, and the S ̣ ū fi s of Isl ā m, could speak freely without fear of Moslem fanaticism. They adopted the Kab ī r teaching (which resembled the philosophy of Plato, th en long-since familiar to Moslems), saying that “ all phenomena were unreal, and the mere products of M ā ya or illusion, emanating from the Supreme, on whom we must ever be meditating as Hari, Ram, Govind, or Allah ” ( Encyclop. Brit ., xi, p. 844; and Wilson, I, p. 153). On leaving Banaras Nanak seems to have put aside, like Gotama, all religious speculation as to the future of the world, and to have accepted the idea of a Nirv ā na or rest—the S ̣ ū fi “ absorption ” into deity. But Sikhs, like later Buddhists and Br ā hmans, believe in a heaven where souls await such absorption if they have not attained perfection. They retain much of the teaching of our 7th century, when great religious waves swept over Western and Eastern Asia alike. In the West Isl ā m : in India at the same time a Br ā hman reformation. From that time, says Sir W. Hunter ( Imp. Gazet. India , iv, p. 297), “ Hinduism boasts a line of religious founders, stretching in almost unbroken succession to the present day,” all of whom are named in"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Sikhs 297 the Bhakta-m ā la, or “ garland of the faithful,” which contains the lives and legends of the Indian saints—a vast collection of fables and miracles : the Acta Sanctorum, or Golden Legend, of Hinduism. In this record of wonders, and of divine interpositions, the greater saints are regarded as incarnations of deity. Some were born of virgins ; they raised the dead; they overcame lions ; their hands and feet grew again when cut off ; prisons were opened for them ; the sea brought them back safe when cast into it ; and earth opened to swallow those who slandered them. Thousands of pilgrims still annually visit the bleak sand dunes of Puri, to beg a spoonful of rice water from the . venerated monastery of Kab ī r. Among these dei fi ed teachers Kam ā rila (8th century) was a Bh ā tta, or bard, a Sivaite Brahman of Beh ā r in Bang ā l. He worshiped Siva as lord of the universe, with Devi the virgin earth godess ; and about 740 A . C . (or earlier) he became a persecutor of Jains and Buddhists, who did not worship this divine pair. All men were bidden to adore “ the One all-powerful Creator, the cause of the existence, continuance, and dissolution of the world, the One without a second.” About 760 A . C . Kam ā rila proved his sincerity by self-immolation, leaving a disciple Sankar ā ch ā rya, “ the fi rst great historic fi gure ” in the Indian Book of Saints. He was a Malab ā ri Sivaite Br ā hman, and a peripatetik teacher between Cape Kumari and Kashm ī r. He died at Kedar-n ā th, at the early age of 32 years ; and a disciple described his triumphs in a volume called The Victory of Sankara —the text-book of a still growing sect. He accepted the “ traditions ” (Smriti), as well as the Vedas, as being the direct words of God, and made Siva an incarnation of Br ā hma. He established monasteries where Theistik philosophy was taught. We have visited the parent establishment on the high cone of Sringiri in the Mysore highlands, and found students studying the traditions, the epiks, and all branches of Mimansa Vedantist philosophy. In Sankar- ā ch ā rya's time Buddhism was decaying, an d men were weary of skeptiks. But a mystic Monotheism stirred them to their depths, when attested by miracles, and presenting gorgeous rites. The progress of thought was arrested for a time by the appearance of Isl ā m. In our tenth century the Turks of Ghazni ruled from China to the Kaspian, and the great Mah ̣ m ū d ruled all the Panj ā b till 1030, and raided further yet, to Soma-n ā th on the shores of the Indian Ocean. The dynasty so founded ruled till 1186, and was replaced by the Ghorians, free- thinking Tartars from Persian Her ā t, who endured till 1206, when they were succeeded by an equally tolerant Turkish “ slave dynasty.” The indifference to Isl ā m of these rulers was partly racial, and partly due to S ̣ ū fi in fl uence. The last mentioned were driven into India by"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"Sikhs 298 the conquests of the great Mongol Tchengiz-Khan, whose dynasty— from 1217 to 1370—was ever threaten ing the N.W. border of the “ slave ” empire. In 1221 Tchengiz-Khan nearly reached Delhi (see India). The revival of Indian Theism began two centuries later with Kab ī r. By the time that B ā ber had established his power from K ̣ ā bul to Lahore (1526 to 1530 A . C .) N ā nak had learned all that he thought necessary at Ban ā ras, striving to reconcile Isl ā m with native religion. He had no scruple in mixing with every sect, even of Sudra caste, or with cow-eating Moslems. He fe ared neither emperor, priest, nor peasant, but through every danger, and good or evil report, urged peace and brotherhood, and belief in one all-pervading deity. The successors of N ā nak, down to the 18th century, when the Sikh creed was for a time suppressed, ar e enumerated as follows :— 1. N ā nak . . . 1504 to 1539 2. Angad . . . 1539 ,, 1552 3.

Tagh-Bahad ū r . 1664 ,, 1675 10. Govind-Singh . 1675 ,, 1708 The steady advance in organisation, and strong propaganda of the Sikh faith alarmed the Br ā hmans, and excited their hatred, in N.W. India, reaching a crisis when Ā rjun, the 5th Guru, laid aside the garment of an ascetik, and conv erted the voluntary offerings of his disciples into a regular tax, thus adding to the dignity and political importance of his of fi ce. He had greatly enhanced his position by systematic compilation of all the teachings of N ā nak, in the Adi-granth writings which were accepted as th e only inspired scriptures by the Sikhs, superseding Vedas, Tripitaka, and K ̣ or ā n alike. Zealous Hindus appealed to the Moslem Sultan, who had for some years jealously watched Ā rjun. In 1606 the order went forth, and the Sikh leader was quietly removed, and probably mu rdered in prison. Har-Govind took the place of his father, and for the fi rst time the Sikhs were led by a militant priest, who vowed to redress the wrongs under which they groaned. Har-Govind girt on two swords, and prepared to avenge his father’s death, and to set free the faith from every bond ; but sect and leader were alike put down by the Moslem emperor with great"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Sikhs 299 severity. The son, and grandson, an d the nephew of Har-Govind were the 7th, 8th, and 9th Gurus : these were all quiet and inoffensive leaders, who fell back to ancient superstitions, and even descended so far as to amuse the Delhi courtiers with feats of legerdemain and thaumaturgy. But Govind-Singh at the age of 14 years succeeded his father Tagh-Bahad ū r, who was murdered in 1675 ; and in him the Sikhs found a statesman and a warrior, who was also an able writer. He required them to be no t merely Sishyas, or “ disciples,” but also Singhs, or “ lions ” of the Panj ā b, declaring that they were equal to the Rajputs. They were forbidden to shave, and ordered to wear a distinctive blue dress ; to carry steel weapons ; and to invoke Durga-Bh ā vani, the godess of rapine and bloodshed, adopting as their battle-cry “ Wa Gurujika Khalsah ”—“ Success to the Guru’s State.” This militant spirit revealed the wrath that Govind-Singh had long nursed, during the persecutio n of his people while his father, Tagh-Bahad ū r, led a quiet life as a fugitive at Mathura. Even then those who knew him foretold that he would become a great leader of the faith. Knowing the power and watchfulness of the Delhi emperor, the father strove to restrain his so n, but after his death Govind-Singh issued an address to the Sikhs, af fi rming that the mild peaceful views of N ā nak no longer suited their own age ; and to his followers he issued new writings, religious and political, which fi red the heart of every Singh with patriotism. These writings form the second Granth. The emperor’s of fi cials at fi rst expostulated, and then put down small risings, but this only led to more general rebellion. In 1708 the Emperor Aurangz ē b slew the militant Guru, and all the Sikh leaders. But the spirit of Govind-Singh remained in his people, even during the 33 years in which the sect was almost suppressed. It lived in the breasts of a brave warm-hearted race, and survived after British power had been established from 1842 to 1846. The fa ith had revived on the fall of the Mughal Empire, and the nation was then ruled by confederated Misls or Sird ā rs. In 1800 Ranjit-Singh (then 20 years old) was ruler of Lahore under Afghan suzerainty. He encouraged the militant spirit of the Khalsa, and organised his army by aid of European knights-errant, till in religious fervour, and steady discipline, it resembled Cromwell’s Ironsides. The suzerain allowed him to seize Kashm ī r, and his kingdom soon extended west to Peshawar, and south to Mult ā n, bounded by British dominions on the east. He remained faithful to his engage- ments till his death in 1839. Then all was chaos, and Lahore was distracted by the quarrels of rival queens, generals, and ministers, while a proud and powerful army demanded to be led against the British.

Then followed the battles of Aliwal and Sobraon, and the capture of Lahore, where Sir H. Lawrence (then a major) was stationed as British governor. Again in 1849 the Sikhs rose, in January, and gallantly strove with us at Chilianw ā la, and Gujer ā t, when their kingdom was annihilated, and the whole Panj ā b in consequence became a British province. Since then the Sikhs have proved their loyalty to their conquerors in the darkest days of the Indian mutiny. The Adi-granth, or “ old Bible,” founded on Nanak’s writings, was completed by Ā rjun about 1600 A . C . It was supplemented about 1700 A . C . by the national gospel of Govind-Singh ; and the two works —like our Old and New Testaments—form the Bible of the Sikhs, venerated by some 1 2 1 millions of believers, who occupy 100,000 square miles of India's fairest provinces. The Adi-granth is written in old Hind ī , and preserves many ancient Panjab words. It is divided into six parts. I.

A satyr companion of Dion ū sos. The Satyrs or Seil ē noi were sons of Pan, or of Hermes, by sylvan nymphs, or Bacchanals, and were spirits of the woods, with goats’ feet and horns. They frequented springs and streams in the hills, and the Italians called a bubbling fountain a Silanus. Silenus appears as the drunken guardian of Bacchus, riding on an ass, and supported by fauns and dryads. Though depicted as a burly intoxicated old man, yet Plato said that Sokrates obtained his wisdom from Seil ē nos. He was praised as a jovial deity who irrigates the vines ; and he holds a cup, having before him a wine bag. He is also called a Phrygian Bacchus born in Nusa, and ruling in Karia. He was worshiped by Arkadian shep- herds. He was said to know the past and the future, and to despise earthly things. He told Midas, king of Phrygia, that : “ It was best not to be born, and next best to die early.” Virgil makes Silenus discourse on the creation of the world. Silik-mulu-khi. Akkadian : “ the good light (or protector) of man.” A name of the sun as the son of Ea, in Akkadian magic texts. Siloah ̣ . Siloam. A pool at Jerusalem called “ sent,” or “ directed,” because of the aqueduct which conducts the waters from the spring of Gih ̣ on (see Jerusalem). This aqueduct (cut about 703 B . C .) contains the earliest known Hebrew inscription. The water of Siloam was used in the Temple (see Heifer), and great water pourings in the court of the women were a feat ure of the rejoicings at the Feast of Tabernacles according to the Mishnah ( Sukkah , v, 1). See Taber- nacles. Silures. The name of tribes in S. and S.E. Wales according to Roman writers. They were subdued about 50 to 80 A . C ., and were found also in the Scilly Islands (see Britain). Silver. See Gold. This metal was known to the Akkadians as early as 3000 B . C .; and silver mines are found in Kappadokia, and at Gurnish Khana near Trebisonde, on the S. shores of the Black Sea.

The Saena Meregha of the Avesta is the Sanskrit Cy ē na-mriga or “ hawk bird ” : it carried off the Haoma from heaven, as the Indian Garuda carried the Soma, or Amr ī ta ; and Garutman is the grandchild of the male and female Çy ē na ( Ram ā yana , iii, 162; vii, 6. Journal Rl. Asiatic Society , April 1891, p. 345). Indra also is called the Çy ē na or “ hawk,” and Vishnu is the Garuda and king of the “ fi ne-winged ” Suparnas, who dwelt in the Simbali forest (see Suparnas) and devoured serpents. The Simurgh was said to suckle its young, and is the chief of all birds, and the fi rst created ; and (like Ath ē n ē ’s owl) it is a type of wisdom. It is a griffen of triple nature, and “ not of this world ” ( Sacred Books of East , v, p. 89). The Garuda, in like manner (see Beal’s Catena , p. 50), sits on the lofty tree called Kuta-sal-mali, and fl aps its wings till the sea opens, and it swoops down to devour the dragons of the ocean. Sin. Sinu. The Babylonian moon god (Akkadian, Aku) the father of Istar. The Semitic sinu signi fi es “ to shine.” Sin was also worshiped in H ̣ ad ̣ ramaut (see Arabia), and is mentioned by St James of Serug as late as 500 A .

C .) also examined the box, and deposited with it two clay cylinders, describing his further works in the temple. Mr Rassam al so here found the egg-shaped text of the founder of Babylonion civilisation (see Sargina). The bas- relief represents a giant sun god, be arded, and wearing a high turban. In his right he carries a baton, and a ring ; over his head are the emblems of Sin, Tammuz, and Istar ; under his throne are two satyr demons. The text outside his sh rine (in Semitic speech) reads, “ Image of the Sun, the Great Lord, dwelling in the sun-shrine within the city of the Euphrates ” (S ippara). Before the shrine, to the left, is a sun disk on an altar, kept in place by cords which are held above by two angels. A second text, on the roof of the shrine, reads, “ Sin, Tammuz, and Istar, who dwell in the deep, proclaim the fate of the year.” Three fi gures approach the sun disk, and seem to represent a soul who raises the right hand, while he is led by the left by a god or priest , and is followed by a godess or priestess, who raises both hands in supplication. The fi rst noticed text is over their heads ; and a third short one is under the symbols of Sin, Tammuz, and Istar : this calls attention to “ the circle of the sun god ” and to the “ staff ” of the same—the two emblems in his hand. The gods Adar and Anu were also adored at Sippara, according to the Bible (2 Kings xvii, 31). A very large collection of kuneiform tablets comes from the site, including the Akkadian hymn to the sun (see Babylon), with its Semitic translation.

Sistrum. A sacred instrument, and emblem, in Egypt, being a horseshoe-shaped metal band, strung across with wires, on which are loose jingling pieces of bronze. It is often shown in the hand of Isis, or of Hathor (see Rivers of Life , i, p. 216, fi g. 92). Plutarch says that the hoop represented the moon. The instrument was used in the rites of Isis. Sita. Sanskrit : “ sown.” The wife of Rama, and the Indian Proserpine, or the corn in the furro w, who is stolen by the Indian Pluto (see Rama). She was an incarnation of Lakshmi. In the Krita age Ved ā vati, a devotee of Vishnu, destro yed herself on being touched by R ā vana, and she was reborn as Sita. Her foster father (for she is the “ supreme unborne ”) is King Videha, in the Ram ā yana, who said that she sprang from earth, to which fi nally she returned. He found her in the furrow when ploughing ; and her mother was Bhumi-j ā or “ the earth,” which opened again to receive her. Many shrubs are sacred to Sita, especially the Sari fi a, or custard-apple, which has a fruit full of seed, recalling the pomegranate of Proserpine. Sitala. The black godess of small-pox, for whom there is a niche in almost every Indian village, and sometimes a small shrine, as at Pushkar, and other sacred places. She is thought to be ever roaming ()ver earth, and demands sacri fi ces and festivals. She has eight faces studded with eyes, which look to the ends of the earth. Her teeth are like boars’ tusks : her garments are serpents : in her hair are peacock’s feathers, and two elephants hang from her ears. She holds in her hands a sword, dagger, trident, cup, wheel, rope, and an ape. She was cast out of the Paradise of Kail ā sa because she fl ung her necklace of gold beads at Siva, caus ing ulcers ; she married an earthly husband whom she lost, and set out to seek him, being directed by a dove round whose neck she placed a ring. She was kicked by a cow, and decreed that cows henceforth mu st labour all their lives, and have only one teat for a calf, one for the gods, one for the king, and one for the owner, while the hide should be made into drums and shoes.

The Turkish sev means “ kind.” [Akkadian se “ favour,” sab “ heart.”— E D .] Siva as the creator is symbolised by the lingam, especially by natural peaks and upright rocks, or stones, by tree trunks, and plants such as the onion. His pillar, as Mah ā -deva, is the “ tree of life,” in paradise, or symbolised by the egg placed with the pointed end upwards (see Rivers of Life , ii, p. 464, plate xvi, 7). Siva is the “ three eyed,” but also the “ one eyed,” “ one toothed,” “ one legged,” and Ekalinga or “ single essence,” to whom one of the holiest shrines of Odeyp ū r in Rajput ā na is dedicated ; the high priest, being a noble of the Meywar state, takes precedence of all in royal ceremonies. He informed us personally that he is “ the vicegerent of the sun,” which is symbolised by a huge black linga m. The “ one eye ” is on this lingam, and represents the eye of heaven. Siva is also Sava, the “ prosperous ” or “ favourable,” who bestows good fortune. He is always upright, and never recumben t like Vishnu. He is the Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer; but he dest roys only to create again. He is the “ lord of the door ” of life, and holds the key like Janus. He is Tri-murti, or “ of three forms,” in his triple capacity, and holds the Trisul or trident (see Rivers of Life , i, fi gs. 105, 1.57, 189 ; pp. 233, :358, 516). He has eight hands in which he holds the trident, club, citron, serpent, lotus, arrow, lute , and rosary, symbolising his power, passion, and asceticism. He is commonly seated, with P ā rvati, the Indian Venus, on his knee. As Rudra the stormy, and K ā la or death, his terrible Sakti is K ā li or Durga. But Shiva is the “ expanding one ” author of life, and Siva appears in the Vedas as meaning “ propitious.” The Siva of to-day is severely ascetik, while the legend of K ā ma relates his destruction of passion. Faith in Siva is the one thing needful according to his votaries, and parents or children must alike be willingly sacri fi ced if he so requires. He is said to appear in eight forms, as earth, water, air, ether, fi re, sun, moon, and metal. He is especially adored on the 30th of Chait, the end of the Hindu year, about Easter time, when severe tortures and fasts are undergone in his honour, by men and women a like.

The many forms and attributes of Siva are well expressed in a poem by Sir A. C. Lyall, called Mors Janua Vitæ ( National Review , May 1888) beginning— “ I am the god of the sensuous fi re That moulds all nature in forms divine. The symbols of death, and of man's desire, The springs of change in the world, are mine; The organs of birth, and the circlet of bones, And the light loves carved on the temple stones.” Like Osiris Siva is the bull, an d is borne by Nandi, the sacred bull who kneels before the Argha. He wears a crown of skulls, and holds the noose of Yama. Like Ea he holds the antelope, and like Nergal the hare. His Paradise is on Kail ā sa ; among plants the Ā s ō ka is sacred to him (see these headings). The Nirgundi—a three- leaved plant, and the Bilva or “ sacred fruit,” are also his emblems, and the latter is offered to no other go d. Siva requires no altar, and no priest, all may adore him wherev er a lingam is found, presenting grain, fl owers, fruit, oil, and incense, wi th prayers and praises : a Sudra, of the Guruva or agricultural caste, attends to keep the holy spot clean and in order. It is a terrible sin to touch the lingam save with the offerings. Siva, according to his devotees, was the fi rst god who sprang from the world egg, which (see the Padma Pur ā na) was the fi rst manifestation of Mah ā -deva “ the great god.” Similar legends are told of Siva and of Vishnu, and both burst from a pillar, or lingam,"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"Siva 310 to destroy the unbeliever, as we see in the picture copied by Rodriguez from a S.

He appears as the green god; with the sacred tree, and holy well, surrounded by the serpent of eternity, who thus marked the boundaries of the shrine, and then returned to Siva’s arm ( Hindu Pantheon , p. 197). Siva in abstract contemplation, as an ascetik, is represented as disturbed by K ā ma, and by woman, both painted green. The gods—alarmed by giants of death, and by Siva’s motionless atti tude—sent Vayu (“ the wind ”) to rouse him, but he was repelled by the door-keepers of Kail ā sa. K ā ma (“ love ”) was reluctantly induced to undertake the duty, and creeping up behind Siva shot at him from his sugar-cane bow, strung with bees, fi ve arrows tipped with the fl owers of the lotus, mango, ā s ō ka, muli, and karunga, all emblems of desire. The god sprang up, and a beam from his one eye reduced K ā ma to ashes, yet he was restored, and Siva yielded to the charms of P ā rvati. Thus at the vernal equinox a shaft of the sugar- cane is set up, piled round with cow dung, and set on fi re, while nuts, fruits, and sugar, are offered to Siva, and his attributes are then rehearsed. Siva always faces the east, and his one eye is the sun. The great Trinity—the sacred Aum—consists of the dark blue Vishnu, the bright white Siva, and the red or golden Br ā hma. The “ glori fi cation of Siva ” represents him as a column of fi re on Mount Kail ā sa. Br ā hma, as the Hansa or sacred g oose, attempts to soar to the top of the column, and Vishnu, as the boar, digs into the moun- tain to fi nd its base ; but neither can measure the “ height and depth ” of the “ great god.” This scene is commemorated in November, when bon fi res are lighted on any holy hill near a shrine of Siva, and offerings are cast into the fl ames. It has required much vigilance on the part of the British Government to put down the offering of human victims to Siva in his forms of terro r ; and we have seen many a wild spot where the young of both sexes have cast themselves over a. precipice, into a torrent, in faith and love for Siva.

Such cases are very hard to prove, as all concerned keep the secret. Siva is, however, at times a jo vial god, who delights in the dances of naked worshipers. He is said to have invented the Tandava dance to please Uma “ the mother,” who in return introduced the L ā sya,or graceful attitudinising of the Indian Nautch ē s.

Its greatest force is towards the rising sun.

He swells to enor- mous size on his special night (see Siva R ā tri) when the 12 great lingams are visited (see Lingam).

These were sparks of Siva’s fi re which P ā rvati made into a single constellation. Skeptik. Scepticism. The Greek word skepsis means “ care- ful inquiry,” so that Skeptik is an honourable name, though priests have depreciated it, knowing that skepsis leads to skhisma —the “ splitting asunder ” of irrational sects. The Skeptik is one who endeavours to re fl ect without bias on what is told him, seeking the truth, without consideration of the re sult in regard to existing beliefs or opinions. He refuses to say “ I believe ” when he does not feel on fi rm ground; and remains open to further light. It is a stage of enquiry whereby he reaches agnostik results. The old Greek Pyrrho- nist was credited with universal do ubt, which might well be, in an age of so many faiths and philosophies, as those contending with each other in Pyrrho’s time (see Pyrrho). Only through doubt and skepsis has the world been able to make any advance. Science, the parent of knowledge, bas come to us as the child of skepticism : for science requires answers, which are necessary to its own existence, even though they should overthrow old and cherished dogmas. No man doubts a mathematical demonstration if he can understand it ; but only through “ careful enquiry ” is the demonstration reached. Doubt is the true parent of growth that is arrested by opinion. Each step being carefully considered, it often ruthlessly destroys the position of those who have helped to create it. It offers implacable opposition to all who say that “ dissent is sin.” Its pathway is strewn with dead fragments of deeply rooted prejudices and of once venerated creeds. Reverence for opinion is foreign to the domain of real thought. Doubt claims its place, and skepticism has its value, in every sphere of enquiry, religious or secular, social or political. It fears no consequences, and is bound by no dogmas. It desires only that every step be proved correct, and that, to the utmost, the truth shall be secured. With such an object the skeptik studies the ancient scriptures of mankind, and the legends of the past ; and calls in question every asserted command of a god, and every historic state- ment, accepting what can be shown to be good by the light of later knowledge, while rejecting that which is disproven. \"To scepticism,\" says J. A. Froude the historian, \"do we owe"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"Skeptik 313 every advance in science, every im provement in the command of the mechanical forces of nature, and ev ery step in political and social freedom, in the fi rst instance.” Prof. Draper says that the extinction of a religion “ is not the abrupt movement of a day : it is a secular process of many weJl-marked stages ”—the rise of doubt among the candid ; the disapprobation of the conservative ; the defence of ideas fast becoming obsolete even among average believers, who vainly hope that a way of escape may be found, by research or by allegory, so that the incredible may be shown to be probable, or at least possible ; these stages lead to the fi nal denial that is destructive of the religion of the fathers—in so far as its dogmas are untrue. It was the skeptik who freed the Roman Catholic, and the Jew alike, from disabilities as citizens which intolerance had decreed. It is but a century since Protestants forbade a Romanist to purchase land, in Ireland, as freehold ; and no mo ney legacy for reading the Jewish Scriptures apart from the New Testament was then valid. Before 1847 no Jew could join in making la ws for the country in which he dwelt among us. No free-thinker co uld before 1883 sit in Parliament, unless he swore by the Jehovah of the Bible, in whom he did not believe : nor could he le ave money, or property, to any association not conforming to the tenets of Christianity. All who were not on the side of the clergy were “ outcasts and in fi dels,” as Lord Coke wrote in 1737, and “ are in law perpetui inimici ” (eternal foes) : for between them and the Christian, as between the latter and the devil “ whose subjects they be,” there is perpetual hostility. But even the devil and his myrmidons (though Christ was believed to have seen and spoken with both), have fallen into dis- repute through the labours of skep tiks, and have betaken themselves to the world of folklore and witchcraft. The hell of eternal torment under earth, which men imagined to be proved by the sunset fl ames, has suffered its brazen gates to be torn asunder, in spite of gods and scriptures. The denunciations of creeds that condemned the skeptik to its depths, are disregarded. For skepticism has opened prison doors ; has struck the shackles from the limbs of the poor and oppressed ; and has cared for the wretched madman, whom harsh priests and bigots neglected. It has given the skilled nurse and the able physician to the sick. Skepticism indeed fi rst opened the gates of Eden, and gave to us the fruits of the Tree of Kn owledge, substituting science—or true knowledge—for stumblings in a ma ze of occultism, spiritualism, and deluding theosophy.

It is the doubter who has freed us from the tyranny of ecclesiastics, who once forbade investigation of any natural phenomena from a scienti fi c stand- point. In the regions of sociology an d politics, skepticism required that statesmen, and patriots, should cast aside the priestly texts that com- manded men to submit to the tyranny of a ruler, as being the “ Lord’s anointed.” Priests and Bibles in all lands have stopped the path of progress in every branch of knowledge—moral or physical, political, social, literary, or scienti fi c, because of their defects of conscience (see Con- science) ; and we may thank the skeptik for setting thought free, for tearing down the barriers, and for lightening the burdens of individuals and of nations. Yet skepticism owes much to dogmatism : for, as Prof. Seth has said, “ dogmatism has been its food.” Assertion is needed before doubt arises ; for it is more natural to us all to trust than to distrust. The child trusts its parent till it is able to judge for itself. Fears and hopes are the parents of mythology and religion. But the agnostik has reached a higher stage than the skeptik, for he has found that even “ careful enquiry ” will not always lead to certainty ; and has learned to wait when he sees no safe path before him. Few even of the Epicureans in the past ha d attained to this attitude of the cultured and scienti fi c, though in a measure they declined speculation, and modestly refused to go beyond the evidence of the senses—“ the gates of all real knowledge ” (Max Müller, Hibbert Lectures ). Long before the time of Greek civilisation the dogmatism of the Vedas gave rise to skeptikal philosophy in India (see Kapila) ; and from this came forth the heresy of Gotama, and the religion of mercy systematised by him as Buddha. But such growth is slow and timid, requiring many able and reverent thinkers, and a receptive race. Pyrrho apparently visited India, and returned in 320 B . C . thoroughly imbued with the agnostik spirit of Buddhism, which was then a rising faith in the East. He agreed with Gorgias the Sicilian (450 B . C .) that we know little, and have no faculties to enable us to know much, concerning the real nature of things ; and that speculations as to Being and Cause must be relinquished as be yond us—which is precisely what Buddha thought (see Pyrrho). The early Sophists urged, as he did, that A-taraxia or “ mental calm ” was the desirable result of such conclusions. Kapila-vast ū —Buddha’s home—was full of skeptiks when he lived, in the 6th century B . C . ; and Indian in fl uence is"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"Skeptik 315 traceable in the cruder dogmas of Thales, and among Sophists down to 500 B . C . Thales said that all things were based on a single element — fi re or water (just as the Logos, or “ Cause,” of H ē rakleitos was “ heat ” : see Logos), but added th at spirits independent of matter surround us (see Spirits) ; and this latter assertion the wiser skeptiks refused to accept unproved. The old idea however culminated in the ontology of Parmenides and Plato, in spite of skeptiks. Plato specu- lated as to the soul, and thought it immortal because sin did not destroy it (Rep., x) : while even Aristo tle, the father of science, seeking to found ethiks on logic, divides its faculties ( Nicomach. Ethics , I, xiii). Zeno, Prot ā goras, the Eleatiks, and the Sophists ; writers of such works as that of Gorgias On Nature , and On That which is Not , contributed alike to the slow growth of th ought and ethikal culture (see our Short Texts of Faiths ). But in these early days, even as now, there were doubters who hung back timidly, distrusting all enquiry. They said that the happi- ness and tranquillity of the community were of the fi rst importance ; and extremists gave way to self-ind ulgence, or fell into indifference : they taught that effort only brou ght disappointment, and forbade real happiness. But inactivity is impo ssible ; and, putting doubt aside, man has to live, pursuing his duties as well as he can. All earnest skeptiks, from Protagoras (440 B . C .) to Hume, have laid down as a maxim that every judgment must be questioned. Hume said : “ We must in all the incidents of life preserve our scepticism.” Eternal vigilance is the price to be paid for Truth and for Liberty. Like Buddha we must “ strive to the end,” however hard the strain may be. Professor Clifford has well de fi ned the limits of rational belief. We may, he says, “ believe what goes beyond our experience only when it is inferred from that experience, by the assumption that what we do not know is like what we know . . . It is wrong in all cases to believe on insuf fi cient evidence ; and where it is presumption to doubt and to investigate, there it is wo rse presumption to believe.” We must in short conjecture as well as we can, by the light of our experi- ence: for conjecture, if reasonable, often leads to new knowledge. Christian dogmatism led to the skepticism of Celsus, and skepti- cism to the Apologies . The dogmatism of Islam produced Moslem skepticism, which fl ourished in our 9th century till crushed by Turkish fanaticism. Even Pascal confessed “ Le Pyrrhonisme est le vrai,” but quali fi ed this as he well knew how to do when facing both ways. The theory of “ tranquillity,” am ong the Sophists of 500 B .

Every Bible has served to excite skepticism. The Hebrews had their Skeptiks in Job, Agur, and K ̣ oheleth “ the preacher ” : and in spite of the beliefs of their age they were very outspoken (see Mr Dillon’s Sceptics of the Old Testament ). They had outgrown the dogmas of their time. “ Job,” he says, “ looking down on the world from the tranquil heights of genius is manful, calm, resigned ; K ̣ ohe- leth shuddering at the gloom that envelops, and the pain that con- vulses, all living beings prefers death to life, and freedom from suffering to positive pleasure : while Agur , revealing the bitterness bred by dispelled illusions and blasted hopes, administers a severe chastisement to those who fi rst called them into being.” [As to this judgment, however, we may perhaps be sceptical ; for Job fi nally believed in an inscrutable Providence, as did Agur (Prov. xxx, 24-28) ; while there is no sound reason for supposing the conclusion of K ̣ oheleth (Eccles. xii, 1, 13) to be added by some other writer. The Hebrew mind always found peace in submission; and the Psalmist who says (Ps. cxxxix, 6) : “ Such knowledge is too wonderful for me,” was not a Skeptik, but a true Agnostik, like Job.—E D .] The doubter always begins by trying to explain away the clear meaning of sacred texts, which distur b him as an honest seeker after truth. We have had a good instance of this ( Times , November 1902) in the case of the Dean of Ripon, when doubting the legends of the New Testament. The Rev. S. Bicke rsteth considers that the liberal clergy attempt to explain “ in a no n-natural sense the words of Holy Scripture setting forth the Resu rrection,” and he defends the decisions of the Councils of Nicea and Ephesus. But it would seem that this is not now the genera l attitude of English clerics, one of whom says : “ I myself expressed with suf fi cient clearness in my examination, both for deacon and priest, views similar to those of the dean (Dean Freemantle) . . . and a friend of mine was ordained by the late Bishop Lightfoot, with the fullest knowledge that he totally disbelieved the Virgin birth.” Dr James Martineau has written faithfully on this subject of “ Destructive Criticism.” “ The attempt,” he says, “ to fi nd infallible records in canonical books, and permanent standards of truth in eccle- siastical votes, has so hopelessly fa iled that honest persistence in it has become impossible to instructed persons, and therefore, in all competent guides and teachers of men, a continual sanction and profession of it is not simply an intellectual error, but a breach of"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"Skoll 317 veracity.

Whoever smothers an honest doubt turns it into dishonesty by rejecting its invitation to truer be lief. And the conventional outcry against destructive criticism interce pts the reconstructive thought and faith, which can alone endure.” Our own poets (like Jains of yore) have sung in praise of Doubt. Bailey says : “ Who never doubted never half believed.” Tennyson, though he would not dist urb the faith of a sister, wrote : “ There lives more faith in honest doubt Believe me than in half the creeds.” Surely then it is better to acknowledge that we know nothing as to any resurrection of Christ that can be regarded as credible, rather than to explain away the traditional beliefs of early Christians, by saying that this was “ not a return to the mortal conditions of this life, but a manifestation of the spirit ual state of a spiritual body ” (see Christianity).

The Slav gods mentioned in the chronicle of a monk named N estor, about 1100 A . C ., included Perun the sky, Svarog the heavens, and the earth as the wife of Perun. The godess of fi re was Dai-bog , and Stri-bog was the sun. Mokosh was a Venus, and Simagri the god of ocean, Volas a god of herds, and Khors a Mars. Perun curses those who break their oaths ; and weapons and gold are dedicated to him. His images were of wood, with a silver head and golden moustaches. Human sacri fi ces were offered to wooden logs on mounds ; and the three great rivers Dnieper, Don, and Bug, were also represen ted by images, and adored. The Letts, in N. W. Russia, were Slavs, holding that men would be reborn in another world much like this, but said to have had no belief in any hell, or future retribution. Thei r thunder god Perkunas was the same as Perun.

No religion in the past forbade slavery. As Renan says : “ There is not one word in a ll Christian literature that tells the slave to revolt, or the master to free the slave, or that touches the problem of public right which arises out of slavery.” [The oldest account of slavery is found in the Babylonian laws of H ̣ ammurabi. Twenty out of 280 of these laws refer to slaves. It was death to steal a slave, to entice, or harbour, or hide a runaway, or to rebrand a lost slave. The slave who struck a freeman, or who denied his master, had his ear cut off. He who branded a slave indelibly (to prevent purchase) had his hand cut off. If a slave was killed, a slave must be given instead. If a slave was damaged half his value must be paid. A foreign slave must be returned to his master unless purchased. The fee for catching a runaway, for curing a slave, or the fi ne for failing to cure, was 2 shekels (or about 5 shillings and 8 pence) : a slave purchased could be returned within a month, and the bargain was cancelled, if he fell ill ; freemen could be sold as slaves if they failed to keep up the banks of the canals on which irrigation depended. These laws, which regard slaves as cattle, are more severe than those of the Pentateuch.—E D .] The later Babylonians introduced some mitigation in the lot of the slave, who was apprenticed to learn a trade, and supported when old and in fi rm: a master who injured his slave was bound to clothe and feed him, and they could purchase freedom. An old and faithful slav e could not be sold, and was some- times given freedom at his master’s death. The Romans were great slave-holders, and imported some millions of captured white slaves. The ruin of the empire is thought to have been partly due to this system, and the abolition of slavery was facilitated by the discovery that slave labour is in the end unpro fi t- able. But even in recent times Christian statesmen upheld what they called a “ divine institution ” : for according to the oldest Hebrew laws a slave was property (Exod. xxi, 21). A Hebrew could not be permanently enslaved by a Hebrew, sa ve by his own consent (xxi, 2-6), and slaves were foreigners (Levit . xxv, 44) : Christianity regarded slavery as unimportant, in view of the immediate end of the world (1 Cor. vii, 21-24 ; Ephes. vi, 5- 9; Col. iii, 22-24). Protestants kidnapped 80 millions of “ blacks,” whom they enslaved in N. America. Moslems continue to import such slaves to Jeddah, and secret slave markets exist in such towns as Jerusalem and Damascus. Muh ̣ ammad, though he freed his own slaves, and made laws to mitigate the condition of slaves generally, ne ver contemplated the abolition of slavery. No Church or Pope ever pleaded the cause of the slave, though in 1167 Pope Alexander III decreed that “ Christian men"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"Slesha 320 ought to be exempt from slavery.” The good men who fi rst advocated abolition were mainly found among those who had emancipated themselves from State Churches, in Britain, and in America alike. Buddhists who really followed Gotama condemned slavery ; and philosophers like Seneca protested against it. Constantine decreed that slaves owned by Jews were to be freed if they embraced Chris- tianity, but that a free woman who gave herself to a pagan slave was to be burned, and the slave executed. Only in 867 did the Church concern itself with slaves’ marriages ; for the pious Theodosius held that “ slaves were too vile to be worthy of legal notice.” Even in 1832 Mr Gladstone only proposed that Christian converts should be emancipated ; and his father was a sl ave owner. Christian slaves were not permitted to partake of the Eucharist without their master’s consent, as decided by the Council of Laodicea ; and in 541 A . C . the Council of Orleans required that the descendants of slaves should be re-enslaved. The Council of Toledo in 633 A . C . forbade bishops to set free church slaves, or to sell Christian slaves to any but Christians, and other Councils made laws about slaves down to 1179 A . C . The Abbey of St Germain des Prés ow ned 80,000 slaves, and that of St Martin de Tours 20,000. Wilberforce, and Theodore Parker, stated that, in their time, American churches supported slavery : Presbyterians owned 80,000 slaves : Baptists 225,000, and Methodists 250,000. Many theological colleges hired out their slaves ; and the northern states—including Boston—refused to allow Liberationists to lecture, calling them in fi dels, and deniers of the commands of holy writ. Prof. Francis Newman points out that Republican France was the fi rst European state to make an act against slavery. In 1788 the “ Society for the Propagation of the Go spel ” refused to allow slaves to be educated, lest they should rebel (see Westminster Review , Dec. 1888). Slesha.

He was born in 468, and died in 399 B . C . Like his father he was a poor Athenian sculptor, and as a lad studied the philosophy of Anaxagoras, being a thoughtful youth who “ not without a struggle mastered his naturally impetuous appetites.” He was 16 when Anaxagoras was banished from Athens as an atheist. He was fairly educated in music, and in the gymnasium. Krito, a rich Athenian, who proved to be his life-long friend, and admirer, took him away from the city, and appears ever afte r to have maintained him. He served as a soldier, and showed courage ; he witnessed the Isthmian games, and settled in Athens, where he showed the courage of his opinions, as a simple-hearted, and loving teacher of all who would listen to his words. He early belie ved in his mission to reclaim his fellows to a thoughtful and moral life ; and declined to participate in worldly, or politimd affairs, thus separating from the Sophists. He said that it was his vocation to awaken to moral consciousness the youths, and busy workers, to be fo und in market-places, gymnasia, and workshops. He fought against false pretentions and learned conceit, saying that the foundation of cond uct lay in self-knowledge. He became obnoxious to the mentally sl othful, and to corrupt rulers, or learned and orthodox teachers, who detested the “ ugly little street preacher.” In 423 B . C ., Aristophanes turned him into ridicule in the famous drama of the Clouds . But the fame of Sokrat ē s was wide- spread, and he discoursed with th e most distinguished men and women of Greece. Though ungainly in movements, with a fl at nose, thick lips, and prominent eyes—described by his friend Plato as “ externally like a satyr, or Silenus,” yet all allowed “ that the rude exterior was forgotten as soon as he spoke : hi s soul was all virtue, and from within him came forth such divine, and pathetic, breathings as pierced the heart, and even drew tears. . . .

At ti mes, he thought, he “ had monitions, or warnings of an inner voice,” and this he called his daim ō nion —the promptings of a good genius ; he woul d often stop in his walk, and strive by deep thought to commune with such a spirit. The busy city did not long endu re him, and his friends were unable to defend him from powerf ul and bitter foes, who denounced him as an enemy of the state. They began by enacting laws against “ oratory,” or street preaching, thus putting down dissent, and for- bidding freedom of speech. He was impeached on false evidence, as a disturber of the state who denied the gods, spoke lightly of priests and religious rites, demoralised men and yo uths, and interfered in politics. The charge was false, though some of his friends, such as Kritias, and others, had doubtless—as in duty bound—expressed political opinions. Sokrat ē s repelled the accusations, saying that he had never spoken of religious, or of state, affairs, but only about ethiks and philosophy, telling enquirers “ not to deviate from the maxims of the state,” but to endeavour to be the best of its citizens. The accusations were renewed ; and, like his early teacher Anaxagoras, Sokrat ē s was denounced as an atheist, and as one who taught the young to despise their parents, to disobey the laws, and to do dis- graceful things, for the sake of gain. An ignorant and corrupt aristocracy were against him, fee ling that their ways would not stand the light cast on them by a great moralist, and not brooking the reproofs of a poor and ugly critic of their aims and actions. He made a long and able defence before his judges, but refused any acquittal which involved his ceasing to enquire and to teach ; and he was condemned by a majority of six. He was asked to plead in mitigation of punishment, but declared that he ought to be maintained at public expense in connection with the Prutaneion. This incensed his judges, who then condemned him by a majority of 80. Plato, Krito, and other friends, in vain offered security ; and he was told to prepare for death by the poisoned hemlock cup within 30 days. He walked forth from the judgment hall saying that “ he would rather die after such a defence than live on, asking"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"Solomon 323 for money.” The sun of Athens set in everlasting shame.

His enemies met with contempt and punishment afterwards ; and, too late, a bronze statue was erected to the unstained memory of Sokrat ē s : in a few years appeared the immortal Memorabilia of Xenophon in his vindication. Like Buddha, and Christ, Sokrat ē s left nothing in writing, unless it were a short hymn to Apollo composed in prison. In India, or China, he would have been honoured, as were Buddha and Confucius ; but barbarous Greeks slew their greatest, like the Hebrews. Sokrates prayed to his god under the name of Pan or of Zeus, and spoke of “ the refreshing of his soul by such exercises.” He was once heard to exclaim “ O great Zeus, and all gods who haunt this place, give me beauty in the inward soul, and make the outer one with the inner man . . . may I reckon the wise to be the wealthy man.” Phredrus heard him and cried : “ Ask him, O friend , the same for me, since friends should have everything in common.” When dying, Sokrates is said to have “ offered a cock to As klepios ” ; for, in spite of his bold enquiry, he retained much of the ancient beliefs of the race —like Confucius. The age of Sokrat ē s was one of great thinkers in Greece.

The sacred drink of Vedik and Indian Aryans, the ambrosia of the go ds. The word (from the root Su and meaning “ drink ”) came to mean a libation. Soma was gathered on mountains, the stems were bruised, and the juice squeezed out. The Aryans came from lands too far north for the vine, and as they marched south had to fi nd substitutes for their original Soma plant. The modern Homa of Parsis is the Sarcostema Viminalis , or Asclepias Acida . Haug found Parsis in Poona using a few drops of the sour juice of a small bush which grows where the Asclepias will not grow ; and dry Homa wood, for the sacred fi re, was brought to them from Persia. In the Yaj ū r Veda the Soma is described, according to Max Müller, as a dark, sour creeper, without leaves. It had a fl eshy texture, was eaten by goats, and produced phlegm, and vomiting. Dr G. Watt, the highest authority on the fl ora of the Hindu Kush, could fi nd no plant ful fi lling all the requirements, and says that “ the vague poetical description makes any scienti fi c identi fi cation almost impossible.” The Iron (Iranian) tribes of the Caucasus use a kind of black beer as the sacred drink. The Soma juice “ was mixed with Yava (probably barley) and with milk,” which leads Max Mtiller to suggest the hop- plant, which came late to Europe, and—in the Latin of our 9th century—is called humolo , humslo , or umlo ; in Finnish humala ; in Slavonic speech chmeli ; in Hungarian komlo ; and in late Greek khoum ē l ē , comparable perhaps with Homa. Hence the “ ale ” of our ancestors, “ the delectable drink of gods and men,” may be the Soma.

An important Kolarian tribe (see Kols) in the Chutia- Nagp ū r hills, who have been much changed since railways penetrated to them, and Europeans started mi nes. Many interesting customs survive however, including tribal communism (see N. Indian Notes and Queries , July to September 1893). Sophists. Greek : “ wise men.” An important group of thinkers between 500 and 400 B . C ., following the early students of nature classed as physicists, an d naturally developing from these beginnings, and .dogmatic statements, a freer system (see Skeptiks). The older school began with Thales (644 to 548 B . C .), an astronomer who said that water was the fi rst principle. Anaximander of Mil ē tos (about 500 B . C .), an astronomer and geogra pher, disputed the existence of matter apart from some great spirit. Xenophan ē s (550 to 535 B . C .) was a Pantheist, teaching that “ all things are one, and come from one unchangeable and unproduced eternal.” He was the founder of the Eleatik school. Anaximen ē s (about 545 B . C .) regarded air as the fi rst principle, and is said to have invented the sundial. H ē rakleitos, his contemporary, called fi re “ the fi rst principle or deity,” all change being due to heat and cold, while men were created by the sun. The Sophists discarded such dogmas, as Gotama about the same time dis- carded the teaching of Indian schools of speculation. Parmenid ē s (about 500 B . C .) taught his followers to stri ve for virtue rather than for knowledge of the unknowable. He was a disciple of Xenophan ē s, and believed the earth to be round, and the centre of the universe. Gorgias (500 to 420 B . C .) was skeptikal as to all contemporary ideas. Zeno (450 B . C .) was the fellow countryman, and earliest disciple of Parmenid ē s. Protagoras, his contemporary, denied the existence of a Supreme God, and the religious theories of his age. Empedokl ē s also, at the same time taught the transmigration of souls, and Anaxagoras —the tutor of Euripid ē s and of Perikl ē s—was an astronomer who said"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"Sopt 327 that we knew only phainomena , or perceptible things. Sokrat ē s pre- served a belief in the soul and in deity, in law and purpose. D ē mo- kritos (460 to 360 B .

C .) thought that immortality was possible, that the gods had co ntributed to human comforts, and that our main duty was the pursuit of virtue. These teachings fi nally produced the great schools of Plato and Aristotle. The busy world was uninterested in the disputes of Sophists. The weak and ignorant were dismayed, and found their faith destroyed. The various teachers succeeded in showing the weakness of their predecessors, but failed to advance true science till Aristotle arose, and “ Sophistry ” became a word of evil meaning. Hostility and contemptuous criticism marked the discussions of Sophists, from Protagoras to Isokrat ē s (436 to 338 B . C .) and the latter “ impartial judge,” though educated among them, was bitter, in maturity and old age alike, against Sophist doctrines, regarding Sophists as sk eptiks whose teaching was opposed to morality and law, though individually they might be as good as other men. Sopt. The Egyptian spirit of the twilights whose shrine is known at Saft el H ̣ annah in the E. Delta (Naville, “ Goshen,” Academy , 21st Oct. 1893). Horus-Sopt was the light of dawn, whom King N ektanebo is represen ted as worshiping in Goshen—a deity surrounded with stars. Sorakt ē . An Etrurian conical mountain 25 miles S. of Rome. [Probably in Etruskan speech it means “ snowy peak.”—E D .] It was famous in Roman times as the shri ne of Apollo, now replaced by the chapel of Santo Silvestro, the “ fo rest ” saint. At the foot of the mysterious mountain were sacred groves, and dank grottoes in the limestone, such as that of Terracina , the chief sanctuary of Feronia, the earth mother of the Falerii. The practice of walking on fi re was a feature of her cruel mysteries (see Fire) : her cave, and the whole mountain, were sacred to infernal go ds. The cavern emitted poisonous vapours, and was the abode of Hirpini (“ snatchers ”) whose name signi fi ed wolves in Sabine speech. They were fabled to have been shepherds who took the forms of beasts of prey (see Lukos). The Hirpini Sorani were ministers of Feronia, who walked unhurt on glowing embers. Soramus.

Sothik Cycle. A period of 1460 years during which the heliacal rising of the star Sothis, or Sirius, was believed to return to the same day of the vague Egyptian year.

It is hardly a century since all Christian Europe regarded the soul as a kind of bodily organ near, or within, the heart, or the brain. Leslie St ephens says that “ a belief in its immaterial substance did not exist until the time of Descartes.” The word soul represents the Hebrew Nephesh , the Greek Psukh ē , and the Latin Anima , or the Sanskrit Atman , signifying breath, life, or self, and so applicable to all animated beings. The belief in a soul lies at the base of all religious systems : for all men know that the body is dissolved ; and the individuality wa s materialised as some form—a butter fl y, a dove, or a mouse—dwelling within, and leaving the corpse. Men did not think that individuality depended on the stored memory of the brain cells, which memory is blotted out when they decay. They believed that the soul could ta ke all these with it into some new body. In the New Testament the Greek Psukh ē is variously rendered “ life ” (Mark viii, 35), and “ soul ” (Matt. xvi, 26) : “ For whosoever will save his Psukh ē shall lose it,\" and\" what shall a man give in exchange for his Psukh ē .” [This changed rendering, in two consecu- tive verses of the English, indicate s the belief of the 16th century. In both cases the Greek represents the Hebrew idea of the “ self ”— see Nephesh—“ whosoever will save his self shall lose it,” and “ what shall a man give in exchange for his self.”—E D .] The ordinary modern idea of a soul has no found ation in ancient Hebrew teaching : for according to the Bible man has a “ living soul ” (Gen. ii, 7) like other animals, because animated by the “ breath of life.” The ancient Egyptians had but vague ideas of the nature of the soul (see Ba, Egypt, Ka), and expected only a future life in a “ spiritual body ” for the righteous, while the wicked—devoured by a monster—suffered the “ second death ” (see Amenti). Renouf says : “ The people, like many ancient nations, believed in the pre-existence of souls before"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"Soul 329 their appearance on earth . . . they circled round the sun ; and the glori fi ed dead held converse with them . . . this was an article of the popular, and traditional, creed ” ( Ritual , chap. cxxiv ; see Proc. Bib. Arch. Socy ., May 1893). The soul fl ed at death, but hovered long near its earthly tabernacle, longin g to inhabit it once more. The universe was thronged with souls and spirits, of every grade and character, as earth was throng ed by all classes of men. The rudest and earliest nations all believed in souls, animating not only men and animals but plants also. But they had no clear doctrine as to the future of the soul, nor did Christians formulate such till very late times. Plato spoke of the soul as “ the child within” : Aristotle said it was “ small in size ” : Origen and Tertullian \u001fqually believed it to be of a materi al nature. Christ is recorded to have said (Mark xii, 25) that those who will rise from the dead, “ neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels which are in heaven.” But the more educated Sadducees had no ideas of any de fi nite nature about such a future (see Heaven, and Hel). The belief grew originally out of human love of the dead ; and parents were worshiped as guardian spirits, ever watching the children whom they left behind. When the body was safely burned, so that no evil spirit could enter in to the corpse, the soul ceased to desire a return to earth, and pa ssed to oblivion in Hades. The Homerik tradition regarded a future life as the privilege of only a few heroes ; and Greece owed the doctrine of immortality to later philosophers. Plato taught that the soul returned to the great soul of which it was a part, to be once more sent to earth (see Er) ; but ordinary Greeks, in his age, had no expectation of escape from Hades. They hoped at most to m eet again those who were dear to them, in the pleasant gardens of Elysium. Even their greatest had, like Æschylus, no cares about the “ great beyond,” any more than the struggling masses of to-day. The vagueness of modern concep- tions is evident in the translation of the Bible. The later Hebrews were as skeptical as the Greeks (see Ecclesiastes). Prof. Ernst Haeckel describes th e theory which compares life to an air played on an instrument (the body) by a skilled musician, who withdraws his hand at the end : but, although we speak of the soul as immaterial, we can only picture it to ourselves as a form. Men, as a rule, cannot think of life as a force acting in matter. If man be developed from lower animals, and no t a distinct and separate creation, his intelligence must also have de veloped from lower intelligence, and -as the Hebrews believed-his soul or self does not differ in kind, but only in degree from that of ot her animals. Uncultured tribes"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"Soul 330 attribute souls to their weapons, tools, food and garments. The spirit of spear, ring, or mantle could possess the owner, as the spirit of Yahveh fell on Elish’a with the mant le of Elijah, or as the Holy Spirit is sent with the Pallium from Rome. The ghosts, not only of slaughtered slaves, but of all useful implements, and weapons placed in tombs, accompanied their master to the other world. The Mala- gasi claim to have seen King Ra dama dressed in his uniform, and riding the horse, which was buried with him, as also the charger of Friedrich Kasimir was buried with him at Tr ē ves in 1781. Teutons and Skandinavians still place shoes on the feet of the dead, and pro- vide money, garments and sewing ma terials to supply their wants in a new world (see Animism). Dr E. B. Tylor ( Prim. Cult . and Anthropology ) gives abundant evidence of the widespread belief that the souls of men, women, and babes pass into animals, trees, wood, and stones ; the souls of parents into children ; and those of dead infants into new-born babes. Similarities of manner and appearance—due to heredity—were so explained, and were regarded by the ignorant as sure proofs of their idea. The priestly rites of touching, laying on of hands, or blessing, were originaily be lieved to convey a spirit by actual contact. So Elijah conveyed life into the body of the dead child. The expectant mother thought. that the soul of her lost child would come back to her when the new babe should be born, and it was named after someone dead but dear, and regarded as the same. The majority of mankind believe that the soul leaves the body in sleep, and returns to it when it wakes. Nay, in times of ecstasy, or “ standing out ” of self, the soul for a time is freed. An idea once conceived gathers force, and develops as time goes on like a torrent swollen by tributaries, when it satis fi es the desires of men. Few ask how the idea arose, or where the great stream had its source. Christian beliefs were vague till Augustine (about 400 A . C .) taught that we possess souls quite distinct from our bodies. Origen spoke of the souls of all creatures, including the snn and stars. Justin Martyr thought that all souls save those of the elect perished. Paul never conceived the possibility that a soul could exist save in some kind of body, whether mort al or immortal. Many ancient and modern races have regarded the body as life- less matter, into which a living germ entered or was breathed. Buddhists said that the Jiva , or “ life,” existed throughout the body, and ceased to exist at death. Chri stian fathers, however, taught that “ souls were even visible ” as “ li ttle naked bodies,” which “ escaped from the month.” Tertullian says that his sister saw a soul, although he calJs the soul a “ spiritual essence.” He says that she “ used to"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"Soul 331 converse with angels, knew men’s thoughts, and saw other mysteries ” ( De Anima , v and ix : see Antenicene Library , vol. xv, p. 428). The soul was in the shadow also ; and to tread on a shadow injured its owner, while to stab it was to murder him. At a death, mirrors should be covered over lest the soul should be seen in them ; and doors and windows must be opened to allow the soul to depart : while those of neighbours should be closed, lest it should come in. Many think that the soul escapes while they eat or drink, which should be done with closed doors ; and sneezing is a danger for the same reason (see also Mus). The hair and nail parings when cut off must be concealed, for a part of the life or soul goes with them, and evilly disposed persons might use them to injure the living. In China and Polynesia, as among Hebrews and other ancient races, the seat of life is in the stomach rather than in the heart ; and a rounded form thus indicates a larg e and well-developed soul. The inspired author of the Sanskrit Katha Upanish ā d describes the soul of the perfect man as : “ an entity the size of a thumb . . . dwelling in the ether of the heart, like a light without smoke. . . . It rules his past, present, and future.” Yet “ the mortal can only become immortal when—all the evil desires of the heart having ceased to move us—we attain to Brahma.” None of the ancients believed, any more than savages do, in our theory of a “ disembodied spirit.” From Patagonia to Polynesia the soul is never conceived as existing apart from some form of body. It is a volatile something, prone to wander, and sometimes replaced by another spirit in its absence, or entering other bodies such as those of birds, fi sh, and cattle. The learned Spinoza said : “ Soul and body are the same, the one express- ing conscious thought, and the othe r material extension.” A soul without a body would be a force wi thout anything to move. African tribes round Lake Nyassa speak of the soul as an indwelling divinity, as we speak of the conscience. It is a heavenly being and becomes a god (Rev. A. Hetherwick, “ Yao Beliefs,” Journal Anthrop. Instit ., Jan.-June 1902, pp. 89-95). When the lisoka , or “ soul,” leaves the body it goes to Mulunga or heaven. It “ becomes fi nally God,” as Buddhists and Christians have also taught at times. The Orphik poets equally believed, like Virgil, in an Anima Mundi or “ world- soul,” which was a theory inconsistent with common beliefs in pre- served individuality and “ Islands of the Blessed,” or in heroes whose souls haunted earth and were propitiated at Greek Anth ē steria, or Roman Lemuria fêtes of “ all souls. ” They were dismissed by the invocation “ Manes exite paterni ”—“ depart ye ancestral souls.” Dido threatened Æneas saying, “ I will cling as a shade in all places.” But"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"Soul 332 the heroes of Greeks and Romans were half divine, and haunted their tombs, ever ready to listen to those who invoked them. The ordinary Greek left speculation on immortality generally to the mystics who were initiated at Eleusis. Prof. Francis Newman, in 1852, wrote on the “ Natural History of the Soul.” He de fi ned it as “ that side of human nature upon which we are in contact with the In fi nite, and with God the In fi nite Personality.” “ By the soul alone therefore is it possible to know God. . . . In child, and savage, as th e conscience is half developed so it is manifestly with the soul.” He thus regards it as the Mind, which “ warms into adoration when we discern the beauty of the in fi nite world . . . the forethought, fi tness, and design apparent in all the works of nature.” He thinks little of the miseries of life, and only of “ a Boundless, Eternal, and Unchangeable, designing Mind,” which he calls God. Thus he attemp ts to deal with the old objection that “ man cannot by searching fi nd out God.” He adds that “ it is unreasonable to imagine that we can at all more deeply sound His mind, than a dog that of his master.” He says that : “ The soul knows that God is her God ; dwelling with her more closely than with any creature. . . . If thy soul, O reader, is to go into higher spiritual blessedness it must become a woman—yes, however manly among men. It must learn to be dependent, an d lean on God, and dislike inde- pendence and loneliness.” Vainly we build our temples on the sand ; but in future we must be bolder and more trustful, as our frail barks are launched on the ocean where only Hope and Trust can remain with us. The great reality is heyond our understanding, and over it we have no power. Why need we f eel doubtful that the future is good, or cling to the fancies of man in the past ? The Chinese say that man has three souls. One remains in the tomb, one in the ancestral tablet, and one expiates its sins in a Purgatory—these are the Ba, Ka, and Ta, of Egypt. Men thought that souls continued to share the jo ys and sorrows, fuod and drink, of the living, long after death—that is to say, till the individual was for- gotten in time. The table is still spread yearly at the “ All Souls’ ” feast, when men pray and eat with the dead. These rites are royal and magni fi cent in China, solemn and complete among all Indian tribes. We have often seen the profusion of viands, milk, fruits, fl owers, and funereal cakes, spread out near woodland graves—nay even water provided that the ghosts may wash, and couches on which they may recline—and we have heard the solemn invocation : “ Take and eat this food, and drink again as ye so oft have done before with us.” Y et sometimes the additional request is : “ But we pray you"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"Soul 333 come not again to us, and we will seek you no more ” (see Sr ā ddha). Some Buddhists—like prehistoric tribes—leave a hole in the tomb for spirits to come and go. One school holds “ that the soul exists for ages, but is then reduced to the vacuity whence it arose.” Hindus are much divided on such questions, some believing in an “ unbegotten self-existence,” while their Agnostiks say that no such theories have any basis in reality. The Charvakas know of no soul save the breath which vivi fi es matter (Dr R. L. Mitra, in Bengal Rl. Asiatic Socy. Journal , Jan. 1884). The pure Monist urges that “ it is simpler to think of one uncreate and eternal supreme soul, than of many.” Man has always thought it si mplest to assume direct action of some soul or spirit when he meets with unfamiliar phenomena, but he thus creates yet greater dif fi culties. The discussions of Hindu philosophers are to be found in 13 Upanish ā ds of which Dr Rhys Davids gives us a list (see Journal Rl. Asiatic Socy ., Jan. 1899), and these include 474 pages, penned perhaps as early as 600 or 700 B . C . Even the Rig Veda, much earlier, spoke of a great being whence “ all the gods, and all human souls were suppo sed to have proceeded ” (p. 75). The idea in the oldest Upanish ā ds makes the soul the physical double of the body. But not even the Veda vouchsafes us any proof of the existence of a soul. All who believe take it for granted—whether it be Plato or a Polynesian savage. It is called a light, a fl ame, a heat, a memory, or a mind, and he whose soul is absent wakes insane. The soul existed before the body, and entered it through the head, or through the toes. But such speculations were regarded as mysteries only to be understood by the priest. The orthodox Hindu belief is : (1) that the very pious go to “ the place of gods,” whence a spirit takes them to the “ place of Br ā hma,” there to dwell forever, or for ages : (2) the souls of the less perfect go to smoke and darkness in the\" place of the fathers,” in the ether, or in the moon, and there the Devas feed on them ; they then return to earth in the rain, and become embodied in sacri fi ces eaten by men, reborn as infants, and forever migrating into other bodies in the same way : (3) the souls of the careless and irreligious are of littl e account, and enter into moths and gnats. The Katha Upanish ā d says that some so uls become immortal, and free from care and from rebirth, but others undergo many lives, or even have to abide in wood and stones. The Prasna Upanish ā d, says Dr Rhys Davids, “ contrives wi th reckless boldness to give fi ve different views of what happens to the soul after it leaves the body.” The Vedik view was that of the West. All had souls, and the good went to a sensuous heaven very like a pleasant earth, while"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"Spear 334 the bad went to darkness in “ a pit.” Nothing is said about any transmigration. Neander tells us that gifts used to be left on Christian altars for departed spirits, and the congregati on prayed for their repose before partaking of the Eucharist. Dead kings in France were served for 40 days as though still living ; and still in Greek and Spanish churches bread, wine, and other viands in saucers, are placed above the bodies of the buried dead. Dr Tylor tells us that down to our 17th century empty seats for the dead were sold in churches on St John’s Eve, and prayers for the dead were offered in mid-winter, or at the spring equinox. Early Christians held feasts at the tombs of martyrs : and Russians and Bulgarians still eat and drink among the tombs on “ All Souls’ ” night, giving an abundant supply of food to the ghosts, like Hindus. The custom is of Pagan origin, but in the 9th century A . C . this day was instituted (Smith, Dicty. of Christian Antiq .) ; and at the close of the 10th century the 2nd of November was set apart for special prayers, to deliver the dead from Purgatory, at the instance of the abbot of the famous Cluny monastery, who had accepted the statement of a pilgrim, from Palestine, that he had heard the wailings of souls in an awful abyss of fi re. The rites of All Souls’ Eve are often unseemly in Italy and in the Tyrol. Pious Bretons then assemble bare-headed, in groves or cemeteries, and pour holy water and milk into hollows on tombstones : the bells ring all night, suppers are spread out, and the voices of the dead are heard chanting, or praying the living to pray for them. Christians and Hindus alike explain that, though such viands are untouched, their essence nourishes the souls : wherefore the visible remains may be given to the poor. Of such “ communion with the dead ” the cake and wine at funerals are a survival (see China). It would seem better that we should only commune in spirit, and in memory, with good ones who have gone before us. Intelligent beasts displa y more sagacity than some of the wild men we have met. The child sleeps away its day as an infant, and only gradually attains power of thought (see Conscience).

Sphinx. The Greek woman-headed, or man-headed, lion (“ the strangler ”), sometimes winged, and usually sitting or couchant. The emblem was used not only in Egypt but by Hittites, Baby- lonians, Phœnicians, and early Greeks. The famous Egyptian sphinx, carved near the pyramids, was called Sesheps, and is the symbol of Neb-hor-em-khu, or “ the lord Harmachis,” whom Greeks called the Agathos Theos (Pausanias, viii, 36, 3), in whose honour a cup of wine was drunk at the end of a repast. Thothmes IV adored this god, and built the altar between its paws. It is however supposed to be much older than the 16th century B . C . (see Egypt). Thothmes IV is represented adorin g the sphinx. There is a Roman altar at the entrance of his chapel. The paws were repaired with small stones plastered over, at a late date. The body is 140 feet long. Arabs call it “ the father of terror.” The sphinx was also an evil being in Greek mythology (see Oidopous). Spinoza. Baruch (or Benedict) Spinoza was a descendant of Jews who fl ed from Portugal to Holland : his father was a well-to-do tradesman, and this only son was born at Amsterdam in November 1632. Two sisters Rebekah and Miriam were born later. Spinoza studied Hebrew, German, and Dutch, under the senior Rabbi, and became deeply versed in the Talmud, and in the philosophic and religious writings of Ibn Ezra and Maimonides, who sought to reconcile Jewish belief with the teaching of Aristotle (see Maimo- nides). The Latin master of this remarkable youth was the scienti fi c Dr Ende, who became a rationalist, attracted perhaps by the ideas of Giordano Bruno who was martyred at Rome in 1600 A . C . Descartes also (1596 to 1 650) settled in Holland in 1629, and his philosophy was spreading when Spinoza was born. Being able to read Latin easily, the youth grad ually set aside studies of divinity, and as early as 1653 it was noticed that he had become lax in his attendance in the synagogue. He was entrapped into controversy, and his views were declared unsound by the Rabbis ; but his talents were great, and scandal was unadvisable ; he was offered a yearly income of £50 to conform to orthodox doctrines. This he scorned to accept, and was fi nally expelled from the Rynagogue, with the usual fearful curses, in July 1656. An attempt was made to murder him soon after, and this led to his leaving the city for a suburb, principally inhabited by Mennonite s or Baptists (see Mennonites). Here he remained studying and writing for fi ve years, supporting"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"Spinoza 336 himself as an optician, and known by the name of Benedict Spinoza. He was regarded as a Christian, but his studies had carried him further than Descartes, and he had become a philosophic Pantheist, a simple, pious, and earnest seeker after truth. He was not an atheist, and Novalis has called him a “ God-intoxicated man.” Hegel de fi ned him as an “ A-kosmist ” (not a believer in a self- acting world) ; and Schleiermacher speaks of him as “ the holy excommunicated one.” Goethe, Lessing, and other great thinkers, considered him to be unique in stre ngth, learning, and sincerity. He was kindly and unsel fi sh, often refusing wealth, including a fortune left to him by an admiring friend. He resisted the attempt of his fanatical sisters to- depriv e him of his patrimony, yet he gave them everything except one little bed, and continued to live by his humble trade as a grinder of lenses for optical instruments. He dec;ined the chair of philosophy at Heidelberg which was offered to him by the Elector Palatine. In 1661 Spinoza, with his humble host, moved to Rhijnsburg near Leyden ; and in 1663 to Voorburg near the Hague ; in order to publish his Ethics , which be fi nished writing in 1665. He then began his equally celebrated “ Theologico-Political ” treatise, in defence of freedom of thought and speech concerning speculative questions. It was published anonymously, in 1670, at Amsterdam, and was at once placed on the Index Expurgatorius in Rome, and interdicted throughout Holland in 1674. Spinoza was cut off suddenly by consumption in February 1677, before he was 45 years old. It was thought that his lungs were affected by his trade. He was no propagandist, but a gentle student, who has left us his best thoughts. When his landlady asked his advice about her religion, he said : “ It is a good one, do not look for another ; you will be saved if you live a quiet, honest, and peac eable life.” His creed was purely ethikal, and he lived bravely in times of great danger. His valued master in science—Dr Ende—was hanged as a conspirator in 1674 in Paris ; in England Prynne, the author of the Histriomastix , was imprisoned for life ; fi ned £5000 ; had his ears cut off ; and, by decree of the Star Chamber, had to stand in the pillory at West- minster and Cheapside. Yet the mild spectacle maker, for twenty years, silently undermined the church es of Europe. To such as would listen, he said : “ We do not know for certain that anything is good or evil, excepting what conduces to understanding ”—a conception very different to those of establis hed Churches and political powers. Dr Martineau, reviewing Sir Frederick Pollock’s Spinoza , wrote : “ Though Spinozaism is anti-theistic, and has no valid excuse for"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"Spirits 337 retaining the word ‘ God,’ in the conception of an in fi nite monad, yet Spinoza digni fi ed the idea of a Supreme Being as much as Jews degraded it. His God is solitary, acts only from the necessity of his nature, is the free cause of all th ings, and loves himself with an in fi nite intellectual love.” Spinoza says that “ Pain and sorrow are man’s passage from a greater to a less perfection . . . memory, and like powers and feel- ings, are wholly dependent on the body. . . . God necessarily exists, and expresses the perfected human idea under the form of eternity.” But like churchmen the sage was talking about matters of which he could know nothing. He adds : “ It is only the Immortal and Omni- potent One who knows the past, and on ly in Him can we be immortal.” He thus approaches the Indian doct rines of absorption into deity, and annihilation. The philospher is clearer and sounder when he leaves God and heaven to return to earth and man. He sets aside the doctrine of free-will, when he says : “ Men are deceived who say they are free . . . this concept is based on ignorance of the inevitableness of the causes which determine desire. . . . There is truly but one substance, of which all things are but modi fi cations, and are absolutely dependent thereon ” (see Free-will). Kant went much further than Spinoza, in denying the philosophical necessity of supposing the exist- ence of a Supreme Being. Even he admits, however, that it is “ in many respects a useful idea ; but being only an idea it is quite incapable of increasing, by itself alone, our knowledge with regard to what exists.! Spinoza's Monad is a passionless, perfect, and eternal being, personal though existing in a ll things. This is not the Monist’s view, nor is it that of any sc hool of Atheism (see Pantheism).

The Jew and the Christian a like believe in a Holy Ghost, or Spirit of God, which among the latter has gradually, since our 4th century, become the third “ person ” in a mysterious Trinity, and a God who is Oreator (Gen. i, 2), Preserver, and Advocate (Paraklete), or “ Comforter ”—an omnipresent and omniscient “ being ” or per-"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"Spirits 338 sonality. Under this Trinity innum erable good spirits, seraphs, and angels act, and are opposed by evil spirits, under a devil (enemy, or accuser, or Deva), who is equally om nipresent. The system is exactly the same in Persian dualism ; but the nature, of fi ces, and even exist- ence of the good spirit, or advocate, have been denied far more than those of the adversary, or Satan. Texts from Genesis to Revelation have been adduced against every proposed de fi nition of the former ; but the Churches in solemn councils (see Councils) have declared all such objections to be “ blasphemous heresies,” when not in accord with de fi nitions pronounced orthodox (see Creeds). For the Spirit of God ( Ruah ̣ Eloh ī m ) created the world by “ brooding ” on the waters (Gen. i, 2). The gradual growth of the Trinitarian dogma, which has been the cause of so many schisms (see Church), due to attempts to de fi ne and harmonise various statements in the Bible, is traceable in the Epistles, Gospels, and creeds. The Jews called God their Father like the Christians ; and Paul often speaks of “ the God and. Father ” of Christ ; and de fi nes the one God and Father of all as “ above all, and through all, and in all ” (Ephes. iv, 6 : the “ you ” not being found in the early MSS.). He does not regard Christ as equal with this God, for (see Rev. Vers. margin) he says (P hil. ii, 6) that Jesus, “ being in the form of God, thought not to grasp equality with God.” The term Son of God is used in the Epis tles in the same sense as it was by the Jews, in speaking of their Messiah ; and even the Babylonians called every good man, and good ghost, a “ son of his god ” (see Babylon). Paul states that all be lievers, whether Jew or Gentile, are sons of God (Rom. viii, 15; Gal. iv, 6). The Holy Ghost inspired not only Jesus but also all believers (Acts x, 38 ; xx, 28 ; Rom. v, 5 ; 1 Cor. vi, 19 ; 2 Cor. xiii, 14 ; 1 Thess. i, 5). The legend of Virgin birth, found in two out of the four Gospels, attributed a supernatural origin to Christ, which the Epistles, the Didach ē , and other early works, do not notice. Even in the Gospels, however, the dogma of the Trinity was not originally to be found. It is admitted that the passage in the First Epistle of John (v, 7, 8) is a late interpolation, found only in a few later MSS., and absent from the Uncials of the 4t h and 5th century, and from all Greek MSS. down to the 15th century. The fi nal verse in the Epistle (2 Cor. xiii, 14), if genui ne, is inconclusive ; and another passage (Matt. xxviii, 19) appears also to be a later addition (verses 16 to 19) to the original. The Trinity has, in the same way, been intro- duced into the Latin translation of the Didach ē , though absent from the older Greek and Koptik versions , and in spite of the fact that"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"Spirits 339 Christ is, in that work, regarded only as an inspired “ servant ” of God. The equality of the Son was denied in 325 A . C . (see Arius) by those who regarded him as the fi rst created being. The equality of the Holy Ghost was also denied, as late as 381 A . C ., by the Mace- donians ; and the “ procession ” of this spirit from the “ Father and the Son ” is still denied by all Catholic Churches except that of the West. The Hebrew word Ruah ̣ (“ wind ” or “ spirit ”) is of both genders, but usually feminine. The later Hebrews identi fi ed this spirit with the feminine H ̣ okmah, or “ Wisdom ” of God (see Logos). Hence, in a passage from the lost “ Gospel of the Hebrews,” the Holy Ghost is called the “ mother ” of Christ ; whereas in our third Gospel it seems to be regarded rather as his father (Luke i, 35). Even Origen speaks of this spirit as the “ mistress ” of the soul. A dif fi culty also arises as to the omnipresence of the Holy Ghost, on account of passages in which it is said that, until the departure of Jesus, it could not come on the disciples (John vii, 39 ; xiv, 16, 17, 26 ; xvi, 7, 8). Two accounts are given of the inspiration of these disciples : according to the one, by Christ’s breathing the Holy Ghost into them after his resurrection (John xx, 22) ; and acco rding to the other by its descent on them after Christ’s ascension (Acts iv, 31). From other passages (Matt. i, 18, 20, iii, 11 ; Mark i, 8-10, iii, 29, xii, 36, xiii, 11 ; Luke i, 15, 35, ii, 26, iii, 16, 22, iv, 1, xii, 12 ; John i, 32, 33 ; Acts i, 5, ii, 17, iv, 31, v, 3, vii, 51, viii, 15, 17, ix, 31, x, 38, xv, 28, xix, 2, 6, xxviii, 25) we lear n that the Holy Ghost inspired David, and Isaiah, descended on Mary, and was the Unction or Bap- tism of Christ ; by it John the Baptist also spoke ; and the sin of blaspheming this spirit is unpardon able, though blasphemy against the Son of Man is pardonable. Simeon the priest prophesied through the Holy Ghost, of which Jesus also wa s full. The apostles receiving it (Jould transmit it to others, by laying their hands on them ; but the Ephesian converts (Acts xix, 2, 6) had never heard of it till Paul asked if they had felt its in fl uence. The orthodoxy of later creeds declares the three persons to be spir its distinct, yet indivisible ; rightly calling this an “ incomprehensible mystery,” since the Churches have created the dif fi culty, by vain attempts to de fi ne the God-man—to their own destruction. The incarnation of a god is an idea common to all faiths, as are Triads or Trinities ; but in all cases the idea con- fi icts with that of a single god, omnipresent and illimitable (see our Short Studies , vii and viii). Neither God nor man can ask us blindly to believe without actual evidence, and still less he who says “ be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you, a reason of the hope that is in you ” (1 Peter iii, 15)."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"Spirits 340 The nature of the Holy Ghost had been de fi ned in the 4th century A . C . (see Didron’s Christian Iconography , i, 417) ; and Augustine ( De Trinitate , ix, ch. 6) said, that “ the Father represented Memory, the Son Intelligence, and the Holy Ghost Love.” Every word of the Bible was then believed to have been written from dicta- tion of this spirit, by holy men (2 Peter i, 21). The Jews equally believed (sep. Bath-K ̣ ol) in such inspiration ; and men did not in such an age consider what Mr Herbert Spencer ( First Principles ) calls “ a scienti fi c commonplace,\" namely, that thought and feeling are only perceived through nerve action, and that force is only possible as a movement of some kind of matter : or, in other words, that every spirit must have some material form ; though, if this be imperceptible by our senses, we cannot be aware of its existence. The Christian Churches however were not concerned with this ; but, from our 8th to our 11th century, were rent asunder by the questions whether the Holy Ghost proceeded from the Fath er alone (John xv, 26), or from the Father and the Son (John xiv, 20), and why Christ said “ my Father is greater than I ” (John xiv, 28), if he made himself “ equal with God ” (John v, 18). Although believers in spirits denounce as Materialists all who differ from th em) there is no more materialist conception than that of the believer himself : for man is forced to personify his gods, and to localise hi s heavens and hells, before he can grasp the ideas, and must thus limit that which he pronounces to be illimitable. Berkeley ( Principles of Human Knowledge ) honestly ad- mits (p. 238) that “ of a spirit per se man can have no idea or notion.” Locke also asserts that “ our mind s cannot advance beyond the simple ideals which we receive from sensation and re fl ection.” Let us then hold with Aristotle that the judge mu st not allow his heart, aspirations, desires, or any a priori views, to affect his reason or understanding. It is only through matter then that we poor mortals can know of spirits : they must appeal to our sense of sight, or of touch, of hearing, or of smell or taste. Even when we credit such com- munication, we must ask whether the cause is not some illusion, due to imperfect vision of eye or mind. If passion entices, men say that an evil serpent tempts ; if the ass thwarts us, it sees some spirit ; if the cloud thunders, some angry god is speaking. Such ideas are common to all Animistic faiths and myths ; but they have nothing to do with piety and true religion, as we now understand them. Weak, credulous, ignorant, and emotional, or timid persons ; hysterical women ; men with highly strung nerves and strong imagina- tions; those who are epileptic, or in a state of ecstasy bordering on insanity ; all these have been the deceivers and the deceived ; not"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"Spirits 341 willingly perhaps, but through the in fl uence of their education, and upbringing in a spiritual (or spirit) atmosphere. Such tendencies are, by the law of heredity, natural to th em from birth, not easily shaken off, and still less affected by evidence that destroys the fables of ancient faiths. Indeed a new, and more ignorant, belief in spirits often fi lls the void left when the older religion is discarded ; and the new “ Theosophy,” as it is called, comfor ts the believers for what they have lost, as regards a future spirit-world. Hence we fi nd that many who have ceased to believe in the old Scriptures of their race, and who have turned aside from the steep hard paths which alone lead to the temple of truth, are unable long to endure the cold grey atmosphere of reason, which must ever surround the heights of knowledge. The weak, the ignorant, and the indolent, thus fall back into a slough deeper than that from which they have escaped. But let us not blame either the teachers or the taught of any creed. The former have generally been thoughtful and pious ; and their chief fault has been an attitude perhaps too revere nt towards that which, to them, was mysterious and incomprehensible. The object of their teaching was (perhaps at the expense of logic and truth), to comfort the miser- able and the dying, and themselves as well, by their belief in a future spiritual world, where spirits would compensate us for miseries endured —or in fl icted by them—on earth. The basis of belief in spirits is fo und in our ignorance, and in the fears that it engenders. Most p eople live in constant presence of phenomena which they do not understand—even when explained to them scienti fi cally—and which they cannot investigate. The more this is the case th.e more do they believe in spirits. A super fi cial acquaintance with scienti fi c discoveries appears only to widen the fi eld of man’s credulity concerning the unkno wn powers of “ nature.” Hence we often observe that the young Theos ophist fancies the presence of as many spiritual agencies around him as he has heard of forces—magnetic or electric—which appear to him wo ndrous. He readily accepts, on the haziest testimony, accounts of visions, or of miraculous cures like those at Lourdes : he says that he regards these “ not as miracles, but as results of powerful, inexplicable actions on the part of spirits.” He confesses that he has neithe r time, inclination, nor scienti fi c ahility, to investigate properly the real fa cts, or the causes—physiological, mental, or other—which produced wh at appears to him to be mysteri- ous. He may be deceived by others ; yet he believes ; and so the ball rolls, and a new religion springs up.

It is so easy"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"Spirits 342 when we hear, see, or dream about, something strange, or connected with what is far off, to put all down to the intervention of a god or spirit, rather than calmly to investigate all possible causes (physical and mental), such as the action of the brain lobes, or of the optic nerve. Hypnotism and dreams, the imagination of the ecstatic, insane, or self-drugged, have been called—in the sad history of religions—the voices of another world, communications from the dead, or from gods outside the universe of matter. The visions of the ancients were far more terribly real to them than are our modern trances ; and their consequences were far-reaching, in ti me and in eternity. Our ignorance of nature is the measure of the in tensity of our belief in the super- natural. It is needless to suppose fraud, or clever manipulation, among the ancients : the phenomena were accepted as real, and not perceived to be illusions (of sight or mind), any more than they now are. They were as sincerely believed as the st ory of Eden, or the temptation of Christ, are now believed, by pious Christ ians, to have been actual facts. As civilisation advanced the ancien t teachers, like the modern ones, tried to smooth over any dif fi culties, and even sought to perpetuate hallucinations from which they themselves had escaped—sometimes wisely anxious to steady the weak as they plunged wildly into the dark unknown. Dreams have often been the ca use of religious beliefs (see Dreams) ; for the soul or spirit was thought to wander away from the body. In dreams the dead were seen again, which was considered evidence of .their existence in some distant region. The names for spirits signi fi ed either that they were weak “ shades ” of the departed that escaped the touch, or “ livin g ” powers. As early as the 8th century B . C ., great thinkers began to hold that life was not an entity apart, but a movement of matter. Failing its presence the body was said to be dead : the spirit was supposed to have fl ed—perhaps only for a time. Therefore the rock-cut tomb, or the rude mound, must have passages leading from without, to the chamber, where the corpse was laid, in order that the spirit might come freely in and out. For this reason too our Indian servant wakes us very gently in the morning, softly entering the tent, or room, and repeating “ Sa-a-bib, Sa-a-hib ” in a dreamy monotone, gradually becoming louder, till he sees us move : for the Atman, self, or spirit, has thus been given time to resume its throne in “ The dome of thought, the palace of the soul.” It is an idea common among the wild hill tribes, and forest dwellers.

In the evening a naked savage with his sword beside him appeared, and after salutation departed on his rounds. About four in the morning the author was wakened by a low plaintive note, as if from a horn echoing round the camp, apparently at a distance. The sound seemed gradually to come nearer, becoming loud and eerie, till all the camp was roused. The friendly savage explained, on enquiry, that he always did this, lest the body of the sleeper should rise “ A-kela ”—or “ without its spirit.” From every ancient sacred book we can gleam abundant lore about the occult and the spiritual. Everywhere Isis is easily unveiled, and her garments assume the forms of local belief : but we have occultism enough in Christianity, without going further : we need not seek for such mysticism among the Mah ā -atmas (“ great souls ”) of the corrupt Buddhism of Tibet ; or among Y ō gis of the Him ā layas. Belief in spirits is undoubtedly to be found there, but so is it among ourselves, and wherever men, women or children are weak, or sick, piously inclined, and ignorant. Let the Theosophist study, as he proposes, “ seven years ” like Buddha, or Apollonius of Tyana. But let that study be an earnest, and if possible unbiassed, attempt to learn facts ; and let him leave alone the occult and the mysterious, accepting what Confucius taught 24 centuries ago, and considering that “ what he does not know he does not under stand.” We arrive at no useful results by simply culling out of the Bible marvellous tales of how serpents and asses spoke with human voice, or patriarchs lived for many centuries. As men of science we know that the anatomy of such beasts shows vocal organs un fi tted for speech, and that the human frame cannot hold together fo r above a few scores of years : that it is too heavy to allow us to walk on water, or to fl y in the air, and too solid to pass through closed doors or walls. Human imagin- ings, based on dreams, account for every tale of spirits who can eat without bodies, can talk to man, or dwell in arks, bushes, clouds, fi re, and water: in trees or stones: or who appear as “ tongues of fi re.” All such marvellous stories, found in every sacred book ever written by man, must be weighed in the balance of scienti fi c knowledge ; and he who fails to compare one faith wi th others will only deceive himself and others. He must allow for the ignorant imagination of those who saw spirits in mountains or rivers, caves and deserts ; and he will—if fairly educated in science, and of sound mind—come like others to the conclusion that “ no man has seen God at any time ” : that no one"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"Spirits 344 has ever heard one word or whisper from any “ spirit ” whatsoever : that he must not expect any voice, or action, which is not connected with the material universe.

Medical knowledge will enable him to give a cause for visions of the night ; for dreams of angels walking on the stairs of he aven ; for presages of famine and disaster, which are more often falsi fi ed than con fi rmed by events. It is an absolute truth that our mental state depends entirely on that of our bodies, and that no “ mi nd ” is perceptible except through nervous action. Healthy thought is possible only under healthy con- ditions of the animal, or living being. If such being be immature, or too old, it cannot accomplish the highest work for which it is fi tted in its best age. The mind soon be comes conscious of weakness ; and hence we see that the aged with draw from the consideration of dif fi cult questions, even when they have spent the best part of their lives in debating them. Old age seeks rest, and often fi nds it in the comforting assurance which friends are ever ready to urge—for who would be so cruel as to suggest disturbing doubts and fears ? But such fi nal yielding to opinions which, in days of vigorous intellectual power, we had tried, and found wanting, and had cast aside as superstitious, must (as Renan saw) be regarded, not as a “ death-bed conversion,” but rather as the result of weakened mental grasp. It would be a poor compliment to the gods to pretend otherwise : to say that we can only believe in them when feeble or doting ; or when we resemble the ignorant Oriental, the raving madman, or the entranced Y ō gi. We must set aside alike the visions of Buddha, Christ, or Muh ̣ ammad, however earnestly the believers urge that these great teachers strove with Mara, Satan, or Iblis, and communed with gods in lonely groves, or on desert mounts. No doubt, like the child Samuel, they heard their Lord calling them, as many an hysterical girl hears him in these days also : but we have learned now, in such cases, to call in the doctor ; and we should certainly not allow a physician to practice long in our ho spitals, if he diagnosed the case as one of possession by a devil, or of inspiration by a god. Belief in such possession or inspirat ion; in spirits, souls, ghosts, devils, deities, and spectres, is ne vertheless still very general through- out Europe ; and they are still very re al “ beings,” and causes of terror, throughout Asia, Africa, America, and Oceania.

Once, in an Indian jungle, the author tu rned aside from the pursuit of game to interview ghosts. It was a favourable time in the early grey dawn, when the laurel might assume the form of Daphne. Cautiously he rode along a tortuous path, ri fl e in hand. Arriving at an open space, he was amazed to see a screeching group of women running, with hands and chudders over their beads, “ because of the angels ” (1 Cor. xi, 10). He hastened to their defence—from a bear perhaps : but was fi nally directed to a burning-ghat some- way back. After much chattering, by the aid of a ploughman, he found (on entering the fi eld) that these women had gone at early dawn as mourners, to sprinkle holy water, with incense, over the ashes of some dear one who had been burned the evening before ; and that suddenly there sprang up Angusta-m ā tha —“ little thumbs ” —such as are well known and much feared: for they are the ghosts, the linga-sarira , or “ essence ” of the dead—the sprites which fl it about the corpse for a time , before setting out on the long journey to Swarga, or to Nirv ā na. Vainly did the author try to calm these women, by assuring them that, if water is cast on hot ashes, such little spurts of it will shoot up. The Hindu is not an Ephesian Christian, to excl aim that he had “ not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost ” (Acts xix, 2). Modern Spiritualism and Theosophy are but feeble survivals of the mighty superstitions of the past, which still enthral so many millions of humanity. Spirit rapping is known all over the world : among Transvaal Boers, and Syrian Moslems ; and we have witnessed writing on slates and walls, in the houses of Chinamen at Singapore, and often heard of it in Barmah, Java, and Siam. The Germans have always had their Polter-Geist, who makes mysterious knockings in houses : in Swabia and Frankonia these are frequent and urgent, on the Anklöpferleins-nachte, or “ night of the little knockers ” ; but without any important or evil results. In Wales the miners delight to hear sundry knockings which dire ct them, they say, to places where there are minerals. The Ch inese, says Mr C.D. Mills ( Index , August 1884), have mediums who can commune with gods in writing, by means of a self-moving pencil, and a tray of dry sand. Widows of the Mandan Indians can still so hold converse with their dead husbands. The Christian Church (as shown by a well known legend) held that the spirits of the dead were able to write : for two bishops died during the sitting of the First Council of Nicea, and its proceedings are said to have been left for a night on their tombs : in the morning these were found written across with th e words : “ We, Chrysanthus and"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"Spirits 346 Mysonius, consenting with all the Fathers in the holy, fi rst, and Œcumenical Nicene Synod, although translated from the body, have also signed the volume with our own hands.” Truly many legal dif fi culties might easily be solved if spirits without bodies could now, with their hands, sign the necessary deeds in our courts of law. The ancient physician Hippokrates was well known to send prescriptions from his tomb. Abelard and Heloise have often told their friends that they are now happy. Mr Herbert Spencer has shown that the more emotional, poetic, and artistic (that is to say the more imaginative) the nature, the keener is the faculty of conjuring up pictures in the mind, and “ the more liable are we to the revivi fi ca- tion of ideas, and impressions from real perceptions, until we come to revel in a wonderland of mental imag ery, miracles, and ghost, or spirit, stories divine and devilish, and as fallacious and delusory as ancient witchcraft.” In the lives and writings of poets, artists, and even philosophers—Milton, Dryden, Tasso, Descartes, Bunyan, Cowper, and others, we read of such things. Tasso used to speak to a spirit gliding on a sunbeam. Malebranche (like Abraham, Moses, Samuel, or Muh ̣ ammad), heard spirit-voices distin ctly. Dante, and Cowper, saw and spoke with the Devil, and Luther actually assaulted him. Pascal started from his chair when he saw the fi ery gulf of Hell at his side : Swedeoborg saw, and accurately described, both Hell and Heaven ; even the philosophic Descartes speaks of an invisible being that followed him. Among the Finns new born infants (and persons born in an auspicious hour in some English northern counties, and in Scotland) can see ghosts, souls of the dead, and demons, or hobgoblins ( Notes and Queries , 28th Nov. 1884). The Finns indeed constantly see and hold interviews with the damned, who generally appear of fi ery or blood-red color, sometime s headless, sometimes “ with fl ames spurting from their mouths and eyes . . . they whistle, shake houses, and occasionally shut doors . . . bewail the weariness of their lives . . . but never speak to the living till spoken to, though they mumble, and try to speak, and usually answer in monosyllables ‘ yes ’ or ‘ no.’ ” They are often seen near wells (in red caps), in bath houses, behind hearths, kilns, etc.; and are found dressed in red, sitting near fi res and ovens. “ The woods of Finland have an enormous number of such sprites, with long beards, whos e daughters are beautiful, and fond of combing their long hair at sunset beside calm clear wells : un- baptised children are often stolen by them, and they assume various forms, as cats, etc., in order to ge t near them ; but a pair of tongs, knife, etc., laid crossways drive away these spirits.”"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"Spirits 347 Heavenly spirits (like the Hebrew Beni Eloh ī m or “ sons of god ”) still come down to earth, in many parts of the world, and love the “ daughters of men.” Maidens in India are still believed to bear children to some holy spirit. Such a child of Munja we fi nd in Malab ā r. Holy men too, who may be called Mah ā -atmas (which Theosophists wrongly pronounce Ma-hatmas) say that they obtain offspring by heavenly Succubæ, afte r the performance of some severe rites and penances. The Ceylonese say that all children born with hair, or teeth, have Incubi as fathers (see 'l'ylor, Prim. Cult ., ii, p. 190). Sir J. M. Campbell ( Indian Antiq ., Jan. 1898) gives many instances of similar beliefs in Europe, surviving till the 19th century, even among ourselves. Many are the great men, besides Plato or Alexander, who had gods as fathers ; and Servius Tullius, the 6th king of Rome, was the son of the hearth-spirit Vesta. The Cyprians said that the Greeks were the offspring of Succubæ. Our St Augustine (600 A . C .) said that he was constantly visited by such beautiful fi ends : as holy women were visi ted by Incubi. These ghostly temptations are frequently noticed in our 4th century ; and, in 1621, Burton ( Anatomy of Melancholy , pp. 118, 494-496) wrote that “ there was never a time when so ma ny lecherous spirits, satyrs, and genii, appeared as now.” Scotland was then complaining that “ not even the names of Jesus and Mary, or the sign of the Cross, could scare away Incubi, and Succubæ.” In France, as late as 1730 to 1780, masses used to be said in churches to keep away Incubi from nunneries. For there were many children suppose d to have had such fathers. The evidence for these beliefs would, however, not be now admitted in any court of law. We must endeavour to trace the origin of all these superstitions in the radical meaning of the various words used to describe the spirits ; and some of these roots are common to various families of language. A material meaning must attach to such words, and it is not enough to say that. they mean “ wind ” or “ breath,” unless we can fi nd the basis of terms for such abstract ideas. Animus in Latin is the Greek anemos for “ wind,” from the Aryan root An , which means to “ breathe ” in Sanskrit (see An). Our word soul is from the root swal , “ to swell ” or “ sway ” ; and ghost, like “ gust,” is from kwas to “ pant ” ; but the origin of these roots requires to be explained. [Perhaps the oldest common term for a spirit is As, Is, or Us (see As), from the root meaning to “ blow ” or “ breathe.” With it is connected the root Ish for “ being ” (Hebrew Ish, “ man,” “ being ” : Turkish Is “ to live ” : Aryan Ish “ vigorous ” : Akkadian Us “ man ”) : it is connected again with Is to “ speed,” and As “ to throw ” (Egyp-"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"Spirits 348 tian as , Aryan is , Hebrew aus ̣ ; Turkish es , “ to hasten ” : Egyptian us ̣ “ fl ing,” aas “ javelin ” : Aryan as “ throw ”), the meaning being, in all cases, life or movement. Cogn ate to this root is the inverted sound Si or Su , which appears in the Akkadian Zi , and the Keltik Si , for “ spirit,” and in the Egyptian Shu “ wind.” This again is connected with movement, as the root Sa or Su means “ to go ” or “ move,” in Akkadian, Egyptian, and Turkish, like the Aryan Swa “ to sway.” The Arabic J ā n or Jinn for a “ spirit ” comes from an ancient common root (Akkadian gan “ to be,” Aryan gan “ to produce,” Semitic kan “ to be ”) ; and the word Pan seems equally widespread (Japanese Pan , Latin Faunus , Greek Pan , all meaning “ wind ” and “ spirit ”), being derived from Ba and Bu “ to blow ” (see under these headings). In Semitic speech three words are used :—(1) Nephesh , in Hebrew, is the Assyrian Napistu , and Arabic Nefes , for “ soul ” or “ self,” the root being probably Pasah , “ to grow ” or “ spread ” (see Bas and Nephesh) : (2) Ruah ̣ , means “ wind ” or “ spirit ” (Arabic Ruh ̣ ), from the root Ruh ̣ “ to move ” or “ go ” : (3) Neshamah , “ spirit,” from a root meaning to “ inhale.” The commonest Turanian words are As and Pan as above mentioned. The Aryan words are numerous, and in some cases refer to apparitions, as for instance “ phantom ” (from the Aryan root Bhan “ to appear ”), or “ spectre ” (from Spak “ to see ”). The Greek Daim ō n, or demon, probably means a “ spirit ” (Zend dhm ā , Persian dam , “ wind ”). “ Ghost,” as the author points out, is connected with words meaning to “ swell up,” “ to pant ” ; and so with “ gust,” “ gas,” and “ geyser.” This root Kwas appears also to be cognate to the widely distributed root Kas “ to hasten ” (Egyptian Khes , and Hes : Aryan Kas : Hebrew Khish : Arabic Kh ā sh : Finnic Kos ). The words Bogey, Puck, Phooka, Pixey (see Bh ā ga) appear to come from the Aryan root Bhug “ to wave about ” (see also Bhuj ), derived from the older Bu or Pu , “ to blow ” or “ swell ” (see Bu). The Greek Pneuma for “ spirit ” is, perhaps, to be referred to the old root Pan already mentioned, from which also the Pena tes or family spirits were named : while Psukh ē (Psyche) for the “ soul ” would come from Pas (compare Bas or Pasht) rather than from Bhug . The Latin word Spiritus , and our “ spirit,” are from an Aryan root Spar , which apparently means to “ vibrate,” “ move to and fro,” “ breathe ” : from it also come “ spear,” “ spurt,” and “ spur.” In this, and in most of the preceding cases, the material basis of the roots is found to contain the idea of palpit ation, heaving, or movement to and fro.

Sanskrit : “ reverence,” “ piety,” hence an offering or charitable gift. It is now almost exclusively understood as applying to funereal rites, feasts, and pray ers for the dead (see Soul). These are held annually, monthly, or even weekly. The offerings are some- times only eaten by the Hindu prie st, the remains being given to a sacred bull or cow. By eating these, priests are believed to be able to commune with the dead. In the Vedas, Sraddha is the godess of religion: but the present rites differ widely from those laid down in the old S ā stras (see Max Müller, India : What can it teach us ? vii). In the Dharma S ā stra the gods are said to have won heaven as a reward of their faith and sacri fi ces, and men, if faithful, can do the same. A part of all Sr ā ddhas is offered to Agni (the fi re), and Br ā h- mans assert that the gods accept wh atever is offered to their priests, while no Sraddha is ef fi cacious unless offered in the right place, and by the right person, for it is otherwise the heretical offering of one “ whose gifts are fl ung to goblins.” These offerings seem to be fi rst noticed in the Grihya Sutras, when Sr ā ddhas are said to raise the soul of the deceased from this world, re-embodied in heaven, while without them it wanders in a world of demons. The worshipers used of old to eat the offerings after the ghosts had been satis fi ed with their essence or savour : and the fl esh was often eaten raw, as it is said still to be in Mexico and Hayti. The Roman Feralia and Lemuralia were Sr ā ddha rites in February and May. The Algonquin Indians equally believe that ghosts eat and drink food placed before them ; and such offerings were found in th e dolmen cemeteries of Guernsey. Among Esthonians, morsels are thrown under the table for souls to eat. Spaniards still offer bread and wine on the tombs of those they have loved, at the anniversary of the death. In Russia a table is spread for beggars, as well as one for the friends and for the priests who perform the funeral rites, and the feast is repeated on the 9th, 20th, and 40th day after death.

The Mazdeans of Persia held annual feasts for deceased relatives, as do Slav s in springtime, and Bulgarians on Palm Sunday. The Russians, on “ Parents’ day ” wail for the dead ; and, spreading a handkerchief on the grave, set out gingerbread, eggs, curd tarts, and vodka, sipping the spirit in memory. In Italy, on “ All Souls’ ” Eve, the children receive skulls and skeletons made of sugar and paste. In the Tyrol melted fat is burned on the hearth as a “ soul light,” and cakes are left on the table for ghosts. The Barri in China (according to Father Cris tofero) consider that the dead require splendid feasts several times in the year, and they wait long for the arrival of the dead guest. The missionaries were here told that the souls of the dead feed on the substance, and leave in the dishes “ the accidents which the corporeal senses perceive.” The Jesuit father adds that, as they hold this belief, “ it will not be very dif fi cult to prove to them the my stery of the Eucharist ” (see Secular Thought , October 1898). Confucius hims elf upheld the practice of such rites, though he would not disc uss questions as to the future life any more than Buddha would. Sraman. Sanskrit : “ toiler,” a monk or priest who is what some Protestants term a “ worker.” Hence the later form Saman or Shaman (see Samans) : the Greeks called them Samanaioi, or Semnoi.

It was the capital of N. Ayodh ā , or Oudh, divided from S. Oudh—of which the capital was Saket—by the Gogra river. A Raja Sravasta was the 11th in descent from Surya the sun, before the time of R ā ma (Genl. Cunningham, Geog. of India .) according to the Vishnu Pur ā na. The Vayu Pur ā na says that R ā ma assigned the city to his son Lava. It was the capital of King Pr ā -sen-ajit, son of Mah ā -Kus ā la, both of whom were friends of Buddha. They appear to have been suzerains of the State of Kapila-vast ū ruled by Buddha’s father, subordinate however to the M ā gadha emperors down to 320 B . C . Hiuen Tsang, in 635 A . C ., found several thousand monks near the ruins of the palace of Pr ā -sen-ajit. General Cunning- ham states that this pilgrim’s account of the size of the city agrees with that of the ruins of Sahet-mahet, on the south bank of the Rapti river ; and he here found a gigantic statue of Buddha, with the name Sr ā vasti inscribed on it, which sets at rest the question of the site ( Geog. of India , pp. 407-414 ; Imp. Gazetteer of India , viii, 107- 112). We have twice visited the ruins, which lie ten miles from Balr ā m-p ū r, in the Gonda district of Oudh. The principality appears to have included the districts of Baraitch and Kheri, bounded by the Gogra S. and W., by the Him ā layas on N., and by the Gandak river on E. In Buddha’s time it was one of the six kingdoms of N. and Central India (Hardy, Manual of Buddhism , pp. 283, 284). Sudatta, the prime minister of Buddha’s convert and relative Pra-sen-ajit, prob- ably built the great Jeta-vana monastery, which was a Buddhist centre for twelve centuries. One of the three chief sects of Kanishka’s council came thence. It stood 1200 paces outside the S. gate of Sr ā vasti, in a park which Buddha used to inhabit. The king is said, in his absence, to have erected a great image of Gotama, which—according to the legend—bowed to him on his return : it became the type for other statues of the master, who however left the Jeta-vana for a smaller monastery. The image was unscathed when the Jeta-vana was burnt, and the building was at once restored. Fa-hien speaks of the monastery of Mah ā -prajapati, the fi rst woman convert to Buddhism, at this city ; but there were in his time (400 A . C .) 90 sects holding erroneous views ; these were howe ver all monks and ascetiks. On either side of the E. gate of Sravasti, Ā s ō ka set up stone pillars 70 feet high ; and another stupa marked the traditional site where the woman who slandered Buddha was killed by a Br ā hmach ā ri ; while a third was on the spot where Devadatta went down to hell when he tried to poison Gotama.

The school developed out of that of the Cynics (see Cynics). The leading Stoik in Athens about 300 B . C . was Zeno, a rich merchant from Syria, who lived to a great age (see Essenes). Kleanth ē s suc- ceeded him when he died in 262 B . C . He regarded virtue as the “ chief good,” saying that “ it was both honest and pro fi table, but if followed for the sake of pro fi t it ceased to. be virtue.” He considered that “ he only could be virtuous who lived in harmony with nature,” but this was a doctrine easily abused. The Stoik was unconcerned with specu- lations like those of the Epikureans, regarding them as unpro fi table. He spoke only of virtue, and said that sickness and adversity leave the good man unmoved : he is a king, and a god, among men. The greatest of the Stoiks was the great Emperor Marcus Aurelius (160- 180 A . C .), who died at the age of 59, and was adored with the household gods, while some declared that he appeared to them after death in visions (see Religion). The human sympathy of Aurelius was however not always characteristic of Stoiks. He used to say : “ Do not take your whole life in your head at one time, nor burden yourself with the weight of the future, nor form an image of all possible, or probable misfortunes. . . . Remember that neither what is past, nor what is to come, need af fl ict you, for you have only to deal with the present . . . and this (anxiety) is strangely lessened if you think of it singly and by itself ” ( Meditations ). The same advice was given by Christ when he said “ be not anxious for the morrow.” The Stoiks believed that every great and good man is divinely inspired, and can often foretell the future correctly ; but this was a departure from practical teaching which led to many errors, and they often failed to appreciate actual knowledge and science. The in fl uence of the Stoiks—though condemned by such a writer as Ter- tullian—favoured the spread of early Christianity in Italy. But Renan says that “ Stoiks mastered and reformed the empire, and presided over one of the fairest centuries of human history . . . whereas Christians, who mastered it from th e time of Constantine, achieved its ruin ” (Les Apôtres , p. 344). Mommsen considers it more than doubtful whether the countries consti tuting the empire are as wisely governed now as they were under Severus and Antoninus Pius, in the days of the Stoiks. Many Stoiks believed in ancient wonders and oracles, though they smiled at those asserted to exist in their own times. Some even said that “ miracles prove there are gods, as medicine proves there are doctors ” : “ Surely we are not so vain as to think there is no being superior to man, especially when we see many things we do not under-"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"Stoiks 354 stand. . . . When we see a house, but know not the builder, we still know it was not built for him : how much more so when we see an universe with such wondrous agents in its parts ?” This is the old argument from design (see Agnostik s, Design, Materialism). Zeno thought that the round world might be a living, thinking being : “ that which reasons is preferable to that wh ich does not ; so if the world, or universe, is preferable to all things it too must reason. . . . It produces living and wise things, and is theref ore living and wise ; and, being the greatest giver of life and wisdom, this world must be a god.” The intelligence of the world he called Pr onoia or “ providence ”; but Zeno lacked the logical clearness of Aristotle : Stoikism was in its infancy in his time, but it grew in wisdom and stature like all things which have life or reality in them. Zeno, Kleanth ē s, and Krusippos, were a triad of great masters, but the teaching became gradually less dogmatic, down to the later days of the scienti fi c Stoik Poseid ō nios about 135 to 64 B . C . The Rev. Professor Bruce ( Gifford Lect ., 1897-1898) recognises an eastern element in early Stoik teaching which he regards as Semitic —an apathy which is more characteristic of Asia than of Europe. It was not merely the pursuit of virt ue, but indifference to all earthly ambitions. Stoiks said that “ happiness arises from the inward state of the heart, not from the outwar d lot : therefore should the Stoik treat as insigni fi cant the outward ills of life.” The cultured Seneca, and the pious Epictetus, argued that troubles and miseries are sent by God, and are necessary—as he has free-will—to chasten, and to perfect man. But these views have always proved a poor consolation to the af fl icted, however much they may tend to justify the deity. The true Stoik did not speculate on the future. Unlike Sokrat ē s he saw no objection to taking his ow n life ; and both Zeno and Kleanth ē s are said to have so done. Seneca said : “ If you do not wish to fi ght you can fl ee.” Epictetus said : “ God has opened the door, when things do not please you go out, and do not complain.” Marcus Aurelius said : “ If the room smokes I leave it.” But the brave Sokrat ē s said that the soldier must no t desert his post. The Stoik was a founder of Roman civilisation, and a teacher of morality whose doctrine gave stability to the empi re. Without this teaching Chris- tianity, which began by teaching St oik doctrines, such as those of the brotherhood of man, and of resignation in trouble, would not have emerged as the historical result of the great movements of thought in the fi rst and second centuries of our er a.

Horace speaks of the stola as the effeminate robe of a voluptuary.

Stones. See Dolmen, Galeed, Gilgal, Makka, Menhir. Under this head are included : (1) natural objects ; (2) erect stones ; (3) stone tables and chambers ; (4) ston e circles. These are of great im- portance in connection with the ear liest religions of pre-historic, and uncivilised, man. Such “ rude-stone monuments ” are found all over the world, but are especially numerou s in India, W. Asia, Europe, and N. Africa ; the most famous examples being those of Moab, Tripoli —in N. Africa—Bretagne in France, Ireland, and Norway. These have been noticed in various articles (see Subject Index). The fi rst stage was that of the worship of natural objects, such as rocks, stones, caves, trees, springs, or rivers. The arti fi cial symbol—the erect stone —came later ; and to the present day millions regard a natural peak, or rock, as more sacred than any monumental stone or image (see Lingam). Early pietists were very dif fi dent in worshiping the work of their own hands. The idea of setting up a stone, or stones in a circle or heap, seemed to them a rejection of the great natural crea- tions of the Unseen One. So Moses is represented to have been commanded concerning an altar : “ thou shalt not build it of hewn stone, for if thou lift up thy tool upon it thou hast polluted it ” (Exod. xx, 25). Such an altar was accompanied by twelve stones representing the tribes (Exod. xxiv, 4) at Sinai, as well as at Gilgal (Josh. iv, 20), where they formed a rude-stone circle. It was a decided advance even to scratch solar symbols on such stones, or. to suppose that the gods would leave their hills, groves, or waters to dwell in structures reared by man. Hence such shrines must be placed where gods were known to be already dwellin g. Even Isaiah speaks of his God as the S ̣ ū r ’Aulam ī m , or “ Rock of Ages ” (xxvi, 4), and the name S ̣ ū r , or “ rock,” is one of the commonest titles of Yahveh in early Hebrew songs and psalms.

It was long before savage man attempted any such carvings. The stones themselves were alive (s ee Bethel), and the natives of the Torres Straits, and of Fiji, believe d that godesses brought forth sacred stones, and that stones themse lves could beget others (see Journal Anthrop. Instit ., Feb. 1890, p. 322). Miss Gordon Cumming ( Fire Fountains , i, p. 40) says that “ the sacred sympathetic black stone of Bau never failed to give birth to a little stone when a chieftainess of high degree became a mother ” ; and that the sacred stones are as dear to Fijians as a doll to a child. “ They are robed in feathers—miracu- lously so—and, when new gods are thought necessary, the . . . deities are wrapped up together in a piece of tappa, and after a time this is unwound, when lo ! a baby stone is found.” This gradually grows in stature and divinity, as offerings ar e presented to it, such as arrow- heads, nails, or bones. The stone heaps equally grow in time, as stones are added, resembling the Galeed of Jacob, or the great heaps of the valley of Mena near Makka. Tribes like the non-Aryan Tharus, and Bogshas, of upper India, place a vertical stone, or pole, on a mound before each house (see Mr Vaux, Journal Rl. Asiatic Socy ., July 1885 ; and Calcutta Review , Jan. 1885). Stones, like trees and other objects, symbolised strength, power, vitality, and all qualities prized by man in his early days. It is incorrect to speak of Yahveh as a “ mere fetish stone ” (Mr Grant AlIen, Fortnightly Review , Jan. 1890) for, as Mr A. Laing said in reply (March 1890), the history of relig ions would thus be a blank. The stone was the symbol of an idea (see Rivers of Life , ii, pp. 531- 535). The god existed before the imag e. Nor is it correct to regard such stones as merely monuments of the dead, or head-stones of graves, though the spirit of an ancestor often dwelt in a stone. The Greeks burned the dead, the Persians expose d corpses to dogs and birds, the Egyptians made mummies, the Scythians even, according to Lucian, ate the deceased. In none of these cases were head-stones to graves in use, yet in all there were sacred stones and circles, such as are common all over the world (see Khasis ). The Hebrew Eben-’ezer, or “ stone of help,” was not funereal any more than that of Bethel. Hebrews, Phœnicians, Babylonians, and Akkadians, buried in deep rocky shafts, or other graves ; but none of them would build a shrine in a place de fi led by graves. Gudea, as early as 2800 B . C .

In Hawaii corpses are hidden in caves, but the bo nes of chiefs, regarded as charms, are ground to powder and eaten. These savages call the sacred stones “ great fathers,” because they are emblems of reproduction, and not because they are regarded as ancestors. Stone emblems are equally common among the Red Indians of America. Here also they have been wrongly regarded as symbols of “ ancestor worship,” instead of symbols of generation (see Leslie’s Illustrated Journal , New York, 22nd Jan. 1887). A photograph represents a historic scene in Dakota, at the “ Standing Rock Agency.” In this we see the Sioux chief Fire-Cloud, dedicating the “ Sacred Standing Rock of Peace and Plenty ”—an ancient lingam set up on a stepped pedestal. It had been often moved from one place to another, but its fi nal station was fi xed by the government of the State, in a manner which would have roused the wrath of our Churches, if any Indian administrator had vent ured thus to recognise a native lingam. The whites feared that\" it was losing its civilising and pacifying in fl uence on the Indians. . . . In order that it might be preserved as the sacred idol of the tribe, Major M’Laughlin the United States’ agent agreed with the leading chiefs to place it on a pedestal, veiled ; and on a given day, with pr ayers and thanksgiving, to unveil it to the sun god ; and that ever after it should remain unmolested, and protected. This was done on 27th November 1886 ; the chiefs and their families, followed by the entire Indian population—over 5000— fi led with reverential tread to th e holy spot. Here for several hours they sat in council, discussing the history of the holy symbol ; and showed much uneasiness as to who should be honoured with the duty of offering up prayers, and anointing it. All agreed that no sinful person, but only the purest of the tribe, could perform the sacred rites, lest the stone should lose some of its virtues. By the decision of 100 chiefs Fire-Cloud, of Fire-H eart’s band, was chosen ; but no Indian would remove the veil, and this was done by the United States’ representative, who thereupon addre ssed the tribes, describing how and why the Government had interfered, namely because the historic “ rock ” was so sacred, and so often disturbed, that it was now fi xed, and dedicated to the Great Spirit, to be guarded forever from the hands of sinful men, and preserved to the Indians’ children’s children, until all had reached the Happy Hunting Grounds, beyond the dark river. Then Fire-Cloud stepped forward, and anointed the stone with a paint brush, which he swung about, praying for peace, the puri fi cation of the Indian heart, forgiveness of sins and tran sgressions, abundance of rain and corn. He wound up by vowing to the Great Spirit that the Sioux"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"Stones 358 tribes would forever protect the holy standing stone. . . . Then, with a few mystical wavings of the anointing brush, the people uprose, and returned to their homes with uplif ted hands, chanting to the Great Spirit, and keeping time in the conv entional Indian heel-and-toe dance.” The stone was 5 feet high, and (as commonly done in India) was said to have originally stood on its smaller end. Among the Black-foot Indians of N.W. Canada we fi nd sacred standing, and also sacri fi cial, stones, just as they are found in the “ high places ” (see Bamoth) of Eastern Palestine. The Black-foots say that their rites have been handed down from pre-historic Talaks and Nahuans. The Government Inspector (see Journal Anthrop. Instit ., Nov. 1885) says that “ blood is still smeared on these stones, drawn from the bodies of the worshipe rs : that the deity is Tohil, the morning star, who came from the far North ”—perhaps from N.E. Asia. The sacred number of these Indians is seven; they have 7 high gods, connected with 7 high hills, one rising 200 feet, like a pyramid, from the plain of the Red Deer river, and called the “ hill of the blood sacri fi ce.” On its summit is an enormous circular stone—like the Mensef Abu Zeid (“ dish of Abu Zeid ”) described by Col. Conder in the Jordan valley, and compared with other Arab altars on which camels were sacri fi ced ; or like others in India, and Polynesia. This Canadian example has long puzzled archreologists. It is 14 feet in circumference and 15 inches thick ; on its surface (as described by M. J. l’Heureux, plate vii, p. 161) is marked a crescent having above it a star, and a “ sceptre ” or phallus ; a double border of stars surrounds these emblems. It is clearly a sacri fi cial stone, and we have met with many such, on which were cup hollows , dots, circles, representations of the sun and moon. They may not be moved ; but to rub against them is a cure for barrenness, just as Syrians laid themselves on the basalt stones of Hamath (carved with sacred Hittite votive texts) to cure many ailments. Thus throughout the world we fi nd stone phalli, sacri fi cial stones, and circles, where sacred rites are performed, and which are smeared with blood, or anointed with oil and milk. Pausanias ( Boi ō tia , 192) says that : “ the stone circle is with the Thebans the sacred serpent’s head,” and such sh rines we have equally visited in Scotland, or among the Bh ī l mountains in India (see Rivers of Life , i, p. 91).

A few of the leading examples of Keltik monuments personally examined by the author may here be noticed. In the Orkneys a famous group of such remains exists, on either side of the narrow isthmus separating Loch Stennes, and Loch Har ē , the latter to the north (see Rivers of Life , i, pp. 238, 290, plate vii.). Our compass sketch was suf fi cient to mark the topography. The rocky margins of the sacred lakes are backed by shining fi elds, and moorlands, with a full view of the triple peaked Hoy, or “ sacred island,” behind which sinks the midsummer sun. Close to the isthmus, on the east, are the stones of Stennes circle, and the two outlying Odin stones, through one of which men and maids, or allies, joined. hands swearing oaths. The parish church is to the N.E. in the line to the great sepulchral chamber of Mæs How, supposed by Mr Fergusson to be a Skandinavian monument. Another stone circle , also with an outer pointer stone (now fallen) on the N.E. (the line of the midsummer sunrise) exists immediately W. of the isthmus, and further west are variou s “ hows ” (barrows or “ hollow ” mounds) with the great “ Ring of Brogar,” a circle in line due W. of Mæs How. The swampy and unhe althy spot was reconsecrated by a new faith when the Christian church was built on the site of an ancient N.E. “ pointer stone,” as Mr A. L. Lewis (see Journal Anthrop. Instit ., May 1886, Nov. 1892) has shown, in the line of the midsummer sunrise from the centre of the eastern circle. Mr J. Fergusson ( Rude-Stone Monuments ) regards the surrounding “ hows ” as being all of them sepulchres of a later race, who found the sacred circles already in existence. The carved tracery in Mæs How is of Norse style. Brogar circle is evidently later than those at the isthmus ; it covers 2 2 1 acres, being 366 feet in diameter. The mound and ditch surround stones 7 to 15 feet high, and the interior—as at Arbor Low—is reached by a level causeway over the ditch. Mæs How signi fi es the “ great mound ” and it is now about 38 feet high and 100 feet in di ameter at the base. No doubt the Jarls, or Earls, and other mediæv al chiefs, sought to be buried at an ancient sacred spot, and placed their treasures in the “ how ” chambers, and scratched their undeciphered runes on the walls. This “ how ” is said to be mentioned in an Icelandic saga. The spot is thought to be haunted by “ Haug lads,” or evil spirits.

Each circle has pointer stones E. and W. of the centre, and outside, these being 7 to 11 feet high, and 10 to 15 feet in cir- cumference. The circles thus appear to have been used—perhaps, as at Stennes, in later days—for the entombment of chiefs. And here also a Christian oratory has been found, at the W. end of the group, as also at Fodart or at Dalcross. The Dalcross Mut Hills (or places of assembly for the tribes), with their tumuli, are a few miles N.E. of Dalcross Castle. The parish church stands E. of the principal mound. Three miles S.E. of Inverness, below Leys Castle , is the small Leys stone circle surrounded by a grove. It is remarkable for its double ring of stones, which are of great size, its central altar, and its great “ pointer ” outside the circle on the west: this is 10 feet high. A farmhouse on the E. is said to have used up a second “ pointer ” in that direction, as we1l as se veral stones from the circles. The Fodart Stones lie due E. and W. of the parish church of Fodart, near Strathpeffer in Ross-shire. They are said to have been brought there by gods or demons, just as the “ giant stones ” in N. Donegal are said to have been hurled by giants. The W. stone at Fodart is a “ covenant ” stone, where oaths were sworn : it has on its side two well marked cup hollows—like those found in Moabite standing stones at ’Amm ā n by Col. Conder in 1881. These cups are on the E. and W. faces of the stone, 2 feet from the ground, and they are (i to 10 inches deep, and twice this in diameter. The church seems to occupy the site of some ancient circle between these “ pointer ” stones, which are said to have been worshiped within the memory of living persons, though they are now hard to fi nd in dense shrubbery. The site lies in the centre of a rich valley, at the junction of two streams which, as the Peffer, fl ow into Cromarty Firth. It nestles at the base of Ben Wyvis, the “ Hill of Storms,” N. of the Pictish fort on Knock Farl, at the seaward end of the long fi r-clad range of the Cat’s Back. Many strange legends cling to the hills and lakes, where sacred stones, and tumuli, are numerous. One of the many islets of Loch Ousie, at the foot of Knock Farl, has a magic “ wishing stone,” where wishes are made, and vows paid. Further up the Strathpeffer valley, at the foot of the spurs, in the grounds of Castle Leod, there was another mysterious stone ; and one at Klach-tionda (“ the"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"Stones 361 stone of turning ”), with yet another called the Munro (or Muro) stone on which an eagle is rudely scratched, with the sun, moon, and lily (see Rivers of Life , ii, p. 261, fi g. 253). Muro is a word attached to such stones as far as Shapinshay in Orkney. In the pass leading to Ben Wyvis is a remarkable stone covered with cup, and other, markings, and throughout the district, according to guide-books, are found “ wh orls, sling-balls, barley stones, fl int weapons, and tumuli.” The “ barley stone ” is a Yoni emblem, just as barley is a female symbol in the Arabian Nights Tales. The Clach-na-cuddin is the “ city stone ” of Inverness, which we carefully examined in its recent si te. It was sacred to Scots and Picts alike, both of whom called themselves its sons. The word Cuddin had a female signi fi cance according to the Rev. N. M’Alpine ( Gaelic Dict .), but it is now only a battered fragment, built into the façade of the City Chambers of Inverness, and parted from that “ sacred apple tree,” where lovers used to plight their vows. In this old Highland capital we found the “ hand ” still carved over the main doorway of the new Episcopal church (see Hand). Turning S. towards Lindores Abbey we found the Mugdrum shaft on Tayside, in a pretty garden in Fife (see Rivers of Life , i, p. 444, fi g. 173; ii, p. 231, fi g. 244, Polynesian Stones) ; it is singular ly like some Polynesian examples. Yet Mugdrum was a “ station of the Cross ” on the pilgrim route to Lindores, in a wooded headland by the river near Newburgh. The Lindores stone (close to the village ) is on the roadside by the abbey, and here the village maids and youths murmured their wishes (see Mr Lang, Lindores Abbey , 1876). The region abounds also with “ swearing wells ” ; and among other “ wishing stones ” (p. 164) was the slender shaft, 9 inches in diameter and 8 feet high, which stood before the ancient church of Newburgh. The great crag above is topped by a Pictish “ vitri fi ed fort ” ; and a serpent mound (see Serpent) occurs here (p. 323), as at Loch Nell, the eyes and scales being very distinctly marked. In this district the “ Coucher’s Knowe ” was a lair for the Keltik guardians of the sanctuary of Cross Macduff (according to Sir J. Skene), and it included nine sacred wells (pp. 329, 349). Sir Walter Scott says that there was an inscription “ on the Macduff cross, which could not be read in his days ; and whoever worshiped here heard words spoken to him, and saw strange visions.” The Loch Nell menhirs, near Oban ( Rivers of Life , i, p. 288), stand on a knoll at the narrow mouth of Glen Lonain, not far from the famous serpent mound, apostrophised by our friend Prof. Blackie. This region also is full of “ Druid ” monuments, with strange hiero-"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"Stones 362 glyphs, cup marks, Thor's hammers (or Svastikas), roses, and suns (Dr Angus Smith, Loch Etive ). England and Wales, however, contain many similar remains, such as “ Long Meg and her daughters ” in Cumberland, which we sketched in 1881. Tradition says that they were pagan witches, turned to stone by a saint as they danced—a common legend—and hard by is a “ wishing well ” (see Rivers of Life , ii, p. 284). This shrine is at Kirk-as-Wold, near Salkeld, or 7 2 1 miles N.E. of Penrith, also famous for its circle. The oval measures 360 ft. E. and W., by 300 ft. N. and S. “ Long Meg ” is the great “ pointer ” stone on the S.W.; and a line thence through the centre of the circle cuts a large N.E. menhir, placed in the direction of the midsummer sunrise. The line, if prod uced, cuts the peaks of Skiddaw. Long Meg is 250 ft. from the centre, and 80 ft. from the circum- ference of the ring ; it weig hs some 20 tons, being 13 ft. high, and said to be sunk 6 ft. into the ground ; the base is 15 ft. round, and the stone is of a kind which cannot, it is said, be found elsewhere within 30 miles. Mr Lewis ( Journal Anthrop. Instit ., May 1886), has written fully of this monument, and on those of Swines-head, and Keswick circle, not far off. We have described the latter ( Rivers of Life , ii, p. 236), and Mr Lewis sees no reason to believe it to be sepulchral. The rays of the rising sun struck on it from a triple summit, as they fall on the Hoare Stone, in Shropshire, from Pen-maen-maur (“ the hilltop of the great stone ”) ; or as the triple summit of the Eildon hills is the centre connected with sacred circles near. Mr C. W. Dymond has carefully illustrated and described the circles and menhirs of Cumberland and Westmoreland, such as the Gunner Keld circle, near Shap, in the latter county ; or that of Eskdale moor (100 ft . in diameter), with its fi ve enclosed “ barrows ” or mounds ; or the Swinside circle near Broughton, which is 92 ft. in diameter. He also gives a full account ( Somerset Arch. Socy. Journal ) of the important remains at Stanton Drew, about six miles S. of Bristol ; and he elsewhere describes the Cornish circles ; the Madron circle, of “ nine maidens ” (or stones) ; the Boleit of 19 ; the St Buryan, Chun, and Tregeseal circles ; the Men-skrifa (“ inscribed stone ”), the Chun, Lanyon, and Trethevy cromlechs, and the Men-an-tol or “ holed stone.” Mr Rivett Carnac ( Journal Bengal Rl. Asiatic Socy ., 1879) compares the stone monuments of India, such as the Kam ā on lingams in the Him ā layas, with those of Europe and Africa, and describes the monoliths on the snowy heights of Pandakati, 5000 feet above the sea, to which childless wives made pilgrimages. The Penrith, or Mayburgh, circle presents a central monolith"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"Stones 363 by a sacred tree ; and due W. of th is is the Arthur’s Table (see Arthur). The Calder (or “ caldron ”) stones stand on a moor four miles from Liverpool ; the circle is 23 feet in diameter, with stones 2 2 1 to 6 feet high ; many of these have cup markings, connected by ducts for the libations poured on the stone ; there are no less than 36 near the base of the largest stone. No sepulchral remains exist here, and the whole “ had a purely religious signi fi cance ” ( Liverpool Arch. Assoc ., August 1887). Sir J. Picton derives the name Calder from the Anglo-Saxon Galdor for “ sorcery.” Mr A. L. Lewis has made specially valuable researches regard ing the astronomy of the subject ( Journal Anthrop. Instit ., November 1882), studying all the examples he could visit within 200 miles of London. He found the “ pointer ” stones outside circles to be, in 15 cases, directed (from the centre of the circle) towards sunrise on the longest day of the year, or towards the N.E. ; in seven cases to sunrise at the winter solstice, in six cases towards the winter sols tice sunset, in two cases due west, in three due east, and in four cases due south. In all instances they served to measure the length of the solar year, as notably at Stone- henge. A letter quoted by this writer was penned by the Rev. Dr Garden, professor of Theology at Aberdeen (1681 to 1700), and shows that such monuments were, in his time, still regarded as having been places of worship and sacri fi ce. “ Holed stones ” have ever been regarded as charms, and the Cornish Men-an-tol, like the Odin ston e, is pierced in this manner, and stands between two other stones in a line bearing S.E. and N.W. Persons still secretly perambulate these, or push their limbs through the hole to cure disease : others w ill lie all night with head or feet tied to such lingams. Thus in India men crawl under the carved elephant of Indra, or the boar of Vishnu. Mr Mould saw a sailor at Weymouth tying a holed stone to the prow of his craft as a charm ; and holed stones are used in the Sc illy Islands as “ betrothal stones,” the pair clasping hands through a block of granite ; while the “ healing stone ” of the Madron group is calle d the “ creeping stone,” as the sick crawl through it (see English Folk-Lore , 1884, p. 25). Mr Elsworthy mentions many “ holed stones and holy fl ints ” in Somerset and Dorset, as well as near Amal fi in S. Italy. Col. W. Martin ( Pagan Ireland , 1895) speaks of holed stones all over Ireland, some holes being 2 or 3 ft. wide, some only large enough to admit a fi nger. Peasants are wont to “ pass through holes in rock s ” near Ennis in Clare, and e]se- where. In a Cambridge print ( The Scouring of the White Horse , p. 105) a stone with some curious holes in it is noticed as still extant at Uf fi ngton in 1859. It was under an oak tree before the inn ; each"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"Stones 364 hole was covered with a piece of wood secured by a chain and padlock. These being removed young men, and their sweethearts, stooping down blew into the holes, which made a “ dull moaning sound ” from which certain auguries were derived. Women and fl ocks were also supposed to be protected by charms called “ mothering stones,” or “ breeding stones,” which were conglomerates, or puddingstones, believed—just as we have seen to be credited in Poly nesia—to be capable of developing pebbles into boulders. The Rev. Dr Isaac Taylor found one in Essex : “ a water-worn block of sandstone which . . . had a pebble within it as big as an acorn,” which be was assured by a peasant might be removed, “ when the mother stone would at once . . . incubate another ” ( Notes and Queries , 22nd June 1895 ; Leicester County Folk-Lore , 1895, i, p. 63). Other stones are used for healing, as at Christ Church in Monmouthshire, wh ere the “ Colmer stone ” is found in the chancel. In 1770 more than 16 children were laid on it to be healed, but in 1800 only 6 or 7 : in 1803 Mr Dunovan found a man stretched on it ( Notes and Queries , Nov. 10th, 1900, p. 370). Such customs are now described as “ Folk-Lore,” but represent the religion of the past. Many legends gather round these sacred places ; the “ Boleit Pipers ” st and up some 15 ft. above ground, and we were assured on the spot that they were men “ turned to stone, because they piped to the 19 maidens on Sunday.” They were still secretly visited by youths and gi rls, and libations of milk were offered to them, with dances, songs, and perambulations, by those who there plighted troth. The Logan, or “ rocking,” stones must be noticed in the same connection. .They are naturally or arti fi cially balanced stones on rocks, said to have been placed by giants or demons, and approached with fear by worshipe rs. Rites of circumambulation and sacri fi ce occurred near them, and the toppling over of such a stone presaged dire misfortune, as Lieut. Goldsmith of the Royal Navy found in 1824, when he had overthrown the great Logan rock at Landsend : he was required to replace it, whic h cost him all he possessed, for it weighed 66 tons, being 17 ft. long, and 32ft. in girth. The “ logging ” or “ rocking ” was due to natural wearing away of the exposed corners of the base. The movements of the stone were sup- posed to answer the questions of the worshiper, and to show the acceptance, or denial, of his prayer . We have seen supposed Buddhists so worshiping at Kaiktyo (see Rivers of Life , ii, p. 314). A wealth of literature connected with “ lithology,” or study of rude-stone monuments, has grown up ; and the ancient lingams of Europe are often enshrined in Christian churches, as at Larnaka in Cyprus, or in Spain (see Rivers of Life , plate xv : Athenæum , 15th"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"Stones 365 Sept. 1888). Protestant Kelts have placed sacred stones in their chapels “ for preservation ” ; and Scottish Calvinists still clear the moss and weeds from the old stones of their fathers. Torch proces- sions, and Bel-tein rites, are still re ported to occur at sacred circles, in the Hartz Mountains, and the Apennines, as well as at Braemar. More than 20 years ago we pointed out the relation of the “ pointer ” stone, or “ Friar’s Heel,” at Stonehenge to the “ altar stone ” in the centre of the circle, as deno ting the direction of sunrise on the 21st June, at the summer solstice. The photograph by Mr Barker, taken at 3.45 A . M . on that day in 1891, is described in the English Mechanic (10th July 1891), where Mr Barker says that there can now be “ no further room for doubt as to the special orientation of the sentinel stone.” The photograph shows the sun risen about 4 3 of the disk, and behind the top of the “ pointer ” stone, not quite centrally but a little towards the right. [Various attempts have been made to calculate the age of Stonehenge, from a change in the angle of the ecliptic (about 12 minutes in 1400 years) in this connection ; but the results are discordant, varying between 500 A . C . and 1680 B . C ., the latter being the conclusion of Sir Norman Lockyer, and Mr F. O. Penrose, F.R.S. The editor, having examined Stone- henge, was led to conclude that the great tri-lithons could not be very early examples of such monuments. They are hewn blocks ; and the “ stone hinges,” whence the monument is named, are stone “ dowels,” fi tting into corresponding hollows, to keep the capstones in place— this represents a considerable advanc e on other rude-stone monuments. The surrounding circular trench is evidently late, since British tombs were destroyed in digging it. Th e inner “ horseshoe ” of “ blue stones,” which has its opening towards the “ pointer,” might no doubt be older. The outer Sarsen blocks of grit were brought from a distance ; and the three which fell in 1797 weighed together 70 tons. This supposes considerable mechanical appliances on the part of the architects. There can be no doubt of the intention with which the “ pointer ” was erected ; but the ca lculation of date is beset with dif fi culty : for the altar-stone in the ho rseshoe is not the centre of the circle ; and the Friar’s Heel itself is not perfectly perpendicular. Admitting that the observation is correct, a settlement in the founda- tion of the pointer—such as co mmonly occurs in such monuments— makes the exactness of the line somewhat doubtful.—E D .] The original monument has been supposed to date from about 400 B . C . ; but the ancient Druids, who set up the “ pointer ” by eye, to mark the furthest northern line of sunrise, may possibly have readjusted its position after the Romans left Britain, or about 400 A . C . The photo-"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"Stones 366 graph was well reproduced in France, and an electrotype kindly supplied to the author (see La Nature , 12th Sept. 1891). Stonehenge originally formed a circle 100 ft. in diameter, of 30 monoliths with huge lintel stones. Some of the uprights have in them holes made to receive offeri ngs or libations. Within these Sarsens was a smaller and ruder circle of “ blue stones,” of which few now remain. Within this again the horseshoe consisted of 10 monoliths, forming fi ve great tri-lithons : an inner horseshoe of “ blue stones ” has the altar-stone at the centre of its curve. Thus the ruder circle and horseshoe appear to be each duplicated, and enclosed, by the mighty Sarsen tri-lithons. The whole monument is enclosed in an earthwork 300 ft. in diameter. The line from the altar-stone to the Friar’s Heel, through the axis of the monument and centre of the horseshoe, points to a fairly fl at plateau, behind which the sun rises. The great extent of Salisbury plain round the shrine somewhat dwarfs its effect, and it is only when standing under the monoliths—some 15 ft. high—that the great size of the blocks is appreciated. Only half the outer Sarsen circle remains, the stones that fell in 1900 having been replaced, and those which fell in 1797 being the three forming the western tri-lithon of th e outer horseshoe. The Sarsens were found to extend only some 3 ft. beneath the surface ; and the Friar’s Heel is apparently not more deeply founded. The “ pointer ” stones of such circles as a rule are directed about 50° east of north from the centre of the circle, as the author has noted in his sketch-books on the spot in various cases, and as Mr A. F. Hutchinson has subsequently shown ( Journal Stirling Arch. Socy ., April 1893). The worship of holy stones, rocks, and wells, in Ireland is described in many publications referring to all parts of the island. The custom of “ passing through ” holes in such rocks and stones still survives, and is very fully described in 1836 in the case of St Declan’s rock (Mr P. D. Hardy, in the record s of the Royal Irish Arch. Socy.). This rite took place on 23rd Decemb er each year, at Ardmore in the county of Waterford. Thousands of half-naked persons of both sexes then assembled, on the W. shore of Ardmore bay, and 1100 were seen, in 1836, crawling on their faces through the hole, as described by a correspondent of the Roman Catholic Expositor . A reverend gentle- man present stood by and exclaimed : “ O great is their faith.” The rock fl ew over the seas from Rome, bearing the bell for St Declan’s church, and vestments for the saint himself. A human skull, placed on the headstone of his tomb, was venerated as that of this local patron, and to it the people bowed, believing that it watched their penance, and visiting the grave at the conclusion of the ceremonies."},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"Stones 367 The rite can only be accomplished at low tide; and on the saint’s day the accumulated sand is scooped away. The sacred stone rests on little natural pillars of rock. The passage is some 4 ft. long, and the devotee crawling through rises on hi s knees, and strikes his back thrice against the stone. He then walks back over the sharp stones, on his knees which are bare and often bleed ing, and the creeping through is repeated again twice by each person. The bare-kneed women are said to have been even more careless of pain than the men. Nor is this a solitary case, for the pilgrimage to the summit of Croagh Patrick was performed in the same way on bare knees, while yet more severe rites of penance belonged to St Patrick’s purgatory at Lough Derg in Donegal (see Purgatory). On the is le of Howth is the holed stone called “ Finn’s Quoit ” ; and rites of worship attached to a dolmen on the “ Venus Mount ” hard by, the result being certainly (according to the Irish guide) a “ double increas e of family ” (Mr A. L. Lewis, Journal Anthrop. Instit ., November 1879). Mr Lewis also notices many “ ph allic rites ” and traditions, at such sites as that of the “ Druid Stones near Killiney ” under a mountain surmounted by an obelisk : or at “ the Carrick mines in the Druid’s glen, like the Plas Newydd in Anglesea.” He compares the New Grange tumulus, between Navan and Drogheda—the largest domed chamber in lreland—with the chambered tumulus of Gavr- Innis (see Forbes Leslie, Early Races ; Mr Coffey, Tumuli ; and Transactions Rl. Irish Academy , xxx, 1). New Grange, with the Dowth, and Knouth tumuli, is on the N. bank of the Boyne, 6 miles above Drogheda, and these were all plundered by the Danes in our 9th century. New Grange was described in 1699 by Mr Llwyd of the Ashmolean Museum, being a mound 280 ft. in diameter, and 44 ft. high, the chamber stones being 8 to 10 ft. long. Beside this tomb there was a circle of large stones of which only 12 remain. The passage (on the S. E.) is 62ft. long, roofed and walled with large slabs. In the central chamber, which is 20 ft. high, stood a slender stone—a lingam—about 5 or 6 ft. high : and another monolith was erected on the top of the mound. The cups and rings found on such sacred rocks and stones have received much study. They occu r everywhere, and, in Moab, Col. Conder found those on dolmens often connected together by channels. There is no doubt that they were, as they still are, connected with the pouring of libations of blood, milk , and other liquids on the stones. The Rev. A. G. Jones found cup ma rkings in the Kushan hills of Shantung, in N.E. China ( Athenæum , 26th June 1886), where, says Prof. R. K. Douglas, are also “ remarkable sculptures representing"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"Stones 368 mythological ideas unknown in other parts of China, and with a strange resemblance to the sculptures of E gypt and Assyria.” The shrines of Kwan-yin here crown the great granite cone which rises 200 feet above the rest of the mountain : “ it is a wild, awe-inspiring spot, and just the place to favour the rudest worships.” Emperors used once to offer sacri fi ces to the Shin or spirit of this natural lingam. Mr Jones found circular, and hemispherica l, holes on its rocks and stones : and from E. Asia, perhaps, the custom passed on to America : for similar markings occur from the upper reaches of the Red River, in Canada, to the “ cañons ” of Colorado and Rio Grande, and all over Mexico and Peru (see U.S. Geog. Survey , 1881). The cup markings of India, N. America, and Scotland have been compared ( Scottish News , Nov. 1886) : especially those of the Silurian rocks of Wigtown- shire (see also Journal Scot. Ant. Socy . for papers by Sir J. Simpson, and those of Alnwick described by writers on “ Northumberland Stones ” in 1865). Mr Hamilton ( Scotsman , 8th Dec. 1887) compares the “ pre-historic etchings ” of the most rugged parts of the Sierra Nevada, described by F. L. Clarke ( San Francisco Examiner , 6th Nov. 1887), with the cup and ring marks near Howell Farm in Kirkcudbright. The central cup was here chipped out of the rock by some sharp pointed instrument, and in some cases as many as seven concentric circles were carved round it: these markin gs are often covered over by moss or turf. At High Banks farm, Mr Hamilton found 650 separate carvings, in a piece of glaciated rock, measuring only 10 by 6 feet. A central cup, with three concentric rings, was surrounded by 200 smaller cups. Similar carvings o ccur at Balmae, Galtway, Tours, Townhead, Castlecreavie, Gribdae, Senwick and Auchenhay, in the same vicinity. Many also occur el sewhere in “ earthfast rocks ” (see Rivers of Life , i, p. 91), and Mr Rivett Carnac was told, at Kam ā on and elsewhere in India, that such cup and dot markings “ symbolised Siva.” In certain parts of Germany it was customary to bore cup- shaped depressions into the walls of churches, for good luck, or as swearing places. Such a hole occurs in a pillar of St Sophia in Constantinople below a “ red hand,” and it is said to have been made by countless worshipers placing their fi ngers on the spot. The dust from such hollows was used for philtres, and water thence was a febri- fuge. Prof. Desor notices such sy mbols and rites in the Canton Vallais in Switzerland ( Berlin Anthrop. Journal , 1878) : he also speaks of them in the church of Voanas near Bourg, in the French Department of Ain, where the great stone called “ La Pierre de St Loup ” is constantly scraped for such purposes. On other French rude-stone monuments the depression is a “ footprint,” as on the rocks"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"Stones 369 of Bohnslehn in Sweden, the dolmen of Arzon in Morbihan, or the “ Pierre aux Dames ” in Guernsey—an island full of holy stones and of prehistoric tomb chambers (see Foot and Pad). Baron von Hügel ( Travels in Kashmir and Panj ā b ) describes many lingam stones near a sacred well of Isl ā mab ā d, which Mr Aynsley regards as representing an older faith than that of Buddha ; but Guernsey sailors equally doff their hats to “ Le bon homme Andrelot,” a high conical rock on the S.E. promontory. Further information is given by the Rev. R. Munro ( Illustr. London News , 6th Sept. 1890) as to the cup and ri ng marks of Dumbartonshire. At Duntocher, under the turf, one of the circles was 37 inches in diameter. At Bowling, cups with concentric circles also occur on rocks. The “ elfstones,” “ needles, ” “ buttons ” and “ stones of the dead,” in Skandinavia, Switzerland, and Scotland alike, chie fl y belonged to races who were as yet in the stage preceding any know- ledge of metals. Milk, eggs, and other food were placed in such hollows at certain seasons ; and in Prussia sterility and disease were believed to be so cured. In Sweden the custom of pouring milk libations into the cup hollows in rocks is said to be still extant. The worship of stones was forbidden in the 6th century by the Council of Tours, and by the Archbishop of Canterbury ; in the 7th by the Council of Nantes ; in the 10th by the Saxon king Edgar ; and in the 11th by the Danish Canute ; yet it continued more or less till the 17th century in various parts of Europe, while in the British Isles sacri fi ces and dances, at famous Menhi rs, were customary even down to the 19th century. In the Edda we read of oaths taken before “ the sacred white stone.” At Tromsöe, in Finmark, a bishop threw such a stone into the river, because the people persisted in adoring it : another, in the island of Daumöe, near Heligoland, was venerated on the summit of a sacred mountain. Ovate stones in India are emblems of P ā rvati, and we have found them buried in tumuli in Afghanist ā n. Bishop Shöning in Norway, in the 18th century, spoke of two stones with a rounded, and a convex top respectively, at the farm of Qualset, in the Telemarken district. They were much revered, placed on “ seats of honour,” “ bathed regularly with milk and butter, and at Christmas watered with fresh beer.” M. du Chaillu has described such remains all over Norway. Mr Aynsley fi gures another sacred stone, at Pont l’Abbé in Brittany, which is 10 feet high—a conical monolith 4 feet in diameter at th e base and 18 inches at the apex, said to be engraved with fi gures of Hercules, Mercury, Mars, Venus, and Adonis. Others stand in the churchyards of St Martin in Guern- sey, and of Catel, the latter having once been placed in the chancel."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"Stones 370 These—like the rude hermai of Greece or of Tartary—have bosses like breasts on the sides. Even the polished “ celts,” or stone axes, are used as phallic emblems set on end under sacred trees, as Mr Rivett Carnac remarks (see Man). The Romans also swore by their “ stone Jove,” and seven sacred stones are said to have surrounded an ancient temple at Erech in the S. of Babylonia. Another class of such stones, best known in Britain, are the “ city stones ” which are the central lingams in towns (see Rood). Mr J. R. AlIen gives a long list of th e sculptured stones of this kind in Scotland (see Scot. Antiq. Socy. Proc ., 1889-1890). London, too, like Makka, had its “ black stone ” mentioned in a popular sketch by Mr Grant AlIen ( Longman’s Mag ., Feb. 1891). It still remains, protected by an iron grille in a ni che of the wall of St Within’s Church in Canon Street. It once stood opposite, where the great station is now built, beside the old highway of Watling Street, close to the Roman Wall. It belonged to the old Folk-mote, or place of assembly and justice ; and, during Jack Cade’s rebellion of 1450, Mortimer touched this stone with his sword saying “ Now is Mortimer lord of this city.” At Bovey Tracey on Dartmoor every new mayor must ride round the city stone, an d must touch it respectfully with hand, or wand of of fi ce, after which youths and maidens used to kiss it, and perhaps still do so (see Danda). Mr Ellis ( Village Communities ), and Mr G. L. Gomme, have shown that all early peoples erected such a stone when founding a new town, and of fi cials in various parts of Europe must still make offerings at such stones once or more times in the year (see London and Middlesex Arch. Journal , v, p. 282 ; Indian Antiq ., ii, p. 66 ; Biddulph, Tribes of Hindu-Kush ; Forbes Leslie, Early Races ). Mr Loftie supposes the London stone to have been in the heart of the Roman citadel, and it was regarded as a mile-stone because all distances were thence measured. It remained an honoured palladium in the Middle Ages, like its rival the coronation stone of Westminster, and the fi rst mayor was named “ Henry of London Stone,” being of necessity “ of the Parish of St Within, and Valley of Wall-brooke,” as a true guardian of the sacred emblem. It was also a “ wishing stone,” and men and maids plighted troth thereat, and walked or danced round it. As London extended it included other such stones : for each market town had its central symbol (see Leland’s Collecteanea , 1770, p. 76). Such was the sacred post of Billingsgate, which all men used to salute, and wh ich heavily laden porters touched : according to Bagford an image had once stood here. “ St Paul’s Stump ” (Brand, Pop. Antiq ., see Notes and Queries , 3rd December 1892) was so called as late as 1715, and became St Paul’s Cross in the"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"Stones 371 N.E. corner of St Paul's Churchya rd. It was famous in Reformation history, and the base was uncovered in 1887 (see Mr J. B. Marsh, St Paul’s Cross ). Here, as early as 1191, William Fitz-Osbert dared to say “ that kings had no divine right to govern wrongly.” In 1529 youths were here sworn subjects befo re the mayor and magistrates. The ancient symbol was stricken by lightning early in the 15th century ; but, restored by the bishop, it continued to be the centre of London life till razed to the ground by Puritans in 1644. In 1852 another stone, with a runic text and a Norse design of interlaced animals, was found on the S. side of St Paul’s (Prof. Westwood, Rl. Arch. Socy ., 4th Feb. 1853) : it was then built into the wall above the spot where it stood ( Notes and Queries , 6th April 1901, p. 269). The city stone of Exeter was in th e centre of the Green at Kiston, and “ to it a bull is still tied on the annual fair-day, and baited by bulldogs ” ( Athenæum , 28th Aug. 1891). The “ treaty stone ” of Limerick, and that before the Town Hall of Inverness, are examples of city stones. Observant travelle rs constantly remark on the simi- larities of such monuments in different parts of the world. Their antiquity is often shown by the changes which have occurred since they were erected, as at Erlanik ne ar Vannes, in the Gulf of Morbihan, where the sacred circles are now submerged, near the great tumulus of Gavr-Innis, by Pen-be (“ the head of the tomb ”), and the broken obelisk 60 ft. high, or the pillar 42 ft. high at Plouarzel (see Sketch , 12th July 1899). The Breton remains indeed, as described in this newspaper, are more wonderful than those of Britain. They survive among the heath lands of the Morbihan district, including splendid examples of menhirs, dolmens, circles, tumuli, and “ alignments,” or long rows of memorial stones, sllch as Colonel Conder also found at El Mareighat (“ the smeared ” stones) in Moab. They include the Géant de Kerclerf, an obelisk 20 ft . high, and the three groups of Le Mennec (“ stones ”), Kerm ario, and Kerlescant. The fi rst has eight lines of stones, and the others have three each. These Carnac examples are illustrated by those of Hardwar in Upper India ; and they indicate the presence of pilgrims whose sepa rate memorial stones were thus arranged. Local legends speak of them as impious dancers turned to stone, and Breton childless wives still touch the Géant de Kerderf, while offerings of fruit and fl owers are laid at the foot of other menhirs ; and priests still strive to hallow them with crosses. The fi nest dolmens of this district include the “ Table des Marchands ” at Loch Mariaquer, a long chamber, like those of Guernsey which proved (on excavcation) to be tribal cemeteries : the length is 35 ft.; the side stones are 16 ft. high ; and near it is the huge monolith 78ft. high, and 13 ft. girth at its base."},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"Stones 372 Sacred menhirs were connected wi th rain like “ water crosses ” (see Crosses) : such were the Arab H ̣ ajr el Mat ̣ r or “ stone of rain,” or the Latin Lapis Martialis, which was prayed to for rain : the latter became the “ baton of St Martial.” Menhirs also often stand in front of a dolmen, and sometimes these represent a symbol with its accom- panying altar. Mr J. Fergusson ( Rude-Stone Monuments , p. 306) describes the “ sentinel stone of Oroust ” in Sweden, which so stands before a dolmen ; Col. Conder gives another instance from Mr Gilboa in Lower Galilee ; and at the circle of El Mareighat in Moab he found a central group of menhirs, and a dol men gate to the circle (see Heth and Moab ). Col. G. Austen regards recumbent stones at the base of the menhirs of. the Kba.sia hills, in India, as symbols of the female principle ( Journal Anthrop. Instit ., 1871, p. 122). “ Stones, wells, and holy trees,” were vainly denounced by Charlemagne, as they had been ever since the Council of Arles in 452 A . C . Quite recently a bride was led from the church at Bamburgh, in Northumberland, to the “ petting stone,” to be jumped, or lifted, over it, for good luck ( Notes and Queries , 5th Jan. 1901), and Mr Norman adds that the same custom is “ still observed at Holy Island, or Lindisfarne, but has recently died out at Kyloe, and Belford. The ‘ petting stones ’ used to stand at the entrance of the church.” So also the lingam which the bride salutes in India stands before the temple ; but “ at Bam- burgh only a low stool is now placed near the church door for the occasion ” : that at St Mary’s in Holy Island has been moved to the E. window, and is popularly supposed to have belonged to a cross. So also the obelisk at Rudstone Church in Yorkshire (see Rivers of Life , ii, p. 73, plate ix), which is 25 feet high, and was brought from the Whitby moors 30 miles to the N., in spite of its weight of some 50 tons, has been removed from its po sition as a “ pointer,” to the altar. In France there appear to be upwards of 6300 of these rude- stone monuments ( Athenæum , 4th Dec. 1886), one at St Agnan being a dolmen on which a human fi gure is sculptured, while a second close by is called “ the Ass’s Back,” with deep cavities in the stones (to hold offerings) as at Stonehenge and elsewhere. In the neigh- bouring department of Saône et Loir e there are two “ rocking stones,” like those of Cornwall, on one of wh ich a human bust is sculptured. The “ Roche aux Loups ” near Lormes, which Dr Jacquinot regards as a sacri fi cial altar, with another called the “ fox’s house ” in the same neighbourhood, present the same cavi ties in the side stones of the dolmen ; and these are common in other countries also.

Stork. In mythology there is little difference between the stork and the heron ; but in the West the stork is a welcome spring visitor. The Hebrews called it the Khas ī dah (Jer. viii, 7) or “ pious bird,” as Arabs call it the “ little pilgrim,” returning from his southern pilgrim- age. The Syrians hold it as sacred as do the Danes and Germans. The latter put white vessels on the roofs of farm houses, hoping that storks will make nests therein. The storks bring children, and are supposed to destroy evil snakes, as well as toa<;ls and frogs ; and to manifest fi lial piety. Russians connect them with the fox and the woodcock. Strawberry. This sweet red fruit was sacred to Venus, and grows wild in Italy, but the Madonna excludes from heaven the children of mothers who eat strawberries : such mothers of dead children must at least not eat them before St John’s day the 24th June. Stundists. An earnest evangelical sect founded by German Protestants, in Russia, about 1855 to 1865. They are so called as observing so many stated “ hours ” in the week, for devotions. The fi rst preacher was a poor Russian of Osnova, Michael Rotushny, called Onishtshenko, who was converted from an evil life by hearing the gospel read. He became a shoemaker , and learned to read himself. In 1877 “ the famous Sutaev ” established the sect, which now num- bers several millions ( Daily News , 24th Nov. 1887). They have gradually simpli fi ed their creed, and their religion' now consists in practical goodness of life, with reading of the New Testament and prayer, as far as constant persecution permits. Mr Lanin ( Contempy. Review , Jan. 1892) says that from the day of conversion till death the Stundist sinks his individuality in that of humanity generally, believing in the brotherhood of man. They think that Christ is still wandering among millions of planets, teaching by word and example. Discord is the root of all sins, an d he who follows the law of love fi nds life full of charm, while death has fo r him no terrors. Stundists do not merely distribute their money and goods : they will mow hay for the prisoner or the sick, reap his co rn, repair his hut, and care for his children.

His emblems include the disk, the ring, the winged globe, the eagle or eagle-headed man, the archer in a ring with wings and tail of the eagle (among Assyrians and Persians), or the god driving a chario t. He is the “ golden wheel of the impeller of Pushan ” (Rig Veda, IV, viii, 7) symbolised by the Fylfot (see Fylfot, Ixion, Svastika), and the sun god holds a staff and a ring (see Sippara). He is atso the winged horse (see Asvins, and Pegasos), and the winged scarab (see Beetle), represented on the early Hebrew jar handles with the name of Ba’al, found at Gath, Gezer, and Lachish.

As no woman is free from jealousy, the East marks with darkening face the blushing glow with which the West welcomes the approach of the lord of all. The weeping lake shuts its lotus eyes, and the clouds try to follow him through the night ; for what avails it, though we see all, if we see not the beloved one.” The sun is the source of life on earth ; hence, among all nations (even Polynesian savages), he is thou ght to be the father of many “ sun children ” (see Mr Crawley, Folk-Lore Quarterly , June 1892). Virgins dedicated to the sun are commonly fo und, and others were shut up for months, or for years, in cruel darkness lest they should produce “ sun children ” (see Samoa), as Mr Fraser describes ( Golden Bough , ii, p. 225). He is ever young, with go lden locks, or horns, or with rayed diadem. He is both a babe in the arms of a virgin mother, or of an earth goddess, and also the bridegroom of the moon. He rises in Egypt from the tamarisk, or tree of the Aurora. He is ram-headed, or bull-headed, and often grasps the fi ery serpent, which becomes his rod (see Proc. Bib. Arch. Soc ., May and June 1893). His death is mourned as winter approaches (see Ad onis, and Baldur), and his eclipse, like that of the moon, is dreaded : for a dragon threatens to devour him and must be frightened away by loud noises. Mexicans, who dis- tinguished “ the sun in his substanc e ” (Tomatink) from “ the sun in his four motions ” (Naolin), were wont when he was eclipsed to seize on ruddy persons, or on albinos, and hastily to tear out their hearts before his shrine. In India the sun is worshiped no t under his old Vedik name of Surya (“ the shiner ”) but as Vishnu, or especially as Krishna. He is nearly always adored near holy wells—such as the Sura-Kund (or “ sun well ”) near Oudh, and especially after the winter solstice is over : fl owers and incense are then offered to him, and are thrown afterwards into a sacred stream. Mothers stri p their babes naked, and present every part of their bodies to his rays. The sun and moon have been adored together by all races, and in all ages. The shrines of the sun must be oriented ; and even Josephus says that Moses “ placed the tabernacle with its front to the east so that the fi rst rays of the rising sun might enter it ” ; “ the golden candlestick . . . had as many branches as there were planets including the sun.” Solomon’s temple"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"Sun 377 in turn also looked due east to th e line of sunrise behind Olivet (see Heifer, and Stones). Surya is still adored at 12 of the ancient shrines of K ā s ī (see Ban ā ras), and we have seen his image in the temple of Ana-purna, the godess of plenty, as a god seated in a seven-horsed chariot, with an aureole of rays round his head, much as in the bold sculpture on a rock at Mundore, near Jaip ū r in R ā jput ā na. Surya is only adored on Sunday, at sunrise, and at sunset when his temple is closed ; but Hindus fl ock to worship him before undertaking any new matter, and especially before marri age. We have also found the worship of Surya at the head of the Panch-Ganga gh ā t , or “ pass,” one of fi ve great places of pilgrimage, where the blue Vishnu is fl anked by the pale Chandra (or moon) on the right, and the golden Surya on the left. In a temple adjoining the Pisach-Mochan, or “ demon’s tank,” the sun also appears with Vishnu, Siva, and Lakshmi. The Sura- Kund in the S.W. part of Ban ā ras is a “ sun well,” said to have originally consisted of 12 wells. In the centre of the temple is a large round fl at stone, with a central hole for a sacred fi re, to which offerings are made, while a Pandit reads portions of the Surya-Pur ā na, especially on Sundays and feast days. In the suburbs of Ban ā ras, at the R ā m-nagar fort, a similar carved disk is set in the fl oor of the shrine of Veda-vy ā sa, accompanying Siva and Ganesa, but without any image either of Surya, or of the Vedik scholar after whom the shrine is thus named, though devotees he re worship both. The temple of Adkesava, at the junction of the Ganges and Barna, contains another image of the sun ; and a similar shri ne, with a very sacred well, is to be found at the junction of the Ganges with the Asi river : fi rst fruits are here always offered to Vishnu an d Surya, especially in autumn when men, and women, bathe in the tank ; and at the “ smith’s feast ” in August. At the great Surya feast, thousands of females bathe in this Lakshmi-Kund from early morning until late at night. The sun is sometimes represented in Indian paintings in a chariot with seven green horses, as representi ng the fertile power of his rays. Arjuna (“ the bright ”) sits before him as his charioteer, and is repre- sented without legs. Indra, Sakra, and other gods, are regarded as incarnations of Surya, and may thus be invoked. The shrines are always perambulated in the direction of the sun’s path (see Dakshina, and Rita), as used to be customary in early European shrines also. Fire is still so carried round buildings, and used to be whisked by husbands round their wives, in the same “ De-Suil ” direction, immediately after a child was born (Toland, Celt.

In the Ram ā yana the king is called Trisanku, and the Rishi who sells his son Suna-sepha as a human sacri fi ce is Amba, of Ayodha, or Oudh. Suna-sepha is a substitute for Rohlta , the child born to the king after he had performed austerities, but is carried off by Indra as his father is about to bind him to the sacri fi cial stake, Vishnu having been pleased by his recital of sacred verses. This sacri fi cial story recalls that of Isaac among the Hebrews. Sunda Islands. A great group between Java and New Guinea, which has been invaded successively by B ā lis and Dr ā vidians from S. India and Oeylon, and by Telegu races from the coasts of Barmah and Siam (see Rivers of Life , chap. ix) : the B ā li name survives in the S.E. promontory of Sumatra ; and the large island of Timor, in the Sunda group, shows survivals of Indian lingam worship (Mr H. O. Forbes, “ Timor Tribes,” see Journal Anthrop. Instit ., May 1884). Every village has its “ Lulik ” or temple, or in towns there is usually a group of three ; they are carefully fenced in, stand- ing generally on a mound in the sacred grove : not a twig or a blade of grass may be .taken thence, nor a stone be removed : cattle are excluded, and tobacco is forbidden within the sacred bounds : buffalo skulls decorate the gateway : an old man or woman—the Luliata— takes charge by day ; and the shrine has its high priest, the Dato-lulik or Rai-lulik. No Christian is admitted, but Mr Forbes heard that “ the great treasure ” is a sacred stone called the Vatu-lulik. The central door of the Lulik cell is opened only during war time— as in the case of the temple of Janus in Rome. Fowls and pigs are sacri fi ced, and the Dato-lulik wears scarlet cloth on his head, a round breastplate of gold, gold disks in his ears, gold armlets, and a broad gold crown. Thus robed he talks with the Lulik, and declares the will of heaven. On the eve of a war he comes to the great door of the shrine, bearing a sacred shield, spear, and .gun ; and he publicly sacri fi ces a buffalo before the assembled tribe, each man of whom has a fowl in his hand, which he kills while chewing, and expectorat- ing, the Siri and Pinana nut : according to the color of the ex- pectoration, and the position in which the fowl lies after death—as with the right or the left foot raised—is the augury which decides whether the worshiper is to go to the war or remain on guard at home. Those who obey the divine command cannot be hurt by any"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"Sunday 379 weapon. During the war the Dato-lulik must never leave the side of the deity ; and he must keep the sacred fi re burning day and night. If the fi re goes out, or the hearth is cold, great disasters will ensue : and during the war the high priest must drink nothing but hot water. The islanders also make special offerings at the sowing and reaping seasons. Sacred stones and trees, at cross roads, or on dangerous ascents, are decked with rags from garments, cigarettes, and Indian corn. Mr Forbes noticed the same custom (common all over the world) in Sumatra as well, where every passer-by deposits an offering at certain strange stones in forest paths. In Timor he says that “ the summits of the highest mountains are all Lulik,” especially “ rugged and singular peaks . . . there no man dare break a branch of a tree . . . and only after due ceremony would he ascend them. . . . Dark, or far-spreading, trees are also Lulik, but especially the fi g-tree or Lulik-Halik ” (apparently a banian). It is a place of sacri fi ce where will be .seen the heads of goats and buffaloes, fl esh, and rice, just as among wild tribes in India. None will set out on a journey without making an offering to the village tree, and under it the native of Timor swears brotherhood, drinking blood which is also poured into a bamboo and hung on the tree, while a sacred spear and sword, from the Uma-lulik or temple, is set on either side. The blood so drunk is mixed with spirits. The islanders are much afraid of swangi or “ sorcery,” and pray against it at great stones, offering rice and betel nut. At the end of the rainy season, when they begin to wash gold, the high-priest and people sacri fi ce to the stone on the summit of Fatunarosk, the highest peak in Timor. The god invoked in war is Maromak or “ the heavens,” with Urubatu (the sun), Laraula (the moon), and also “ he of the earth.” The introduction of caste, and of Hindu architecture , into Sumatra, Java, and Timor, dates apparently from our 15th century : the doors of houses are often elaborately carved.

The Sunn ī s—who represent the large majority of Moslems, in all countries except Persia, are divided into four great sects, diffe ring in minor points, but admitting the general orthodoxy of the others . These sects all arose in our 8th century, and are named after four famous doctors of the faith. (1) H ̣ an ī fa born in 702 A . C .: his disciples say that he only accepted a few of the traditions, teaching a reasonable acceptance of the K ̣ or ā n, and the right of private judgment : his pupils, Yusuf and Muh ̣ ammad, wrote six books of commentaries which are much esteemed. (2) M ā lik born in 712 A . C ., laid down all the life duties of the faithful according to the views of the Med ī na school, and detailed the sacred law : hisauthority is widely accepted in Turkey, and among many Indian Moslems. (3) Shaf’ai was born in 768 A . C ., and established an eclectic system, based on the views of both the preceding doctors. His followers are distinguished by certain attitudes in prayer, such as placing the thumbs on the lobes of the ears. This sect is commonly found on the Indian coasts. (4) Ibn H ̣ anbal, born in 781 A . C ., was an extremist who declared the K ̣ or ā n to be not only inspired but “ uncreated and eternal.” His views have never been accepted in India (see Lane, Modern Egyptians , and Hughes, Dict. of Islam ). Su-parnas. Sanskrit : “ fi ne winged ” supernatural beings (see Garuda and Simurgh) : they dwell in the Simb ā li forest, of which Garuda is the king. They are invo ked at the daily presentation of water to deceased ancestors. Superstition. Latin : Superstitio “ standing still.” Religion as a virtue was the mean between excess and neglect—as every virtue is a mean between two extremes which are vices, accord- ing to Aristotle. Superstition is practically a “ standing still,” and a dread which is due to ignorance of natural phenomena. Max Müller observes ( Cosmopolis Review , Aug. 1896, p. 632) that we may be tempted to call it a “ survival.” The superstitions of peasants, now'called Folk-Lore, are the survivals of very ancient religious ideas, and of rude pre-historic faiths : such superstition engenders gloom and fanaticism, whic h sometimes bursts forth, sweeping all before it ; being excited by any di sbelief in terrible powers or deities whom the fanatic dreads.

They are angrily intolerant of rational considera-, tions, and resent inquiry into the origin of their beliefs, gods, and"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"Superstition 381 scriptures. They are usually quite ignorant of natural law, and of science ; and, under the in fl uence of heredity, they cling to supernatural explanations, mysteries, cataclysms, and miracles. They esteem omens and presages, and belie ve in lucky and unlucky days. Even among the more educated, some belief survives in the Friday bad luck, in the sign of the cross, in crossed sticks, knives, or fi re- irons, in number 13, in spilling salt, or in passing under a ladder— all which ideas belong to the religions of the earliest ages. The superstitious are thus obstructive to all advance in true knowledge. They retain belief in holy, and unholy, ghosts, and in ever present angels : even when, through travel, and intercourse with those of other faiths, their experience is wi dened, they continue as far as possible to shut their eyes to fact s. Such men are almost hopeless as subjects for improvement and education ; and, if won from error, are liable to fall back into yet gro sser superstitions and theosophies, being unable—through lack of scienti fi c training—to follow the calm methods of reasonable enquiry. The brain may be sane, but the effects of early teaching, and of heredity, are too strong to be overcome, unless youth, and unusua l energy and independence of character, enable the individual to escape from the bonds of custom and habit. The fanatic is unable to stand still aright in the presence of the unknown, and desires to have a de fi nite creed regarding all things unseen. It is best th erefore to leave such men alone, trusting that they may be enlightened in the general awakening of man’s intellect, and by increasing civilisation. Nothing but wide reading, and hard thinking, can do away with superstition, whether in an individual or in a nation ; and where free discussion is forbidden the people retrograde, and the nation sinks into hopeless decay and corruption. The mystic is a slave, as Mill said, to “ mere ideas ” : the believer is ever ready to accept evidence which the more experienced know to be of no value. The prepossessions of an emotional nature are no proofs where objective realities are in question. Some say that our faith depends on our nature, which is true only in the sense that it depends on our knowledge and experience ; whereby our nature is controlled. Plutarch held that it is better to have no opinion at all about a god than to hold one that is unworthy : “ I would rather men should say there never was such a person as Plutarch, than that I ate my children ” (like Kronos) ; or—he might have added—that I sacri fi ced my only son to appease my fatherly wrath (see Sir F.

They like to believe what they were taught, an d hold all they hear asserted, and this they do with indolent, or uni ntelligent, acquiescence,” usually through indifference. It becomes those who wish well to their fellows, and to their country, to re sist superstition and mysticism, which bring untold evils and misery on a state thrown back into dark ages when cruel laws, ignorance, an d all manner of impurities, throve, and when reason was silenced. Carlyle wishes a “ speedy end to superstition—a gentle one if you can contrive it, but an end. What can it pro fi t to adopt locutions and imaginations which do not corre- spond to fact ? ” It is nevertheless vain, and unkind, to attempt rudely to destroy those superstition s which are the religions of the un- cultured.

Hebrew : “ rock.” This term is a favourite title for the deity, as symbolic of his strength and eternity ; and the rock or stone has been a divine emblem for these reasons among all races (see Stones). The term is used especia lly in early books (see Dent. xxxii, 4, 18, 30, 31, 37 : 1 Sam. ii, 2 : 2 Sam. xxii, 3, 32, 47 ; xxiii, 3 : Psalms xviii, 46 ; xxviii, 1 ; lxii, 2-6 ; lxxviii, 35 : Isaiah xxvi, 4).

It has been much explored, and the recent French Government expedi tion under M. de Morgan (1897- 1902) has discovered some of the mo st important Babylonian records ever found, at this site. It was the capital of the non-Semitic king Kudur Nankhundi, who overran Babylonia as early as 2280 B . C ., carrying away the image of Nana from Erech, which Assur-bani-pal recovered about 650 B . C . Here the “ Laws of H ̣ ammurabi ” were un- earthed, and yet older monuments re covered, together with Kassite boundary stones stolen by Elamite kings, which are valuable for their long historic and religious texts of the 11 th century B .

Dieulafoy found the beautiful enamelled tiles of a frieze in the palace of Artaxerxes Mnemon, which represen t Persian guards (see Persepolis) ; and here an Akkadian text shows th e city to have been conquered by H ̣ ammurabi, while a fi ne bas-relief represents the victory of the yet earlier Naram-Sin. The spoils of Susa, described (after 648 B . C .) by Assur-bani-pal, at the time of the fi nal Assyrian destruction of the city, included those of a mysterious temple in a grove where the “ god Susinak ” dwelt, “ whose godhead none had seen ” (see Rec. of Past , i, p. 85). [The remains described in the memoirs of the French expedition are of all ages. Besides the monuments stolen from Babylonia, the pillar of Xerxes inscribed in three languages, or the texts of Semitic patesis —or subordinate rulers—of unknown date, there are many later texts in the Susian language ; Part hian tombs ; Christian, Sassanian, and Arab remains ; symbolic eyes from Egypt, with early ivories, and fi ne pottery. The two most remarkable monuments are the obelisk of M ā nistusu, and that containing the Laws of Babylon about 2100 B . C . (see H ̣ ammurabi). It is uncertain whet her these were erected on the spot in early days, or were stolen by later Elamites, as was certainly the case with regard to the Kassi te boundary stones, and other monu- ments. The same applies to the stela of Naram-sin, which bears a later Elamite text in addition to the original short Semitic inscription. The obelisk of M ā nistusu (De Morgan, Susa , i, 1900) is inscribed on each of its four faces, in the Semi tic Babylonian language. It appears to record endowments of a temple by this “ king of Kish,” who is otherwise mentioned in a text in the Berlin Museum. It includes the names of several early monarchs of S. Babylonia ; and Mesalim, “ the king’s son,” has been supposed to be the Mesalim king of Kish who de fi ned a boundary with a certain E- anna-du (or “ heaven sent ”) ruler of Zirgul, noticed on a clay cone in the Louvre.

Svastika. Swastika. The name of this emblem is derived from the expression Su-asti , or “ be thou well.” It is a cross with feet, but may have three legs instea d of four (see Fylfot). The four- legged emblem is very ancient, being found on the Hittite monument of Ibreez in Lycaonia, at Mycenæ, on the pelvis of a naked female image at Troy, on rocks in Cornwall, and in many other ancient ruins. It is a symbol of the sun, of fi re, and of thunder—the hammer of Thor. The Hindus also apply the na me to a man standing with legs and arms extended ; and this likewise is an early Hittite and Phœnician emblem. The sign seems to represent the wheel of the sun (see Ixion, and Sun) ; the Hindu parent marks it on the breast and forehead of his babe at birth (see Bombay Rl. Asiatic Socy ., iii, 1893) ; and a Svastika is formed of wheat ears in the natal chamber ; the sign (or Kunku) is ma de with red powder in honour of Ganesa, and Hindu writers place a red Svastika (or Sri-vatsa) at the beginning and at the end of MSS. and books ; it is also sketched in fl our on fl oors, and on garden paths, at wedding fetes. In the ordinary form , which is called “ male,” the feet follow the direc-tion of the sun's course in heaven ; this is the Greek Gammadion, the “ Croix Cramponée,” or Crux Ansata, the Tetra-skel ē , sometimes formed by two letters S at right angles. The opposite emblem is the “ female,” or Sau-svastika, which is sometimes of evil omen. The Tri- skel ē (“ three legged ”), or Triquetra, is a similar emblem with only three legs, and is common on Si cilian coins, as well as in the Isle of Man. This sacred cross was known among Mexicans, and apparently to the mound builders of Ohio in N. America (Prof. Wright, Quarterly Stat. Pal. Expl. Fund , October 1894), and also in Peru, where it occurs on early pottery. It was probably of Turanian origin, but is widely spread, on Indian coins and in Skandinavia alike. In India it is often drawn with long crooks, so as to suggest that originally it was a circle divided into four by cro ss lines, and representing the sun. Among Buddhists it was made into a Chakra or “ wheel of the Law ” (see Buddha), and by Tibetans it is ca lled Yun-drun, or “ path of life. ”"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"Svastika 386 It is found in Greece, Krete, Cypr us, and Rhodes, and was the emblem of Artemis, and of Ath ē n ē .

It was used, apparently by Christians, in the Roman catacombs, on garments of priests, and of the “ Good Shepherd.” It was a charm on bells in Yorkshire, and on vases, and arms, in Switzerland, and among Saxons and Kelts ; on Gaulish coins from the 3rd to the 6th centuries A . C ., and on Roman tombs at Algiers ; on the coins of Parthians and Sassanians in Persia, and on old Phœnician seals, as well as in Belgium down to our 14th century. Count d’Alviella ( Migration of Symbols , p. 81) traces this wide- spread and ancient symbol from Troy and Mycenæ down to the 9th century A . C . in Ireland, and fi nds it in Persia, China, N. Africa, and Skandinavia, in Tibet and Japan. The introduction into America appears to have been due to the Buddhists of our 5th century. In Thrakia the Svastika has a central circle, and is accompanied by the letters MES in Greek. This coin was discovered by Mr P. Gardner, and appears to have belonged to th e city Mesembria, named from the “ midday sun.” A Lycian coin of the 6th century B . C ., also bears the Triquetra, or three-legged emblem. The Svastika is found through- out Europe, as at Bishop Island on the Oder, or on a vase from Reichersdorf, or all round the pulpit of St Ambrose at Milan. There are 1000 instances in the Roman Catacombs, and others on the walls of Pompeii : on a Keltik urn found at Shropham in Norfolk ; and in the Roman villa at Beading in the Isle of Wight ; on Athenian and Corinthian vases ; on coins of Le ucas and of Syracuse ; on a mosaic in the royal garden at Athens. The Skandinavian S form occurs on the Ogham sto.ne at Pen-Arthur, in S. Wales, as well as on the altar frontal of the cathedral at Valentia said to have been sent from Old St Paul’s in London in the time of Henry VIII. It is common on Persian carpets, and found in both Hungary and Ashanti, as well as in Yukatan. The Japanese may still be seen stamping this emblem as the ancients did in Egypt, or in Cyprus. Mr Aynsley regards the Gammadion on the tomb of St Agnes in Rome as an “ old Christian cross.” The Triskel ē at Eryx in Sicily is older than 400 B . C . The Svastika on the stones of the Buddhist stupa at Sar-n ā th (in Ban ā ras) may be yet older. It uccurs twice in the cells by the “ red gate ” of the mosk at Jaunp ū r, and used to be seen at Granada ; but Moslems disowned it, saying it was placed there by the devil. Hindus often decorate the Svastika with leaves, fl owers, and gold. It is recognised as representing the two fi re sticks (see Arani), as Emile Burnouf noticed long ago (see Mr Hewitt, Journal Rl.

In mythology (see Prokn ē ) these birds are har- bingers of spring, and welcome as such. In the Babylonian fl ood legend a swallow was sent forth as the waters subsided. The Akkadians called it the Nam-khu or “ bird of fate.” It is unlucky to dream of swallows, yet they saved Alexander the Great from a family plot by awaking him. In the Norse Edda, Sigurd was advised by swallows when he hesitated to kill the giant gu ardians of treasures, and he thus gained a wife and wealth. None dared hurt swallows—even birds of prey—and St Francis of Assisi called them his “ dear sisters.” It is lucky for them to build on a house, and a wizard who drove one away was blinded. The gods need their aid in building the skies, and the Piedmontese call them the “ chickens of the Lord.” Suidas says that Khelid ō n (“ swallow ”) means the pudenda, and the bird was sacred to Venus as well as to the Madonna. Swan. See Goose, and Hansa. Swithin. This saint was originally a form of Odin and of Thor (see Davies, Druids , p. 198). “ Sythan was son of Seithan who, under the in fl uence of drink, let the sea overwhelm the country,” and hence Swithin is still connected with 40 days of rain if his name day is wet. Sword. See Spear. The word ase in Sanskrit (Latin ensis ) meant originally a “ weapon ” which pierced or cut, whether dagger, sword, or spear. Swords are not found early at Troy, but occur on early Hittite monuments. The sword was an ancient emblem of power, and is used (as is the Latin gladius ) to denote the phallus. The Arab couplet has a double meaning: “ All swords strike without the sheath, Thy sword strikes within its sheath ” ; which is explained to mean the lady’s eye. Scythians, and the Turanian nomads of Central Asia, worshiped the sword set up erect on a mound, as do non-Aryans in India (see"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"Sword 388 Rivers of Life , ii, p. 358, fi g. 274). Arabs and Japanese did the same, as Aryans set up the Quiris or short spear. The divine sword of ’Ali (Dhu-el-Fikr) was hung over the door of the K ̣ a’abah at Makka. The Teutons prayed to the sword of Odin and of Tyr, and we fi nd it represented on Norse and Keltik menhirs, where it has been mistaken for a cross. Swords, scythes, and sickles, are hung over doors as charms. The sword was believed to have a soul, and often spoke to its master. In some Sagas it springs from its sheath and slays foes of its own accord. In others it is called “ brother of the lightning,” or “ thunderbolt,” and is gold hilted, and bears inscribed runes on its blade as char ms. It is often connected with “ magic rings.” Gram (“ bright ”) was the sword of Odin, forged by Völundr with the magic spear Gungnir ; the sacred runes on these shone, and the weapons sang, before battle. Arthur’s sword, brought from the fairy city under the lake, or drawn from the rock, was called Excalibur, said to mean the “ champer of steel.” It was given to Richard I by King Tancred the Sicilian Norman (see Dr Karl Blind, Gentleman’s Mag ., 1892, and Proc. Viking Club , 15th February 1895). In China and Japan the sword is often the chief emblem in a shrine ; and Greeks adored both the spear of Athene, and the sacred scimitar of Kambyses ( Herod ., iii, 64 ; Pausan., i, 28) ; the latter was “ conspicuous for the glory it confe rred.” Men and nations alike must possess a sacred or magic sword lest evil should befall them. Most tribes in India have shown a naked sw ord to every infant as soon as it could see. It is still worshi ped in the hill shrines of Chutia- nagp ū r, among Khonds also in Orissa and Ganj ā m, and they are even said to be named from the Khanda or “ sword.” The sword is also worshiped by Mongolians, and throughout Oentral Asia (see Journal Rl. Asiatic Socy ., April 1893). Sir R. F. Burton, writing the Book of the Sword , says that its history is that of mankind. Sacri fi ces were made to it by priests. It is the key of heaven or of hell in the K ̣ or ā n. It killed but also cured. It cut every knot, and became the symbol of justice and the emblem of martyrs. It was called “ God’s daughter,” for the gods were lords of hosts and of battle. Moslems give it 80 names, each connected with a legend. The sword of ’Azrael, or of death, opens the door of life, and eastern legends say that cities sprang up where a sword was brandished. It has, indeed, been the agent of advancing civilisation, which was impossible without “ red ruin ” : men would have stagnate d forever without such purifying storms, before their minds had been widened by commerce, travel, and research.

Mateer, Travank ō r , pp. 125, 200) : it is borne in procession from its shrine, at the Pongal fête early in January; and is placed on the altar of Bhagavati, the earth-mother, and called Bhagava or “ god.” Aryans and non-Aryans adore it alike ; the priest fi xes it upright, and the kneeling king offers rice and fl owers, circumambulates it, and sprinkles it with holy water and sandal dust. In the absence of a suitable husband, the Travank ō r maiden is married, at the age of 11 years, to a sword; and through- out the Telegu regions the bridegroom is represented by his sword if he cannot appear at the wedding ceremony ( Indian Notes and Queries ; and Indian Antiq ., Dec. 1891). So also, in Syria, the Maronites hold a drawn sword over the door as the bride enters her new home ; and a sword dance forms a feature of all wedding processions. Syama.

This scholar is described as “ a translator of the s criptures of the Jews,” from whose sister Juliana—soon after his death—Origen obtained certain “ inter- pretations of the scriptures.” Eu sebius, a century later, says that Symmachus “ maintained the Ebionite heresy,” and discarded the Gospel of Matthew. Symmachus lived from about 160 to 210 A . C ., writing about 200, or twenty years later than Theodoti ō n, another Greek translator consulted by Origen. Palladius (about 420 A . C .) says that Origen lay in hiding from persecution, for two years, in the house of Juliana, at Cmsarea the capital of Kappadokia. He seems to attribute only poetical works to Symmachus. Epiphanius regards him as a Samaritan convert. He was no doubt of the old school of Christians whom the Catholics pers ecuted as Ebionites. Symmachus is said to have aimed at combining literal translation of the Hebrew with purity of Greek. Theodotion (an Ebionite of Ephesus) only attempted to revise the LXX transl ation ; while Aquila (or Onkelos), the Jewish proselyte from Pontus, was so literal as to become some- times unintelligible (see Bible).

The oldest known are in Galilee (see Memoirs of Survey W. Pal .), and their architecture imitates Roman style (see Col. Conder, Syrian Stone Lore ). These are traditionally said to have been built by Rabbi Simeon Bar Yokhai in our 2nd century: they usually are entered on the south, and it is remarkable that they are adorned with fi gures of animals in spite of the Law : they appear to have had a gallery for women. The modern synagogue contains an ark in which the rolls of the Law are kept. The chief of a synagogue was called the Parnas, and the minister who read the liturgy, and the lessons from the law and prophets, was the She1iah ̣ or “ delegate.” At least 10 Bat ̣ lan ī m, or “ men of leisure,” were required to form a representative congrega- tion ; and a Meturgem ā n, or “ translator,” was also needed to explain in Aramaik the meaning of the Hebrew, which was a dead language not understood by the congregation.

The synagogue is the centre of Jewish life, connected with all rite g of circumcision, marriage, burial and prayer ; and the greatest misfortune to a Jew still is to be cast out of the synagogue.

Tabernacles. The Latin tabernacula means a “ small booth ” or small tavern.

The Babylonians made Sukkoth- Benoth or “ booths for girls ” (2 Kings xvii, 30), and the “ Sicca Veneria ” at Carthage were the same—that is to say, booths where dwelt the K ̣ odeshoth, or women devoted to Venus (see K ̣ adesh) : such booths are still to be found outside Indian towns in secluded places ; and the custom is also found in China, and in Africa. Orientals (in Syria and elsewhere) construct booths on house-tops, or outside the village, in which they live during the hot autumn before the rains ; and this was the probable origin of the feast of Sukkoth, or “ Tabernacles,” held by Hebrews in autumn after the great fast of Y ō ma—the “ day ” of Atonement. It began on the 15th of Tisri— the feast of the in gathering and vint age, at the end of the civil year, or about 1st of October, and lasted seven days. The Day of Atonement was the 10th of Tisri (Exod. xxxiv, 22 ; Levit. xxiii, 41).

Yet neither of them appear to have heard of the miracles of Christ. His Annals , written in 117 A . C ., give the Imperial history from the death of Augustus to that of Nero (14 to 68 A . C .), and these include his only allusion to Christia ns (xv, 44) as follows : “ Nero (in 64 A .

It is not quoted by the early Christian fathers, or even by Eusebius ; but the Annals were unknown till 1468 A .

C .) describes the tortures of Christians almost in the same words with those in the Annals ( Hist. Sac ., ii, 29), and this may be the source whence the interpolation was taken. The passage in Suetonius (about 65 to 100 A . C .) is of even less importance than that in Tacitus : it relates that the Emperor Claudius (41 to 54 A . C .) drove the Jews who, “ at the suggestion of Christus,” were cons tantly rioting, out of Rome. This is historically an anachronism if it means anything more than Jewish belief in a Messiah (see Christ). Tacitus says : “ I regard as the highest function of history to rescue merit from oblivion, and to hold up as a terror to base words and deeds the reprobation of posterity ” ( Annals , iii, 65).

Their supreme god Ta-ar ō a, the “ creator of all life,” is symbolised by an erect stone (or lingam) decorated with feathers. He is also bread (Arœa), and created woman out of the bone of man while asleep, calling her Ivi ; but this legend may have been introduced by Arab sailors before the arrival of Christians. Ivi signi fi es “ bone,” and is not “ Eve.” The Tahiti sect, or confraternity of the Arœis was as licentious as the Sakti sects of India : they preached a future heaven of youth and pleasure, to gain which it was necessary to kill off the old and sick, and to enjoy unrestrained licence at their festivals—as in Australia.

Prayer consisted in confession of human unw orthiness, and in praise of the gods ; it was offered by kings and queens who were equally fl attered, their dwelling being A-arai or the clouds of heaven, while the royal canoe was Anuanua, or the rainbow. The king’s voice was thunder, his torch the lightning ; nothing once us ed by royalty could be put to any common purpose ; nor might royal na mes be given to subjects. The king, or the landowner, must however abdicate when a son was born : for the youthful only were esteemed. Priests had no power over marriages, but were important at circumcision, and tatooing cere- monies ; for the smallest deviation from custom vitiated all rites and sacri fi ces : and even if the priest’s attention was diverted, and the “ prayer broken,” all must be repeated, and new victims offered (Mr Ellis, Polyn. Researches ). The Maro-aurou was a “ divine girdle ” (or Ephod), worn by such priests, conf erring marvellous powers on the wearer. It was artistically deck ed with yellow, blue. black, and especially red feathers, and was kept with, or in, an image of a god. The Tahiti marriage customs—like those of New Ireland and of other groups in Polynesia—are due to the general licentiousness of the race; and, from an early age, the maiden has to live when betrothed on a high platform railed round, near he r home, and can never go out unless accompanied by one of her parents. The pair, standing on a mat, pledge troth at the wedding, when the skulls of ancestors are sometimes set out to take part in the cere monies and prayers (Hutchinson, Living Races , p. 23). Tail. This is one of many euphuisms for the phallus. Mr Fraser carefully avoids any allusion to the phallic idea in his Golden Bough , although it is well known to lie at the base of all worship of life. He prefers to speak of the “ corn spirit ” ; yet even he informs us (ii, p. 3) that\" the corn spirit is a wolf whose fertilising power is in hi s tail,” quoting Mannhardt (see Nik). His work contains no allu sion to the Nismes sculpture, where a female rides on the phallus which she guides by a pair of reins (see Pala). Tak ē . Tachen. Polynesiah terms for a god, or a chief.

They were buried in tombs, under houses, or in temples ; and sometimes, lead talismans are inscribed with curses agains t foes (see Miss L. Macdonald, Proc. Bib. Arch. Socy., Feby . 1891).

This work, or “ teaching,” is a huge commentary on Hebrew Scriptures, the Mishnah text—in late Hebrew of our 2nd century—being accom- panied by the Aramaik commentary or Gem ā ra : the Jerusalem version being of the 4th century, and that of Babylon dating 500 to 800 A .

Fierce, intolerant, vi ndictive hatred for mankind with small exception—con fi ned in some cases to the singular number : idle subtlety, frittering away at once the energy of the human intellect and the dignity of the divine law : pride and self-conceit amounting to insanity : adulation that hails a man covered with the rags of a beggar as saint, and prince, and king : indelicacy pushed to a grossness that renders what it calls virtue more hateful than the vice of more modest people ; all these might be strung together in one black paternoster, and yet they would give no more just idea of the Talmud than would the chaplets of its lovelier fl owers. For both are there and more. These volumes comprise the intellectual life of a gifted people for a period of 800 years —a self-tormenting, mournful, misd irected life.

Rabbi Eliezer enumerated 300 laws against witches. None could venture abroad alone on Wednesday or Saturday, for fear of Agrath daughter of Makhloth, nor sleep alone for fear of Lilith. We learn that Yahveh devotes three hours daily to the law, three to judging the world, three to feeding it, and the last three to sporting with Leviathan whom “ he made to play with.” He never acts with- out consulting his heavenly council, and sometimes a Rabbi has been summoned from earth to advise him. He himself superintends the rains and irrigation for the land of Israel, but leaves all the rest of the earth to the care of an angel. The world was created for Israel alone : hence a judge may lawfully favour an Israelite against a Gentile “ but so that it be not observed.” The Talmud is full of gigantic similies. Noah found it dif fi cult to get the unicorn into the ark because it was as large as Mt. Tabor, and its horns were bound outside. The coats of skin of Adam and Eve had all the beasts and birds in the world painted on them. These descended from Cain’s son to Nimrod whom Esau killed, and Jacob wore these skins when he stole Esau’s blessing. The meaning of such allegories is often very obscure. The transmigration of the soul is taught in both Talmud and K ̣ abbala. A Jew at death may be reborn as a Gentile, to save Gentiles or to help Jews. Words and numbers are K ̣ abba- listically used in a sense not intended by the original, as when we learn that there are 903 kinds of death, because the Psalmist speaks of the “ issues ” of death, the numeral value of the Hebrew word for “ issues ” making 903. The tablets of the Law weighed 28 2 1 tons, and Abraham was a giant. Yet the Jews say that to know the scriptures aright it is essential to know the Talmud. Many of the legends are of ancient Persian (Mazd ē an) origin; many of the fables are Buddhist ; but of such results of comparative study most Jews know nothing. Much of Christ’s teaching has its parallels in the “ sayings of the fathers ” (Pirke Aboth) in the Mishnah, which are often attributed to Hillel, and to other Rabbis living before, or at the same time as Christ ; but these memories were set down even later than those in the Gospels.

He is a god of darkness, fi ghting with Atea (see Atua) the god of light. He sprang from chaos, and produced Ono or “ voice.” Kanaloa presides over Po or “ hell ” (see Fornander, Poly- nesia , i, pp. 63, 84) : the pronunciation of the various Polynesian dialects is very indistinct, and various, in such names. Tanyatu (Fornander, ii, pp. 34, 94) is a go d of thunder [from an old root Tan to “ strike ” or “ sound,” as in the Aryan tan “ to thunder ”—E D .]. Tan ē . The Polynesian father god (see Tan) who made the earth and skies, like the Chinese Tien “ heaven,” and Central Asian Tañ for “ god.” He thrust the heavens away from the earth, and gave men heavenly fi re. He produced Rangi, and Papa, a divine pair who made light. The myths of the various islands differ, and the Hervey islanders say that Vatea produced the twin boys Tangar ō a and Rongo (see Rongo) with whom are associated Tonga-iti, Tangi-ia and, lastly, Tan ē , or Tan ē -papa-kai, who is the “ piler up of food.” Others regard Tangia and Tan ē as the “ chief gods of Mangaia ” or the world.

Tangaroa sprang from his mother’s head, and was symbolised by sacred lingam stones (see Fiji) his color being red. His principal sons were Vaka (or Laka) and Ahu (or Tupo), of whom the fi rst killed the latter, being jealous (as in the story of K ̣ ain and Abel) of his goodness and diligence : the myth seems to represent the war of light and darkness, as does that of Tangaroa and Rongo.

These books include the rites and hymns in honour of the Saktis or Prakritis (see Sakta); and an important section of Hindus regards them as a “ fi fth Veda.” They represent the worship of matter, and of nature, as a reaction from the philosophy, and asceticism, of Nyana and Y ō gi sects. The Tantraists, reverting to a savage licence like that of Polynesia or of Australia, divided into “ right hand ” and “ left hand ” Saktyas (Daksh ī n-acharya, and V ā m ā charya), adoring the lingam and the yoni respectively (as Siva-ites and Vishnu-ites) which are philosophically described as representing “ the male and female principles (Yan and Yin of the Chinese) in nature.” Their orgies have already been described, as there is little differe nce between Tantra and Sakta rites (see H. W. Wilson, Relig. of Hindus , i, p. 263). The “ right hand ” Tantraists worship Siva as Paçu-pati, “ the lord of herds,” but are perhaps less degraded than the “ left hand ” worshipers of Vishnu. Both sects hold that all natural passions are good, and that pleasure should be made as exquisite as possible for the Vira, or “ strong man ” (Latin vir ), who is not a Paçu or mere “ tame beast.” Such revolt from ethikal restraint has been quelled by education among civilised races, yet it still lies beneath the surface in dark corners even of Europe (see Pisanus Fraxi, 1877, on Prohibited Books ). The teaching of love as religion has alwa ys been liable to result in such abuses (see Agapæ), as shown in France or in Syria (Dulaure, Hist. des Cultes , i, p. 428) and these survive even in the modern Agapæmon ē , or in the “ spiritual marriages ” of America. The disciples of Prodicus (see Adamites) were philosophers who, even as late as our 5th century, held Tantraist views. Gregory IX charged his German converts with practices like those of the Thrakian worshipers of Kottus, or Kotutto— the Baptai whom Greeks and Romans also imitated, combining puri- fi cations with licentious orgies, and dressing (like the eunuch priests of Kub ē l ē ) in female dress.

C. Das, Bombay Rl. A.siatic Socy. Jour nal, Feb. 1882, p. 124). The Tantras are believed to have been inspired by Siva, and are mostly dialogues between him and his bride P ā rvati : they inculcate the worship of the Sakti (the female “ power ” or “ manifestation ” of a deity), and the performance of magical rites whereby power over the spirits of heaven, earth, and hell, may be obtained. Enlightened worshipers of Siva and Vishnu now disown the inspiration of the Tantras, but the result of asceticism is naturally a revolt, leading to the opposite extreme.

A native of Mesopotamia—probably of Edessa—said to have been the son of a Greek merchant, and born about 111 A . C . He was noted, about 140, as a student of Hebrew scriptures, and as knowing Greek, Syriak, and Arabic. He is supposed to have become a convert to Christianity at Rome about 152 or 153 A . C .; but was rather a Jewish Theist delighting.in Platonic ideas, and Gnosticism. When Justin Martyr was slain, about 165 A . C ., Tatian fl ed from Rome, wandering in Italy and Syria, and settling at Edessa, where he died about 180 A . C . He became a leader of the Enkratites or “ self-con- trolling ” ascetiks, who shunned wine, and even used water only, for the Eucharist. His “ Oration to the Greeks ” is still extant; but the ori- ginal of his “ Diatessaron ” (or “ four fold ”) harmony of the Gospels is lost. It is noticed by Eusebius about 340 A . C . as one of two “ har- monies ” then current ; but it is unno ticed by Origen or by Jerome. It was written in Greek. Ephraem the Syrian, at Edessa (306-373 A . C .) seems to bave valued it, and wrote commentaries thereon : he appears to have translated it into Syriak ; and a Latin version of Ephraem’s work was published at Venice in 1876 ; but Ephraem knew little of Hebrew, or of Greek, and depended on the Syriak Gospels. Theodoret, bishop of Cyrrhus (457 A . C .), endeavoured to suppress Tatian’s gospels in favour of the orthodox Greek text of his time. Bishop Victor of Capua in Italy mentions a Latin version of the Diatessaron (in 554 A . C .), but such versions were often much inter- polated : Arabic, and Armenian vers ions also existed. The Arabic has recently been found in the Vatican, and is translated into English by Rev. T. H. Hill (1893); but such versions as we know (according to the Rev. Dr Abbot) disagree not only with our Gospels in Greek, but with each other, and the original is still unknown. Tatian taught the ordiriary Gnostik doctrines as to Æons, and the Demi-urge (see Gnostiks), and, on joining the Enkr atites, denounced not only the use of wine and animal food, but also marriage, leading a celibate life.

The bull’s head, or skull, is a charm, and as such was sculptured by Greeks and Romans on the friezes of temples. In kune iform and Hittite scripts it stands for “ power ” as well as for “ bull.” After the funereal rites the Hindus (see Mr S. C. Bose, Hindus , p. 275) set up a pole (the Brisak ā t), gaily painted and supporting the head of an ox, which is circum- ambulated and adored : the pole is some 6 feet high, and is fi xed in a pit, thus formilfg a lingam in an Argha (see Argha) : a similar emblem in the Borghese Museum ( Phallicism , 1884) is supposed to represent the head of Apis the Egyptian bull, accompanied by emblems of the sun and moon. The Germans, when fi ghting the Roman Marius, also carried a golden bull as their standard. To many races the cow and bull are too sacred to be offered in sacri fi ce ; but in imperial Rome the expiation for heinous sins consisted in allowing the blood of a slain bull (see Mithra) to drip on the penitent, who was placed in a pit below the place of sacri fi ce—this was the celebrated Tauro- bolium rite. The ashes of heifers had equal powers of puri fi cation (see Heifer). The bull was everywhere the emblem of production and life, of strength and creation. (Lajard, Culte de Venus , p. 221).

These—especially canine teeth—are charms, but often are euphuisms for the lingam or phallus, like tiger’s claws and other such talismans. The “ tooth of Buddha ” is a name often given to a lingam of considerable size: but teeth of holy men were relics to Buddhists and Christians alike—like bones. Major Forbes ( Eleven Years in Ceylon , I, ch. x ; H, ch. xiii) twice saw “ Buddha’s tooth,” a piece of discolored ivory, 2 inches long and 1 inch in diameter at the base. It is popularly called the “ Dalada, or left canine tooth, of Buddha,” and is enshrined within 7 successive caskets of gold, in another which is silver gilt, 5 feet high and bell-shaped, as are the interior carandus or “ caskets.” Two of these are inlaid with rubies and other gems. This relic stands on a silver table hung with rich brocades, in the inmost shrine of the temple attached to the royal palace of Kandi. When Major Forbes saw it in 1828 it had not been shown for 53 years. It was taken out and placed on a golden lotus on the table, while Buddhists offered to it gold, jewelry and"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"Teeth 408 fl owers. It is fi rst noticed at Puri (or Saga-nath), N. of Telling ā na, which was called the Danta-p ū r or “ town of the tooth ” ( Journal Bengal Rl. Asiatic Socy ., March 1883). Here it was the palladium of the city for 800 years, and famed for its miracles during the wars of the region, from 300 A . C . even to the 18th century. Br ā hmans carried it to their emperor Panduva, at Patna, denouncing—as a “ vile superstition ”—the worship of a bone. The M ā gadha emperor decreed the “ grinding and burning of this human bone ” ; but iron would not pulverise it : it was buried deep, but sprang out of the earth, or the water, and shone with light, fl oating on a golden lotus, in a golden cup, on the stream. Thus the emperor was converted, and Br ā hmans declared Buddha to have been an incarnation of Vishnu. King Ksh ē ri-dara, of Sevat-nuvara, attacked M ā gadha to seize, or to destroy, the tooth, and it was considered right to restore it to Puri. Panduva abdicated to he come a Buddhist monk. Ksheri-dara then marched on Puri, where Guha-Siva hid the relic in his daughter’s hair, and sent her to Ceylon, where the tooth was adored from 309 to 318 A . C ., in the reign of Kitsiri Maiw ā n. It had many later adventures, being, as Sir H. Yule says ( Marco Polo , ii, p. 265), “ a great object of desire to Buddhist sovereigns.” It is said to have been once at Amr ā vati on the Kistna river ; and, in our 11th century, King Anarauhta of Barmah claimed to possess it, or a miraculous emanation from the true tooth. In 1855 we found a building in the palace of Amara- p ū ra called “ the tower of the sacred tooth.” The reigning king then enshrined a model of the Ceylon tooth in his capital at Mandale. According to a Chinese text, quoted by Sir H. Yule, one of the four eye teeth of Buddha, was placed in Svarga, or the heaven of Indra, the capital of which was Amr ā vati: the second in the capital of Gandh ā ra : the third in Kal-linga (or at Puri); and the fourth went to the Nagas or snake gods. One of these teeth (from Gandh ā ra as Sir H. Yule thinks) was brought to China by an embassy from the West, in 350 A . C ., and is perhaps that now shown at the Fu-chau monastery. But in our 7th century Hiuen-Tsang was shown other teeth of Buddha at Balk, and at Kan ō j. Kubla Khan, the Mongol emperor, is said to have got one from Ceylon in our 13th century. China has another celebrated tooth of Fo, or Buddha, enshrined on the summit of Mount Omei (see Omei) where the “ glory of Buddha ” is seen. The Ceylon tooth was captured by conquerors from India, but returned, after a few years, at the entreaty of the king of Ceylon, Parakrama III, in our 14th century. It was again carried off by the Portuguese to Goa in 1560, when th e king of Pegu was ready to offer anything he had in exchange for it ; but the king of Ceylon said"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"Tefnut 409 that the Kal ā s (“ foreigners ”) had only got a sham relic ; and, in return for magni fi cent presents, he sent the real tooth to Pegu. Its reception —says Sir H.

Portuguese history shows that their Admiral Constantine Braganza seized the tooth in Ceylon in 1560, and was offered 300,000 ducats, which the bishops would not allow him to accept , for its return. It was ground to powder in the presence of horri fi ed Buddhists ; and the Portuguese said that the Kandi monks substituted an “ ape’s tooth,” which may have been quite as genuine as th e older relic. When the British took Ceylon in 1815 the tooth was carefully hidden, and only re- appeared when it was found safe to show it. Sacred teeth were common. One was shown in the adytum of the Kanheri cave temple near Bombay, and another at Nasik (see Dr Stevenson, Journal Bombay Rl. Asiatic Socy ., July 1853). Fa-hien found one at Ladak (Legge’s Life , p. 23), and Hiuen-Tsang describes three (Beal’s Life , pp. 50, 134, 181), one at the “ new monastery of Balk, another at Kan ō j, and a third at Simhala.

The word tarpu is used for a “ ghost ” in Assyrian (from the same root with Rephaim), and the Teraph ī m thus represented “ spirits.” Tertullian. Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus was the fi rst Christian writer in the Latin language. He was born about 150 A . C ., and at Carthage he studied Latin and Greek, Plato and the Stoiks. He is supposed to have been converted to Christianity about 190 or 195 A . C ., but about 207 A .

The Pelasgi fi ghting at Troy called themselves sons of Teutamos (see Rivers of Life , ii, p. 564). The emblem of Teut was the “ hand ” (see Hand), and he was also a rock or mountain. Tez-katli-poka. The Mexican sun god symbolised by “ a black shining stone,” called Teo-tlet. He was also Ixtliltou “ the black one,” as contrasted with Kuetzal-koatl the fair god, as Krishna the dark is contrasted with the white Siva (Bradford, Amer. Antiq ., p. 301). He is often “ seated on a bench covered with red cloth, skulls, and bones of the dead . . . is always young, and superior to the effects of time.” Human sacri fi ces were offered to him to secure good crops ; and “ skulls were hung up in Tzompantli,” or sh rines, as among Indian non-Aryans, and Polynesians. The Asamese have Naga skull-houses in sheds near temples (see Bengal Rl. Asiatic Socy. Journal , 1872, p. 19).

Its glory endured for ten centuries before the Assyrian conque st of Upper Egypt. It stood siege by Ptolemy Lathyrus (the 8th Greek monarch in Egypt) for three years. Its temples, whence Kambyses had taken some two millions sterling, were then again plundered, and much destruction of its tombs and monuments followed. Its wealth is shown hy the statement that Rameses III (20th dynasty) alone, bestowed about £170,000 of gold and silver on four great and some other smaller temples.

The worship of a personal god without any reference to belief in inspired writings. The Socinians of the 16th century, and the Unitarians of the 17th, natu rally developed into the Deists of the 18th, and into the Theists of the 19th century. The followers of Fausto Paolo Sozzini, the Italian Protestant (1539 to 1604), believed that Christ was God, but divided later into two sects, the more advanced saying that he shou ld not be worshiped. They were expelled as Arians from Poland, and retired to Transylvania in 1658, .reaching England in 1773, and spreading to America in 1815. Unitarian doctrines were especially furthered by Lindsay in 1773, and by Dr Martineau who accepted the results of modern critical study of the Bible. The more emotional teaching of Dr Channing, in America, resulted in the estab lishment of a religion of unscctarian ethiks. But pure Theism is a very ancient belief, especially among Greek thinkers who, as a rule, supposed the personal creator to stand apart from the universe, leaving it to the laws of its nature. Vedant- ists believed that the phenomena of matter were Maya or “ illusion,” and God the only reality, much as Plato also taught. Deists like Paine, in the 18th century, rejected the dogmas of Christian churches. He too rashly accepted Nature as his God and Creator, though she recognises no such “ equality and natural rights ” as he proclaimed, and upholds no idea s of love and compassion through- out her domain. Tennyson says that: “ Nature is one with rapine, a harm no preacher can heal ; The May fl y is torn by the swallow, the sparrow spear'd by the shrike ; And the whole little wood where I sit is a world of plunder and prey.” Thus Deism was dethroned, but Paine’s in fl uence led (says his bio- grapher, Dr M. Conway) to the establishment of the fi rst Theist church in New York, whence a mo re reasonable Deism spread to Europe, teaching that God is a lovi ng father and mother, and saying as little as may be of any evil power that limits his actions. Theism, developing into an “ Ethical Societ y,” teaches only what Christ, and Buddha long before him, taught—a religion of good thoughts, words, and deeds, tolerating many various speculations as to the unknown and incomprehensible deity. Two centuries after Spinoza Cardinal Newman, in his Apologia , gives us reasons why he believed in a personal God which are much less clear than those of the Jewish genius. When a lad, he says, “ I wished the Arabian Tales were true.” “ I thought life might be a .dream, or I an angel and all this world a deception ” (Maya). “ In fact . . . I was very superstitious, and for some time previous to my"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"Theism 415 conversion used constantly to cross myself on going into the dark.” We learn hence how little we can tr ust even genius in a devotee, for insanity is not far off when the mind is so highly strung, and the imagination so powerful. The young priest felt—like the old Vedantists—“ a mistrust in the reality of material phenomena,” and so regarded God as a “ necessity of his nature.” He was ready to credit the occult ; but he confesse s that his God is only a “ pro- bability,” adding that “ Probability is the guide of life.” He owns that God's existence cannot be proved like a mathematical problem, but this idea of probability he embraces “ with full internal assent ” —that is to say belief—the Probability being to him a great Person whom he loves and fears, as other men have made their God according to their own image. Theism is called a “ half-way house,” where those can rest on the way who have found the old paths to lead nowhere, yet cling to a modi fi ed belief, not having yet found the new path to truth. The Theist believes in a person, or indi viduality, apart from the universe, calling him In fi nite and Omni-present ; which attempts at de fi nition usually lead to Pantheism or to indi fference, unless they result in an humbler Agnosticism. The Rev. C. Voysey (Nov. 1892) distinguishes Theism from Unitarianism clearly, in respect to belief as to Christ : for though the Unitarian does not believe him to be God yet he claims to know God especially through the New Testament. The Theist on the contrary is independent of any historical creed. Even Unitarians however (of whom there are some 300 congregations in Britain), are gradually joining the increasing ranks of the Agnostiks. They have long and bravely fought an unequal fi ght ; for, as Socinians, they started the real Reformation of the 16th century, and took up the fallen cause of the defeated Ariu s, suffering long persecution as “ Anti-Trinitarians,” though they claimed only the right of private opinion dear to all Protestants, and advocated free enquiry into dogma. They were almost suppre ssed by the combined forces of the Jesuits and Trinitarian Protestants in 1611, and “ all Arians and Anabaptists ” were exiled from Poland in 1658. Yet they spread to Prussia, Switzerland, Holland, and England, everywhere awakening thought among the drowsy masses. Joseph II of Austria, and other enlightened princes, favoured them in secret ; and in spite of many martyrdoms, Austria included 32,000 of them in 1790, and has added 22,000 more in the 19th century. Socinians with “ an Unitarian catechism ” appeared in England as early as 1650, but were repressed for a cent ury by severe laws, and dared not openly disavow the divinity of Christ. Brave leaders like Dr"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"Theism 416 Priestly arose among them in the fi rst half of the 18th century. In 1772 the Rev. Theophilus Lindsey threw up a valuable living in Yorkshire, and established the fi rst Unitarian Church in London, while just a century later another bold Yorkshire clergyman founded the fi rst Theist Church in these islands. Both leaders relied chie fl y on the peaceful dissemination of their religious literature : and, in 1813, the civil liberties long deni ed to English Unitarians were granted : yet for 21 years afterwards they were not allowed to own their lands or chapels ; but now, under such eloquent and pious leaders as Taylor, Channing, Theodore Parker, Martineau, and Page Hopps, they have risen to the high est forms of spiritual faith, dis- carding the timid teaching of earlier days, and building up a great Theist church in all parts of the world. They are little noticed, on account of the variations of belief among them, and because many men now see no necessity for join ing any particular sect, or for keeping up old forms of worship ; but since 1820 a large body of the liberal clergy of America have declared themselves to be Theists ; and in 1886 the “ Free Religious Society ” was there founded, discarding all mythology in favour of secularism and free thought. But “ Theology abhors a vacuum,” and the Theist clings to belief in a personality, not in, but outside the material universe. Men are better than their beliefs, and the practical aims of Theists are now the same as those of Agnostiks. If we preach love, and mercy to man and beast, we must of necessity ascribe a like nature to God. Few are strong enough to leave the church of their fathers, with all its fond memories and beautiful ritual, to jo in either the few who have gone out into the Agnostik wilderness, or those who rest in the Theistic house by the way. The aged Professor Newman—brother of the Cardinal ( Miscel ., ii, p. 178) goes further than this. “ Not in such words, 0 Father of our Spirits, Speak we again. A fear, a hope, each child of us inherits, Making them vain. Now a vast doubt wherewith our souls are shaken, Outlasts the tomb. Where, in what region, sh all the wanderer waken, Gazing on whom ?” The unchangeable and omniscient deity of the theologian is yet not absolute, since he is limited by la w or consistency. So Bishop Cud- worth wrote : “ God did not create . . . even morality. It is inherent in His nature . . . he cannot be conc eived as capable of reversing it.” Goethe well says that : “ The theologian must hold fast to words if he"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"Theism 417 would reach the gate of certainty ” ; yet these, says Hobbes, “ are the coin of fools, but the counters of wise men.” It is dif fi cult, in spite of every attempted de fi nition, to regard Theism as absolutely distinct from that kind of Pantheism which still retains a belief in the indi- viduality of the deity. To speak of the “ absolute ” and the “ uncon- ditioned ” is to speak only of the unknowable. Christian churches confess that their God is “ incompre hensible,” though they labour to explain His nature even to babes. Every object or creature which is not God limits his in fi nity, as the Rev. C. Voysey says ; but what is the difference between such teaching and the “ Higher Pantheism ” of Tennyson ? If God is present ev erywhere, and in all, we reach Monism, from which such Theism be comes.' indistinguishable. As Clifford said : “ the evolution of consciousness from molecular vibra- tion is an ultimate fact of nature ,” and without matter to vibrate we have nothing of which we can be conscious. The great gods of man have arisen from his contemplation of incomprehensible phenomena and marvels of nature. He naturally called them in fi nite and eternal compared with himself. The idea of law, or natural consequence, was as yet unconceived, and terri fi c cataclysms, arbitrary displays of power, were feared ; or gods were otherwis e thought to be coldly indifferent to the miseries of man. The fear of such dread beings was said to be “ the beginning of wisdom.” Miss Power Cobbe, as a typical Thei st, astonished her friends by saying ( Contemporary Review , Jan. 1888) that “ when poets spoke of looking through Nature up to Na ture’s God, they must have meant through telescopes fi lled with the glass of Christian sentiment . . . nothing could be more disastrous to both religion and morality than to revert to Nature for one or the other . . . The all-pervading law of Nature, by which animal life on earth, and in the waters, is chie fl y sustained, is the preying on other life—unquestionably repugnant to our feelings ” ; but “ as death is the inevitable condition of physical life, it may be compatible with the widest bene fi cence, and pain be needful to secure us from mutilation and untimely death.” [A short pang, unexpected, against a life of delight.—E D .] To live is to desire, to want is to suffer. Yet a short misery outweighs with us a long felicity. We have given but a sketch of the dif fi culties that are raised by the theory of a Theos, good, just and bene fi cent, almighty and omni- scient, but apart from the universe. But Theism is a mighty advance on all that went before. It casts aside amass of superstitions en- shrined in human writings, with worthless rites and symbols, miracles and dogmas.

An Ephesian Christian who lived about 140 to 180 A . C ., and who reverted to Judaism. His Greek version of the Hebrew scriptures was used by Or igen (see Origen and Symmachus). Jerome speaks of him as—“ a hereti cal Christian of Pontns ” : Irenæus mentions him ; and Epiphanius calls him an Ephesian who studied Hebrew, making his translat ion under Commodus (160 to 193 A .

This Jonathan, according to the Talmud, was a son of Uzziel, the pupil of Hillel, who died about 10 A . C .; but in this case the date of Theodoti ō n would be somewhat earlier. Theos.

Pali : from the Sanskrit Ther-vira , a term of courtesy applied to elders and monks among Buddhists, in Ceylon, Barmab, and Siam, usually to Bhikshus of ten years standing at least ; it implies learning and good service. They are J ā tis, or sage elders, and as a body are called Therawadi. A Thera must be physically perfect, and the royal Ka lyani text at Mandale speaks (in the 15th century A . C .) of the rejection by king and priests of a candi- date to the title of Thera, “ because of a big toe being too short ” ( Indian Antiq ., Feb. 1893). He was “ un fi t to enter the Sima circle ” (see S ī ma) just as a Pope must be declared physically perfect before he is accepted, or as a Hebr ew priest could not enter the house of the Lord if mutilated or imperfect (see Rivers of Life , i, p. 148).

Philo ne ver speaks of Christians, though Eusehius regarded the Therapeutaias semi-Christian. Philo regarded them as belonging to an older sect “ scattered over all the known world, and to be found in all nations.” His essay on “ the Contem- plative Life ” describes them as known in Egypt (about 25 B . C . to 45 A . C .). He himself “ had tried the life of. the recluse, and found (like Gotama Buddha) that solitude brings no escape from spiritual dangers ; for, if it closes avenues to temptation, there are few in whose case it does not open more.” He however calls them “ the Therapeutai (or ‘ servants ’) of God.” They dwelt in huts, cells, and caves on the borders of Lake Mareotis : “ their time was taken up in contempla- tive communion with God, the reading of old sacred writings, and composition and singing of hymns.” On every 50th day they met in a monastery where, during a modest meal of bread, water, and vege- tables, the leader gave a more or le ss mystical discourse explanatory of the traditional love which was handed down among them. This was followed by “ a solemn procession, and dance of mystic signi fi cance, in 'the moonlight on the margin of the lake.” Only brethren and sisters joined in it, and if strangers appeared they withdrew to their cells. There were other meetings for fasting, meditation, and instruction. In every house was a room set apart for solitary reading of their “ laws, prophets, hymns, and psalms .” They were vegetarians and water drinkers, and the elders were favoured with divine illumination. Dean Mansel ( Gnostics ) maintains that “ the philosophies of the Therapeuts were due to Buddhist missionaries who visited Egypt.” Lassen, Schopenhauer, Schelling, Renan, Muller, King, and other scholars take the same view, and Dean Milman wrote that “ Thera– peuts sprang from the contemplative fraternities of India ” (see Lillie, Buddhism and Christianity , chap. vii).

The crowd opened to aid his fl ight, and encouraged him, unless public opinion was against him, when he was killed as soon as he reached the shore, as also if the avengers overtook him. The last Foude Court was held in 1670. The Tingwall was also a centre for fairs and feasts. The custom of seeking refuge is ancient and common, and is found early among the Hebrews. Thinis. This. An ancient capital of Egypt on the W. bank of the Nile, 370 miles S. of Cairo. The fi rst two dynasties were Thinite. The sacred name of the city was Anhirt from the Egyptian Mars, and this has now been converted into Girgeh—the Christian St George taking his place. The debris is of the Roman and Greek age, the ancient city being buried to a depth of some 15 ft. (Dr A. H. Sayce, Proc. Bib. Arch. Socy ., June 1885). The tombs range from the 6th to the 13th dynasties, and a temple of Osiris was built here by Seti I of the 19th dynasty about 1400 B . C . The British Museum has a record of 35 kings of Thinis who preceded Rameses II. Anhir, the local god, was the “ guide to the sky ” represented as a walking vase standing on the fi rmament. The vase is the sign of rain and sky, and this Mars was evidently a storm god. Thomas. Aramaik Tuma “ twin.” His name is explained as being the Greek didumos , or “ twin ” (John xi, 16). In spite of his zeal to die for his Lord he doubte d his resurrection (xx, 24). He was one of the twelve apostles (Matt. x, 3 ; Mark iii, 18 ; Luke vi, 15 ; Acts i, 13) and apparently critica l by nature (John xiv, 5). He is stated to have seen Christ again in Galilee (xxi, 2), as also to have witnessed the Ascension on Olivet. According to Eusebius, and the Christian historian Socrates, he was “ the apostle to the Parthians and Persians,” and was buried at Edessa on the Euphrates. Yet later legends make him go to India wher e he was pierced with a lance like his master ( Syriak Chron . and Roman Breviary : see Milne Rae, Syrian Ch. in India : Huc and Gabet, China and Tartary , i, p. 19).

The, Portuguese spread wild storie s of his journey throughout India even to Madras, where, in the Mailap ū r suburb of the city, they showed his tomb, over which they built their cathedral. They called an old conical mound, sacred to the natives, a little inland, the “ Hermitage of St Thomas,” and this has long been the artillery head- quarters. Here between 1517 and 1547 was found “ a great stone with an engraved cross and dove, and an inscription in Pahlavi char- acters.” Dr Burnell refers it to our 7th or 10th century ( lndian Antiq ., 1874, p. 313). This stone may have been consecrated by later Nestorians, but was probably an old lingam on the Sivaik cone of granite which rises abruptly 200 feet from the plain : for the Portuguese said that when they captured the place they found ruins of a Christian church, “ in charge of a Fak ̣ ī r,” or native ascetik. Marco Polo mentions the site in co nnection with legends of St Thomas as early as our 13th century. Cosmas (535 to 550 A . C .) is the fi rst to speak of Christians in S. India ; he says that “ in Caliana ” (or on the Malabar coast) “ was a bishop appointed from Persia ”—evidently a Nestorian. Two copper plates dating about 774 and 824 A . C ., are known, granting rights to Chri stians near this hermitage of St ,Thomas at Madras ; in the 14th century Jordanus the Dominican speaks of them as “ a poor scattered people, calling themselves Christians, but knowing nothing of their faith, or of any baptismal rites ; but believing that Christ wa s St Thomas the Great.” Pope John XXII had made Jordanus bishop of Quiloa, resident at Travank ō r, directing him by a special bull to convert the natives. The Portu- guese in 1600 began to in fl uence these native Christians, but when 'the Dutch drove them out,in 1653, these Nestorians owned allegiance to the Patriarch of Antioch who is now accepted by some 400,000 Indian Christians (see La Croze, Hist. of Christians in India , pp. 39, 40). Haito, the Armeilian writer of the 14th century, believed that in his own time only one city in India professed Christianity ; but Portuguese tr adition alleges that Cheram-Perum ā l, king of Malabar (about 900 A . C .), favoured Christians, who were then led by Thomas Cana, a very much married Armenian. The children of his fi rst wife were esteemed nobles , and would not commune with those of the second ; but from these all Malabar Christians claim descent.

The Nestorians naturally revered St Thomas of Edessa, and thus all their churches came to be regarded'as having been founded by him (p. 128). Thor. The Skandinavian god of thunder (see Taramis). He fi ghts the giants of Ni fl heim, and is the second god of the Norse trinity, called in the Eddas the “ eldest son of God.” His great weapon is Miölner, the hammer or “ fi ery cross ” (see Fylfot, and Hammer), which is the “ crusher ” and also the giver of wealth and abundance. Skandinavians called th emselves children of Miölner, and it is the symbol of the thunderbolt ; but also one used at weddings (see Freya), and still said to weld the bride and bridegroom together, in Transylvania and Roumania.

Thursos. The emblem of Bakkhos, a pine-cone on a Narthex or “ reed,” adorned with streamers. It is connected with the pine- cones, and palm spathes, borne by Assyrian deities; with the pome– granate ; and with the lemon carried by Jews (see Tabernacles). In the Narthex Prometheus hid the fi re from heaven. The emblem was one of fertility, and originally of phallic signi fi cance.

Shang-ti in China is the “ supreme god ” (Prof. Legge, Sacred Books of East , iii, p. 25) : and “ Ti corresponds to our God.” In Polynesia Ti, Tiki, and Titi, are terms for spirits, as Ti is a Kelt ik word also for God. Tiki was also known in New Zealand (see Fornander, Polynesia , i, p. 69 : Dr March, Journal Anthrop. Instit ., May 1893). The Tiki (or Unu) is represented by an erect stone, and Ti was the creator or the fi rst man in Polynesia. The Ti emblems (says the Rev. Mr Ellis) were “ anointed with fragrant oils.” So me were rough logs, others carved, or shapeless, images 6 to 8 ft. high and wrapped in cloth. This sacred garment is sometimes wrapped round a bride ; pigs are sacri fi ced and a bit of the cloth is placed in the pig’s ear (Davis & Ellis, iv, p. 435). Tiki was the god of the dead, ruling in Po or hell, or in Avaika (“ night ”), among the Atuas or ancestral ghosts.

Tibet. This high mountain region, which now owns the suzerainty of China, is said to have fi rst become a settled kingdom only in 434 A . C ., under an eponymous ruler Tu-pöt (see Journal Bengal Rl. .Asiatic Socy ., February 1891). It is called Tabbat by Arab writers about the 12th century. Marco Polo, in the 13th century, with others, speaks of Th abet, or Tebet. But Tibetans call themselves Bod-pa, and their count ry Upper and Lower Bod, while Ti-pot-an only means “ the end of Bod,” or Pot, connected probably with the name of the separate state of Bhut ā n. Indians, and Chinese pilgrims, down to our 7th and 8th centuries, called Tibet Himavata, or Himadesa, the “ land of snow,” which is Khawa-chan in Tibetan speech. The introduction of Buddhism, about 630 A . C ., by Sam-bhota (see Lamas), led to the appearance of the Pah-mo or “ holy people ” —monks and nuns—at Pha-boukha near Lh ā sa, and they were believed to control demons through powers gained by austerities (see Journal Bengal Rl. Asiatic Socy ., February 1892). The weird wastes, snowy peaks, deep gorges, lakes, and glaciers, have made Tibet a land of mystery, where monks have pondered in solitude for ages. Tibet begins about 200 miles N. of Calcutta, and even its passes are 10,000 feet above the sea. Till 1904 all attempts of modern Euro- peans to penetrate to its sacred capital at Lh ā sa failed (see Times , April 1889). The whole region is 700,000 miles in extent, with a population of 8 millions, the table land rising to 12,000 and 17,000 feet above sea level. The Tibetans are nominally Buddhists, but actually devil worshipers, and are of Mongol stock with some Chinese infusion. They regard their land as the “ home of Buddha,” the “ land of the blessed,” the “ roof of the universe.” Marco Polo related strange tales of the “ Bods,” who devoured corpses, and the livers of foes, with butter and sugar, and made candles of human blood.

In 1719 the Capuchin friar Francisco Orazio della Penna reached Lh ā sa with 12 companions : his mission existed there for more than 25 years.

Hastings sent Mr George Ogle to the Teshoo- L ā ma—the only European who has been on terms of warm friend- ship with a spiritual ruler of Tibet. Capt. Turner, sent later, saw the election of a baby Dalai-Lama. Thomas Manning made a private visit to Lh ā sa, undergoing great dangers, since which time the only visitors were the Catho lic missionaries Huc and Gabet. The truest and fullest account of Tibetan religion is that of Dr Waddell, who lived in a monastery on the borders of this land of mystery, and whose scienti fi c researches destroyed the false repre- sentations of theosophists. Dr Hodgson, the British political agent at Nap ā l, fi rst astonished Europe by his account of Tibe tan literature (1824 to 1839) ; and Burnouf’s translations date from 1844, leading to the mission of Fathers Huc and Gabet in 1845. The account given of Buddhist ceremonies led, however, to their volume being placed on the Index Expurgatorius in 1860. They spoke of churches, rituals, processions, pilgrimages, relics, and images ; of tonsured priests and auricular confession ; of crosses and beads, incense, and tinkling bells, too like those of Rome ; though the resemblances were explained away as due to Nestorian teaching in our 8th century. The Gompas—or L ā ma- serais—date only from 750 A . C ., when Indian Buddhism had passed its zenith ; but we know that such ritual existed earlier, and we have no reason to regard it as having been borrowed from any Christians. Tibet had received Sanskrit books from India in con- nection with Buddhism by 600 or 700 A . C .; and used Sanskrit characters for its sacred literature in the Mongolian language. Mr Knight ( Where Three Empires Meet , 1893) saw at Lad ā k, in N.E. Kashmir, or “ Little Tibet,” the same ceremonies described by Huc—too truthfully—as performed at the famo us monastery of Hemis, 20 miles higher up the Indus than the capital at Leh. He describes a ritual still extant, as elaborate as that of Lh ā sa ; processions worthy of mediæval Rome ; and sacred dances by tonsured and gorgeously robed L ā mas, who wore mitres and copes, carried pastoral staffs, and swung censers of incense, chanting to the tinkling of bells, dipping their"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"Tibet 426 fi ngers in holy water, and partaking of a sacrament.

Such a “ Bodhi- sattva king ” is said, as early as our 7th century, to have been proclaimed in Tibet, “ an Avat ā r clad in a garment of eyes,” and endowed with the eternal spirit of Shakya Tubpa, or Buddha.

The L ā mas are no true followers of Gotama, and in small outlying Gompas of Lahoul and Sikhim the Ge-longs, or monks, openly consort with Ge-long-mas, or concubine nuns, discipline and piety being rare, and the old orgies of the Tantra sects being known to these “ beggars of virtue.” Good arch-Lamas, however, frequently degrade or dismiss the abbots of monasteries when of evil repute. About 620 A . C ., the Tibetan king Srong-tsan ordered all foreign books to be translated into Tibetan. The early use of blocks for printing has preserved the Nagari characters fi rst introduced, in older forms than those of Sanskrit MSS. in India. The spirits of the authors were believed to haunt the great libraries, and are invoked in the great four storeyed building at Lh ā sa, said to date from our 12th century. Here “ the monutnental work of Kshem-endra, called Kalpa-lota,” was translated into Tibetan verse by order of the great Lama Phagspa, who is said to have converted the. emperor Kubla- khan to Buddhism (see Mr S. Chandra Das, Journal Buddhist Text Socy ., ii ; Academy , 9th October 1893). The Sam-ye library was the largest at Lh ā sa till the beginning of the 19th century, when it wae accidentally burnt down ; it is believed to have been built in our 8th century, after the model of that in the Odanta-p ū r monastery in M ū gadha. The Dalai Lama’s library is .now the chief one at this sacred city. From the 14th to the 16th century Chinese books were translated, when the Buddhist originals could not be obtained from India. But Buddhism had its times of trial in Tibet, and it was disestablished in the 9th century by King Lang-dharma, called “ the apostate,” reviving again through the powerful preaching (about 1020 A . C .) of Atisha, who said that he saw Om, or Adi-Buddha’s name, written in letters of fl ame on a rock where be was allowed to rear a monastery, and to. plant a sacred tr ee. The miracles which followed included the appearance of some 10,000—some say 100,000—images on the leaves of this tree. Abbé Huc visited the monastery at the foot of a mountain where Tsong-kaba was born in 1350, to see the “ celebrated tree which sprang from one of his hairs.” He gravely describes the markings on the leaves as Tibetan characters, and, with"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"Tibet 427 great consternation, admits that there was no suspicion of fraud. We can hardly wonder that the Pope discountenanced the work of this credulous priest, who knew as little of Tibetan writing as he did of botany. Tibetan literature is ably described in the Edinburgh Review (Oct. 1890), by one who appears to have given a lifetime to the subject. It includes the two huge encyclopredias called Kan-gyur (100 volumes) and Ten-gyur (225 vo lumes), which reached London in 1838 with 14 other volumes (339 in all) : among these are the sacred poems of Milaraspa—the Milton of Tibet : the huge historical compilations of Buton in 1320 : the work of the “ Lotus picture writers ” ; and the fairly reliable History of Tibetan Kings —the Gyalrabs—said to have been written 250 years ago by the 5th Grand L ā ma of Lh ā sa. To the zeal and piety of the kings Sron-tsan Gampo, and Tisrong-deu-tsan (650 to 800 A . C .), we owe translations of Sanskrit works of which the originals have been lost. In our 9th century king Ralpachan revised and added to these translations made by studious monks : the main canons of the Buddhist scriptures were then rendered from the Chinese. Others were added in the 12th century, and about 1340. The two great dictionaries were printed at Narthang, in the province of Tsang, between 1728 and 1740. Other editioris were published from two presses in E. Tibet, and Pekin possesses a somewhat illegible copy. The Kangyur of 100 volumes includes seven divisions—(1) The Dulwa, or “ discipline,” drawn from the Sanskrit Vin ā ya, and including the cosmogony, and much Buddhist mythology in 13 volumes ; (2) Sher-chhyin (21 volumes) ; (3) Phal-chen of 6 volumes ; (4) Koutsek of 6 volumes ; (5) Mdo, the Sutras of the 5th century A . C ., including the legend of Buddha, and many Tantric, and magical rites, and theosophy (30 volumes) ; (6) the Myan-das in 2 volumes ; (7) the Gyut in 22 volumes, including the Tantras of the third and most degraded stage of Buddhism reduced to a magical system, with invocations, and meditations and all phases of Y ō gi hypnotism.

The Dulwa cosmogony speaks of Rirab the holy mountain whence Avalokit-Isvara looks down in compassion, on men, and on the holy Manasarowar lake : among the 33 gods are the Tibetan representa- tives of Brahma, Vishnu, and K ū vera : on a lower ledge are the four Diks or “ protectors of the faith, ” and below these the Lhas or local gods, ruling over the Tibetan forms of the As ū ras, Yakshas, Raksh ā sas, Nagas, and Gandharvas, whose names are translated into Tibetan speech. The various Indian philosophies, the teaching of transmigration of the soul, and of Karma ( Las in Tibetan) are given in the Ryud, or Gyut (the 7th part of the Kangyur), and in the Kyil-Khor, or 2nd part of the Tengyur. These works are full of the Yoga extrava- gancies which form no part of the teaching of Gotama Buddha, but belong to the Mah ā yana, or “ great system ” of later ritualism. The Mdo (or 5th part of the Kangyur) treats of the “ clearing up of sorrow,” of ethiks, and philosophy, of mechanics, the calendar, astro- nomy, medicine, and alchemy ; but th e most popular volumes of this part are the last about the “ Journey to Shambhala,” a mythical paradise on the borders of Mongolia, in whose blessed groves the pious desire to be reborn. The Tibetan masses know little of such literature. They call their faith chhoi , and believe in Shakya Tubpa (the Sakya Buddha), as the Buddha of the present age who had many predecessors, while in the future he will reappear as Byans-pa “ the loving one ” answering to the Maitreya, or future Buddha, of India, whose name means the same. They follow the usual legend of Gotama (see Lalita Vistara) : they believe in four stages of perfection : (1) that of him who “ has entered the stream ” : (2) of him who returns to earth for a further existence : (3) of him who goes to Ba rdo, or the place of the gods, to await Nirv ā na : (4) of him who has conque red life and desire, becoming"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"Tibet 429 an Arah ā t. Buddhism reached Tibet about 640 A . C ., or 500 years after the fi rst schism between the Mah ā -yana (or high church) and the Hin ā -yana (or purer low church) sects. The former triumphed in N. India, Mongolia, China, and Japan, the latter only in Ceylon. Thus Tibet received the corrupted system, while L ā mas added to it the savage superstitions of Central As ia. Even the southern (or Ceylon) school is largely affected by the superstitions of the northern (see Dr Waddell, Buddhism of Tibet , 1895, p. 10). The mystical Amit ā bha Buddha (see Amit ā bha) is a “ boundless light,” “ holder of the book of wisdom,” and “ of the sword of knowledge,” dwelling in Nirv ā na surrounded by celestial Bodhi-sa ttvas, and not the true Gotama. Patanjali had preached the “ ecstatic union of the individual with the universal soul ” as early as 150 B . C ., and a Pantheistic system of Y ō ga had spread all along the base of the Himalayas by 500 A . C ., reaching Tibet, with Mah ā -yana Buddhism, in our 7th century. To it were added the abuses of the Hindu Tantraists, who were not Buddhists at all (see Sakta, and Tantras), and the Shaman demon worship (see Samans). Kubla-Khan, the Mongol emperor of our 13th century, conferred temporal powers on the L ā ma of the Sas-kya monastery in Tibet. The Mongol prince Gusri-Kh an, conquering the country in 1640, transferred these to the head of the De-pung monastery, calling him the Dalai-L ā ma, or “ vast L ā ma.” The Chinese emperor con fi rmed these powers in 1650 ; but, to Tibetans, the priest-king of Lh ā sa is only the Gyal-wa Rin-pooche, or “ gem of majesty.” The fi rst of these prelates (Nagwan-L ō -zan) declared himself to be an incarnation of Avalokit-Isyara, and established his power at the Potala monastery of Lh ā sa. Buddhism was not pure even in 635 A . C ., for King Sron-tsan Gampo’s inscription of that date “ relates to Sivaic lingas,” and none of his texts are distinctly Buddhist, though he married the Buddhist Chinese princess fi ve years earlier (Dr Waddell’s Buddhism of Tibet , p. 20). The theory that as each Grand L ā ma dies he is reincarnated in a new born babe dates only from 1417 A . C ., and serves to retain actual political power in the hands of the Teshoo L ā ma, and of his assistants. The “ Path ” of Gotama Buddha gives place to the hypnotic ecstasies of Y ō gis (see Hypnotism), who must strive fi rst to become deaf to all outer sounds, secondly to lose all sense of self and of the world, and fi nally to attain complete indifference. This is done by gazing at some small object, such as a little image of Buddha, until eye and brain become Zhi-lhak or “ dazed ” : or by holding in the breath for an incredible time, causing tumpo , or “ a delicious feeling of lightness,” when the devotee believes he fl oats in the air.

Lamas are said to fl y through the air to distant lands, to read men’ s thoughts, to see the unseen, and to know the unknowable (see Y ō ga). Tibetans dread the third stage of man’s existence (the “ waiting period ” in Deva-chen, or the Paradise of Rirab, the “ place of Devas ”) : for good and bad alike must pass through a purgatorial period in Bardo for 49 days, or months, before they can be reborn. Even holy Buddhas are subject to rebirth, can recount experiences in former lives, and can prophecy before death when they will reappear. But the Dalai-Lama is chosen as a child by lot, the names of those proposed being drawn from a golden urn placed in the Jo-kang temp le before an image of Tsongka-pa or Buddha : the name so drawn is reported to the emperor of China, and is con fi rmed by him, much as Popes used to be elected and then con fi rmed by the emperor : the child is actually appointed when four years old. Its relatives are then ennobled : the father becomes a Kung or “ prince ” of the fi rst rank, receiving a button and a peacock’s feather : while titles which are hereditary are given to other relations. The Dalai-L ā ma, or boy deity, is usually dressed in a conical yellow hat fringed with fur, with a red woollen fl owing robe em- broidered, and edged with white s ilk which, as among all Buddhists, covers only one shoulder. The fi rst Grand L ā ma of Lh ā sa (Ge-dun- dru-pa) was born in 1391, but was not a Dalai-L ā ma : the third (So-n ā m “ the ocean of victory ”), born in 1543, became one, the word in Tibetan being Tal ē , and not Dalai as in Mongolian. Nagwan-lo-zan (1650) though the fi rst to be recognised by China is counted by them as the fi fth. The term was a Mongol translation of Jya-tso (“ ocean of victory ”) the title of Sonam, applied to all his successors. Early in the fi rst month of every year the Tal ē Lama descends from the red Potala monastery, above the great park of Lh ā sa, to visit the chief Jo-kang shrine in the city, and to deliver his “ charge ” to the chief L ā mas of the state, praying, and expounding the scriptures. Thousands kneel in the road, and spread before this Tibetan Pope gold, pearls, and gems, in precious bowls, lifting their heads as he passes in hope of being touched by his fl y- fl apper, which confers unspeakable blessings. To wards the end of the festival a strange rite is intended to con fi rm the general belief in the Tal ē - Lama’s divine nature.

Tibetans are great believers in charms, and use rosaries. Women have the Svastika emblem on their garments as a rule. All desire to possess mani-ru-bu charms, or red balls, which the Chinese say are “ pills ” with very potent medical qualities. One of these is sent to the Dalai L ā ma on enthronement. Every year he goes to the S ē ra monastery to reverence the golden Dor-je or mace (see Dor-je), a magic club said to have fl own to his Potala palace from some western country (see Journal Rl. Asiatic Socy .) ; and the “ crystal staff ” of the Mart’ang monastery is equally revered, having been “ brought by an Arah ā t in olden times ” : it stands with other relics beside an image of Maitreya (“ the merciful ”), who is the future tenth Buddha, accom- panied by those of 18 Arahats or “ saints.” A small tooth of Gotama (see Teeth) is shown in the same place, being about an inch long and yellow with age. The Pan-chen-erdeni, or “ most excellent Panchen ” L ā ma, of further Tibet, is popularly regarded as an incarna- tion of the Dor-je ( Journal Rl. Asiatic Socy ., Jan. 1891, p. 81). Like the Dalai-Lama he rules the yellow sect. The latter is not the only boy deity of Central Asia, fo r, besides the one above noticed in Nap ā l, another exists among the Bu riats (see Mongols).

Tiru-valluvar-n ā yan ā r. See Dr ā vidians. This celebrated poet is usually called in Tamil speech Tiru-vall ā r, “ the priest of Valluvars ” or low caste Pariahs. He is said to have been a low caste weaver of the Mailap ū r (or St Thom ē ) suburb of Madras, who lived about 800 to 1000 A . C ., or certainly not later than our 9th century, according to the Tamil scholar, Dr Pope : native tr adition makes him live as early as our 3rd century. He wrote the grand and compre- hensive poem called the Kurral (“ coup lets ” or “ short verses ”) which consists of 1330 verses of two lines each. The work is divided into three sections on Virtue, Wealth, an d Affection (or Pleasure) : it is full of plain, manly, good sense, and above all things the author is practical in his teaching. He says, “ strive to ascertain the truth, and to re fl ect thereon, and trouble not thyself about births and re- births : a knowledge of the truth never conducts thitherwards.” “ Drive insatiate desire from the heart, and heaven is at once attained.” “ If rich, be not above work ; nay, choose a profession, and energeti- cally undertake and perform public, as well as private, duties for which thy poorer neighbours have neither time nor means.” The mantle of Buddha and of Confucius fell upon Tiru-vall ā r. According to the legend of the Br ā hmans he was the son of one of their leaders named Bhagavan, by a fair Pariah mother, Adi-yal. As usual in such cases, with the object of preserving the purity of Br ā hman blood, the parents agreed to abandon any children born to them, and to console themselves by repeatmg verses as to the good- ness of God to all who are entrusted to His protection. Two girls and three boys were born to them, of whom the poet was the youngest. He was left under the branches of a tree (the Brassia Longifolia ) and was found by a farmer who called him Tiruv ā lum. He left his foster parents to join certain hermits wh o educated him : and he developed miraculous powers, slew a destruct ive monster, and so gained in marriage Vasuki the daughter of a rich landowner. She proved a “ miracle of goodness, as well as of wealth,” but Tiru-vallar (or Tiru- v ā lum) thought it wrong not to labour, and therefore learned to weave, while devoting his life to pu blic and private duties. Dr Pope, the translator of the Kurral (1887), says : “ Its teachings have formed an important factor in my life ” ; and this Dravidian scholar was long a distinguished missionary. He says that the Kurral outweighs all"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"Tiru-valluvar-n ā yanar 433 other Tamil literature ; and, like the Ramayana in N. India, its teaching has sunk deep into the heart and mind of S. India : it has .indelibly impressed for good the th oughts of millions: for herein “ is food for all.” In the Kurral we read : “ As each man’s special aptitude is known Bid each man make that special work his own.” Like Buddha, in his second stage, Tiruv ā lum was strongly opposed to a lazy celibate life, urging men to seek happy homes, and spheres of usefulness. He appears to have been a good Theist repeating with approval the words of the Bh ā gavad-gita : “ The holy one is the letter A, an eternal, omniscient, passionle ss, beautiful, and gracious one, who always acts through natural in fl uences.” He retained the Vedik .reverence for the elements, and thought that “ the power of learned IRish is over the world comes next to that of God, and of rain ” : the few profound and advanced ones eventually rule the masses : it is well for these if the higher diligent and active minds have a religion devoted to goodness and truth. Th e power of the elements however is very great for “ if rain falls not it upsets the whole course of the world, the offerings to the gods , Virtue, Wealth, and Pleasures.” Evidently Tiru-vall ā r was a follower of the doctrines of neo- Hinduism, which was then replacing Buddhism and Jainism, which were expiring in S. India, bu t from which he inherited much— he was even said to be a Jain—as well as from the philosophers of our 6th to 8th centuries, such as Kam ā rila, Subandha, Bhava- bhuti, or Sankar ā charya. We speak from considerable personal acquaintance with the Kurral poem, gained during our residence in Dr ā vidian India. From the 6th to the 10th century A . C ., works on Dharma, or “ duty,” were abundant, and from the earliest Buddhist age the Hindu standard of morality, right and wrong, was very high. Tiruv ā lum was an “ eklektik,” searching for the highest ethiks among all sects. Dr Pope says that he was familiar “ with Sanskrit, Buddhist, and Jaina literature.” So successful was he in generalising, and in popularising such literature that twelve standard authors of as many sects claim him as a mast er. He urged that “ whatever brings with it persuasion of its tr uth must be absolutely, and forever, taken into the soul; and that when convictions clash, it is because the fi nite is dealing with the in fi nite ” (see Dr Pope, Indian Mag ., Feb. 1895). In a chapter on God—whom he names not—he describes the deity as a spirit “ wi thout form, desire, or aversion : who passes over all our soul, like the soft breeze over the lotus ; yet should all strive to reach his feet , though over the vast billowy sea of embodied existence.”"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"Tiru-valluvar-n ā yan ā r 434 The good poet, though not disapproving of asceticism, by which even “ supernatural powers ” may be gained, says that “ more will be gained by the practice of benevolence, and a gracious regard for all men.” We must cultivate “ all the virtues ” for : “ Virtue sums up the thin gs that should be done And vice the things that all should shun.” “ Spotless be thou in mind. This only merits Virtue’s name ; All else—mere pomp of idle so und—no real worth can claim.” Morality is de fi ned as “ that which is useful, pleasurable, beautiful, and necessary to human society”—a seed, originally, and divinely, implanted in humanity. “ Let us begin by exercising re straint, extirpating evil desires, an d so build up a character devoted to goodness and truthfulness,” for, “ nought but evil can fl ow from falseness in life or word.” Dravidian speech has no word for our idea of conscience, but this, with faith, seems—says Dr Pope—to be summed up in “ Vision ”—or perception of what is right, which Tiruv ā lum “ attributes to all good men.” “ E’en when resources fail they weary not of kindness due And Duty’s self to them, appears in Vision true.\" “ Those who have conquered sense with sight, from sord id vision freed Desire not other good e’en in the hour of sorest need. Though troubles press, no shameless deeds they do, Whose eyes the ever-during Vision have in view.” Thus the old poet was as strong in preaching Duty as the best men of our own times are. He says that the whole world, as well as those with whom we are immediately connected, may claim duty from us, whereof we “ should have an intuitive consciousness . . . for in Duty there is nothing arbitr ary, but the revelation, to purged eyes, of that which is within the veil.” The Tamil word means “ a binding,” or debt that we are bound to pay, seeking for no recompense. As to sins of omi ssion or of commission Tiru-vall ā r insists that “ retribution overtakes the evil doer in the natural course of things, as surely as our shadows follow us.” “ Evil will dog the doer's steps where’er he wends, Destruction thus on evil deeds attends.” In the second part of the Kurrral the noble and rich are told to associate only with the good, to use their time and opportunities well, to cherish their kindred, to seek after friendship, manly activity, and duties on which they can concentrate time and talents.

A timely bene fi t though thing of little worth, The gift itself in excellence transcends the earth. ’Tis never good to let the thought of good things done thee pass away, Of things not good ’tis good to rid thy memory that very day.” The third book of the Kurral, on the “ Pleasures of the Affections,” teaches that “ Love is the ful fi lling of the Law.” \" That breast alone contains a living soul within Which Love inspires. Void of this warmth ‘tis bone and skin. The loveless to themselves belong alone, The loving ones are others’ to the very bone. Is there a bar that can e'en Love restrain ?

The Todas are good.humoured, but dirty and drunken. They have black bushy beards, and are often handsome. Their dress is not unlike that of our Highlanders. They worship the rising sun, and adore their buffaloes, with several other gods, the chief of whom is Hiria-deva, the “ belly- god,” who is a hunting deity. Some of the other tribes look up to, and serve, the Todas. They have celibate priests, and these pour ghee, and milk, but never blood, over their sacred stones (see Kurumbas and Vetal).

They distinguish the Katas or Tardas , who are laymen, from Paikis or Ter ā lis —“ holy ones ” who have to do with the gods. The women are often beautiful, with long thick tresses falling on the neck and shoulders, while the curly black hair of the men is some 6 inches in length. The Morts or “ dairies ” are sacred places which no woman may enter : [a custom also among Bechuanas in S. Africa —E D .]. The chief Toda temple, dedica ted to Truth, appears to con- tain nothing except three or four bells in a niche, and the chief rite is a libation of milk, which is otherwise not used, but left to the calves.

A survival of the ancient custom of shaving the head, .among Phœnician, Egyptian, and other priests (see Nazarite). It is believed to have been a modi fi cation of self-sacri fi ce like circumcision (see Rivers of Life , ii, p. 154). The tonsure rite, performed by a bishop among Roman Catholics, admits to the full privileges of the priesthood ; it must as a rule be renewed every month. The Council of Toledo in 633 A . C ., enacted that all clerics must have a circular tonsure (or “ shaving ”) of the crown of the head. The Quinsext 'Council of 692 A . C . requires even the inferior orders of singers and readers to be tonsured. Rome th en enforced her peculiar tonsure on the Culdees, or primitive hermits of Britain, who shaved the head after an older style, like that of the Greek Church apparently. The new Romanists called the old “ tonsure of St John,” in contempt, that of “ Simon Magus ”: it consisted in shaving the front of the head to a line drawn from the crown to the ears. The Oriental Churches now merely cut the hair of priests short. Monks wear it quite long and tied up on the head like a woman’s hair. Great importance was .attached to the tonsure as indicating obedience to Rome ; but, as the Rev. C. W. King ( Gnostics , 1864, p. 71) justly remarks, the worshipers of Mary preserved in the tonsure, in celibacy of the clergy, in the alb, and in their rites, the customs of the Egyptian priests of Isis in the 2nd century A . C . Tonsure was customary in India in the time of Buddha : for, according to the Dhamma-pada—a writing of the 3rd century B . C .—Buddha cautioned his followers : “ not by tonsure cloes the undisciplined man who speaks falsehood become a Sr ā man ” (Rogers, Buddhist Parables , xix, 264). The Romanist tonsure came to be connected—by its form—with the wafer of the Host, at the Councils of Valencia, Salzburg, and Ravenna (see Notes and Queries , 12th January 1895). It varies in size from 1 inch to 2 2 1 inches according to clerical rank. The London Council in 1258 laid down a rule of tonsure (to be found in the British Museum) to which their clerics were to conform: they were to keep their hair short to show that they renounced the advantages of this life, and aspired only to the dignity of a royal priesthood. The long hair was a sign of temporal royalty (see Hair) : Paul regarded long hair as a shame to a man (1 Cor. xi, 14, 15), and Hebrew Levites were shaved (Num. viii, 7) : so also are Br ā hmans.

The word Totem has come to be popularly us\u001fd as meaning a tribal deity, being inco rrectly adopted from the Algonquin Ote , the Iroquois Ohtara , and the Ottawa Ododarn , for a family badge. The words kit-otem “ thy family mark,” and mind-otem “ my family mark,” have caused Ote to be transformed into Totem. The idea is the same as that of the Australian Kobong. Mr Long—an interpreter among Red Indians—seems to be resp onsible for the term “ Totemism ” in 1792, when describing the well- kuown worship of certain animals and objects. Mr Fraser ( Encyclop. Brit .) says that : “ A totem is a class of natural objects which rude people regard with superstitious respect, believing that there exis ts between them and every member of the class an intimate, and altogeth er special, relation.” A Fetish differs from a Totem as being an object in which some spirit dwells unconnected with any class ideas. [Recent researches. in Australia show that such tribal badges are not always common to all the tribe— individual ones are also recognised. The basis of the idea is that of metempsychosis (see that heading, and also Africa, and Animism). The term is often as misleading as it is incorrect, and would be better avoided.—E D .] Totemism is a primitive attempt to establish a friendly connection with incomprehe nsible, and therefore supernatural, forces. Early savage man thought that beasts, birds, fi sh, and even plants, had blood feuds like himself; and he therefore sought to identify himself, his family, and his clan, with one or more allies, the better to fi ght the battle of life. Thus when claiming af fi nity to a bear (in which perhaps an ancestor’s spirit was reincarnate after death) be expected the aid of all be ars, as belonging to his clan. This usually resulted in the bear be coming a divinity (see Prof. Tylor, Journal Anthrop. Instit ., Aug.-Nov. 1898). The idea is not peculiar to American Indians : it is found in Africa, Australia, Siberia, and wherever the doctrine of transmigration from human into animal forms is known. The Totem animal never injures, but often warns his, ally of danger. Towers. See Fidh. Trakia. Thrakia. Thrace.

Like other Thrakians th e Trojans in time became partly Hellenised, therefore of mixed culture and speech.” The Pelasgian Kaukones (or Kikones) who assisted Priam were Bithynians of Thrakian origin.

The various articles on sacred trees are enumerated in the subject index. Shady or useful trees have been adored by man in all parts of the world from the earliest times. According to Persians the fi rst parents of mankind sprang from the sacred rhubarb tree. The Mongol “ heavenly race ” claimed descent from a tree impregnated by a ray of divine light, as Adonis sprang from the tree Murrha. Rhea was a pomegranate nymph, Phil ū ra a linden, Daphn ē a laurel (or an oleander), Helik ē a willow, Phullis an almond tree in Thrakia, the dryads were oak nymphs, and the Tengus in Japan are forest spirits. The Sioux on the upper Missouri say that the fi rst man and woman were two trees : a snake gnawed the roots and enabled them to walk away. In India we have seen whole villages march forth in gay processions, with banners and music, to some distant sacred tree, encamping round it to worship for several days. The Rev. S. Mateer ( Travanlc ō r ) gives several instances of such tree worship (p. 133). The paradises of the ancients had many sacred trees. The Hebrew Eden had two—the tree of lif e, and the tree of knowledge : the Indian Meru had four : the Greek Hesperid ē s garden had its tree of golden apples : the Chinese spok e of a “ jewelled peach tree in the west ” : the Babylonian wondrous tree was under ocean : the Persea of Egypt was in Amenti : the Moslem speaks of a tree in heaven, and of a bitter thorny tree in hell.

Atus was a fi r tree in Phrygia, and the cones held by Assyrian go ds are usually supposed to be fi r cones, though Dr E. B. Tylor ( Academy , 8th June 1889) regards these as “ the in fl orescence of the male date palm, as it appears when freed from its sheath.” Many ancient deities are symbolised by trees : Zeus by the oak, Ath ē n ē by the olive, or the Ephesian Artemis by a tree trunk. In ancient Egypt (according to Dr F. Petrie) : “ Offerings were made to trees to propitiate the spirit which dwelt in them : the peasant is fi gured bowing to the sycamore in his fi eld, and surrounding it with jars of drink offerings.” On Babylonian gems of the 8th century B . C ., the palm tree is conspicuous, as in the legend of Artemis, or that of Deborah in Palestine. Still in Palestine the oak, the terebinth, the acacia, or the tamarisk, is a sacred tree hung with rags as memorials of visits paid to some shrine hard by (see Quart. Stat. Pal. Expl. Fund , July 1893). On a Thursday, soft music may be heard at such places, and the spirits of the trees may be seen visiting each other, while the tamarisk, as the wind blows it, sighs out Allah ! Allah ! The olive is still the “ source of light and food,” and thus sacred : the palm is the source of the “ water of life ” (or date palm spirit) ; but the fi g and sycamore are the abodes of devils. The Greeks, lacking trees in their rocky land, pictured the Isles of the Blessed in the West as well wooded. The Thessalians offered drenched raiment to the oaken gods (Ovid, Metam ., viii, 741), perhaps in time of drought. The Greco-Phœnicians spoke of the “ winged oak of the universe,” reaching from earth in which were its roots to heaven, its fruits being of the fi re without which nought is begotten. The Romans had groves said to have been made sacred by Numa, and by the laws of the twelve tables . Isaiah speaks of the worship of idols under trees (lvii, 5). In Europe this tree worship survived till the time of Adam of Bremen (11th century A . C .), and he describes (iv, 27) sacri fi ces offered under the sacred oaks, and ashes, at Upsala. The cypress is still a “ tree of joy and grace,” and Mazdeans worshiped two great cypresses in Khorasan—“ the produce of shoots brought by Zoroaster from Paradise.” One was cut down by a Khalif and carried to Baghdad in our 9th century, when it was 1450 years old and 50 ft. in girth (Yule, Marco Polo ). These were connected with the sun and moon; and mediæval legends spoke of two trees in some distant “ earthly paradise ” beyond the sea, one of which was green and fl ourishing, and the other the “ dry tree.” These, according to Buddhists and others, symbolised the married and the ascetik life.

The practical Chinese of to-day—like the Japanese of yesterday—go to sacred trees in sacred gardens to gather fruits which convey every blessing both here and hereafter. An ancient print shows Alexander the Great visiting the two trees of Khorasan already noticed, one of which has the sun on it and the other the moon ; between them is a loftier tree on which sits an angry-looking stork— no doubt a phœnix. Alexander is speaking to the priest of the sun temple which was on a mountain to which 2500 steps led, according to the legend given by Sir H. Yule. The stems of the two trees were clothed in skins of male beasts for the male tree, and of females for the female (or moon) tree : these spoke oracles which none could interpret, while the other sacred tree assured Alexander of victory, but prophesied that he would neve r return to Makedonia. General Cesnola found at Idalion, in Cyprus, a sculpture very like that of the Roman villa at Albano : it represents a tree with a serpent coiled round it attacking its fruits. The Albanian Diana is also represented as a fruit tree. In these cases the phallic signi fi cance appears to be clear. In 1858 we witnessed the worship, or loving reverence, paid by all classes in Vienna to their ancient ash, the “ Stock im Eisen,” now a mere stump dis fi gured by the innumerable nails (see Nails) and ex-votos. It stood till 1891 when it was removed in a skeptikal age. English sacred trees have been many (see Glastonbury), and Skan- dinavians prided themselves on devotion to the “ green tree of Goth- land.” “ No sharp instrument,” says Prof. Holmhoe, “ has ever touched the grand old sacred birch of Bergen, and its roots, at several fetes, and especially at Christmas, were deluged with libations of new beer ” (see Rivers of Life , ii, pp. 409-412). The Frisians held their chief court at the Upstal-baum (“ court tree ”) where the National Assembly met (see Indian Antiq ., August 1886). It is only some six or seven centuries since Prussian s forbade Christians to enter their sacred groves, or to approach their holy wells. The chief fane was at Rikoivt—now Remove—where, under an ancient tree, were busts of the three chief gods, including Perkuno, before whom burned a perpetual fi re of oak logs.

The Gaulish nemeton was a sacred grove ; and Strabo says that “ the Galatian council met in the Dru-nemeton or oak grove ” (xiii, 51). The Roman temple of Jupiter Feretrius on the Capitol marked the site of the sacred oak to which Romulus brought the fi rst Spolia Opima. In England Mr Alien mentions especially the Crouch oak on Walford Greeu in Surrey—a gnarled hollow bole in the centre of the ancient “ ploy- fi eld ” or common. Of the “ twelve apostles ” at Burley near Ringwood only fi ve are left. The “ gospel oak ” at Addleston, near Chertsey, is said to have been so called because Wycliffe preached beside it : but the boundary-marking processions always halted here, while priests read the gospel ; as probably also at the gospel oak of Cheriton. For the “ beating of bounds ” was not merely intended to establish them in the memories of the poor boys who were fl ogged, but also to drive evil spirits beyond the bounds, while the tears of the victims secured the fall of rain when desired. Sacred trees are believed to be haunted by spirits in Japan, Korea, Java, and most countries of the far East. The cannibals of Borneo have such trees. Mr Romilly ( New Guinea , p. 86) says that the natives of the Louisiade group of islands hold their sacred feasts under large trees believed to have so uls : “ A portion of the feast is set aside for them, and pig, and hum an, bones are deeply embedded in their branches.” The Hindu merchant fears to place his shop near a Ficus, or other holy tree, lest it should hear him asking an unjust price for his goods ; but we fi nd little lingams daubed with red under Indian trees, and food is often plac ed near for the tree spirits. Bir ū ni the Arab traveller speaks of trees that bore children instead of fruits. The people of Belgrade still take the sick to holy groves. Virgil sang that “ all sylvan powers were born from the trunks of trees and stubborn oaks.” Hesiod and Hesychius said that men sprang from the ash Phoroneus. The Pelopidæ sprang from the plane (Keary, Prim. Beliefs ). Even Christ in the 13th century was said to be born on the tree of Paradise. In South Africa, according to Galton, “ the tree is the universal progenitor,” different species yielding different animals ; and similar beliefs exist throughout the islands of the Indian Archipelago, in the Philippines, in Polynesia, and in N. and S.

We still plant the ash, hazel, rowan, near our homes to guard us from the evil eye, and the Danes and Norsemen gave the latter its name, as a Runa or “ charm.” In the Vedas, Varuna (or heaven) is said to have “ lifted up the summit of the celestial tree of life,” and to have obtained Soma or Amr ī ta (the drink of immortality) by squeezing its fruit between two stones. Yet the Vedik poets condemned the phallic Sisna-deva rites (Muir, Sanskrit Texts : Müller, Origin and Growth, see Contem- porary Review , October 1879). The phallic meaning of the tree in the midst of the garden, and of the serpent that enticed Eve to taste its fruits, is made clear by Sir G. Cox ( Aryan Mythol .). Tall straight trees especially were sacred, such as the deodar, or deva-d ā ra cedar “ given by God.” The “ healing tree ” on the Nile near Memphis is sacred to Moslem and Christian alike, as are the many specimens of the Dirakht-i-Faz ̣ l (“ tree of grace ”) am ong Persians, these being common near their shrines and tombs. It is death to injure them or even to move a leaf or twig (Yule, Marco Polo , i, p. 124), as also in Palestine where Col. Conder describes the sacred trees beside the Mak ̣ ā ms or “ stations ”—shrines of the peasantry. The trees of the wild Khonds represent the Gr ā ma-devas, or village deities, and the sky god with his earth consort Nadzu-Penu (see Khonds). When starting new public works in Indi a the workmen always plant a sacred tree, and set up their lingam emblems beneath it (see Rivers of Life , i, p. 121, fi g. 40). At weddings the fi rst thing brought into the Hindu’s house is a branch of his fa vourite tree, which is reverently placed on the winnowing fan and then worshiped, all the bread of the household passing over it. The Buddhist equally plants a tree of iria,uguration, under which he may place a small image of Gotama. He clears a space round this tree, and strews it with marigolds and other sacred fl owers. The Balis of Ceylon symbolised Samana their god by the sacred tree Palol, Bagaya, or Kiri-n ā ga, represented beside, or within, a sacred ark (Cunningham, Bhilsa Topes : Rivers of Life , ii, p. 482, fi g. 318).

Hindus recognise sex in trees, but fl owers are feminine, and Deva-d ā si temple girls hold funeral rites over the favourite fl owers of their deities, when the bloom dies. The European Christmas tree has the same origin in the West (see Yggdrasil). Pliny said that the serpent fears the ash tree, and Cornishmen still believe that only an ash plant can kill an adder, while the rowan chip is carried in the pocket as a charm. In the Volsung tale the hero Sigmund spri ngs, however, from the straight poplar tree which was also sacred (see Grimm, Teut. Mythol ., p. 571 : Aryan Mythol ., i, p. 274). But the mother of Phoroneus, the fi re hero of Pelasgoi, was an ash tree. The triple leaves of the ash are plucked by English maidens, and placed in their bosoms, that they may dream of their lovers. Wedding torches of white may, or hazel nuts, are used equally for divining (see Rods). Grimm says that few rustics will injure an ash, and all over Europe it was placed, with the elder and hazel, near the cattle to prevent disease. The Germans call the hazel the “ bewitching tree,” and plant it near houses and courts of justice. They, like Kelts, pass their babes through hoops of hazel, ash, and rowan (mountain ash) to cu re disease (see Fire, and Stones). The blackthorn also is as sacred as the Indian banian tree. Skan- dinavians still say that mistletoe cures epilepsy, and that the ash cures hernia. All these trees are powe rful against poison and snakes. Pilgrims af fi x rags to such sacred trees at Loch Mari, or at the holy well of Helen near Thorpe-arch in Yorkshire, or on many others round Lourdes in France.

Vishnu is said to have come to worship Siva with a thousand fl owers, and missing one, which Siva had hidden, he tore out his own eye (the sun) and placed it in Siva’s forehead, so that like Zeus he became three-eyed. The present Tri-lochan shrine at Banaras stands, says Mr Sherring, on the site of an older temple : whoever worships here for 24 hours without sleep at the Baisakh fête (Easter time), attains spiritual emancipation, and absorption into deity, no matter where he dies. Trinities. The primeval pair in most mythologies are heaven and earth, and their child is the sun. These form a triad or trinity, in Egypt and elsewhere ; and among early Christians, who regarded the Holy Ghost as the mother of Christ, the trinity was of the same character. Three is the sacred perfect number, and Indra was the Tri-deva-pati, or “ triple deity.” Parmenides explained Trinitarian ideas to Greeks long before Plato. Even Egyptian priests, in some mysterious manner, regarded their three deities as being one. Hindus regard the lingam as Tri-murti or “ three formed ” yet one, and as a very ancient emblem of Br ā hma. Siva is Tri-murti as being the Creator, Preserver and Destroyer (see Rivers of Life , ii, plate xv, 5). Kalid ā sa described this triad 1700 years ago : “ In these three persons the one god is known Each fi rst in place, each last, not one alone Of Siva, Vishnu, Br ā hma each may be First, second, third, among the blessed three.” For such trinities Gotama substituted a trinity of ideas—Adi-Buddha, the supreme ancient wisdom, with Dharma or duty, and Sangha, or the congregation of the faithful. This Tri-vatna was like most of his ideas much in advance of the age. Hindus have (like others) many groupings of three, and even Tri-venas, or female trinities, such as Ganga, Yamuna, and Sar ā svati, godesses of three great rivers. It was in a magni fi cent temple of the Tri-pati, or Trinitarian Lord, some 75 miles from Madras to the W. that the author fi rst began to study Indian faiths in earnest.

The Christian dogma of the Trinity only very slowly developed .(see Sabellius) between the 3rd and the 8th centuries. It was an attempt to harmonise the various passages in which the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are noti'ced in the New Testament. The triangle became the emblem of the Triad which Christians sought in the Hebrew scriptures, as when three angels visit Abraham (Gen. xviii), which a mosaic of our 5th century al ready represents. In these days however it was still thought idolatrous to represent deity in human form. In the church of St Felix at Nola (6th century) and in the basilica of Saint Cosmas and Saint Damian, the Father is represented by a hand in a cloud, beside the Dove (for the Holy Spirit), while the Son stands below in the Water of Life. But on a sarcophagus in the Lateran, attributed to the 4th century A . C ., three bearded fi gures are engaged in the creation of Eve (see Smith, Dicty. Christian Antiq .). Christian creeds still proclaim that th ese three are one, but Christians say as little as may be about the mystery created for them in the 4th century. Tri-pitaka. Sanskrit : “ three baskets ” (see Buddha). The Buddhist Bible—a canon of holy writ, revered as the teaching of Gotama, and as the ultimate appeal in all matters of belief and conduct. It is eleven times as long as the Christian Bible, but de- voted to religious questions rather than to myths. Nothing is more striking in this work than the intense individuality of Gotama. The Tri-pitaka appears clearly to be the recension which, according to Buddhists, was settled in 309 B . C ., and approved at their third general council. The Mah ā -vansa states that the sacred books were orally known down to the 1st century B . C ., and the teachers appear to have had no original texts till then. But among the Barh ū t sculptures, supposed to be of the 3rd century B . C ., appears a text giving a sentence of the Vinaya-Pitaka in the Magadha language. This Vin ā ya is the fi rst of the three “ baskets ” or collections, and is divided into fi ve parts.

There was thus no distinction of public and secret teaching, but only an advance from the fi rst simple course of teaching to the higher. Tripolis. Greek : “ triple city.” An important port in N. Syria (see Col. Conder, Heth and Moab , ch. ii). The old name may survive in that of the K ̣ ad ī sha river on which it is built. It was no doubt sacred to Istar as the fi sh godess (see K ̣ adesh), and a relic of her worship survives in the sacred fi sh of the Bedaw ī yeh mosk, S. of the city, which, according to the local legend, went to help the Sultan against the Russians. There is also a tank of the sacred fi sh in the mosk at ’Akka, further S. in Palestine. East of Tripoli is a monastery of the dancing Dervishes, whose ri tes are also described by Col. Conder. Triskelion. Triskele. Triquetra. See Svastika. This is the “ three-legged ” emblem, which appears to represent the sun’s movement. Dr Isaac Taylor regards it as of Phœnician origin (see Notes and Queries , 11th June 1887). It is common on early coins, and in Greece a Gorgonian face so metimes forms the centre round which the three legs revolve. It o ccurs on an electrum coin of Mil ē tos (623 B . C .) with the crescent moon ; in Thrakia also almost as early : in Lukia (Lycia) from 480 B . C . downwards, the feet being represented by cocks’ heads. In Sicily the Triquetra appears in 300 B . C . ; it ap- pears in Britain not only as the emblem of the Isle of Man, but also as the coat of several families (Count d’Alviella, Migrat. of Symbols . 1892). When Alexander III of Scotland expelled the last Norman ruler from the Isle of Man in 1264, and King Hako was forced to cede it to Scotland, the Norse standard of the ship was replaced by the Sicilian emblem, Sicily having been accepted by Henry III, the father-in-law of Alexander, on behalf of his son the Duke of Lancaster.

The legend related that Ilos was guided by “ a cow of many colors ” to this hill of the Phrygian godess At ē , and that Zeus threw down from heaven the Palladium—or image of Pallas Ath ē n ē —which fell before the entrance of his tent and fi xed the site of his town. Sir G. Cox regards this stone as a lingam. Homer ( Iliad , v, 215) calls Ilion a city of Merop men, apparently “ dispersed ” fugitives. The Trojans were of Thrakian origin (see Trakia) and like other Mysians and Phrygians had migrated from the Danube. Roman writers distinguish two races—the Teucri, and the Phrygians—in Troy, both however apparently Aryans. [The discoveries of Schliemann repr esent at least seven consecutive cities on this site, the oldest being 50 feet from the surface. In the fi rst city were found axe heads of diorite and jade : in the second the skeleton of a girl standing erect : she was round headed with prognathous jaws, and must have belonged to quite a different race to that represented by a skull of the third city—probably a Turanian race followed by Aryans. The third or “ burnt ” city, supposed to be that of Homeric poems, contained evidence of wide trading relations represented by Egyptian porcelain and glass : hæmatite sling bullets as in Assyria : ivory, gold, silver, copper, with weights, and short early inscriptions in the “ Asianic syllabary ” script. No less than 9000 gold objects we re found, including goblets, diadems, bracelets, earrings, etc. The skulls of this period are long headed. In the fourth city inscribed texts occur. In the 5th, an axe head is of white jade, such as is now not known except in Central Asia. In the 6th city the so-called “ Lydian ” pottery resembles that of Etruria.

The sweet basil is a sacred plant and royal shrub. It was said to grow best when cursed and mocked. It was holy in East and West alike. The Hindus say that Krishna wedded the Tulsi ; and Roumanians, and Bohemians, use bunches of basil to drive away evil ; while—sprinkled with holy water, duly salted—it puri fi es persons and houses. It is called in Hindu dialects the Turals ī or Sulas ā , and was one of the “ mothers of the world ” (Jagan-M ā tara) whereby Vishnu created the earth (see Indian Antiq ., Jan. 1880). In the Arabian Nights we fi nd ladies of Baghd ā d speaking of the Tulsi (or basil) as an emblem of the Yoni. It has myrtle-like leaves and clustering fl owers. It is often found in pots in women’s apartments in Indi a; and the legend says that Tulsi was a woman who loved Vishnu, and was cursed by his wife Lakshmi, but comforted when he vowed to remain ever near her as the S ā lagr ā ma stone (see that heading). He nce the presence of the Tulsi plant secures that of Vishnu. It is planted in cow dung, and watered if possible with holy Ganges water ; lamps are lit near it, and, in the hot season, water is made to drip on it (as on lingams) from a vessel fi xed above it. As a charm it is placed near the dying and the dead, and when the plant itself dies it is reverently carried to a sacred river or lake, and consigned to the waters. Tum.

Tunguse. A widespread Turanian stock between the shores of the Paci fi c and the river Yenisei. They are akin to the Manchus, and number about 80,000 persons. They are great fur hunters and fi shers, living in tents of skins. Castren calls them the “ nobility of Siberia,” and they bear a good reputation for .honesty. The cradle of the race, as a distlnct stock, was near 'Lake Baika1 in Centrai Asia. The Chinese called them Tong-hu, or “ red men,” and Mr Vining compares the Tunguse and Samoyed races to the red men of America. The term Tungu however, in Chinese, is a “ pig,” and the Shaman rites are often preceded by sacri fi ces of pigs, the plains and forests near the Am ū r river abounding in wild pigs. The Tong-hu are fi rst noticed in Chinese records about 1100 B . C ., ruling as Sushin, and Kitans. The historian Tsa says that they were then the strongest race in Tartary ; but they were powerless against China in our 3rd century, and by the 9th the Turks and Mongol Shad mastered them. Hum- boldt noticed the striking resembla nce of the Tunguse and Red Indian physical types, and he speaks of “ a monument about 900 leagues from Montreal ” with “ Tartar characters ” (Vining, Inglorious Columbus , p.23). Turan. See Etruskans. Turanians. This term is taken from Turan (“ nomads ”), a Turkish word which is used in the Shah-namah of the inhabitants of Central Asia, N. of the Iranian Persians (see Tar). We urged as early as 1877 that the fi rst civilisers of Asia were of this Turanian or Mongolic race. The suggestion has since. been followed out by various scholars ; and Sir H.. Rawlinson showed that the Akkadians of Mesopotamia were Turanians, speaking an agglutinative language (see Diagram in Rivers of Life , ii, p. 548). The term includes not only the Turks, Mongols, Chinese, Finns, and others of the north, but the Kolarians and Dr ā vidians, Malays, and Siamese of the south, whose languages are all agglutinative, and ultimately connected. In Europe the Hungarians, Basques, Finns, Lapps, and Ugrians, represent this stock, which was also present in Italy in the Etruskans as early at least as 1000 B . C . Col. Cander however (“ Comparison of Asiatic Languages,” Trans. Victoria Institute , xxvii, 1895) holds that the roots of all human speech are the same in the simplest cases, amount- ing to some 200 in all.

A sucking sound connected with Pu . These aboriginal Toots are most. clearly traced in early agglutin- ative speech; but, as will be seen fr om the articles in this work, they are recognisable even in in fl ectional languages asactual roots of Aryan and Semitic tongues. Col. Conder would place the homes of the three Asiatic stocks Turanian, Aryan, and Semitic, within a radius of some 500 miles from a centre near Mt. Ararat. The true origin of speech was undoubtedly man’s imitation of natural sounds, and this explanation covers even the dif fi cult case of words for sight and light. The original Turanian stock, which preserves the old roots, is now only represented in Europe by some 14 millions, including 6 million Magyars, 2 million Permians on the Dvina, 3 million Lapps and Finns, with other scattered Tartars, Basques, etc. But in Asia the gr eat majority of the population is Turanian.

Turtle. In mythology an important emblem of creative power— the Hindu Kurma (see Vishnu). Kurm a is the foundation, at the bottom of the Sea of Milk, on which the creative pillar is reared, in the Satya Y ū ga or “ age of reality.” He is called also Kaura, Kach- cha-pa, and Kasyapa, being thus the “ fi rst born of time,” the Ā ditya or “ illimitable.” Vishnu sits on the lo tus at the top of the Mandara, or shaft of the world, which rests on the back of Kurma “ the maker.” Vishnu the creator, and “ Kama the turtle-shaped one,” are noticed in the Yaj ū r Veda, and the original of the Pur ā na legend is to be found in the Satapatha Br ā hmana as early as 600 B . C . Kachcha-pa is called the fi rst of the nine treasures ( Nidhi ) of K ū vera the god of wealth. The turtle is equally important in Chinese mythology as a symbol of enduring power. On a Kassite boundary stone of the 11th century B . C ., the turtle appears to take the place of the, zodiakal crab (see Zodiak). Tvashtri. Tvaksh-tri. The Hindu Vulcan, the smith who forges the weapons of the gods, such as the golden dart of Surya, the iron battle-axe of Brihas-pati, the thunderbolts of Indra. Tvashtri was fi re, the warmth without which nothing can germinate. He is called beautiful, skilful, multiform, and is identical with Savitri the “ vivifying ” heat. He created the Lord of all, and Agni in his mani- festation. He was the “ fi rst born\" and lord of wealth, before K ū vera was known. He is Visva-karma “ maker of all,” and Praj ā -pati “ lord of creatures.” His twin children are Tri-siras the “ three-headed ” son, and Saranyi his daughter. Tri-siras, as Visva-rupa, or “ all shaped,” was slain by Indra. Typhon. Typh ō eus.

The symbol of Uat was the green color of vegetation due to water ; and the sounds ua , a , va , ma , in African, Polynesian, American, and Asiatic speech alike, signify “ water.” Thus ma-a is the “ water abode ” or boat.

Canon Isaac Taylor re- gards them as appearing as early as 2600 B . C .; being the third Neo- lithik horde (see Neolithik). They were a tall, strong people with heads of medium width—like Teutons. They buried the dead in barrows, and have been regarded as ancestors of the Romans (see Contemporary Review , August 1890). About 2000 B . C ., they ap- pear to have lived on acorns and nuts (as shown by the prehistoric remains of N. Italy), and became ac quainted with bronze, while in the mounds of the Terra-mare villages we fi nd barley, wheat, fl ax, and even woven materials, tanned le ather, bone and bronze pins, fi sh-hooks, and spear-heads, to have been known. The Umbri, penetrating S. found the W. coasts of Italy held by Pelasgik Sikuloi, and Liburnians, driven W. from their homes by I llyrians, Panoni, and Veneti. The Umbri, opposed by Turanian Etruskans, maintained themselves in the Apennine mountains, on the E. of th e Tiber, from Ariminum to Fanum Fortunæ, and even to Capua. They created the states of the Sabines and Samnites, and preserved their own law and rites even to the Christian era (Toland, Druids , pp. 128-292).

Brown ( The Unicorn , 1881), had three legs, three eyes, and a hollow horn of gold, like the mythical ass of the Persians (see Onolatria). Union Islands. A group of islands some 300 miles N. of Samoa (see Tokelau). The king alone, as the high priest, was allowed to undress and dress the stone representing the supreme god Tui, and this he was bound to do annually. The stone was 14 ft. high, and was seen by Wilkins in 1841, in the centre of the island of Faka-ofu, so-called after the third god of the local trinity, the second being Samoau whose stone was smaller than that of Tokelau or Tui, which was covered with mats (Mr Lister, Journal Anthrop. Instit ., August 1891), but was fi nally destroyed by a white missionary. The term lenga (or lingam) was used of these stones according to Dr Turner. The sick washed in water that, had touched them, or crawled to die in their shadow. Tokelau gave health or disease according to the con- duct of his children : the fi rst fruits of fi eld and sea were offered to him, and his little temples were hung with pe arl shells and precious objects. The regular rites, conducted by the king, included the unction of the stone decked with fl owers. The monarch sat before it dressed—like the stone—in leaves of the cocoanut palm, so precious to the people and. sacred to the god, of whom he was the name-child and vice- gerent.

The Faki or octopus was the god of many families in Faka-ofu. The legend of the Union Islanders relates that, in the beginning, two divine men—Kava and Singano—came forth from stones, and from them sprang also Tiki an incarnation of Tui who “ upholds the islands and the heavens, and rules the living and the dead.” Tangaia, the fi rst woman, rose from the earth, into which Tiki had thrust a bone : she was therefore called Ivi or “ bone.” From Tiki and Ivi came Lu, who raised the heavens above the earth, ordered the winds and rains, formed the islands and clothed them with vegetation. The people seem to know nothing of future punishment, but only of various heavens—kings and priests going to the moon, and others to more distant regions wh ere also God is found, and where eternal feasts, dances, and enjoymen t may be expected.

Upanishads. Sanskrit : “ sessions.” The scriptures of the second, orphilosophic, stage of. Brahmanism. They are often added to the Br ā hmana commentaries on the Vedas, and form the founda- tion of the Hindu schools of philo sophy (see Darsanas), though they are mystical speculations rather than real seekings after truth. Max Miiller calls “ the Vedas the childhood, the Br ā hmanas the busy man- hood, and the Upanishads the old age of Hinduism.” The earliest Upanishad is supposed to be not later than 700 B . C ., and most of them to be as early as 600 B . C . Hindus call them “ works that destroy ignorance ”—a “ setting down ” rather than a “ sitting down upon,” or “ session.” They strive to show that religion embraces all science, or—as Feuerbach de fi nes it—that : “ Religion is knowledge.” They say that : “ Apart from Br ā hma there is no reality. . . . He who understands and believes this is freed from the trials, and evils, of transmigration, and will rest with Br ā hma in eternal bliss. . . . No works, religions, rites, study, or knowledge even of the Vedas, but only contemplation, and faith, will insure this, and the attainment of this state is impossible as long as the mi nd or body is engrossed with, and wedded to, worldly or sensual matters .” It was amid such teaching that Gotama Buddha grew up in Kapila-vast ū ; but he parted company later with the mystics. The K ā tnaka Upanishad likens the soul to one who drives in a car, which is the body drawn by the senses as horses : the charioteer is the in tellect; and the guiding reins are manas or purposes. He who allows his will to be guided by the horses “ will not advance, or will turn asid e from the road to the city of Immortality.” The soul however can only proceed according to the capacity of the horses, and is much at their mercy ; for they are what their trainer made them, and liable, in spite of the reins, to run riot at times. The author of the Kena Upanishad tells us that “ the true knowledge of the supreme spirit (or soul) consists in the consciousness which man acquires of his incapacity to understand it ” ; but Buddha and Confucius more wisely exhorted men to, leave alone what they could inot comprehend."},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"Upa Vedas 461 The K ā thaka Upanishad, and others, teach—according to Prof. Whitney—that after death the worthy who have attained to true knowledge enjoy a heaven of eternal happiness. The unworthy are condemned to return to eart hly existence. Dr Pope ( Indian Antiq ., Sept. 1888) thinks that one short text in the Chandogya Upanishad has perhaps in fl uenced thought “ more than any utterance of human speech ” ; it consists of three words only, Tad tvam asi , “ Thou art It.” Thousands of verses, in Tamil and other S. Indian languages, have been composed on this text, as summing up the three questions “ What is man ? what is the Supreme ? and what is man’s relation to Him ? ” The oldest Upanishads occur at the end of the Aranyakas or “ forest books,” which are manuals for the aged Br ā hman who is trying to understand the Atman, “self,” or “ soul.” Max Müller ( Hibbert Lect ., 1878) says that “ the keynote of the Upanishads ” is this attempt at self-knowledge, and through the true self they strove to understand the “ eternal self,” or soul of the universe. But we are as far from understanding this still as were the earliest Indian philosophers. They taught howeve r that rites, prayers, and sacri fi ces, availed nothing, only the “ higher knowledge ” being of any use to man. The Devas or gods were converted into Pr ā nas or vital spirits, but the philosophy of the Upanishads continued to be much tainted by mysticism, and was not reduced to any fi nal system. Max Müller ( Sacred Books of the East , i and xv) has translated eleven of the Upanishads. None of these contain any historical indications to show that they are more ancient than Buddhism. The Chandogya teaches Pantheism, making the soul part of the universal soul which alone is real, existing from the beginning and forever—vain words on matters as to which man knows nothing. The mystics make Om a “ subject for concentration of the highest thought ” ; but Gotama Buddha cast aside such useless speculations, to help the miserable with sympathy, yet had gleaned much from the Upanishads which aided and guided him in his work for suffering humanity.

Men dressed up in straw, as bears, hunted women at many popular fêtes : the straw was pulled off and put into the nests of hens to make them lay. The hair of bears was mixed in ointment as a philtre. The Greeks said that Paris, and Atalanta, were suckled by bears, and the virgin priestesse s of Artemis were called bears. Bears also play blind man’s buff with mice, which change into maidens. The hero of a Norse legend (whence “ Beauty and the Beast ” is derived) is a bear by day and a beautiful youth by night (as Eros was said to be a monster by the sisters of Psukh ē ), and —like Eros—he fl ees when the bride brings a light to look at him. The Christian legend makes Ursula a “ little bear ” (see Ursel), and Russian legends say th at bears become the fathers of heroes when maidens seek their dens ( Zool. Mythol ., ii, p. 118). The daughter of the Danish king Kanute is said to have been thrown into a bear’s den.

This City appears to have been the capital of Yukatan, still fl ourishing some 900 years before the Spanish conquest (see Dr Brinton, Maya Chronicles , p. 127). Its great Teo-kalli, “ god- house ” or temple, was a pyramid in three or more terraces of earth, with steps in front and in rear, walled round with shrines at its foot. On one façade, “ above the doors of the House of the Monks,” were niches with seated fi gures, very like those of Buddha, and crowned with solar aureoles : they appear to have re presented the peaceful god Kuetzal- koatl (see Mr Vining’s Inglorious Columbus , pp. 594, 595). These images are preserved by the drawings of M. de Waldeck, the artist sent out by Lord Kingsborough when preparing his great work on Mexican antiquities. Eight niches in all are noticed, two being “ on the façade of the House of the Nuns ” (see Azteks, Mexico, Palenque). At the base of one of these niches are remarkable groups of tigers placed back to back—as also at Palenque—to form the throne of the god, just as in Ba rmese or Siamese representations of the “ lion throne ” of Buddha. Over the “ House of the Governor,” as at Palenque, elephants’ trunks also appear, as well as at other sites in Yukatan. The Uxmal buildings are faced with well-cut stones not set in cement, and appear to be older than the stucco work of Palenque. Uz. Hebrew ’ A ū s ̣ . The desert region round Petra in Edom (see Job).

Long after, they passed again by the plac e, sought the child, and found him “ well and lively, playing with the fl ames of a sacri fi cial fi re.” His devoted followers raised a temple on the spot in after years, and this is still suitably maintained. Thus his birth and childhood are sur- rounded with the usual legends abo ut divine babes. His story, written in the Bhrigu dialect, relate s that, at the age of seven, he had oread the 4 Vedas, the 6 Darsanas, and the 18 Pur ā nas, which would he a lifelong labour for mature scholars. At the age of 12 he had formulated a revised Vishn ū va creed, on the lines of Vishnu-sv ā mi. His father then died ; and he left his mother, and his home at Gokul —the birthplace of Krishna near Mattra—to travel in S. India, dis- puting with the learned, and astonishing all. At Vij ā ya-nagar he converted many, including the Raja, and was accepted as a Vishn ū va leader or Ach ā rya. He accepted payment of his expenses, but lived ascetically. At Ujjain he dwelt long under a sacred Pipal tree, like Buddha. He had huts also at Mattra, Allahab ā d, Ban ā ras, Badri- Ked ā r, Hari-dv ā r, and Bindrab ā d, where the god Krishna appeared to him and commanded him to worship himself as B ā la-g ō p ā la, “ the child cowherd,” or rather the fat little dwarf. The new creed was propagated widely in W. India, under the title of Rudra-sam-pr ā daya, or “ tra- ditional Rudra cult.” Vallabha the Ach ā rya was himself pure and simple—a student innocent of the wild passionate world around him, immersed in leamed commentaries on the Bh ā gavad-gita, and Bh ā gavad- Pur ā na, which are now regarded as “ scriptures equally sacred with the Vedas.” He was a Vedantist who believed fully in dualism (see R ā ma- n ū ja); but he saw in the story of Krishna, Radha, and the Gopis (see Krishna) only allegories which described the longing of the human soul for the universal (see Sir Monier Williams, Journal Rl. Asiatic Socy ., July 1882, p. 308). He was an Indian Epikouros ; but the corrup- tion of his teaching led to greater de gradation than that of Epicureans. The sensualists who accepted him ca red little for his philosophy. He remained intent on study at Ban ā ras, as the husband of one wife, educating his two sons Gopi-n ā tha (born in 1511), and Vithal-n ā tha (born in 1516), being an able and strong-minded man, but the teacher of a faith which produced many excesses. He withdrew fi nally, as a Sany ā si, to a hill near Ban ā ras, and died at the early age of 52, bear- ing the reputation of a good man, and saint.

The rich, idle, and sensuous, how- ever, singled out texts from the writin gs of this pious thinker to justify their favourite vices ; and initiated gross rites on the plea that they were imitating Krishna. Their Go-svamis, or Gosains, thus made claims similar to those of the feudal lords of France (see Gosains), and under the leadership of Vitthal-n ā th, or of his seven sons, the sect became grossly licentious, in spite of many attempts at reform made by pions Hindus. They established themselves in W. India, between Bombay and Gokul, from Ujjain on the S. to Dvarka on the north. A stern puritan (see Nar ā yana-svami) issued 212 excellent precepts for conduct, in 1815, which no doubt did good among thinking men. But the best check on such vices is found in modern schooling, and in exposure by courts of law. There are still some 60 or 70 Go-svami “ lords of cows ” in India, among the Maha-rajas : of these six are at Gokul, three in enlightened Bombay, and one or two in each city of ancient Sur ā shtra.

His functions dated back however to the earliest ages of sacri fi ce in Vedik times, of which there are clear indications even in the Rig Veda (see Sacred Books of East , XII, xii, xv). One passage (Rig Veda IV, 1, 8) which has been regarded as a later interpolation—for the Vedas like all other Bibles have thus suffered—gives us the words of the holy Rishi V ā ma-deva : “ That king with whom the Br ā hman walks in front lives well established ” ; but it was not so in his days, for elsewhere we hear how V ā ma when hungry “ cooked the entrails of a dog,” which no one of respectable caste would now do even to save his life. The dif fi culties which are encountered in the study of works which, though regarded as divinely inspired, contain many incon- .sistencies, are similar to those found in other Bibles. Thus the white Yaj ū r Veda is called the V ā ja-saneyi-sanhit ā , after an author supposed to have lived about 1200 B .

The ages of other Rishis are equally doubtful, and we cannot even be sure that honorary titles and patronymics do not appear as historical names (see Sacred Books of East , ii, p. 15).

Putting aside the questi on of the heroic ages, and that of the seven Rishis of unknown lineage connected with the seven stars of the Great Bear, we still depend on epiks of the 6th century for quasi- historical personages, supposed to have lived between 2400 and 1000 B . C ., belonging to the great lunar race descended from Soma the moon. Pulastya the “ mind born ” son of Br ā hma is said to be a contemporary of Parasara. Visravas, who married a daughter of the Vedik sage Bh ā rad-vaja, was a son of Pulastya, or his “ half shadow.” He may therefore have lived as late as 500 B . C . Yet his father-in- law is made contemporary with Bh ā rata and R ā ma, receiving the latter in his hermitage. The anachronisms are equal to those of the Talmud. Agastya is associated with the divine Vasishtha ; but, as revered by Dr ā vidians, who called him the fi rst teacher of science and literature, he may—according to Dr Wilson and Dr Caldwell—have “ lived perhaps in the 7th or 6th century B .

C . (see P ā nini). This may suf fi ce to show the uncertainties that surround the traditional chronology of the Vedas. The Vedik poems give us the primitive religion of a people to whom the art of writing was unknown. It is the Bible of dwellers on the Indus, and may have begun to take shape in the memories of bards and priests as early as 1500 or 1000 B . C ., while as yet there were no Aryans in India. The tenth chapter of the Rig Veda, usually regarded as the latest part of all, makes a single allusion to four classes—Br ā hmans, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sudras—which as yet had not become castes. It makes no allusion to the great N ā ga tribes of N. India, or to any Sakyas or Y ā vanas (Scythians and Greeks) : the word Br ā hman is used several times to mean an “ intelligent ” person. Kshatra means “ valour,” and the Vaisyas are the middle class. Though much mixed with eternal be ings, the Kshatriya are “ valiant red ones,” the Br ā hmans are “ intelligent white ones,” the Vaisyas are “ yellow subjects ” or “ people,” perhaps Mongols, while Sudras are the labouring class. The cosmogony of this system makes the fi rst"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"Vedas 475 two to be sons of Pit ā -mah “ the great father,” while the rest are derived, together with all animals, from various wives of Kasyapa or the “ sun.” Mr H. H. Dhruva (as already quoted) thinks that “ Turanians of Chinese-Mongolian stock may have been the fi rst colonists,” and thus, we may suppose , the “ yellow subjects ” of the Kshatriyas. Many useful hints as to age may be obtained by internal study of the Vedas, especially as regards the use or non-use of certain terms. Only two seasons of the ye ar appear to be distinguished— the hot and the cold—indicating nomads who were not as yet agriculturists. The word Prana for the “ breath ” or “ life ” is found, but such terms as Atman, Nirv ā na, Moksha, etc., belonging to a later philosophy, are absent. The geography of the Rig-Veda includes the ten rivers, mentioned in one passage (chap. x) which is suspected as being a later interpola- tion ; these are the Indus with its fi ve tributaries, the Sar ā svati, Sar ā yu, Ganges, and Yamuna. The Galldh ā ri region lies between the K ̣ abul and Kurmu rivers ; and the Delhi district is mentioned ; but there is no notice of Panch ā la, or of other states to E. and S.E. Some of the later Hindu gods and heroes are noti ced, but bear characters different from those attributed to them in the epiks or the Pur ā nas (see Indra, and Vishnu) : R ā ma is a powerful Asura (or “ ungodly ”) king : Sita is the ploughed land : Vena is a writer of Vedik hymns. Chariots, and even four-wheeled cars, are noti ced [the four-wheeled car is found on early Babylonian cylinders—E D .], these belonging to the Turanian hero kings. The later caste objection to the skins of dead animals did not exist in early Vedik times, for leather bags are noticed as used for drinking water ; the Chamb ā rs and Chandals—castes employed in tanning—would not then have been regarded as impure. All these points favour the antiquity of the hymns, as does the connection with the mythology of the Mazd ē ans of Persia (see Shah-namah). The second Vedik age (1200 to 1000 B . C .) is that of the two later Vedas. The songs, chants, and charms (Mantras) of the early Rishis is now give way to the measured prose of sacri fi cial ritual, which was elaborated later in the Br ā hmanas. In the White Yaj ū r Veda (or V ā jasenyi as Indian scholars call it) the word Deva now means a “ god,” and Ā sura a “ demon,” marking the divergence from the Mazd ē an system where Deva is a “ demon ” and Ah ū ra a “ god ” ; yet As ū ra occasionally means an “ overthrower of the enemy ” possessed of Pr ā na or “ spirit.” In both the White (Sukla) and the Black (Krishna) Yaj ū r Veda there is mention of four castes : of Siva as Sata- Rudriya ; and of Vishnu as Y ā jna. But Brahm ā is absent, the creator being either Praj ā pati (“ lord of creatures ”) or Visva-karma"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"Vedas 476 (“ the maker of all ”). The latter takes off an eighth of the sun’s light wherewith to enlighten man as to religion and art. Praj ā pati offers up all the worlds in a “ general sacri fi ce ” (Sarva-Medha), and fi nally (like Odin) sacri fi ces himself. The tribes are now located in the Upper Panj ā b, and have spread further E. and S. The Tritsus, or Ā ryas of the 4th class, are found in Kuru-Kshatra or the “ kingdom of the Kurus ” (see Kums). Ascetici sm appears, as practised even at royal courts by such men as Y ā jna-valkya or V ā ja-saneya, who claimed to be a disciple of the great Rishi named Uddalaka Aruni, of Kuru- Panch ā la. The latter however is said in the Mah ā -bh ā rata (i, 4723) to have lived “ not long ago ” (see Sacred Books of East , xii, p. xliii), which might mean 600 or 700 B . C . This Y ā jna-valkya is a reputed author (but perhaps only an “ arranger ”) of the White Yaj ū r Veda, called after him the V ā ja-saneyi Sanhit ā . It is probable that his/ Jaina asceticism led to the apparent schism of the White and Black schools. He probably either originated, or was the inspirer of those who composed, the Satapatha-Br ā hmana, in which a remarkable dialogue is given between Y ā jna-valkya and certain Br ā hmans of the court of Janaka, king of Videha (and father of Sita), the Br ā hmans being silenced by the Jaina argument s of the ascetik. It is notable chronologically that a Janaka was contemporary with Aj ā tasatru king of K ā si about 470 B . C . All Bibles take centuries to mature, and this “ arranger ” was apparently the Ezra of the White Veda, writing out the Smrita or “ tradition,” and the Brihad-Aranyka. His friends, if not his teachers, were the famous sages B ā shkali and Vaisamp ā yana— a pupil of Veda-Vy ā sa,—and none of these were free from the taint of a gradually growing ascetik mysticism. Perhaps in this age India fi rst learned to regard the ascetiks as “ respectable people,” though Br ā hmans—now beginning to persecute those who did not accept their authority—called them “ wretches who should be thrown to wolves.” The legendary dialogue says that when Y ā jna-valkya boldly withstood the Br ā hman Vidagdha-S ā kalya the latter was silenced : “ his head dropped off, and his bones disappeared .” The ascetik called on all to seek peace, by retirement from the world for meditation and penance, and preached also to his own wives Maitreyi, and K ā ty ā n ī , thus—for the fi rst time perhaps—giving women a share in religious work, as Buddha did later, or was then doing. But it is impossible to suppose that anyone imbued with Jaina ideas, as Y ā jna-valkya here appears to have been, could be the author of the whole of the White Yaj ū r Veda, for it abounds in sacri fi cial formulæ, such as those of the Asva- medha, or “ horse sacri fi ce,” prescribed for each season of the year. These were familiar to Br ā hmans when the epiks were written. The"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"Vedas 477 seasons are six, with 12 months, so that the people had now settled down to agriculture. The Black Yaj ū r Veda was rejected by many learned Br ā hmans, as forming no part of the true Ve dik canon. Some class it with the Br ā hmanas, but the modern Arya-Som ā j writers (see that heading) even call it “ a composition of the Dr ā vidas of Tellingana in Karnatika, or of immigrants from far western countries ” (Mr Dhruva, as quoted above, p. 217). It is well to re member that the great teacher Apastamba, already noticed, was a native of Karnatika, on whom scholars place much reliance (see Dr Bühler, Sacred Books of East , ii). The view that Dr ā vids contributed to Vedik literature, which thus appears to be gaining ground, has been held by us for many years, and is one which raises many important questions. The second Vedik period closes with the Ā th ā rva Veda ascribed to 1000 B . C . We are inclined to suppose however that it was composed mainly, if not altogether, by Par ā sara who, as we have seen, is placed by some as late as 575 B . C . He is confused with the great Jaina saint (Parsva), but, if a pupil of Kapila, he would have lived about the 8th century B . C . It took many centuries however before the Vedik canon was de fi nitely fi xed, and the Scriptures cannot have escaped from many al terations and additions in later ages. In the Ā th ā rva Veda we read of the wars of the Devas and Ā suras ; Br ā hmans have become powerful, and the Ā sura sects are called Vr ā tyas or “ heretics.” The Ā th ā rva is essentially the Br ā hman Veda, and its verses are called Br ā hman ī . It opens with the blessings and curses of Br ā hma, developing a truly ecclesiastic and dogmatic vigour. The Suparnas (o r “ beautiful winged ”) become heretics called “ Western S ā lvas, speakers of a fi lthy language . . . followers of a prophet Zarat-statra ” (whom Mr Dhruva identi fi es with Zarathustra, or Zoroaster) ; while their Ā sura deity is the Persian Ah ū ra. Acquaintance with Persia may date from the time of Darius 1, about 520 B . C . The Creator in the Ā th ā rva Veda is Br ā hma, producing a trinity of words, elements, and Vedik gods. In this work the Angiras are full of Brahm ā -Vidya, or “ divine knowledge,” derived from Satya-vaha, the father of Drona, who is, in the Epiks, a contemporary of R ā ma—which tends to complicate the chronology. This fourth Veda ho wever marks the transitional age between Br ā hmanas and Sutras, as the Yaj ū r Veda marks that from the primitive hymns to the Br ā hmanas. In it R ā ma, Sita, and Krishna all appear, but are associated still with the Ā suras, and Krishna with Kesi, a demon whom, on the contrary, he kills according to the Epik, and the Pur ā nas. Indian mythology thus seems to have now mingled with that"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"Vedas 478 of the Aryas. The atmosphere of this Veda is charged with the same elements found in the Mah ā -bh ā rata, and furnishes the materials from which that great Epik was composed in the 6th century B . C . The terms Dharma and Pur ā na are already used, and the four Yugas , or world cycles, are noticed for the fi rst time. The 10th and 11th hymns are full of cosmogonic ideas, monotheistic speculations, and philosophical teaching. From the 6t h chapter we learn that the race has become agricultural, Indra being said to have taught men how to sow barley on the banks of the Sar ā svati river; but as yet Panch ā la is an unknown region in the Ganges valley, fi rst noticed in the Sata-patha, or “ hundred path,” Br ā hmana. The Br ā hmana Period (900 to 600 B . C .) represents the age of commentaries on the now sacred Vedas (see Br ā hmanas). These works are full of good religious te aching, setting forth established religion and philosophy, and overthro wing many superstitions. They built up schools of learning in citi es and temples. The Aryan colonists bad by this time spread E. to Kan ō j, which was a Dr ā vidian capital about 800 B . C . Many native, and a few European, scholars seem to think that a few of the Br ā hmanas are older than the Black Yaj ū r, and the Ā th ā rva, Vedas, especially the fi rst six chapters of the Aitareya, with the Kaushitaki, and Tandya, Br ā hmanas. The Kaushitaki- Br ā hmano-Upanishad (to give its full title) is as a whole probably the earliest, and includes the Sakha recension of the Rig Veda, with an Upanishad, and an Aranyaka. The reputed author, Sankh ā yana, also wrote the Srauta Sutras, and perhaps the K ā ma Sutra. All the earlier literature is noticed in the Ka ushitaki, which discourses also on Br ā hma-loka or heaven, on Pr ā na-vidya and Atman-vidya, or knowledge of the spirit and soul. The Ā sura is now called a Rakshasa or demon, and Aruni, one of the great Rishis, is said to have striven to gain “ a true knowledge ” concerning men’s souls. The mythology of the Epiks and Pur ā nas is foreshadowed, K ā si (Ban ā ras), Videha, Kuru-kshatra, and the two Panch ā las, are familiarly noticed in the geography. The Tandya, which is the last of the fi rst group of Br ā hmanas, is considered .the most important of eight concerned with the Sama Veda. The Satapatha tells us much of all the central Gangetic states, gives us legends of Manu, whom “ Vis hnu the supreme saved from a fl ood,” and also gives the germs of the stories whence the fi sh, and turtle, incarnations of Vishnu developed. Andhras, Pandias, and Sabaras, now appear on the scene; fi re worship and asceticism are mentioned side by side. It speaks as we have seen of Y ā jna-valkya, who appears to have contributed to its fi rst fi ve books, but is not mentioned in the next fi ve. For here, says Prof. Eggeling : “ occurs a complete disagreement,"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"Vedas 479 doctrinal, geographical, and mythological.” Some of the authors wrote apparently in the W. and some knew the Ganges regions. This Sata- patha Br ā hmana is important as giving the fi rst indication of the existence of written books. In it we fi nd the word likh , which origin- ally meant “ drawing lines ” ; and vachnait “ he reads out ” occurs .often in this and in the Taithriya Br ā hmana. The ancient hymns had so far been known only as Veda or “ knowledge,” but in this work they become Sruti , or that which holy men of old “ heard ” from the mouth of God. It was a period when, as Max Muller says, “ through the in fl uence of Bhrigus, and Angiras (see these headings) the magic formulas of the Ath ā rvans (or “ fi re priests ”) had been acknuwledged essential.” The Taithriya Br ā hmana elaborates this fi re-worship yet further, and for the fi rst time speaks of Br ā hmans as a divine class, and of Sudras as Ā sura-varna—a “ godless ” or “ demon breed.” It speaks of a certain Gautama ; it relates the story of Sil ā , the loves of Soma, and the intercession of Praj ā pati. The Mimansa philosophy also now appears (see Darsanas), but the Ram ā yana epik is not noticed. It alludes to the Dr ā vidian states on the Karnatik coast, and further south. It develops the trinity of Agni, Indra, and Visva-deva, already mentioned in the Satapatha. The three fi rst castes are recognised, and the Br ā hman is sometimes called Br ī has-pati, or “ Lord of prayer.” As above stated the fi rst six chapters of the Aitareya Br ā hmana are placed some four or fi ve generations earlier than the rest of the work. The whole is a commentary on the Rig Veda, sometimes called after its great promulgator, Asvalayana who wrote about 380 B . C . Saunaka his preceptor taught (from the Ā th ā rva Veda) that there were four distinct castes ; and the hard and fast rules of this system may date only from his time. The Aitereya treats only of northern peoples, such as Uttara-Kurus, and Madras : the latter are said (ch. vii) to “ live beyond Hima-vanta,” or “ snow land,” which may mean in Kashm ī r, Tibet, or Nap ā l. It describes the installation of Pari-kshit as king of Hastinap ū r, and the retirement of Yudhishthira (see Br ā hma) ; but it increases the chronological dif fi culties by giving 24 generations (or 700 years) between Puru and Par ā sara (see Dowson, Hindu Clas. Dict ., p. 47). The Br ā hmans were now tightening their hold on kings, and we are told that the gods will no t accept even royal offerings, unless they maintain a Purohit or head Br ā hman. The southern Dr ā vidians have also now come to be regarded as degraded barbarians (vii, 18). The Mantra Br ā hmana is less important. The Gopatha treats of Vy ā sa the son of Parasara, and of Kavi the reputed author of the Ram ā yana epik, but not of Valmika the probable originator.

The trinity of Brahm ā , Vishnu, and Siva (or Is ā na) is now fi rst noticed, each of the three having his special heaven. It is said that religion requires four Vedas, as cars have four wheels, and animals four legs. So too a Christian Father tells us there must be four gospels because there are four cardinal points. According to the Gopatha, Brahm ā , as a Demiurge, created Praj ā pati from whom sprang 10 Rishis, and from them others—21 or 23 in all—the last producing the Ā th ā rva Veda, through the tapas , or creative fi ery energy, of Brahm ā himself. We thus approach the doctrine of successive Jinas (see Jains), which is independently ascribed to the 7th century B . C . Here also the mystic “ Om ” appears, and the fi rst Rishi produces fi re, air, and heaven, Agni, Vayu, and Ā ditya ; while in heaven were heard the words of the Rig, Yaj ū r, and Sama Vedas. Vy ā sa the son of Par ā sara, living perhaps in 550 B . C ., serves to bring down the date of part at least of this work to the 6th century B . C ., to which age also we may ascribe the last, or Chandogya Br ā hmana, containing equally late teaching of metempsychosis, and a fo rmal cosmogony. We thus reach the age of epiks and philosophies (see Mah ā -bh ā rata, Ram ā yana, and Upanishads). The heavens no longer speak, and sruti or revelation is succeeded by smriti or tradition : the gods themselves are called in question by Agnostik philosophers who, like Kan ā da, speak, not of Vedas but of Vidya and Ā -vidya, or “ knowledge ” and “ ignorance,” apart from any Bible. It is the ag e of the “ six demonstrations ” (see Darsanas) when the various schools disputed whether deity was single or dual—“ the one without a second,” or the one who became (or was from eternity) bisexual like all things in his universe. This brief review of an enormous literature will serve to show the reasons for the comparative chronology of the various books, and the gradual growth of Hindu belief and thought : the general result was a culture which refused to be trammelled by old creeds and sacred books. Scholars spoke of the Vedas as including what was good with what was indifferent or bad, and thought that the ancient bards, being superior in understanding to their fellows, came to be regarded as inspired. They held that the human soul, though a part of Brahm the supreme Atman—or soul of the universe—was separated from him by Maya (“ illusion ”), and by A-vidya or “ ignorance.” In the darkness of our European middle ages India was being enlightened by learned Vedant- ists (see Sankar ā charya, Raman ū ja, and Sikhs). Buddhists and others placed conduct fi rst, and belief second. Good words, they taught, can save none, though they may aid men to attain “ release ” or salvation.

V ē dahs. A wild aboriginal tribe of Ceylon, rapidly disappearing, and occupying the V ē derata, a tract of forest land extending about 90 by 45 miles alon g the S.E. coast. They are classed as Rock, Village, and Coast Veddahs, the last named only numbering about 300 persons. The Rock Veddahs differ little from the Tamil population, with whom howe ver they rarely associate. In 1871 they numbered about 2000 in all, and used to make nests in trees. They are a long-haired people with straight noses, somewhat thick lips, and small chins. The men are bearded, and armed with a long bow. Their language is said to be a dialect of the ordinary Cinghalese. Prof. Wallace regards them as a survival of the early population of the Lemurian continent. They are no doubt congeners of the “ wild folk ” of the Palane, and Ane-mali hills and forests of S.W. India—the Bedas (or Redas) of Mysore, and the Patu of Katak, allied to hill tribes of Nap ā l, Ass ā m, and Kamaon, who once knew better days. They have no doub t degenerated in consequence of oppression : for Bedas are said to have fought in the armies of Tip ū S ā hib, and many such aborigines still re gard themselves as superior to Hindus, and to all mere tillers of the soil. They present a not very marked prognathic jaw (projecting like the negro’s), and a head which is of fair capacity. [The gene ral type suggests a cross between the Dr ā vidian and the Negrito.—E D .] The Village Veddahs have adopted many of the beliefs and customs of their neighbours, and join with others in offering viands to demo ns, dancing with solemn cadence in circles round the offering. The Rock Veddahs make this an annual ceremony, in order to secure success in hunting. They destroy all snakes except the cobra—perhaps only sparing the latter in order not to offend their neighbours, though they say that cobras are too numerous to be extirpated. The marriage customs recognise the choice of the young couple, but insist on full deliberation by the parents : the bride’s father gives the bridegroom a bow, and the father of the latter allots him a hunting ground. The dead are not buried, but are only covered with leaves in the forest. It used to be a Veddah custom to extract the liver of an enemy, and to eat part of it, before fi ghting again, in order to absorb the valour of the dead foe.

He was dethroned for insisting that to him alone should offerings be made. He calle d himself the “ lord of sacri fi ces,” but Brahm ā said that he was only a Chakra-varti, or “ universal monarch,” son of Anga and Tunga, and slew him with a blade of Kusa grass. When he desired an heir the sages rubbed his thigh, and produced a fl at-faced man “ like a charred log,” called a Nashida. They then rubbed his right hand, whence sprang a son who glowed like Agni or “ fi re.” The aborigines of the Vin dhya mountains were called Nish ā das, and the “ bright ” race following was probably either Dr ā vidian, or Aryan. Vena is said to have lived as an ascetik afterwards on the wilds of the Narbada ; and Vishnu promised him absorption into him- self if he would offer the “ horse sacri fi ce,” which Vena declined. Prof. Wilson regards the story of Vena as representing a corrupt Jaina system. Vendid ā d. The Zend Vi-daevo-d ā tam , or “ law against fi ends ” (see Zoroaster). This primitive work, extant in Zend, a language similar to that of the Persian kuneiform texts of about 500 B . C ., is important as being said to have formed the 20th Nask (or book) of the Zend-Avesta, the only one which escaped the destruction of the Mazd ē an Bible by Alexander the Great. It was translated into P ā hlavi about 550 A . C ., but the old language was then imperfectly understood. The Vendid ā d Sadah (or “ pure Vendid ā d ”) did not include the commentaries taken from other scriptures. The present copies are derived from the Sist ā n Codex of 1185 A . C ., which is now lost, and from that of Khojah, a Pars ī priest of 1324 A . C ., which, according to Mr West ( Academy , 24th August 1878) was made at Gujer ā t, and still exists. The Vendid ā d is translated by Darme- steter ( Sacred Books of East , vol. iv. See our Short Studies , p. 219). Its antiquity is shown by the purity of the language, which became full, later, of Semitic loan words, and by the absence of any allusion to money, weights, or coins, with which Persians became acquainted at least as early as 550 B . C . It represents a condition of civilisation still mainly pastoral, among a people emerging from the Neo-lithik condition. Nature is peopled wi th spirits, especially those of fi re, water, trees, rivers, mountains, wi nds, and rains. Many of its fi gures are common to the early Vedik mythology (see Shah-namah).

The earth is said to be most happy in the place where a sacred shrine is established, or secondly where a house with priest, wife, and cattle are found, and only after th ese where it is tilled. Earth, water, and fi re are too sacred ( ehs. vi to xii) to be de fi led by corpses ; and the Dakhmas, or plac.es where these are given over to dogs and birds, are full of demons. There are spells to cure sickness (x, xi), and the care of do gs forms an important question (xiii, xiv) for they are “ good spirits who kill evil ones ” : the penalty for killing a dog—or even a hedgehog—is fi ve times that for homi- cide, whereas to kill a serpent expiates every crime. The temptation of Zoroaster by Ahriman, on the ho ly mountain (Elburz), is described, when the devil was defeated by the Ahuna-Vairya, or divine word, after having offered 1000 years of temp oral rule in return for worship of himself (much as in our fi rst gospel) ; and on this mountain Zoroaster (like Moses) received th e law from God. The sacred text “ Ashem-Vohu (‘ good right ’) is the best of all good,” and connected with the Vohu-mano (“ good-mind ”) given by God to the faithful. In a later chapter (xx) the healing of disease is treated. Thrita (see Trita) was the fi rst healer, but the best cure is the “ holy word.” If a doctor performs an operation and the patient dies he is also put to death (which recalls the ancient Babylonian laws of H ̣ ammurabi) : his fees are also laid down, but consist in produce of the fl ocks,. and not in money.

She had two temples in Rome, one between the Capitoline and Palatine hills attributed to Romulus : the other built by Numa. She had also her shrine in the interior of every house, as the godess of the hearth. The great shrine of Romulus (see Rivers of Life , i, p. 345, fi g. 152) had no image, but only an ever- burning fi re ; but various stelai have been recently discovered in its adytum. Rhea Silvia, the virgin mother of Romulus, is said to have been a Vestal. To the original four, Tarquin, or Servius, added two more, making the six of Plut arch. They were selected fi rst by the king, but afterwards by the Pontif ex Maximus, being little maidens 6 to 10 years old chosen from the best families of Italy. They were bound to guard the holy fl ame for at least 30 years, tending it, day and night, in turns. If the Vestal slept, and the fi re went out, she was severely fl ogged; and the Pontifex Maximus relighted it by rubbing together two pieces of the Felix Ar bor or “ lucky tree.” The unchaste Vestal was stoned to death with her lover, or—later—burned as a human sacri fi ce to the fi re god. Few instances of this are recorded. If a criminal going to execution was met by a Vestal he was at once released. They guarded the treasures, and sacred relics of the city, and the Pontifex Maximus alone was allowed to enter the shrine, and to cleanse the national Palladium therein.

The Vestals also prepared the 30 wicker images of men which, in Flora’s week, the ides of May, were thrown by the Pontifex Maximus from the Milvian, or Sulpician bridge, as types of human sacri fi ces to the Tiber. Vestments. Sacred vestments, though often symbolic of new birth and power, are also in great measure the survival of ancient costumes of the higher classes.

The dalmatic was worn by Dalmatian peasants before it was adopted by Christian deacons (or “ servants ”) of the 4th century. The cassock, and the cope (or cape) were the overcoats of clergy and laity alike (Dean Stanley, Christian Instit .). The chasuble was equally common, and the stole originally a neck scar f (see Stole). The pluviale, as its name implies, was a cloak for rainy weather. Vetal. Vital. A form of Siva worshiped by non-Aryans in India, with sacri fi ces of cocks and goats, in stone circles. Vetal is now often regarded as a demon, and Vitala is Pat ā la or hell. Vibhandaka. The father of the sage Rushya-sringa in the Ram ā yana epik. He placed his son in a forest cave, and bade him shun mankind, as being better able to obey heaven among wild beasts than in crowded cities, th rough ignorance of human vices. Vichitra-virya. In the Mah ā -bh ā rata epik, a son of king Santanu. Vidura, his son, by a slave girl, is one of the best characters in this great poem. Vi-jaya-nagar. The capital of an ancient Hindu empire forgotten by history, on the Tungabhadra, 36 miles N. of Belary (see Mr R. SeweIl, A Forgotten Empire , 1900). It is now Hampi, and was founded at the end of our 12th century by the brothers Haka, and Harihar ( Bengal Rl. A.siatic Socy. Journal , i, 1883). The kingdom arose on the fall of the E. Chalukyas, and extended to the E. coast, and by 1380 to the S., even as far as Cape Kumari. The Rajas took refuge in Chandragiri from the victorious Moslems after the fatal battle of Tri-kal ā , fought on the 25th January 1565.

C ., when they ruled as far as El ō ra, and over the Tamiland Telegu races. They adored Siva, and erected to him a statue, 35 feet high, at th eir capital. The dynasty claimed to spring from sacred Deo-garh (see that heading). The city—which Tughlak Shah desired to make hi s capital—was named from Vijaya, one of the 12 “ deputies ” created by Brahm ā . The coins of this empire represent Hanum ā n, the monkey god ; and the neighbouring capital city of Kish-kinda, or “ monkey- fl ag,” gloried in his temple. The Nayaks of Bednur were vassals of the kings of Vi-jaya-nagar, and their coins represent Siva and Parvati, with sun, moon, and a deer. A few Vishn ū va coins represent the boar of Vishnu. These re- searches cast light on the religion of Central and Southern India from the 11th to the 16th century A . C . Vik. Viking. In connection with Skandinavia it should be noted that the Norse Vik means a “ port,” and that the Vikins or Vikings were not “ vice kings,” bu t seamen from the Skandinavian harbours. Our Wyke or Wick is the same; and York was the Yor-vik, or port of the rive r Ouse, then called the Yore. Vikram- Ā ditya. Sanskrit : “ the eternal hero.” A mythical prince after whom the Vikram (or Samv ā t) era of 56 B . C . was named. This case is instructive with regard to the method of creating such eras (see Eras, and India). The hero is supposed to have been a Buddhist king of Ujjain, and a son of king Gandabhila : he was so great a patron of learning that his court was said to contain the n ā va-ratna , or “ nine gems ” of literature. He drove back the S ā kyas, and poets relate that he died at the battle of K ā rur, fi ghting heretics led by S ā li-v ā hana, king of the Dakk ā n, who also had his S ā kya era in 78 A . C . (Max Müller, India , note G). An historical Vikram, succeeded Sil ā ditya II, who was a staunch Buddhist, visited by Hiuen-Tsang in 640 A . C . The battle of K ā rur was probably fought in 544 A . C .; and by reckoning back 600 years the fanciful era of 56 B . C . was obtained for Vikram- Ā ditya, as living 10 cycles of 60 years before the historic fi rst Vikram. Hindus also spoke of the Sri-harsha era of 456 B . C ., which is 1000 years from the battle of K ā rur (see also K ā lid ā sa). If the poet K ā lid ā sa lived at earliest in our 1st century, being already quoted by Asva-ghosha about 78 A . C ., he might be quoted in 416 A . C ., but not 16 B . C .; yet we fi nd a local poet under Kum ā ra-d ā sa, dating verses taken from K ā lid ā sa (in an extant inscription) as copied or pirated by him in 472 of the Samv ā t era.

Prof. Peterson quotes poet ry full of trustful piety attributed to Vikram- Ā ditya, such as Buddha might have approved. He is said to have quarrelled with Bhartri, his natural brother, governor of Ujjain, and to have left his thro ne, wandering as a mendicant to Gujerat, while—on his return—the br other also became an ascetik. This would hardly have been possible as early as the 5th century B . C .; but a large legendary literature grew up round the name of the “ eternal hero.” Mr Sewell ( Asiatic Quarterly , July 1897) says that :—“ No such name as Vikram- Ā ditya exists in all the history of India, except as that of certain local kings of the western Chalukyan dynasty between 670 and 1126 A . D . . . . and it is around the fi rst of that name that all the romantic web of legend has been woven ” ; he considers that the origin of the Vikram era is still unknown, and it appears to have been fi rst used by poets. The oldest known inscription in E. Rajput ā na, so dated, is of the year 370, and the latest of 840, the latter speaking of “ the time called Vikrama gone by,” in a poem. Up to 1042 there are only three references to the era ; but in 1200 we fi nd an inscription speaking of the “ year established by the illustrious Vikram- Ā ditya.” Vikram signi fi es the “ striding, vigorous, or heroic one ” ; and Mr Sewell thinks that the Vikram era only meant “ current reckoning.” Vin ā ya.

He arose from the waters, and made th e sun, and planets ; gave life to stones ; and created all things. He was the patron of the city of Kusko, where he placed Alka-vika as the fi rst man. He returned to the waters because he loved hi s sister Manya-kocha, who had a casket which he broke, causing fertility to fl ow thence over earth and sea. He resembles the Tlalok of Me xico in character ; but is also called Vira-huaka, the word huaka applying to anything divine. The sacred Huaka stones still covered the land in Peru when the Spaniards arrived. Virakocha, Pacha-kamak, and Manko-kapak, formed a trinity of brothers all sons of the sun, according to the system of the Incas. Vira-vara. In an Indian legend this servant of a king slays his son to prolong the king’s life ; the bo y’s sister kills herself, and his wife dies of grief, in consequence. The king, hearing all this, is about to commit suicide, when the terrible godess Durga, who has caused all this misery, relents and brings all the victims back to life (Hardy, Manual of Buddhism , p. 114). The tale is intended to teach the virtue of self-sacri fi ce, the foundation of the religion of Buddha's age. Vishnu. From Visha, signifying water, and all that is blue or green. Vishnu is thus the god of blue water, and of fertility, yet is often regarded as the sun, and connected with Vish or Bish , “ poison,” like Siva. His emblems include the foot. He has usually four arms. In the upper right hand he holds the chakra, or whirling sun disk, through which he places his fi nger : in the lower right is the shank or conch shell : in the upper left is a fi ery sceptre; and in the lower left a lotus. The raised hands have masculine, the lower ones feminine, emblems. From his tiara fl ames dart out ; the Salagr ā ma, and the Tulsi plant, are also sacred to him. He is represented reclin- ing on a couch formed by the seven-headed serpent Sesha, while Lakshmi his wife rubs his foot. The pair (as Hara and Hari) fl oat on the ocean, and from the navel of Vishnu grows up the lotus plant whence the four-faced Brahm ā is issuing. The ten incarnations of Vishnu include one yet to come : they are as follows.

The two fi rst Avat ā rs, or incarnations, belonged to the Krita age (see Kalp), as do the third and fourth : the fi ve next to the Treta age ; and the future tenth Avatar is expected at the end of the present Kali age.

(4) N ā r ā -simha , the “ man-lion,” was the form assumed to rid the earth of Hiranya- Kasipu, another destructive demon. In the second age the incarnations become quasi-historical and are de scribed under their names in other articles : they include (5) Vamana the “ dwarf ” who demanded of the emperor Bali all the lands he could cro ss in three strides : he strode at once over earth, heaven, and hell.

The Rig Veda recognises Vishnu as “ the unconquerable preserver who bestrode the universe in three steps ” (as in his 5th incarnation) ; but the Vedas make no mention of V ā mana, and the Vedik Vishnu is the sun. The Avat ā ras are evolved in the later Pur ā nas ; and, even in the Ram ā yana, the boar who raised earth on his tusks from the ocean is Brahm ā , and not Vishnu. Some later sacred books speak of 24 or more Avat ā ras ; and though Vishnu is usually second in the trinity of Siva, Vishnu, and Brahma (see Trinities) he is perhaps the most popular god of. the three. The Vishnu Pur ā na, which is the authoritative text-book of Vishn ū va sects, exalts him as the eternal and loving father of his children, just as the Siva Pur ā na exalts Siva. In Wilson’s translation of the Vishnu Purana we read : “ Who can describe him, who is not to be a pprehended by the senses, who is the best of all things, the supreme soul, self-existent ; who is devoid of all the distinguishing characteristics of complexion, caste, or the like, and is exempt from birth, vicissitude, de ath, or decay : who is always, and alone : who exists everywhere, and in whom all things exist. He is Br ā hma, the supreme lord, eternal, unborn, imperishable, undecaying : of one essence : ever pure and free from defects. He—that Br ā hma —was in all things, comprehending in his own nature spirit and matter.”"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"Visparad 490 The third, and oldest Purana states that no rites, sacri fi ces, or works are permitted unless authorised in the Vedas. Thus the Vishnuvas depend on priests, while the lingam god Siva may be worshiped by any man. Vishnuva, or “ left hand,” sects adore the Yoni, and the Saktis ; and the cults is soft and feminine as compared with the stem Sivaik ascetisism. The Vishnuvas detest cruelty, and have no such bloody rites as those of Durga ; but they are in danger of licentious abuses (see Sakta). As Br ā hma became a cold abstraction the fi gure of Vishnueclipsed him, as appealing more to the human heart : for the philosophy of Kapila’s school was too deep for the masses, who preferred the mysticism of the Bh ā gavad-Gita, and Pur ā nas. The four great Vishn ū va sects are named after their founders (see R ā ma-nuja, Madhava, Chaitanya, and Vallabha) : all these taught the dependence of the soul on a divine Supreme Being. The notherners adhered to the Vedas ; the southerners relied on the Tamil Veda of 4000 terses called the N ā l ā yira, which some scholars fi nd in the Upanishad teaching. The Tengal ā s refuse to recognise any Sakti, or consort of Vishnu, as being uncreated or in fi nite like him, saying that such a consort is Pur ū sha-kara, a created creatrix, and channel of salvation. Yet they worship the left as well as the right foot of Vishnu, and mark their foreheads with the trisul emblem (see Trisul), the two outer prongs being white and the central one red : a white mark down the nose is the stem of the whole, or “ lotus throne.” The great centre of S. Indian Vishn ū vas is the temple of Sri-rangam—a gorgeous shrine said to represent the Vaikunta, or seven heavens of Vishnu : for it has seven courts each of increasing sanc tity, leading to the inner Holy of Holies. The disputes of the Vada and Ten sects have gradually subsided ; but the former adhere to their so called “ monkey doctrine,” saying that ; though the soul is free, it clings to Vishnu the supreme soul, as the little monkey clings to its mother. Both sects are equally strict in observing privacy in cooking and eating, lest the evil eye should fall upon their food. Visparad. See Zoroaster. Vistash-pati.

Sanskrit : “ the friend of all.” A legendary character whose story is import ant in tracing the rise of Br ā hmanism. He was the son of Kusa, not only a Br ā hman but a Raja, a Rishi, and a Guru. He bade R ā ma slay the demoness Tark ā , and introduce the worship of Agni and Indra, but roused the jealousy of the gods themselves. His 100 sons were slain by the breath of Vasishtha, and in turn he cursed the 100 sons of the latter, who were reduced to ashes by a Raksh ā sa monarch, into whom Visva-mitra breathed his own power. He permitted them to be born again as degraded mortals. He adopted his nephew (see Haris-chandra, and Suna-sepha). He was raised to the rank of Br ā hman alter 1000 years of austerities, and when Br ā hma reconciled the rival Rishis (see Vasishtha), and his sons were restored, half of them re cognised Sunasepha as his heir, and to them he gave cattle and sons, wh ile the rest were banished to the fastnesses of the country. In the great struggle, Vasishtha would not recognise king Tri-sanku as more than a Chand ā la of low caste, though he claimed to be a Br ā hman ; but Visva-mitra restored his kingdom, and, led him fi nally to heaven.

In Hayti they are found as a race of small weak men ; and the Hayti Republic now rules over 50,000 whites and 60,000 mulattos, the remainder of its population of 800,000 being negro. The St Domingo Republic, in the E. part of the island, may include another 200,000. The French abandoned their settlements in 1804, and the Spaniards also gave up the attempt to rule theirs in 1821 ; for both were weary of contending with a restless population controlled by th e secret power of the Papaloi, or Vodu priests, who had long been the real masters—a terror to the people, exerting a cruel tyranny against which the white rulers were powerless. Even educated negroes of high rank were secretly sworn to support the horrible Vodu system, and joined in the secret orgies, which resembled those of Australian savages or of Sakti worshipers in India : they swore terrible oaths to an implacable serpent god, represented by a python priest, and a pythoness, called the Serpent Papa and Mama, or king and queen (see Sir S. St John, Hayti , 1884). To this serpent, human sacri fi ces are still offered, and the heart and lungs of the victim are said to be eaten raw, while the fl esh is salted for priestly families ; the blood is drunk while yet warm, and tubes are inserted into the veins of the half-dead victim for sucking out his life, which thus adds to the vitality of the drinker—a rite said to be pl easing to the python deity. Sir Spencer St John says that, clever and teachable as are the natives, scarcely one is untainted by Voduism. Only fi fty years ago the “ Emperor Soulouque ” was a fi rm believer in this cult, and one of his generals, Therlonge, was a high -priest who, in his younger days, had appeared in scarlet robes perf orming certain rites in trees. A priestess, when arrested more recently for too openly enacting the brutal rites, said to those who spoke of her possible martyrdom : “ Were I to beat the sacred drum, not one from the emperor down- wards but would humbly follow me.” During the perpetual wars “ prisoners were placed between two planks and were sawn in two, or were fl ayed alive, and slowly roasted ” (p. 39). The initiatory rites were simple, and much like those of serpent worshipers elsewhere. The python is kept in a sacred box or ark, and is worshiped as a god—“ the Vodu ”—which word the Arada negroes, who are the leading sectaries, say “ signi fi es an all-powerful and super-natural being, on whom depend all the events of the world ” ; it has “ complete knowledge of the past, present, and future, and will only communicate the god's power, and prescribe his w ill, through an arch-priest . . . and a negress whom his love has raised to the rank of high priestess ” (p. 186).

The king places the ark on the ground, and commands the queen to stand on it. Amid complete silence she begins to trembl e, her body is contorted, and her frenzied convulsions are said to be caused by the god : at length she speaks with violent agitation as his oracle. It is the old story of the Pythoness of Delphi on her tripod. Amid the clanging of bells she prophecies, exhorts, or denounces, according to her caprices. The people reverently receive her word s as the commands of heaven. A fresh oath is administered, and offerings are sacri fi ced : they include the warm blood of a goat in a vase ; or may be of “ a goat without horns,” which term denotes a human victim. Each devotee partaking of the blood imprecates a terrible deat h to himself, or herself, should they ever fail in devotion. After this, excited by fl esh and wine, they join in wild dances. “ They go spinning round, and in their excite- ment tear each other’s clothes, and bite their own fl esh, till they fall to the ground senseless, and ar e dragged into a dark apartment.” Demoralising scenes of general licence conclude the ceremony, and a date is settled on which they are to be renewed (p. 192). At some of these initiations white cocks, goats, and lambs are sacri fi ced, and all present are marked with the blood. The temples where they occur contain sacred stones of crescent shape, and also engravings which represent the Virgin Mary—a relic of former Christianity : the chief fêtes are at Christmas, New Year’s Eve, and Easter, but especially on Twelfth Night, which is called “ Le s Fetes des Rois.” The Catholic rites and symbols of the professed religion are preserved by the Papaloi (p. 201), including the burning of tapers, the use of crosses, and pictures of the Virgin over the altar. This “ national religion ” is supported by the Hayti Government, including many well educated men, who regard it as “ one of the fi rmest props of the independence of the country.” So have rulers spoken of other faiths; but we may even tremble for human progress when we learn how the dark places of earth are still full of cruelty.

The Kelts, and Skuths, appear to have had a week of 8 days, but Baby- lonians divided the month into 4 quarters. Wells. Sacred wells and springs are the abodes of nymphs and water sprites, consecrated later to Christian saints. Many ancient superstitions are connected with th em. Many of our noblest shrines are raised over such wells, and many are the sacred Kunds that we have visited at Indian temples.

In England the holy well of Tissington, is still deco rated and worshiped, like the Rood- well of Stenton in Haddingtonshire. St Peter’s well at Houston in Renfrewshire, St Ninian’s well at Stirling with its vaulted cell, St Catherine’s well at Liberton, St Michael’s well near the Linlithgow cathedral, or the well of Loch Maree are examples. The Glasgow cathedral stands over St Mungo’s well, deep down in its crypt. In Ireland we everywhere fi nd peasants kneeling at sacred wells. In the N. of England attempts have been made to revive such superstition, countenanced by a reactionary clergy. A library might be fi lled by books on the subject. Mr Quiller Couch gives an interesting list of 90 sacred Cornish wells where prayers and sacri fi ces have been offered ; for Pope Gregory instructed Augustine and other missionaries in Britain to adopt and reconsecrate the sacred places of the pagans. In our 13th century, however, local co uncils forbade the “ superstitious adoration of fountains ” ; but only after the Reformation did the clergy actively attempt to suppress such ri tes, as being Papist devices, or connected with the devil, the fairies, and demons, who haunted “ wishing wells.” The devout and ignorant however still drop coins and pins into such wells as memorial s of a visit. Priests made money by claiming that such wells could impart holiness to other waters, as St Margaret’s well at Restalrig imparted its virtues to the Holy-rood well under Arthur’s Seat. Another well of St Margaret is found under the black precipitous cliffs of Edinburgh Castle, being exactly such a spot as we have seen in Central Ind ia, where pious persons precipitated themselves from the rock to please Siva or Kali (see Rivers of Life , ii, p. 357). Holy water must come from an unknown source, from rain, or from some deep spring-well. But a divine person living by the waters imparts his powers to th em. Rain from heaven is also caught in hollows on a holy stone or altar. At Struan in Scotland is the well of F ā olan, the Christian St Fillan, where rain was besought, and if it came not, St Fillan’s image was brought from the church and washed in the well. The “ Hooping Stone,” on a farm near Athol, is a channeled boulder which catches ra in; and the water, especially if ladled out with a spoon made from the horn of a living cow, cures many ailments. The “ Fever Well ” hard by is also still in high re- pute ( Scot. Antiq. Socy ., 1890).

See Svastika, and Triskelion. These are solar symbols (see Chakra), and the Persian Guilous marked the new year when the sun “ wheeled upwards.” The Saxons used a wheel for their “ clogs,” or wooden almanacs, which marked by a cog the Juil day, and the solstitial return of the sun on the horizon at dawn—N. in summer or S. after the summer solstice. They then, like others (see Holi), strove to imitate the “ wheeler ” by dances in which they circled from left to right. They made straw wheels and, lighting them, rolled them down hills. The Sontals and other non-Aryans of India call the sun the “ wheel of fi re,” and a Sontal told the author in 1862 that their supreme god had been seen in this form. The villagers along the Moselle, till lately, used to roll similar straw wheels from hill- tops on St John’s Eve, or Midsummer Night (Miss G. Cumming, Contemporary Review , Oct. 1884), and on May morning, in some districts of Scotland, “ large circular cakes, fl attened on the edge, like a wheel tyre,” are rolled down grassy slopes. Whippings. The practice of fl agellation was ancient and widespread (see N ā gas) ; but it is not merely a penance, as among medireval fl agellants ; which we see from the whipping of Roman brides (see Lupercalia). It was a stimulant as described by Capt. Bourke in America ( Medicine Men of Apaches , pp. 564, 571-574) : he here quotes Brand ( Pop. Antiq ., p. 67) and other authorities in support of views explained in Rivers of Life (i, p. 120). In Tibet whips are made of the skins of black serpents for a similar reason. In Surrey the apple trees are whipped to make them bear fruit (compare Blount, Customs , 1874). White Day. Whit Sunday. See Pentecost.

At Lich fi eld, according to Southey, “ the bailiff, and sheriff,” used to dress infants in fl owers and greenery, carrying them in, procession to a green bower on a hill near the town. King and nobles joined in the procession , and those who were absent were fi ned : everyone passing the village had to contribute, or was placed astride a stone shaft, and so carried to prison in the town. At Kidlington, in Oxfordshire, maidens had their thumbs tied behind their backs, and had to chase a lamb till one of them caught it with her teeth, when it was killed and cooked. This was called the “ lady’s feast.” Wings. The antiquity of winged fi gures is shown by their occurrence on early Babylonian an d Hittite sculptures. Angels, beasts, reptiles, fi sh, and trees, have all been represented with wings. 'The staff, and the sandals, of He rmes—the wind god—are winged in Greek representations, as are some of the Roman phalli. Wisdom of Solomon. See Apokrupha. This work, extant in Greek, is variously ascribed to dates between 217 B . C . and 40 A . C . Some modern critics think it the wo rk of more than one author. It appears to be attributable to the Jewish school of Alexandria, and in some of its tenets—such as its sile nce about resurrection of the body, or its doctrine of God not being th e author of evil—it presents ideas not held by Pharisees, but nearer to those of Sadducees. It teaches that God created all things out of no thing, and is in all: that souls are pre-existent ; and that immorta lity is the gift of wisdom. The fi rst 9 chapters are in praise of wisdom, and the following 10 are intended to show that Israel always triumphed over the Gentiles when following wisdom, or the commands of Yahveh. God did not make death (i, 13), which is due to the malice of the devil (ii, 24), and the just man is a son of God (ii, 18). All things were made “ by the reason (Logos) of God ” (ix, 1), who loves all that he has created (xi, 25) and whose holy spirit is in all things (xii, 1). Idolatry is the root of all evil (xiv, 12), and Wisdom is the guardian (x, 1) who gives “ bread from heaven ” (xvi, 20) : the just man must love all (xii, 19) and the children of God are his people Israel, who have a sure hope for the future (xvi, 2). The writer exhorts “ tyrants ” (vi, 10 : viii, 15) and Paul seems to quote his simile of the “ breastplate of righteousness ” (v, 19).

This name, usually applied to a woman, while a male witch is called a wizard, comes from the Aryan root Vidh “ to know ” (whence Veda) and is found in the Icelandic Vitki a “ cunning one,” the Mid-English wieche a “ clever person,” and witega a “ soothsayer.” All early races have feared witches as being in league with devils, to their hurt ; and Christians have co mmitted as great cruelties in witch hunting as Zulus now perpetrate. Wesley, as an Oxford clergyman, preached that “ whoever denied the reality of witches was not a believer in the Bible,” which was justi fi able (see Ob). Dr Johnson said : “ No one should deny witches or devils for they could not disprove them,” which is applicable to many other things once fi rmly believed, such as the existence of the “ man in the moon.” Belief in witches is still not quite extinct in any part of Europe. Mr Leland says that there is not a town in Italy where witchcra ft is not extensive1y practised, though with wonderful secrecy : “ no book is so extensively dis- seminated among the millions as the fortune teller ” (see Gipsy Fortune-telling , 1891). A witch was cruci fi ed in Hungary in 1893. The regular persecution of witches began in our 13th century, and increased in the 14th. Pope John XXII (1317-1327 A . C .) issued two bulls for the suppression of all witches, and wholesale charges were made against poor old women, who were whipped and burned with every kind of barbarous cruelty. Nor were the Reformed Churches behind the Romanist priests; and the Jesuits seem indeed to have been amongst the fi rst to denounce these cruelties in 1630. Simi1ar vile proceedings continued in Scotland down to the beginning of the 17th century (Froc. Scot. Socy. of Antiquaries, 1887, 1888) as witnessed by the records of our courts. There were said to be immoral orgies, midnight dances, drinking, and revelry, at the old sacred stones ; and the assertions of deluded females recall those of the Asiatic witches of a thousand years earlier. Chrysostom in our 4th century describes the terror of witchcraft at Antioch, and the cruelties in fl icted on the suspected. Even such good men as the Lord Chief-Justice Matthew Hales (1650-1670) opened his inquiries, which resulted in horrib1e tortures, with prayer, proceeding “ under the Divine Laws ” of the Pentateuch, and an atrocious Act of 1620 due to the superstitious King James I of England.

Yet it was not till 1736 that our laws against witches were repealed. Witch burning is still not unknown in Ireland. Poor Mrs M’Cleary was burnt by peasants in Tipperary in 1895 (as being possessed) ; and women at Olonmel in 1884 fried a naked child on a shovel. To the present day Danish and Scottish rustics scourge, drown, and burn, little naked infants supposed to be enchanted, though the last witch was drowned in England in 1838 (see Country Folk-lore , 1895, p. 50 : Notes and Queries , 22nd June 1895, p. 9). Male devils escaped, while female vi ctims suffered. During the 17th century some 70,000 to 80,000 poor de mented persons perished under the laws of those who had been taught the “ gospel of love.” The confessions were wrung from the victims by torture. The last judicial murder of this kind appears to have taken place in 1722. Scott ( Discoverie of Witch Craft , 1584) says : “ Our Reformers put rigorously in practice what the Papists did only in a halting manner . . . the severities depended very much on the temperament of those in power.” England burned 30,000 persons in 200 years, and hanged a poor witch with her child 9 years old in 1716. Addison, and Blackstone, alike declared that certain persons held communion with evil spirits. The Swedes also continued to punish witches till about 1700 A . C ., no less than 57 men and 23 women being burned alive on one occasion when there was an epidemic due to dirt and laziness in the village of Mohra. A case is reported in Scotland as late as 1887 (see Mr Biedy, Notes and Queries , 1st July 1893) : the witch was placed in a cof fi n, and sunk head downwards in a deep hole. The grave was watched for three nights. The Inquisition was equally busy abroad after the violent Bull of Pope Innocent VIII, and in the 15th century burned witches in batches of 50 or 100 at one time. Early in the 16th century 1000 were so burned by the authorities of Como, and 500 at Genoa in three months. Judge Remy put 800 witche s to death in sixteen years. Luther says that 7000 were burned at Trêves ; 600 by one bishop of Bamburg ; 800 in the bishopric of Wartzburg ; 400 at Toulouse in a single execution. Sprenger makes the awful total amount to upwards of 9 million persons. Bacon, Erasmus, Hooker, Sir Thos. Browne, and Baxter, alike abetted such practices. “ These things,” says Mrs E. O. Stanton, “ were done, not by savages, or pagans ; they were done by the Christian Church. Neither were they con fi ned to the dark ages, but permitted by law in England far into the 18th century.

His “ name is still given to a statue on a high rock at the village of Magdalena, four leagues from Tehuan-tepek, where tradition says that he debarked from the South Sea with a cross in his hand . He was a venerable man with bushy white beard, wearing a long ro be, and a mantle with a cowl. His statue shows him seated listening re fl ectively to a woman kneeling by his side . . . he is said to have taught sweetly, passing from place to place, urging penitence, and abstention from pleasures, and even from marriage. When persecuted in one place he passed on to another, and only escaped death from the Mijes (or Miz-teks) by vanishing out of sight. His form then appeared on the summit of a mountain, on reaching which they saw only his ph antom ; but he left the impression of his feet on a rock, and (tradition says) was never seen again, except once, on the enchanted isle of Monapostiak, near Teman-tepek, where he embarked.” Mr Vining gives good reasons for concluding that this teacher was a Buddhist monk of about 500 A .

The wyf-man (German weib ) or mate of man (from the Aryan root wabh to “ join ”). The status of woman is a sure criterion of civilisation. To the sava ge the wife is a trembling slave. Among Semitic races she is still regarded as an inferior being. In the Talmud we read, “ Blessed art thou O Lord who hast not made me a gentile, an idiot, or a woman.” We can hardly wonder therefore that Paul regards women as made fo r men, or that Christian Fathers followed the same ancient ideas. As late as 585 A . C . the Council of Maçon pronounced that “ if women ha ve souls they must be inferior to those of men . . . like unto the souls of beasts.” At the “ Woman’s Rights Convention ” of Philadelphia in 1854, a debater said : “ Let woman fi rst prove she has a soul, for both Church and State have denied this.” Can we wonder if ignorant Moslems think also that women have no souls, though their prophet said that the wives of the pious went to heaven with their husbands and children ?

This tiny bird is a great fi gure in folk-lore. “ The robin and the wren Are God's cock and hen.” The wren was called the “ winter king ” by Germans, and his reign culminated with the last moon befo re the winter solstice. The wren waft king of the birds (according to the fable) because it fl ew the highest, having perched unperceived on the eagle’s head whence it fl ew off above him. The fi re-crested wren was an emblem of the sun, and this crest was his crown. At the Feast of St Stephen, on the 26th December, youths and maidens went out to hunt the wren, because the winter of his reign was over. He was hung on rods or to crossed hoops decked with coloured ribbons. The “ wren boys ” sang songs in honour of the dead king of birds, and begged alms in the villages. The Mayor of Cork forbade these processions in 1845, but they continue in France and in the S. of Europe. At Marseilles they take place in the last week of December ; but in Wales they were celebrated on the 12th of the month, as also in the Isle of Man. The sacred bird is enclosed in a glass case, surmounted. by a wheel, and adorned with ribbons.

Inundations of the Yamuna near Math ū ra are still not unusual, and fanatics still assert that they have seen a miraculous halo on the sacred mount Govan-dana which Krishna raised on this occasion, and where sacri fi ces were long offered.

Yezid ī s. See Yazata. These people, called by Moslems and Christians “ devil worshipers,” are a sect which combines the old Persian worship of the Izeds, or divi ne spirits, with later Gnostik and philosophic ideas. They are tolera ted by modern Persians, and form a community of about 4000 persons at Yezd the capital of Farist ā n or central Persia. They are also found in the Sinjar hills, 50 miles S.W. of Mosul, being there of Kurdish race ; and at the sacred groves of Lalish 27 miles W. of Mosul ; as well as in the vicinity of Mt. Ararat. They are thus much scattered, and few in numbers. They are a fi ne hardy race of middle stature, with regular features, keen blue or brown eyes, and auburn or bl ack hair, of which they leave only a forelock unshaved. They are as wild and ignorant as other Kurds, and haunt Lake Urumia, the reputed birthplace of Zoroaster (see Mr Dingelstedt, Scottish Geog. Mag ., June 1898). They conceal their beliefs from their Turkish, Persian, and Russian rulers ; but the symbol of the Melek-T ̣ ā w ū s (“ king peacock ”), which represents a dreaded evil power, has become gene rally known to students of folk- lore. They are much afraid of Ibl ī s or Shait ā n (the devil), and of gh ū ls or demons. The peacock, which looks more like a duck, perched on a pole, is kept in the shrine at Lalish, and is only brought out by the head Sheikh on important occasions, when it is borne in procession and adored. The Melek-T ̣ ā w ū s was once an angel, or Demiurge, who created Eve from the body of Adam ; but with her he fell into dis- grace with God, and is not mentione d in Yezidi prayers. The follow- ing is their usual invocation : “ Amen ! Amen ! Amen !

Thou hast led me out of darkness into light. Lord, pardon my guilt and sins. O God ! O God! O God ! Amen.” This is not devil worship, but a good Theist’s prayer. Yezid ī s however pray to Sheikh Sh ams—the sun—at his rising and setting, and to the moon as re fl ecting his light. Like the Mazd ē ans they see God's spirit in the “ four sacred elements,” fi re, air, earth, and water ; but especially in fi re which devours and puri fi es all things. They believe that there have been 24,000 prophets, of whom the last was their Sheikh Adi. His shrine is at Lalish or Ba-H ̣ asani, a modest building amid the groves near a holy streamlet, in a picturesque valley naturally well wooded. The shrine has a nave, and aisles wherein are the tombs of Sheikh Adi and other saints. The interior is dimly lighted by a few windows. The founder’s tomb has on it some verses from the K ̣ or ā n. There is a sacred well hard by, where parents purchase water from the Kœvals, or “ elders,” to baptise their children, half the pr ice being given to the temple. Lalish was the burial place of the fi rst Yezid, who was half an angel and half a man. The religious centre was originally on a spur of the Kurdish mountains, near the village of Bashiyka. Here Melek T ̣ ā w ū s longed for a helpmate, and God sent him a H ̣ uri, who bore the Yezids to him. The sin of Adam brought misery on men, which has been lessened by the sending of Sheikhs from time to time. The fi rst known to history was Sheikh Adi, who appeared in 1080 A . C .: he established the Lalish shrine on the site of a Christian monastery —probably Nestorian—known as the Muzur-d ā gh (“ mountain of visitation ”) and after having sca ttered, or destroyed, the monks he made himself the Pope of the Yezidi s, whom his hereditary successors still rule, supported by offerings which are nominally voluntary. The Sheikh now lives in a comfortable palace in Mosul : failing a son he has the right to nominate his succe ssor. Under him is the Emir, or secular Sheikh, with whom the Turkish government deals.

The religious Sheikhs (or “ elders ”) claim descent from fi ve holy patriarchs. They are called P ī rs or “ saints,” Fak ̣ ī rs or “ poor ” ascetiks, and Kœvals or itinerant judges and collectors of taxes, there being no great distinction between these. Sheikhs wear black turbans and white garments : P ī rs red turbans and black robes ; and Kœvals carry with them a sinjak or “ fl ag,” on which is the Melek T ̣ ā w ū s or “ peacock king.” Sheikhs and P ī rs have powers of excommunication, and all these religious leaders are much respected, and their homes inviolable. Agas , or tribal chiefs, have great power, and next to them come the Ruspis , or village head-men, and the Tagvas or fathers of families. The father is the sole ruler of all who live with him : he is the head of the hearth, or holy spot—a triangle marked by three stones—in the centre of house or tent, where burns the fi re which must never go out, and never be lent to another. No Yezidi may marry out of his tribe, nor be wedded till he gets the K ̣ alim (“ word ”), or permission to purchase a wife. Her choice is free, subject to the consent of her parents : after marriage she must obey her husband, and labour at domestic duties. A year often elap ses after betrothal, during which meetings by night are allowed. Women are much respected, and may even become initiates, or priests, and religious leaders ; widows may remarry, but till then wear white mourning. The Yezidis never proselytise, and have a great antipathy to all that is of blue color. The dead are buried facing the pole star (see Mandzeans) : for the Yezidis believe that their forefa thers came thence, which points perhaps to the Aryan cradle in the north. As among Moslems, and Jews, no beast may be eaten till bled. They kiss the spot where the fi rst or last ray of the sun is seen, after offering prayers. They heat the fi ngers of the right hand in the fl ame of an altar candle, and rub the right eyebrow with them, kissing the fi ngers afterwards. They use the Arab word Allah for “ god,” but confuse him with ’Ali—the Persian sainted martyr—and they speak of “Is’a N ū rani ” (or “ Jesus our light ”) who is to return to rule the world. Circumcision is optional. Thursday is kept “ holy to the Lord of all,” and a fast of 40 days precedes the feast of the ve rnal equinox. They believe that salvation can be purchased by liberality to ecclesiastics. The Yezid ī s of the Sinjar hills number some 200, 000, and are said to be honest, moral, cleanly, industrious, brav e, and hospitable ; but very super- stitious, and—like all Kurds—given to sorcery.

Its roots are in Ni fl -heim or Hades, its stem grows in Mid-gard or earth, surrounded by the snake of the ocean, its branch es reach to As-gard or the “ gods’ home,” and on them sits the eagle of Odin. The rainbow bridge leads from earth to this heaven (see Rivers of Life , ii, p. 290, fi g. 270). The fruits of this tree are men ; and on it Odin hung when he sacri fi ced himself to himself. The three roots denote the past, present, and future ; and the tree symbolises the lif e of the universe. Yggr is said to be Odin, and Drasil was his “ horse,” so that the tree is the supporter of the heaven god.

But the 10 Paramitas were soon personi fi ed as meditative Buddhas (see Dr Waddell, Asiatic Quarterly , Jan. 1894). Yogis may be of any sect, and either married or single, but have usually cast aside the world, and re tired for solitary meditation. We have had considerable intercourse with them, and may say that they are usually ignorant, half crazy, and more than half naked itinerants, covered with ashes—and vermin—wit h shells, rings, and charms : they lead about malformed animals, they beg and pray, bless and curse, but are greeted as holy men like the Nabis of Hebrews, or Moslem Fak ̣ irs, being believed to foretell polit ical events, and much feared (see Rivers of Life , ii, pp. 580-596). Their ble ssing gives offspring to the barren, and woe betide those whom they curse. They may be seen bowed down, sitting crossed-legge d, or stauding erect, endeavour- ing to hold their breath and to peop le their imaginations with ghosts of another world; or, as they say, seeking to become absorbed in a celestial ideal. For such purpos e they mesmerise themselves (see Hypnotism) by gazing on symbols such as the Chakra, or the Lingam, as we have often seen them do. At fetes they show themselves among the crowds, stark naked when allowe d : their bodies besmeared with ashes and oil, their ears elongated (a mark of sanctity) or the lobes split—when they are known as K ā n-phats (see Sany ā sis). They do not burn but bury, and teach that a Y ō gi’s tomb (or Sam ā dha) should become a place where pilgrims may me ditate on the transitory nature of earthly things. We saw, near Mathura in 1867, a naked object whose emaciated arm had been upheld, over his matted locks, for many years till stiffened, while the fi nger nails had grown through his clenched palm. We have seen others who have piously endured excruciating tortures in lonely places , believing that by such austerities they pleased the gods, and would attain to powers which even gods could not deny to them, while, in future, eternal bliss without any purgatorial transmigration of the soul, would await them. Many of these Anchorites think that they t hus attain knowledge of the past, and of the future, and become able to divine the thoughts of others, to fl y through the air, to dive through Water or mid-earth, to rise into heaven, or to contemplate all space at a glance.

Most people in India so dread the Y ō gis that they never think of cross-questioning them, and invent many stories about their power of reading thoughts, their supernatural vision, their trances, and trans- migrations. The poor dazed fanatic is called a master of Y ō ga-vidya (“ knowledge of union ”), which was once a school of philosophic en- quiry (see Dr R. Lala-Mitra’s translation of Patanjali’s Y ō ga-S ā stra ). Hindus believe that Y ō gis can die and rise again ; and a too credulous European, at the Court of Lahore, asserted the truth of one instance in the time of the late Raja Ranjit-Singh, the questions of trance, burial, and death, being still doubtful. The great Akbar tried to become a Y ō gi, but fi rst wisely tested the power of the sect, by ordering them to encounter Sany ā sis of an opposing class, when the Y ō gis were dis- com fi ted (Sir H. Elliot, Mahom. Historians , v, p. 318). The Y ō gi system is very similar to those of western philosophers and hermits (see Prof. Weber, Indian Lit ., p. 239) as elsewhere described (see Porphyry). Gibbon ( Decline and Fall , ch. lxiii) relates the descrip- tion of similar practices by an abbot of Mt. Athos in Greece—the strange promontory of rock-perched monasteries still inhabited by Greek monks : “ When alone in thy ce ll shut thy door ; seat thyself in a corner ; raise thy mind above all things vain and transitory : re- cline thy head and chin on thy brea st ; turn thine eyes and thoughts towards the middle of thy belly, the region of the navel ; and search the place of thy heart, the seat of the soul. At fi rst all will be dark and comfortless ; but if thou dost persevere, day and night, thou wilt feel an ineffable joy ; and no sooner has the soul discovered the place of the heart than it is involved in an ineffable light.” The historian wisely adds that this “ light is th e production of a distempered fancy, an empty stomach, and empty brain.” But this is a mild form of the discipline that a Hindu undergoes to accomplish the Hatha-y ō g. He is thus instructed : “ Place the left foot on the right thigh, and the right foot on the left thigh : hold the right great toe with the right hand, the left great toe with the left hand, the hands crossing. . . .

The symbol is found in all the ancient hieroglyphic systems, as mat in Egyptian, muk in kuneiform, mo in Hittite, in each case meaning “ mother.” It is common in Asia and Europe : the earliest pictures of the naked godess in Asia Minor, Babylonia, or Egypt, are equally indecent with Keltik representati ons (see Sila-na-gig). Everywhere the. emblem wards off the evil eye, and confers prosperity like the phallus, with which it is often combined. It is symbolised later by the horse shoe, and the horse collar.

The sixty days of Yule-tide lasted from mid-November to mid-January among Goths of the 6th, or Saxons of the 7th, century A . C .; and the 24th December eve was “ mother’s night,” when a healing dew was said to fall. The Yule-tide sacri fi ces were forbidden in 578 A . C ., but the festival still continued. The word Yule has been thought to come from Hweol or “ wheel,” as denoting the wheeling of the sun (see Wheels), though Prof. Skeat connects it with the root ul “ to howl,” as referring to the cl amour of the feasts. The 25th of December was accepted as Christ mas day by Pope Liberius in 354 A . C ., and the “ Christ mass ” is noticed in a Saxon chronicle of 1038 A . C ., the season being then called the “ Yule month.” The Yule log was kept till the 2nd February (see Candlemass). Herrick writes : “ Kindle the Christmas brand and then Till sunset let it burn, Which quenched, then lay it up again Till Christmas next return. Part must be kept, wherewith to teend The Christmas log next year, And where ’tis safely kept the fi end Can do no mischief there.” The “ Yule candle ” on every table was sacred to Thor, like the May- pole ; and on 1st January (see Scotsman , 1st Jan. 1892) a pole was set np, surrounded with trusses of straw which were burned, while the farm hands were regaled with cide r and cakes. A hawthorn bough singed in the fl ames. was given to the farmer, who hung it up in the kitchen, and this, like the Yule log, must be kept till the same day next year.

The 12 signs of the ecliptic, or path of the sun (see Aries). [As already explained many doubtful statements have been made about these signs. The constellations overlap each other, and vary from 22° to 42° in length on the ecliptic (Mr E. W. Maunder, Monthly Notices Rl. Astronom. Socy ., March 1904, p. 490). The inventors of the Zodiak must have lived between 42° and 36° N. Latitude, or about the latitude of Mt. Ararat ; and the con- stellations cannot have been invented before about 3000 B . C ., nor are they traceable before about 600 B . C . The Kassite boundary stones of the 11th century B . C . give the emblems of 16 gods, and among these all the zodiakal signs occur, excepting the scales (a late sign), the water pot, and the fi shes ; but they do not occur in any regular order, and they are here only the symbols of gods, whose names are written on them, or are noticed in accompanyi ng texts. It is very remarkable that we still speak of the sun as “ entering Aries ” at the vernal equinox, which it ceased to do in 110 B . C . In 1904 it entered Aries on 18th April, Taurus on 11th May, and Gemini on 20th June. The earliest date at which it entered Aries at the spring equinox was 1680 B . C ., and the earliest date of entering Taurus would be 4410 B . C ., or before the zodiak was invented. The order of the zodiakal signs seems however to be connected with the names of the Babylonian deities who presided over the mont hs (see Year), beginning at the spring equinox, as follows :— Month.

C ., when Babylonian astronomy was known, after Alexander the Great had conquered the great city ; but our more exact knowledge is dependent on Ptolemy’s catalogue in our 2nd century. Aratos versi fi ed the ideas of Eudoxos ; Cicero translated his poem into Latin, and Hipparkhos was acquainted with Eudoxos and Aratos (see Cicero On Nature of Gods ). Porphyry as we pointed out ( Academy , 19th September 1885) says that Kallisth ē nes was the fi rst to bring Babylonian astronomy to Greece. The Hindus call the passage of the sun from one sign to another a Sakr ā nta , when special rites are observed. Some of these may be here noted (see Mr Atkinson, Journal Bengal Rl. Asiatic Socy ., i, 1884). The actually extant zodiakal stones are enumerated in Notes and Queries , (1st February 1898). In Min or Chait (Pisces, March) children visit their relatives, and place fl owers, and rice colored with turmeric, on the doorsteps, receiving in return food and garments. In Bikh (Aries, April), Uma, K ā li, N ā r ā yana, and R ā ma, are worshiped. The new year is reckoned from this month. In Kark (Cancer, July) there is a rest from labour, as the barley and maize was sown in the preceding month Mithun. The peasantry deck themselves with sprouts, and used to engage in stone-throwing and mimic wars, the prisoners taken being originally sacri fi ced. The “ scape dog ” is st ill hunted at this season (see ’Az ā zel). In Kanya (Virgo, September) hay and fuel is collected, and fi res are lighted on all hills with much singing and dancing. In Makar (Capricornus, January) great fairs take place. This used to be the fi rst month of the year. Figures of birds of baked fl our are hung round the necks of children.

[A short summary of the essay in question, with later annota- tions by the author, may be here gi ven. Of Zoroaster we have no real history, but many legends. The name, Zarathustra , in the early Zend Persian, is said by Darm esteter to mean a “ high priest ” ; and, while Zarathustra Spitama (“ the very pure (or white) high priest ”) is mentioned already in the Vendid ā d as though a historical person, his story is already a lege nd, in which he defeats the devil with the word of God, on a mountain. In one sense the Zend- Avesta (or “ law with comment ”) is the work of Zoroaster, inasmuch as it represents the laws laid down by “ high priests ” of the Persians ; but its books are not all of one age. Pliny, who says that Hermippos translated 20,000 lines of the work s of Zoroaster into Greek, com- menting on 2 million of his verses, and indexing several books on magic and science, believed that this prophet lived for 30 years in the desert, eating only cheese, an d insensible to the lapse of time. His mother was Dughda (“ the daughter ”) and he had 3 wives, 3 sons, and 3 daughters. He was born of a virgin who conceived by a ray of light which entered her bo som. When born he laughed. A tyrant king sought to slay the babe. He was pierced with spears, trampled by oxen and horses, and cast into a fi ery furnace where he shone as molten brass. He was tempted by Ahrirnan on a mountain, and received the law from God on Mount Elburz. He will reappear in the future (see Sosi osh) when the pious saints of the past will live again with him (see Sacred Books of East , iv, p. 77). Traditionally Zoroaster lived about 1800 B . C ., and converted King Vistasp. But the historical Vistasp, or Hystaspes, was the father of Darius I ; and, if he actually reigned in Persia, it was in the fi rst half of the 6th century B . C . before Cyrus. The Bundah ī sh (now extant only in the later P ā hlavi dialect) includes a valuable note (xxxiv, 7, 8) to the effect th at the “ coming of the religion ” was in the 30th year of Zoroaster’s age, the 30th year of the reign of Vistasp, and 272 years before Alexander the Great, which gives us a date about 600 B . C . The religion of the Zend Avesta appears to have been that of Darius I (see Persepolis), but is not monu- mentally known to have been that of Cyrus. Herodotos had heard"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"Zoroaster 525 the hymns of the Magi sung, in the 5th century B . C ., and his account of Persian beliefs and customs agrees with the Mazdean beliefs. Prof. Harlez thinks that the oldest part of the Avesta may date from 700 B . C . (before the Persians came into contact with Assyria), other parts being of about 400 B . C ., and some as late as 100 B . C . The language of the Vendid ā d, and of the 5 G ā thas or “ hymns,” is older than that of some of the other surviving books, and agrees with the language of the kuneiform texts of Darius I. In the Yasht (xxiii) we fi nd an allusion to “ Gaotema the heretic ” (Gotama Buddha), which is perbaps not older than the time of Ā s ō ka or 250 B . C . Mills on the other band would have the G ā thas to be as old as 1000, or even 1500 B . C . It is acknowledged that the Avesta was destroyed by Alexander the Great ; and the Vendid ā d is said to bave been the only one of 21 Nasks, or books, to escape complete. About 200 B . C ., a collection of 15 Nasks appears to have been made by Parthian kings, but the restora- tion of Mazd ē an literature was due to the Sassanian kings. Ardeshir I (226-240 A . C .) is said to have consulted Tansar, or Tosar, a prince who had become a priest ; and a le tter of Ardashir, to the king of Taberist ā n, was translated into Arabic in 762, and into Persian in 1210 A . C . This (whether genuine or not) speaks of 1200 skins of oxen covered with writing as having been burned by Alexander the Great, containing the sacred Persian laws. Shahp ū r I (240-274 A . C .) began to collect the lost books, perhaps from the oral preserva- tion by Magi ; and Shahpur II (309-379 A . C .) revised the canon, being aided by Adarpad, a priest who is said to have undergone the ordeal by boiling lead, which he drank unhurt, showing the veracity of his account of the scriptures. The Avesta, so recovered, included the Vendid ā d or “ law against fi ends,” the Visparad which consists of litanies, and the Yasna in which are included the Five G ā thas or “ hymns,” which Haug supposed to be the oldest part of the Avesta. The Yashts, or hymns to the divine spirits (see Yasts) form the Khorda-Avesta, or “ little law.” All that we can certainly say of this religious literature is, that Ah ū ra-mazd ā is noticed as the god of Darius I, and that texts of Xerxes refer to Mithra the sun god, and to Anahita the “ spotless ” virgin godess of the Yashts. The whole subject may be studied in various volumes of the great series of Sacred Books of the East . The P ā hlavi works (though some, like the Bundah ī sh, the Bahman Yasht, the Hadokht Nask, etc., claim to be translations of origin al parts of the Avesta) are more numerous, but much later than the Avesta proper, and are known to us only from manuscripts of our 14th century. The Vendid ā d and"},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"Zulus 526 Yashts are translated by Darmestete r (vols. iv and xxiii of the series in question) : the Visparad and Yasna by Mills (vol. xxxi) : the P ā hlavi works by West (vols. v, xviii, xxiv, xxxvii). The Avesta is remarkable for its inculcation of truthfulness, and love of goodness, amid much ancient superstition common to th e Vedas, and recognisable among the earliest Aryans of the West—a general heritage of the Aryan race. But the direct exhortation to “ good thoughts, words and deeds ” (Dinkard viii, 23) is found only in a late work in P ā hlavi, and may be traceable to Buddhist in fl uence. The legends of the Avesta have been noticed under various headings. The good and wise creator Ah ū ra-Mazd ā , “ the very wise spirit,\" is aided by seven spirits whom he created, called the Amesha- spentas or “ undying spirits.” He is opposed by Angro-mainy ū s, “ the wrathful mind,” and by the Darvands whom he produced ; but the Persian devil is “ ignorant ” of the designs of God, and will in the end be defeated, as he was when he attacked the heavenly city. The soul at death is led by the angel created by man’s good thoughts, words and deeds—his conscience—to the “ bridge of the gatherer,” guarded by the sacred dog. The soul of the wicked is blown by a noisome wind to darkness, there to dwell with the devil. All good men, beasts, and plants, were created by Ah ū ra, and all evil things by Angro-mainy ū s. It is the duty of the faithful to de stroy his creations, such as serpents, toads, etc. The fi rst man (see Yima) was righteous ; according to other legends the Gayo-mard, or “ bull-man,” was a prototype slain to produce all things created, and the fi rst pair Meshyo, and Meshya, grew from the sacred rhubarb tree, and fell because they attributed creation to Ahrim ā n (Bundah ī sh xv, 3). After 50 years of innocence, they were then clothed in leaves and skins. The science, and some of the mythology, of the Bundah ī sh seems to be borrowed from Babylon— including the story of six days of creation. The P ā hlavi dialect in which it exists is full of Semitic words, not found in the pure ancient Zend language. The Persians spoke of four ages : the golden age of Zoroaster : the silver age of Vistasp : the steel age of Adarpad (250 A . C .) : the iron age of apostacy after the Moslem conquest of 630 A . C . The present “ wolf age ” is to be followe d by a “ lamb age,” when Sosiosh, born of the seed of Zoroaster, but of a virgin who bathes in the lake Vouru-kasha, or ocean, will fi nally defeat Ahrim ā n.—E D .] Zulus.

The illustrations, . . . admirably bold sketches from the original, are of th e greatest value to the student, and the volumes, with their careful indexes, form a storehouse of research and learning, in which future writers may dig long without exhausting the material.”— Scotsman . “ This is the most comprehensive work that has yet appeared on Comparative Religion. It is indispensable to the stud ent, because it not only contains all the subjects treated of by past writers but that of more recent Oriental scholars, and sheds over such knowledge the light of personal investigation. The learned author has, during a long course of year s, utilised with indefatigable diligence the singular facilities afforded him by his du ties as an Engineer under the Indian Government. Symbolism, often only studie d by the aid of pictures and books, he has studied on the spot, and has collected an immense mass of information not generally attainable, . . . here all arranged and classi fi ed with perfect clearness. From this encyclopædia . . . he shows the evolution of faiths. . . . No one interested in Comparative Religion and anci ent symbolism can afford to be without this work.”— Index (America). “ Under the title of ‘ Rivers of Life,’ a very remarkable book has just appeared. It is the work of a General Forlong, who went out to India fi rst some forty years ago. He belongs to a service which ha s produced many able men, and some of them, like Yule and Cunningham, stand high as authorities on matters of Oriental archæology. From the size of General Forlong’s volumes, and experiences of the author, the work will no doubt form one of the most important contributions on the Evolution of human Faiths which has yet appeared. . . . The author shows all through that he is not without a strong religious feeling. He is to be con- gratulated on his courage for bringing be fore the reading public such a mass of information on topics as yet only known to a few. The author may prove right or wrong in the tracing of words, but the va lue of the ideas which he traces out in most cases does not depend in any way upon etymology for their signi fi cance.”— Glasgow Herald . “ General Forlong has devoted many years and incurred very heavy cost for the purpose of presenting to the world a work which no student of Comparative Religion can afford to neglect. The author has allowed neither time, distance, nor cost to prevent him from visiting any spot where he thought it possible to discover monumental data ; he has studied not only the written sources of Indian mythology, but has done so by the light of the explan ations given by living native authorities, and of the yet existing ancient customs of India. He has visited the most famous sanctuaries of both Europe and Asia, st udying alike the ruins of Jerusalem, of Delphi, Parnassus, and of Rome. The importance of ascertaining and recording the explanations which learned Brahmans give of the symbols and mythological records of their early faith, which no book s contain, is great and obvious. The list of authorities not only cited but read by the author contains some 800 volumes, including the latest efforts of the best-known scholars to pierce the obscurity which veils the ancient faiths of Asia.”— St James’ Gazette . “ This is a very important work in two volumes of nearly 1300 pages, treating exhaustively of Tree, Serpent, Fire, Sun, and Ancestor worships, and all the early faiths of the aboriginal races of Asia, Euro pe and adjacent countries, indeed, of all the world. It shows clearly all the move ments, growth, and evolution of universal religious thought.”— The American . \"General Forlong, who has served over thirty years in the British army in India, and been always employed in va rious administrative duties, and ever intimately associated with the natives, has issued the fi rst two volumes of his long promised work on the Evolution of Religious Thought from the fi rst rude sym- bolisms of Faiths to the latest Spiritual developments. Making himself master of many of the various local dialects of Indi a, and ever carefully cultivating friendly relations with natives of all ranks, prie sts and devotees, he has had revealed to him much of which the ordinary traveller and student is ignorant.”— New York Tnbune ."},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"3 “ ‘ The Rivers of Life, or Sources and Streams of the Faiths of Man in all Lands,’ is one of the most striking monum ents of literary labour given to the world for many years. It consists of two quarto volumes, containing 1270 pages, with carefully prepared indexes (extending over 54 pages, in close treble columns), and a most elaborate synoptical table having the names of all the different gods of mankind arranged in family groups. The author has quite a genius for putting his facts in this form, and makes use of it frequently with excellent effect through the book in presenting historical matter. There are other three Appendixes, two of which are maps—one showing the movements of early races and faiths, and the other the sacred places of ancient India. The interest of most readers will, however, be in the third Appendix. This is a coloured Chart of all faith streams, measuring 7 2 1 by 2 4 1 feet. It is impossible to exaggerate its use to the student of Comparative Religion. The various Cults referred to in the work are here shown by distinct colours in the centre space wi th the god-ideas or Incarnated forms of these. It possesses wide margins, and on one side is a well digested list of the main facts connected with the external relations of religion, and on the other a similar statement of its constituent elem ents. These are all arranged under their appropriate dates. A glance at the Chart therefore shows you what are the leading ideas in any particular creed, and by turning to the sides one is furnished with the actual historical circumstances. The work is not only well printed but profusely illustrated. There are, in addition, 17 full-sized plates, with archæo- logical drawings, and 339 other engravings at suitable places throughout the volumes. “ It is not surprising, then, to hear th at General Forlong has spent much time and money on his work. It is forty years since he fi rst commenced the study of religions. He went out to India as a young of fi cer full of evangelical fervour, but soon found that the natives had something to teach him, and with characteristic honesty he set himself to fi nd out the truth. . . . The scienti fi c spirit was strong in the author, and he has enjoyed much facility in carrying out his researches. His long residence in the East made him not only familiar with the language and worship of the various tribes, but brou ght him the friendship of priests and devotees. He has visited the shrines of Palestine as well as India, and spent many a holiday in antiquarian investigation at the sacred haunts of the West. “ This personal contact gives vividness and accuracy to his descriptions, but in the course of a busy life, and partic ularly during the past eight years of greater leisure, he has also through reading gained a fulness of information that has greatly contributed to the success of his Herculean task. A list of more than 900 volumes has been mastered or consulted in the preparation of the work, being every authority in English as well as many in French on the subjects treated. The result is an accumulation of facts that , were it not for their intrinsic interest, might be sometimes felt oppressive, but these will furnish a rich quarry to ()rdinary students. “ There is no negative attitude assumed to sacred writings, for ‘ they all eontain much that is true and good.’—One may gather from the contents or titles of the chapters the vast extent of territo ry and subjects embraced, and over all the author moves with a fi rm step. A wide induction and intimate acquaintance with his facts have given him con fi dence in his theory. This is stated with commendable candour, but without dogmatic pretensions, and the real value of the book is in no way dependent on its acceptance. Many of his positions will in all probability call forth attack, but the solid learning and intellectual ability exhibited by the author are sure to win him universal respect.”— Dundee Advertiser . From different Notices in the “ Inquirer .”—“ This elaborate work is in itself a perfect Encyclopredia of Compar ative Religion.

General Forlong’s is a most remark-able effort to elucidate the character of ancient religio ns by a method long adopted both by geologists and by archæologists, that of instituting comparisons between what"},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"4 belongs to the past and such present facts and incidents as can be discovered of a similar character. . . . He has collected an amazing amount of information . . . and his researches show beyond an y doubt that the Christianity of the orthodox churches has been extensively inti uenced by the chief elements he traces through so many mythologies. This work is specially valuable as the result of original investigation pursued during a long course of years throughout all portions of our Indian possessions and the least frequented parts. The reader will be fi lled with admiration at the marvellous patience of research and the accumulated stores of varied information conveyed in these volumes and rendered attractive by vivacity of style, abund ance of illustration, and typographical beauty. Being well versed in the Eastern languages and local dialects, he was led by his duties and love of research to visit all the sacred shrines of the East, and was thus able by friendly and long pr ivate intercourse to learn the real ideas of priests and devotees. The original rese arch of the work manifests itself as one proceeds, and the last chapter embodies in 174 pages a vast amount of valuable matter.”— Inquirer . “ Major-General Forlong has just publis hed, and Quaritch (15 Piccadilly) and Bouton (New York) publish a work which should be full of interest. The author has studied his subjects in the land where alone it can be fi tly investigated— India ; and his elaborate volumes are cert ainly a monument of industry. They are full of excellent illustrations, and are accompanied by a large chart showing very completely the rise and fall of religious ideas. . . . We know of no more bold and comprehensive effort to grapple with a subject so full of interest.”— Light . The Journal of the Anthropological Inst itute of Great Britain and Ireland for May 1883 reviews the “ Rivers of Life ” at some length, and very favourably, more especially treating of the ancient ra ces and faiths which, it says, the author “ has done good service in bringing. together so fully and so well.” In Modern Thought for January 1884, there is also a lengthened and favour- able notice of the “ Rivers of Life,” on the same lines as in the Journal of the Anthropological Institute."},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":" SHORT STUDIES IN THE SCIENCE OF COMPARATIVE RELIGIONS EMBRACING MORE ESPECIALLY THOSE OF ASIA, BY MAJOR-GENERAL J.

Elaborate Index, embracing all Names, Subjects, and Chief Authorities. T HIS is a large and important work by a no w well-known Orientalist, and forms a fi tcompanioil volume to his “ Rivers of Life, ” and is in the same type and style. It contains Ten Studies, which, owing to selection of the subjects, make the book a veritable epitome of all Ancient and Mode rn Faiths, except Christianity, which is only touched upon when necessary in the all-embracing Science of Comparative Religion. The subjects are not only of immediat e but enduring interest—historically, literary, and religiously, more especially to the peoples concerned, and the governing .and administrative classes of Trans-In dia—English, French, Dutch, Javanese, Siamese, Tongkin ī s, and Cochinese. The fi rst two studies enter minutely into the very ancient social, religious, and politic al history of these and other adjoining states and nations, of which little is rea lly known even by themselves, and still less by their rulers, conquerors, or suzerain lords. As regards ancient Indian history, the author advances strong reasons against the popular belief that Aryans were, eith er in India or further eastward, the fi rst or chief civilizers ; attributing this to Dr ā vido-Turanians and Mongolic peoples who entered India from the West and North, probably a thousand or more years before Aryans touched the Ganges. Stress is laid on the ingress of a mid-northern race by the tracks of the chief rivers of the ancient kingdom of Uttar Kos ā la or Sr ā v ā sti, more especially by the passes of the Gogra and K ā rnali—probably the ancient Sr ā vasti and M ā la-inda or “ river of M ā las.” There is a great deal in this volume to prove that man's fi rst cultus was Arboreal, or as now termed, a worship of divinities of vegetation, as spirits of groves, trees, corn, and such like. This cult is here shown to be as strong in"},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"6 India and Trans-India as among Syrian s, Hebrews, Tyrrhenians, Greeks, and Latins. Thus the author upholds the argu ments and position he took up in his former work, some twenty years ago, tbat all early gods were but rural and tribal divinities embodying the sensuous wants and ideas of the needy and ignorant ; that there is little to choose between the ruddy Etruskan god of groves, the Pelasgian Dodona, Aryan Zeus, and the Ā la, Ā l ē or Elohim of Semites. All claimed the tree symbol and lordship over animal and vegetable nature, and there- fore was this symbol placed in 1880 at the head of the author’s “ Chart of Rivers of Life ” or Faith-ideas. The monographs on Zoroaster, L ā o-tsze, Confucius, and Mahamad place these leaders of multitudes more succinctly and graphically before us than has yet been done ; and bring out many features heretofore overlooked or insuf fi ciently dealt with; and the adjoining chronological tabl es supply a wealth of information most necessary to have at hand in these important studies. Under “ Sacred Books of the West,” the author so far only gives us the history and development of the Bible of the He brews as seen in the quasi “ Greek Septuagint,” but this is done historically and carefully, and shows the best criticism of the subject up to date in a simple and clear manner, with a result which may surprise many but should offend none. The volume closes, and we may almost say is summed up in Study XI, which is a metrical epitome in Short Texts of Faiths and Philosophies chronologically gleaned from all sacred writings and the teachings of the wise and good. These are charmingly realistic and often very quaint , for they are pithily strung together, and enable one to grasp the national and homely piety, literary style, and the general culture of the old thinkers.— Prospectus . ———————————————————— “ Comparative Mythology is a very large subject, and is most attractive to many thoughtful people merely as an inte resting study ; but it is beginning now to Rssume new aspects from its bearing on the history of human progress ; it throws new lights on the steps by which man advanced from barbarism to his present condition of civilisation. . . . . . . . . . . “ It is this wider grasp which distinguishes General Forlong’s book. . . . “ To the student of Indian religions the article on Jainism and Buddhism will have a special attraction. The Jainas are still a large sect in India, and when the investigation of these subjects fi rst began it was supposed from their teaching and customs they were the remains of what ha d survived of the Buddhists. Sir Henry Yule—better known as ‘ Colonel Yule ’—even as late as the publication of his ‘ Hobson-Jobson ’ describes them as 'the earliest heretics of Buddhism.’ Ultim- ately, it was discovered that Jainism was as old at least as Buddhism, and at last it came out that Maha Vira, the last of the Jaina Tirthankars, was living at the same time as Gotama Buddha, but the J ai na prophet was the elder of the two. Maha Vira was said to be the last of twenty-four Tirthankars, or prophets, that had appeared at various dates in the past. The greater part of these are no doubt legendary ; but General Forlong accepts Parsva, the twenty-third Tirthankar, whose date may be assigned to the ninth century B . C ., as being historical ; and he believes that Jainism existed through most of Northern India, Afghanistan, and Bactria from a very early period, and Bu ddhism was only an offshoot from this older faith. Of course it need not be pointed out that most of these data about the Jainas belong to the very outer verge of our present knowledge ; but the primary fact that their form of teaching is older than Buddhism is now well established, and that in itself is almost suf fi cient to prove that the younger faith grew out of that which preceded it. This conclusion derives its great probability from the close resemblance that exists between the two systems ; the differences are so slight that the one must almost necessarily be a sect of the other. . . . . “ There is another aspect of the subject into which General Forlong enters very fully ; that is, as to whether Buddhism is essentially Aryan or Turanian in its origin ; and he concludes that it—which in his view includes Jainism—belongs more particularly to the latter race. But there is another branch of this subject, which is, perhaps, equally important. This refers to the early civilisation of India"},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"7 —was it Aryan or Turanian ? When the Indo-Aryans fi rst arrived in the region they called the natives ‘ Asuras,’ or demons, and used other contemptuous names for them. Up till lately it has been gene rally assumed that these people were in a low, primitive state, and the improvem ent of their condition was due to the invaders. It has now been shown that the Aryans who entered from the north- west were in the nomadic stage, and what ever they may have brought with them, they could not have had many of the arts of a civilised life. There is a description of a temple in the ‘ Satapatha Brâhmana,’ the date of which may be put at about 1000 B . C ., and the structure was nothing more than posts, mats, and reeds. That was the condition at that date of architec ture among the conquering race. On the other hand it is stated in the ‘ Mah ā bh ā rata ’ that the palace of the Pandavas, near the present Delhi, was constructed by Maya, an architect, who was a ‘ Daitya,’ or ‘ Asura,’ which means that he was one of the aborigines, and, although probably a mythical character, that does not detrac t from the conclusion that the Aryans received their architecture from the country they had invaded. But there is more than that to be said on this point. It is now well established that the Dravidian architecture of India was derived from th e primitive wooden style of these Daityas or Asuras. Modern historians now recognise architecture as one of the tests which may be applied in estimating the progress that has been made in the vari- ous stages of civilisation; and in this case the evidence speaks for itself. If these pre-Aryans had the art of architecture, we may suppose they had along with it other arts, and that they were far from be ing the rude race that has hitherto been assumed. “ The connection of Zoroastrianism with the Vedic system has long been recognised, but its af fi nities with Semitic teaching is a later aspect of the subject, which yet requires more investigation devoted to it. General Forlong deals at some length with this old faith of the Parsees or Sun Worshippers. . . . . “ The effort here has been to show that the book is full of valuable matter that has been gathered in from the Fa r East; and that whatever may be the ultimate decision on the more speculative points with which it so largely deals, it will be found to contain much that is deeply ipteresting to the student of Com- parative Mythology.”— Daily Chronicle , 17th August 1897. “ The author of this substantial volume has already earned a reputation in connection with the subject of which it treats. It is fourteen years since he fi rst made a serious contribution to its literat ure by two massive quartos entitled ‘ The Rivers of Life.’ They represented the l abours of more than twenty years spent in the most favourable circumstances for ac quiring an intimate acquaintance with the history of religion. Our author was early led by his profession to settle in the East, and it was while there that he became specially interested in the curious cults around him. The subject at last fascinated him, and he has devoted the best of a laborious lifetime to its service. A book written by anyone under such conditions could not fail to be of great value, but in General Forlong we have a man of unresting assiduity, exceptional intelligence, and unswerving integrity. He has thrown himself with singular ent husiasm into the study of religions, and not content to rest on the laurels won fourteen years ago he has again appeared before the public with this portly folio of nearly 700 pages. The volume, with the ex- ception of a few slips in spelling, very pardonable where one has to deal with so many strange names, and where one tries to carry out, as our author does, an improved system of spelling, is sure to impress the reader with the capacity of those responsible for its issue. It is well printed on good paper, with suf fi cient margins, and sent forth provided with ex cellent maps, most valuable chronological tables, and a very useful index. “ It is impossible in the space at our disp osal to give an adequate idea of the contents of this remarkable book. Some of it has already appeared in magazines dealing with Oriental topics, and the whole of it is a mere selection from the vast stores of information that have accumulate d, and that have to a. certain extent taken form during many years of diligent research, but there is nothing frag- mentary or incoherent in consequence of this arrangement. These studies consist of eleven articles, each of which might ha ve appeared independently by itself, and yet all of which have an intimate relation to the science of comparative religion,"},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"8 while some of them, as will be obvious from their titles, have even a nearer kin- ship. ‘ The selection of these Short Studie s,’ writes the author in his introductory chapter, ‘ has enabled us to virtually embrace and epitomise all the faiths and religiou~ ideas of the world, as well as to lay bare the deep-seated tap root from which they sprang.’ . . . . . . . . . . “ The fi rst article is on ‘ Jainism and Buddh ism.’ The author does not attempt to give us the genesis of religion, but only to fi nd a basis from which ‘ such grand old structures as the G ā thas of the Vedas and the Avasta arose.’ The most important fact brought out in this article is the relation of Jainism to Buddhism. All through these studies we see the nece ssity for a preparation. There is no Minerva leaping from the head of Jove. We have 24 Bodhas or saints before the birth of Gotama, extending back over a period of from 600 to 3000 B . C . Another interesting fact brought out in this conne ction is the relative importance of the Aryan and the Turanian. Buddha belongs to the latter, and to them India is indebted, in the opinion of our author, for most of her philosophy and civilisation. A great part of this article is devoted to a discussion as to the in fl uence of Buddhism on Christianity. The subject is handled with great scholarship and candour. Much is made of the proselytising zeal of the Buddhist missionaries, and the easy intercourse between East and West during the fi rst two centuries before our era. Our author has no doubt that Buddhism is manifest alike in Jewish Essenism and in Alexandrian mysticism. “ The second article is on ‘ Trans-Indian Religions.’ It is a specially learned treatise on the migrations of the Malas or Malays, ‘ the mountaineers.’ They arrive in the ‘ Hindu Holy Land ’ from Baktria. One fi nds them millenniums before the Aryans at the foot of the Himalayas or Snow Mountains—in the vale and plains of the Man-sarvar lakes. Four sacred rivers issue from this spot, and following these the Malays at last reach the fertile plains of India, from which they spread themselves in all directions to the Archipelago in the East, to Ceylon, to Polynesia, and even to Americ a, as the Aztec language and civilisa- tion prove. They were a very enterprisi ng ,people, and taught the Aryans almost everything they knew. “ The third article is on ' Zoroaster and Mazda-ism.’ . . . . . . “ There is a close connection between this article and the following three. They are on the Vedas and Ved ā ntism, L ā o-tsze and Taoism, and Confucius and Confucianism. The Aryans entered India, not as conquerors, but as colonisers, being for long, not only intellectually, but socially, inferior to the Malas or Dravidians. The Brahmans were rather priests than thinkers, and got all their philosophy from the Turanian pundits. Th e Vedas, like our Scriptures, in spite of the high claim made for their inspiration, are not so much a book as a literature, and represent not only a great variety, but a great difference of religious opinion and conduct. They are generally polythei stic anlt anthropomorphic. Vedantism is a reaction against their superstitions, an d is essentially pantheistic. The reward of virtue is absorption ; but one must be a theologian to distinguish such a loss of individuality from annihilation. “ There is a certain resemblance between Taoism and Vedantism. Tao, like Brahm, is not a personal but a metaphysical deity. L ā o-tsze was something of a mystieas well as a moralist. Goodness coul d alone and by itself secure salvation, but Tao was the way ; and one who lived a ccording to his precepts was at last identi fi ed with him. The system, however, strayed into Yogaism, and encouraged resignation and meditation. All evil arose from action. It came ultimately to teach the personal existence of Tao as a heavenly Father, and to emphasise the existence of spirits. “ Confucius was in all respects a contrast to L ā o-tsze. He was practical and de fi nite, a moralist but not a mystic. When asked by his great rival at a confer- ence to believe in souls and in divine inspiration, he replied, ‘ I have been a seeker for nearly thirty years, but have not yet found.’ He was an agnostic or positivist. Great importance was naturally attached to politics. It was our duty to work for the improvement of the State, and ou r wisdom to avoid vain speculation and. pro fi tless discussion. His system of morals was embraced in the word ‘ Reciprocity.’"},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"9 “ The next three articles have a reference to the religion of Jews and Christians. One is on ‘ The Elohim of the Hebrews,’ th e other on ‘ The Jehovah of the Hebrews,’ and the third is entitled ‘ The Sacred Books of the West.’ They are very scholarly and somewhat startling. Elohim, the word used in our Bible for God, is derived from Al, ‘ the strong one,’ and is associ ated with the worship of trees and of fi re. The Ale-im were local spirits under and ov er the earth ; in other words, the mono- theism of the Jews, as that of every other nation, sprang from polytheism. “ The ninth article is on ‘ The Greek Sept uagint and the Bible of the Hebrews.’ It. proceeds on the familiar lines of what is called ‘ the higher criticism,’ but special stress is put on the destruction of the orig inal MSS. There is the tradition of Ezra reproducing by miracle the sacred books which had existed before his time, but the Septuagint translation was burned in the Bruchium library in the great fi re of 47 B . C ., while the ‘ Temple Standard ’ Roll was sent to Rome by Josephus after the fall of Jerusalem and never more heard of. Corruption has since then gone on apace, and was greatly helped by the well-meant attempt of Origen to prevent it, the text, his emendations and comments, being hopelessly mingled. A revised version of our Scriptures is th erefore maintained to he an impossibility in the absence of reliable MSS. “ The tenth study, ‘ Mahamad and Mahama danism, or Islam and its Bible,’ is one of the most extensive and interesting. It is a very careful and sympathetic piece of work. The experience of the auth or, his intimacy with the representatives of so many religions, gives him a great advantage in the treatment of living religions. It is specially seen in th is really ample and excellent study. “ The last article will be justly popular. It is called ‘ Short Texts in Faith and Philosophies.’ Much labour has been bestowed on it. The author brings before us in chronological order the sentiments and ideas of the wisest and best on creed and conduct. It is astonishing to fi nd how they meet and embrace each other across the centuries, and goes a long way to con fi rm the conclusion reached by the circle of friends in the house of the great Shaftesbury that wise men were all of one religion. We hope the author may be induced to publish this part of his book separately in cheap form, that it may obtain the circulation which it deserves.”— Glasgow Herald , 1st July 1897. “ Any book on Comparative Religion by Major-General Forlong is sure to attract attention. He established his reputation as a scholar and an Orientalist several years ago by two massive volumes on the origin and nature of religion as it is specially illustrated by an experience of the East. The book came out under the title ‘ The Rivers of Life,’ and was simp ly a mine of information. The present bulky folio of nearly 700 pages is better digested and more mature. It is well printed, and sent forth with an admirabl e equipment of excellent maps, a synopti- cal introduction, elaborate chronological t ables, and a carefully prepared index, all of which do much to elucidate its co ntents, and will be found extremely valu- able. It is dif fi cult within limited space to do justice to the varied and substantial merits of such a book. Few men could be better prepared to undertake it than General Forlong. Some may have read more, but one cannot understand a religion or religions by mere reading. He has, howe ver, not only devoted years to studying the literature of his subject, he has had the advantage of personal acquaintance with the representatives of different cults and creeds through a long residence in Eastern lands. It cannot be said that ther e is in his treatment of them any bias in favour of Christianity, but one cannot fa il to be impressed by his sympathy and candour. There is here neither the dexter ity of the apologist nor the rancour of the partisan. The author has evidently star ted with an earnest desire to discover the truth, and he has always the courage of his convictions. “ The book consists of eleven studies, anyone of which may be taken separately, but all of which are more or less related. The fi rst is on ‘ Jainism and Buddhism.’ It is really an elaborate dissertation on the religious movement culminating in Christianity. Instead of Jainism being, as was formerly supposed, an offshot from Buddhism, it is shown to extend as far back as 3000 B . C . It is found fl ourishing alongside the nature worship of the rude trib es in Northern India. In fact, it is one of the fi rst protests against the debasing su perstitions of the popular religion in the interests of intelligence and morality. There may be counted twenty-four"},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"10 Bodhas, or saintly teachers, before the sixth century B . C ., and there was thus a long preparation for Buddha. He was the heir of the ages, and he pro fi ted by their wisdom. The great ques tion among the sects of his time had reference to the existence of the soul. Buddha plays wi th the accepted doctrine of transmigra- tion, but is explicit in his denial of th e supernatural. The soul to him is not personality, but character. It would be too long, however, to follow the interesting account of this system given by the author , of its adoption by King Asoka about the middle of the third century B . C ., and of his sending out missionaries in all directions to preach its gospel. Genera l Forlong points out that Asoka on be- coming a Buddhist changed his title, and it is signi fi cant of the difference between Jainism and Buddhism. Before his conver sion he was known as ‘ Devanam-piya ’ (‘ The Beloved of Gods ’), but after it he called himself # Raja-piya-dassi ’ (‘ The Kindly or Humane One ’), as if he no longer believed in the supernatural. The evidence given as to the rapid spread of Buddhism through Western Asia and even to Alexandria, principally through the agency of Asoka, is ample and con- vincing, while it is hardly possible to exaggerate the importance of the fact when we remember not only the many miraculous coincidences in the narratives of Buddha and Jesus, but also the frequent similarity in ethical ideas. “ The second article is on ‘ Trans-Indian Religions.’ It is an extremely learned and careful study on the character and mi grations of the Malays. The author follows them from the foot of the Himalayas, where round the Mana-Sarvar lakes lies the Holy Land of India, down through the plains, on towards not only China and Japan, but to Ceylon, Polynesia, and even America. One may call them Turanians, or better still, Mongols or Dravidians, but to these M ā las or moun- taineers (as the name implies), General Fo rlong contends, the Aryans, who succeeded them, are greatly indebted for their civilis ation. Buddha himself belonged to them, and it was they who successfully o pposed the armies of Alexander. The third study is on ‘ Zoroaster and Mazdaism.’ Here is one of the oldest of what is called book religions. This study is followe d by one on ‘ The Vedas and Vedantism.’ When the Aryans invaded India they found the crowd addicted to nature worship, but also elect souls impressed by the ethi cal teaching of Jaino-Bodhism. They did not immediately conquer the Malas, but were content for long to be the Ary ā s, ‘ the lowly third class ’ in the community, but in due course, by dint of pride and practicality, they rose to be the Aryas, ‘ the nobler ones,’ and the Brahman-priest usurped the position of the Turanian monarch. Vedantism is simply a reaction from the superstition of the Vedas. Brahma with it becomes Brahm—not a personal deity, but a metaphysical concep tion. It teaches that God is to be served, not by sacri fi ces, but by morality, and that the reward of virtue will be absorption into the Divine Being, a condit ion that must not be confounded with extinction. “ The next two studies transfer the reader to China. The fi rst is on ‘ Lao-tsze and Taoism,’ the second on ‘ Confucius and Confucianism.’ Lao-tsze is the elder of the two by almost half a century, and Confucius is a contemporary of Buddha. Though natives of the same country, there was a distinct difference in the spiritual attitude of these two teachers. Both resolved salvation into morality, and Lao- tsze was suf fi ciently speculative. His position , indeed, suggests Vedantism. Tao is, like Brahm, rather an idea than a pers on, and is, as the name implies, The Way, or ideal of conduct. Confucius might have so far agreed with him, but they not only differed in doctrine—they were contra sts in disposition. Lao-tsze was con- templative and mystical ; Confucius practi cal and positive. The one made much of resignation ; the other was all for action. They met once in conference, and it ended in controversy. When Lao-tsze in sisted that the younger teacher should accept the belief in souls and divine inspiration he answered : ‘ I have been a seeker for nearly thirty years, but have not yet found.’ They came together to go further apart. Lao-tsze seems not only to have abandoned his metaphysical for a personal deity, but to have made much of spirits, and it has been maintained that his Bible contains ‘ the very word of the Supreme God.’ The attitude of Confucius, on the contrary, towards all such questions was that of an agnostic. He refused to reconsider them, and gave himself up to affairs of government. Everyone knows his famous summary of the moral law in the one word—reci- procity. But if he apprehended the golden rule he did not practise it like a"},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"11 Christian. He objected to Lao-tsze for teaching that one should return good for evil, insisting that one should, on the cont rary, recompense injury with justice, and reserve kindness for kindness. “ The succeeding two studies are closely re lated to each other. One is ‘ The Elohim or Aleim of the Hebrews ’ ; the other, ‘ The Jehovah of the Hebrews.’ The study on ‘ The Sacred Books of the West’ leads naturally to one on ‘ Ma- hamad and Mahamadanism, or Islam and it s Bible.’ It extends to about 100 pages, and is yet a marvel of condensation. The long residence of its author in the East is here seen to advantage. Th e estimate is sympathetic but just. Ma- hamad is allowed to have been sincere and generous, but he was a fanatic, and that counts for much. His religion was well suited for his country, and also proves useful to certain semi-civilised peoples to-day, but it is too restricted and un- spiritual ever to rank as a universal re ligion. It would be hardly possible to exaggerate the amount of labour bestowed on this study, but the learning dis- played in it neither burdens the read er nor detracts from its interest. “ The ninth article is a learned treatise on ‘ The Greek Septuagint and the Bible of the Hebrews.’ It is strong meat for timid Churchmen. The critical position is that of the extreme Left. Much is made of the destruction of the original manuscripts, and the subsequent corruption of the text. The roll of the Temple Standard was, we are told, sent to Rome by Josephus and disappeared ; while the Septuagint is supposed to have been lost at the burning of the Bruchium Library, 47 B . C . ‘ Our various texts,’ it is af fi rmed, ‘ all belong to mediæval times, and come from unknown and dubitabl e sources.’ The last paper is entitled ‘ Short Texts in Faiths and Philosophies.’ It is an epitome of the Scriptures emanating from the wise and good in ev ery land, and is arranged according to their order in time. It will be the most popular section of this important book, and might well form a small volume by itself. The selections begin with the wisdom of Egypt, and end with the sayi ngs of Mahornet, the whole forming a very complete conspectus of the be st ideas in religious literature. “ It is unnecessary after such a survey to enlarge on the merits of this book. It is the work of an enthusiast who has ma de himself a scholar. There is a wealth of useful and often not easily accessible in formation in it, which makes it of great value to a numerous and growing circle in terested in the study of Comparative Religion.”— Dundee Advertiser , 8th July 1897. “ Major-General Forlong, who has already devoted two large quarto volumes, entitled ‘ Rivers of Life,’ to the study of early faiths, has followed them by a thick book of 645 pages, entitled ‘ Short Studies in the Science of Comparative Religions.’ Many interesting points in connection with the rise of races and religions are opened up, and in particular the paths by which these faiths may have travelled westwards. This had an important bearin g on the history of Christianity. Major- General Forlong says boldly in his second page :— “ ‘ Those of us who are not trammelled by our surroundings have for the most part felt convinced that there has been a close, early connection between Buddhism and Christianity, and that the younger western faith has borrowed many ideas, legends, and parables from the older eastern one ; while the scienti fi c evolutionist, who can neither fi nd a fi rst man, fi rst rose, or fi rst anything, has stood apart, silently scouting the idea of a fi rst faith, be it that of Jew or Gentile, Buddhist or Christian. To such an one the prophet or reformer, be he Buddha, Mohammed, or Luther, is but the apex or fi gure-head of a pyramid, the foundations of which were laid long before his birth.’ . . . . . . . . . . “ The second study on Trans-Indian Re ligions gives specially interesting and origmal views on the character and migratio n of the Malays. The author advances strong reasons against the belief that Aryans were, either in India or further east- ward, the fi rst or chief civilisers; attributing this to Dravido-Turanians and Mon- golic peoples who entered India from the West and North, possibly a thousand or more years before Aryans touched the Ganges. The immense ruins of Cambodia are described, and the connection with ancient India in serpent and phallic worship shown. “ The third study is on Zoroastriani sm and Mazdaism, represented by the modern Parsis. . . . . . . . . . . . . ."},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"12 “ The Vedas of the Hindus are next de alt with. Our author holds that the Aryans as they penetrated India took ov er much of the Dravidian cult and civili- sation. His experience in India is naturally of great value in this section. His exposition of Vedântism gives in concise compass a very valuable insight into the mystical philosophy of India. The faiths of China are dealt with in two articles, one on Lao-tsze, the old philosopher, and T ā o-ism; and the second on the more rationalistic system of Confucius. “ Interspersed with the erudite inform ation of the book are many shrewd observations, as witness the following :— “ ‘ All gods, being the work of men’s mi nds, if not indeed of their hands, require to be kept up to their duties, and in the prayers of most priests as well as laymen their duties are rather alertly po inted out to them, for peradventure they sleep, and require rousing. Only if our Go d never forgets, leaves, or forsakes us do we “ praise his holy name.” Jacob chose Yahve because of his promised bounties to him. Useless and negligent gods were often cast aside, and even fl ogged, as we shall see in China and Polynesia.’ ”— Free Thought , 17th October 1897. “ We record with pleasure the publication of General J. G. R. Forlong’s ‘ Short Studies in the Science of Comparative Religio ns.’ The wide and long experience of the author, combined with the practical po ints of view which he has adopted, is certainly destined to bear fruit in the fi eld of comparative mythology and religious belief. The present volume, which consists of ampli fi cations of certain encyclo- pædia articles on religious terms, rites, and symbolisms, is virtually an epitome of religions, particularly those of Asia. It is intended for the general reader rather than the specialist, the former of whom will fi nd here good representative extracts from the religious literature of the Asiatic nations, and a brief digest of their main tenets and beliefs. A number of illustrati ons and several excellent maps, that are invaluable in such studies, accompany the text.”— The Open Court , September 1897."},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":" Editorial note to the Celephaïs Press edition This edition of Faiths of Man was OCR’d and proofed from page images of a copy of the first edition, previously in the colle ction of the Shropshire public library system but withdrawn and sold at an unc ertain date (possibly 1980s, and probably because of the lack of interest shown by readers; when it came into my possession many pages were still uncut) and currently in the possession of the present type- setter. Pagination, layout, spelling (including Forlong’s eksentrik ‘fonetik’ rendition of many English words) and styl e have been conformed as far as possible to the first edition with the exceptions th at a few obvious typografikal errors have been corrected as have the comparatively few errata items noted at the end of the subject index in vols. I and II; the errata notices themselves are omitted. “ A . C .” for “After Christ” was Forlong’s notation for years of the Christian error ( A . D . / C . E . / E . V ., &c. &c.). Those of you who have read Rivers of Life and survived the consequent SAN loss may recall a list in the prefatory matter of thirteen monographs on individual religions or to the Faiths of particular regi ons, as being in preparation, as well as a “Glossary or Polyglot Dictionary” which wa s cited in many places throughout those two quartos. Some of the latter citation s are elucidated by the present volumes, though many are not; and in so far as the detailed studies were written at all and not included in Short Studies in the Science of Comparative Religions , their con- tents can probably be found dispersed through these volumes. This completes the Celephaïs Press edition of the major works of General Forlong. It has been a lot of work and I am not entirely sure it was worth it; while there is much of interest in the present vo lumes, they are scarcely suited as a work of general reference on religious topics, many of the articles being frankly polemical or simply marred by the author’s social prejudices, and many more simply having been superceded by archæological and anthropological findings in the 100+ years since these volumes first went to press (without going too far into detailed criticisms, for me this is most acut ely felt in the area of dynastic Egyptian religions; many of his questionable assertio ns, such as treating Nut and Neith as the same deity, and associating the cat goddess Bast with the dwarf-god Bes may have derived from nineteenth-century E gyptological writings, but these latter can be most charitably characterised as the prod ucts of a discipline in its infancy; in addition, the article ‘Sakta’ is probably su fficient grounds to have the man struck from the canon of Saints of Ecclesia Gnos tica Catholica). While the tendency to ramble and go off at tangents which marred Rivers of Life has been somewhat constrained by the encyclopædia format, we still find instances where the majority of the text under a given heading is only peripherally related to that heading. As already indicated, editions of Rivers of Life and Short Studies in the Science of Comparative Religions are available from Celephaïs Press. I currently have no intention of tracking down any of the General’s journal articles, &c.; life is too short. T.S. Leeds, England: November 2006 E .
