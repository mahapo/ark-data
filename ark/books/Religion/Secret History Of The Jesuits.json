The information in this book is factual and fully documented, and it should be read by every Bible-believing Christian in the United States and Canada. The Bible says, \"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.\" (Hosea 4:6) J.T. C Dr. Rivera's Introduction The most dangerous of men are those who appear very religious, especially when they are organized and in a position of authority. They have the deep respect of the people who are ignorant of their ungodly push for power behind the scenes. These religious men, who pretend to love God, will resort to murder, incite revolution and wars if necessary to help their cause. They are crafty, intelligent, smooth religious politicians who live in a shadowy world of secrets, intrigue, and phony holiness. This pattern, seen in \"The Secret History of the Jesuits,\" spiritually speaking can be seen in the Scribes, Pharisees and Sadducees at the time of Jesus Christ. This same evil spirit directed the Roman emperors to issue the ten murderous decrees to persecute the early Christian church. The \"Early Fathers\" observed most of the ancient Babylonian system plus Jewish theology and Greek philosophy. They all perverted most of the teachings of Christ and His apostles. They paved the way for the Roman Catholic machine that was to come into existence. Piously, they attacked, perverted, added to and took away from the Bible. This religious anti- christ spirit working through them is seen again when Ignatius de Loyola created the Jesuits to secretly acco mplish two major goals for the Roman Catholic Institution: 1) universal political power, and 2) a universal church, in fulfillment of the prophecies of Revelation 6, 13, 17 and 18. By the time Ignatius de Loyola a rrived on the scene, the Protestant Reformation had seriously damaged the Roman Catholic system. Ignatius de Loyola came to the conclusion that the only way his \"church\" could survive was by enforcing the canons and doctrines on the temporal power of the pope and the Roman Catholic institution; not by just destroying the physical life of the people alone as the Dominican priests were doing through the Inquisition, but by infiltration and penetration into every sector of life. Protestantism must be conquered and used for the benefit of the popes. That was Ignatius de Loyola's personal proposal, among others, to Pope Paul III. Jesuits immediately went to work se cretly infiltrating ALL the Protestant groups including their families, places of work, hospitals, schools, colleges, etc. Today, the Jesuits have almost completed that mission."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The Bible puts the power of a local church into the hands of a Godly pastor. But the cunning Jesuits successfully managed over the years to remove that power into the hands of denomination headquarters, and have now pushed almost all of the Protestant denominations into the arms of the Vatican. This is exactly what Ignatius de Loyola set out to accomplish: a universal church and the end of Protestantism. As you read \"The Secret History of the Jesuits,\" you will see there is a parallel between the religious and political sectors. The author, Mr. Paris, reveals the penetration and infiltration of the Jesuits into the governments and nations of the world to manipulate the course of history by setting up dictatorships, and weakening democracies such as the United States of America, by paving the way for social, political, moral, m ilitary, educational and religious anarchy. The man, Edmond Paris In the prophetical works of the Book of Revelation, Edmond Paris became a martyr for Jesus. In exposing such a co nspiracy, he put his life at stake for truth of the prophetical signs to be known. Edmond Paris never knew me, but I knew him without meeting him personally when I, with other Jesuits under the extreme oath and induction, was being briefed on the names of institutions and individuals in Europe who were dangerous to the goals of the Roman Catholic Institution. His name was given to us. Works by Edmond Paris LE VATIAN CONTRE LA FRANCE GENOCIDE IN THE SATELLITE CROATIA THE VATICAN AGAINST EUROPE The Edmond Paris works on Roman Catholicism brought about the pledge on the part of the Jesuits to: 1) destroy him, 2) destroy his reputation, including his family, and 3) destroy his work. And even now these great works of Edmond Paris are being tampered with, but we are praying that God will continue to preserve them when they are most needed for the salvation of Roman Catholic people.

(Eph. IV, 25.) Foreword A last century writer, Adolphe Michel, recalled that Voltaire estimated the number of works published over the ye ars, on the Jesuits, to be about six thousand. \"What number have we reac hed a century later?\", asked Adolphe Michel, only to conclude immediately: \"No matter. As long as there are Jesuits, books will have to be written ag ainst them. There is nothing new left to be said on their account, but new ge nerations of readers come every day... Will these readers search old books?\"(l) The reason just mentioned would be enou gh to justify us taking up again this oft-told subject. In fact, most early books retracing the history of the Jesuits cannot be found any more. Only in public libraries can they still be consulted, which makes them out of reach for most readers. With the aim of succinctly informing the public at large in mind, a summary of these works seemed necessary. There is another reason, as good as th e one just mentioned. At the same time as new generations of readers come, new generations of Jesuits come to light. And these work today with th e same tortuous and tenacious met hods, which so often in the past set to work the defensive reflexes of nations and governments. The sons of Loyola are today—and may we say more than ever—the leading wing of the Roman Church. As well if not better disguised than of old, they remain the most eminent \"ultramontanes\", the discreet but efficacious agents of the Holy See throughout the world, the camouflaged champions of its politics, the \"secret army of the Papacy\". For this reason, the subject of the Jesuits will never be exhausted and, even though the literature concerning them is so plentiful, every epoch will have the duty to add a few pages to it, to mark the continuity of this occult system started four centuries ago \"for th e great glory of God\", but in fact (1 ) Adolphe Michel: \"Les Jesuites\" (Sandoz et Fischbacher, Paris 1879)."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"8 THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE JESUITS for the glory of the pope. In spite of the general move towards an ever increasing \"laicization\", in spite of the ineluctable progress of rationalism which reduces a little more every da y the domain of \"dogma\", the Roman Church couldn't give up the great purpose which has been her goal from the beginning: to gather under her crozier all the nations of the universe. This monumental \"mission\" must go on, whatever happens, amongst \"pagans\" as well as amongst \"separated Christians\". The secular clergy having, in particular, the duty to hold the acquir ed positions (which is quite arduous nowadays), it is up to certain regular orders to increase the flock of the faithful by converting the \"heretics\" and \"pagans\", a work even more arduous. The duty is to preserve or ac quire, to defend or attack, and at the front of the battle there is that mobile force of the \"Society of Jesus\"—the Jesuits. Properly speaking, this society is not secular, nor regular in terms of its Constitution, but a kind of subtle company intervening where and when it is convenient, in the church and outside the church, in short \"the agent most skilful, most persevering, most fear less, most convinced of the papal authority...\", as wrote one of its best historians.(2) We will see how this body of \"jani ssaries\" was formed, what service without price it rendered the papacy. We will see also how so much effectual zeal was to make it indispensable to the institution it served, exerting such an influence over it that its General was named with good reason the \"black pope\", as it became more and more difficult to distinguish, in the government of the church, the authority of the white pope and that of its powerful coadjutor. It is then at the same time a retrosp ective and a bringing up to date of the history of \"Jesuitism\" which is found in this book. As the majority of works regarding the Jesuits do not refer to the paramount part they took in the events which have subverted the worl d during the past fifty years, we thought it was time to fill up the gap or, more precisely, to start with our modest contribution a deeper study into the subject, and do this without concealing the obstacles which will be met by the non-apologist authors wanting to make public writings on this burning subject. Of all the factors which have played a part in the international life of a century full of confusion and upheavals, one of the most decisive— nevertheless best recognized—resid es in the ambition of the Roman Church. Her secular desire to extend he r influence towards the East made her the \"spiritual\" ally of Pan-Germanism and its accomplice in the attempt to gain supreme power which twice, in 1914 a nd 1939, brought death and ruin to the peoples of Europe.(2a) (2) A.

Duca \"L'Or du Vatican\" (Laffront, Paris)."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"FOREWORD   9 The public is practically unaware of the overwhelming responsibility carried by the Vatican and its Jesuits in the start of the two world wars—a situation which may be explained in part by the gigantic finances at the disposition of the Vatican and its Jesu its, giving them power in so many spheres, especially since the last conflict. In fact, the part they took in th ose tragic events has hardly been mentioned until the present time, except by apologists eager to disguise it. It is with the aim of rectifying this and establishing the true facts that we present in this and other books the political activity of the Vatican during the contemporary epoch—activity which mutually concerns the Jesuits. This study is based on irrefutable ar chive documents, publications from well-known political personalities, diplomats, ambassadors and eminent writers, most of whom are Catholics, even attested by the imprimatur. These documents bring to light the secret actions of the Vatican and its perfidious actions in creating conflicts between nations when it served its interests. With the help of conclusive articles, we show the part played by the \"church\" in the rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe. These testimonies and documents constitute a crushing indictment and, so far, no apologist has tried to disprove them. On the first of May 1938, the \"Mercure de France\" reminded us of what had been said four years earlier: \"The Mercure de France of the 15th of January 1934 said—and nobody contradicted it—that it was Pius XII w ho 'made' Hitler. He came to power, not so much through legal means, but because the pope influenced the Centrum (german catholic party)... Does the Vatican think it made a political error in opening the way to power to Hitler? It doesn't seem so...\" It didn't seem so when that was written, which was on the day following the \"Anschluss' when Austria was uni ted to the third Reich—nor later when Nazi aggressions multiplied—nor during the whole of the Second World War. In fact, on the 24th of July 1959 the successor of Pius XII, John XXIII, conferred on his pe rsonal friend Franz Von Papen the honorary title of secret chamberlain. This man had been a spy in the United States during the first world war a nd one of those responsible for the Hitler's dictatorship and the Anschluss. One must suffer from a peculiar kind of blindness not to see such plain facts. Mr. Joseph Rovan, Catholic writer, comments on the diplomatic agreement between the Vatican and the na zi Reich on the 8th of July 1933: \"The Concordat brought to the national-socialist government, considered nearly everywhere to be made up of usurpers, if not brigands, the seal of an agreement with the old est international power (the Vatican). In a way, it was the equivalent of a di ploma of international honorability\". (Le catholicisme politique en Allemagne, Paris 1956, p.231, Ed. du Seuil). Thus the Pope, not satisfied with giving his \"personal\" support to Hitler,"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"10 THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE JESUITS granted in this way the moral support of the Vatican to the nazi Reich! At the same time as the terror was beginn ing to reign on the other side of the Rhine and was tacitly accepted and appr oved, the so-called \"Brown shirts\" had already put 40,000 persons into concentration camps. The pogroms were multiplying to the accents of this nazi march: \"When the Jewish blood streams from the knife, we feel better again.\" (Horst-Wessel-Lied). In the following years, Pius XII saw even worse without being stirred. It is not surprising that the catholic heads of Germany vied with each other in their servility towards the nazi regime, encouraged as they were by their Roman \"Master\". One must read the disheve lled ravings and verbal acrobatics of opportunist theologians such as Mich ael Schmaus. He was later made a \"prince of the church\" by Pius XII, and described as \"the great theologian of Munich\" by the publication \"La Croix\" on the 2nd of September 1954— or again a certain book entitled Katholisch-Konservatives Erbgut, of which someone wrote: \"This anthology brings together texts from the main Catholic theorists of Germany, from Gorres to Vogelsang; it makes us believe that national- socialism was born purely and simply out of Catholic ideas.\" (Gunther Buxbaum, \"Mercure de France\", 15th of January 1939). The bishops, made to take an oath of allegiance to Hitler by the Concordat, always tried to excel each other in their \"devotion\": \"Under the nazi regime, we constantly find the fervent support of the bishops in all the correspondence and declarations from ecclesiastical dignitaries\". (Joseph Rovan, op.cit. p.214). In spite of the obvious difference between Catholic universalism and hitlerian racism, these two doctrines had been \"harmoniously reconciled)), according to Franz Von Papen; the r eason for this scandalous accord was because \"Nazism is a Christian reaction against the spirit of 1789\". Let us come back to Michael Schmaus, professor at the Faculty of Theology in Munich, who wrote: \"Empire and church is a series of writings which should help the building up of the third Reich as it unites a national-socialist State to Catholic- christianity... \"Entirely German and entirely Cat holic, these writings explore and favour relations and meeti ngs between the Catholic Church and national- socialism; they open the way for a fruitful cooperation, as outlined in the Concordat... \"The national-socialist movement is the most vigorous and massive protest against the spirit of the 19th and 20th centuries... The idea of a people of one blood is the focal point of its teachings a nd all Catholics who obey the instructions of the German bishops will have to admit that this is so... The laws of national-socialism and t hose of the Catholic Church have the same aim...\" (Begegnungen zwisch en Katholischem Christentum"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"FOREWORD   11 und nazional-sozialistis cher Weltanschauung Aschendorff, Munster 1933). This document proves the primordial part played by the Catholic Church in the rise to power of Hitler; in fact, it was a pre-established arrangement. It illustrates fully th e kind of monstrous agreement between Catholicism and nazism. The hatred of liberalism, which is the key to everything, comes out very clearly. In his book \"Catholiques d'Allemagne\" , Mr Robert d'Harcourt of the French Academy writes: \"The most vulnerable point, in all the episcopal declarations which followed the triumphant elections of the 5th of March 1933, is found in the first official document from the church containing the signatures of all the German bishops. We are referring to the pastoral letter of the 3rd of June 1933, in which the whole of the German episcopa te is involved. \"What form does this document take?\" How does it start? On a note of optimism and with this cheerful declaration: 'The men at the head of this new government have, to our great joy, gi ven us the assurance that they pl ace themselves and their work on Christian ground. A declaration of such deep sincerity deserves the gratit ude of all Catholics'. \" (P aris, Plon, 1938, p. 108). Since the start of the first world war, several popes have come and gone, but their attitude has been invariably th e same towards the two factions which confronted each other in Europe. Many Catholic authors couldn't hi de their surprise—and grief—when writing about the inhuman indifference shown by Pius XII in the face of the worst kind of atrocities committed by those in his favour. Amongst many testimonies, we will quote one of the most moderate in its wording, brought against the Vatican by Mr. Jean d'Hospital, correspondant of \"Monde\": \"The memory of Pius XII is surrounded with misgiving. First of all, there is this burning question asked by observers from every nation, and even within the walls of the Vatican: Did he know of certain atrocities committed during this war, started and led by Hitler? \"Having at his disposition at all times, and from every quarter, the regular reports from the bishops... could he ignore what the german military heads could never pretend to: the tragedy of the concentration camps—the civilians condemned to deportation—the cold-blooded massacres of those who 'stood in the way'—the terror of the gas chambers where, for administrative reasons, millions of Jews were exterminated? And if he knew about it why didn't he, as trustee and first chorister of the Gospel, come out dressed in white, arms extende d in the shape of the cross, to denounce a crime without precedent, to shout: No!?... \"Pious souls will search in vain encyclical letters, speeches and addresses"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"12 THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE JESUITS of the late pope; there is no trace of any condemnation of this 'religion of blood' instituted by Hitler, this Antichrist... they will not find the condemnation of racism, which is an ob vious contradiction to the Catholic dogma\". \"Rome en confidence\" (Grasset, Paris 1962, pp.91 ss). In his book \"Le silence de Pie XII\" published by du Rocher, Monaco 1965, the author Carlo Falconi writes in particular: \"The existence of such monstrosities (exterminations en masse of ethnic minorities, prisoners and deported civilians) overthrows every standard of good and evil. They defy the dignity of their individual being and society in general to such an extent that we are compelled to denounce those who could have influenced public opinion, be they ordinary civilians or Heads of States. \"To keep quiet in the face of such outrages would amount in fact to downright collaboration. It would stim ulate the villainy of the criminals, stirring up their cruelty and vanity. But, if every man has the moral duty to react when confronted with such crim es, it is doubly so of the religious societies and their heads, and above all the head of the Catholic Church. \"Pius XII never expressed a direct and explicit condemnation of the war of aggression, even less about the unspeakable crimes commited by the Germans or their accomplices during that war. \"Pius XII did not keep quiet becau se he did not know what was happening: he knew of the gravity of the situation from the start, maybe even better than any other head of state in the world...\" (pp.12 ss). There is better still! The Vatican gave a helping hand to the carrying out of these crimes by \"lending\" some of its prelates to be made into pro-nazi agents; these were Messeigneurs Hlinka a nd Tiso. It also sent to Croatia its own legate—R.P. Marcone—who, with the help of Monseigneur Stepinac, had to keep an eye on the \"work\" of Ante Pavelitch and his oustachis. Wherever we look, the same \"edify ing\" spectacle presents itself. As we have already shown, it is not only this monstrous partiality and complacency that we object to. The Vatican's unpardonable crime lies in the decisive part played in the bringing about of two world wars.(3) Listen to what Mr. Alfred Grosser, professor at the Institute of political studies of Paris University, says: \"The very concise book of Guenter Lewy \"The Catholic Church and nazi Germany\" (New York McGrawhill-1964) say s that all the documents agree to show the Catholic Church coope rating with the Hitler regime... \"In July 1933, when the Concordat forced the bishops to swear an oath of allegiance to the nazi government, th e concentration camps were already open... the reading of quotations comp iled by Guenter Lewy proves this overwhelmingly. We find in them some crushing evidence from (3) E. Paris, \"The Vatican against Europe\" (P.T.S. London)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"FOREWORD   13 personalities such as Cardinal Faulhaber and the Jesuit Gustav Gundlach.\"(4) Only empty words can be found to oppose this st ack of evidence which proves the culpability of the Vatican and its Jesuits. Their help was the main force behind the lightning rise of H itler who, together with Mussolini and Franco, who in spite of appearances were but war pawns manipulated by the Vatican and its Jesuits. The thurifers of the Vatican must bow their heads in shame when an Italian member of parliament cries ou t: \"The pope's hands are dripping with blood\". (Speech by Laura Diaz, member of parliament for Livourne, delivered at Ortona on the 15th of April 1946), or when the students of Cardiff University College choose as th e theme for a conference: \"Should the pope be brought to trial as a war cr iminal?\" (\"La Croix\", 2nd of April 1946). * * * Here is how pope John XXIII expresse d himself when referring to the Jesuits: \"Persevere, dear sons, in the ac tivities which have already brought you well-known merits..

He was one of the strangest types of monk-soldier ever engendered by the Catholic world; of all the founders of religious orders, he may be the one whose personality has left the strongest mark on the mind and behaviour of his disciples and successors. This may be the reason for that \"familiar look\" or \"trade-mark\", a fact which go es as far as physical resemblance. Mr. Folliet disputes this fact (1), but many documents prove the permanence of a \"Jesuit\" type through the ages. The most amusing of these testimonies is found at the Guimet museum; on the golden backgr ound of a 16th century screen, a Japanese artist portrayed, with all the humour of his race, the landing of the Portuguese, and of the sons of Loyola in particular, on the Nipponese islands. The amazem ent of this lover of nature and bright colours is obvious in the way he depicted those long, black shadows with their mournful faces on which is congealed all the arrogance of the fanatic ruler. The likeness between the work of the oriental artist of the 16th century and our Daumier of 1830 is there for all to see. Like many other saints, Inigo—wh o later Romanised his name and became Ignatius—looked far from being the one predestined to enlighten his contemporaries (2). His stormy youth was filled with mistakes and even \"heinous crimes\". A police report said he was \"treacherous, brutal, vindictive\". All his biographers admit that he yi elded to none of his boon companions regarding the violence of the instincts, then a common thing. \"An unruly and conceited soldier\", said one of his confidants—\"he led a disorderly life as far as women, gambling and duels were concerned\", (1) \"La Croix\", 31 st of July 1956. (2) Like Saint Augustine, Saint Francis of Assisi and many others."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"16 THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE JESUITS added his secretary Polanco (3). All th is is related to us by one of his spiritual sons, R.P. Rouquette, who tried somewhat to explain and excuse this hot temper which was eventually turned \"ad majorem Dei gloriam\". (To the greater glory of God). As is the case for many heroes of the Roman Catholic Church, a violent physical blow was necessary to change his personality. He had been pageboy to the treasurer of Castille until his master's disgrace. Then he became a gentleman in the service of the Viceroy of Navarre; having lived the life of a courtier until then, the young man started the life of a soldier by defending Pampeluna against the French commanded by the Count de Foix. The wound which decided his future life was inflicted during that siege. A leg broken by a bullet, he was taken by the victorious French to his brother Martin Garcia, at the castle of Loyola. Now starts the martyrdom of surgery without an aesthesia, through which he had to go a second time as the work had not been done properly. His leg was broken again and r eset. In spite of all this, Ignatius was left with a limp. One can understand that he only needed an experience such as this to cause him a nervous breakdown. The \"gift of tears\" which was then bestowed on him \"in abundance\"—and in which his pious biographers see a favour from on high—is maybe only the result of his highly emotional nature, henceforth to affect him more and more. His sole entertainment, while lying w ounded and in pain, was the reading of the \"Life of Christ\" and the \"Life of the Saints\", the only books found in the castle. As he was practically uneducated and still affected by that terrible shock, the anguish of Christ's passion and the martyrdom of the saints had an indelible impact on him; this obsession led the crippled warrior on to the road of apostolate. \"He put the books to one side and day-dreamed. A clear case of the wakeful dream, this was a continuation into the adult years of the imaginary game of the child... if we let it invade the psychic realm, the result is neurosis and surrender of the will; that which is real takes second place!...\"(4) At first sight, this diagnosis seems hardly to apply to the founder of such an active order, nor to other \"great mystic s\" and creators of religious societies, all of whom had apparently great capac ities for organization. But we find that all of them are unable to resist their over-active imaginations and, for them, the impossible becomes possible. Here is what the same author says on th is subject: \"I want to point out the (3) R.P. Jesuit Robert Rouquette, \"Saint Ignace de Loyola\" (Ed. Albin Michel, Paris 1944, p.6). (4) R.P. Jesuit Robert R ouquette, op.cit., p.9."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"IGNATIUS OF LOYOLA 17 obvious outcome of the practice of mysticism by someone possessing a brilliant intelligence. The weak mind i ndulging in mysticism is on dangerous ground, but the intelligent myst ic presents a far greater danger, us his intellect works in a wider and deep er way... When the myth takes over from the reality in an active intelligence, it becomes mere fanaticism; an infection of the will which suffers from a partial enlargement or distortion\".(5) Ignatius of Loyola was a first-class ex ample of that \"active mysticism\" and \"distortion of the will\". Nevertheless , the transformation of the gentlemen- warrior into the \"general\" of the most militant order in the Roman Church was very slow; there were many faltering steps before he found his true vocation. It is not our intention to follow him through all those different stages. Let us recall the main points: in the spring of 1522, he left the ancestral castle, with his mind made up to become a saint similar to those whose edifying exploits he had been reading about in that big \"gothic\" volume. Besides, did not the Madona herself appear to him one night, holding in her arms the child Jesus? After a thorough confession at the monastry of Montserrat, he was planning to go to Jerusalem. The plague was rife in Barcelona and, as all maritime traffic had stopped, he had to stay at Manresa for nearly a year. There, he spent his time in prayers, orisons, long fasts, flagellating himself, practicing all the forms of maceration, and never failing to appear before the \"tribunal for penance\", even though his confession at Montserrat had apparently lasted three whole days; such a thorough confession would have been sufficient to a less scr upulous sinner. All this depicts quite clearly the mental and nervous state of the man. At last delivered from that obsession of sin by d eciding it was only a trick of Satan, he devoted himself entirely to the varied and plentiful visions which were haunting his feverish mind. \"It is because of a vision\", says H. Boehmer, \"that he started eating meat again; it is a whole series of visions that revealed to him the mysteries of the Catholic dogma and helped him to trul y live it: in that way, he meditates upon the Trinity under the shape of a musical instrume nt with three cords; the mystery of the creation of the world through \"something\" hazy and light coming out of a ray of sunshine; the miraculous descent of Christ into the Eucharist as flashes of light entering the consecrated water, when the priest held it up while praying; the human na ture of Christ and the holy Virgin under the form of a dazzlin g white body; and fi nally Satan as a serpentine and shimmering shape similar to a multitude of sparkling and mysterious eyes (6).\" Is not this the start of the well-known Jesuitic image-making?

There was only a hazy recollection left, a feeling of something miraculous as if, at that moment, he had become \"another man with another intelligence\".(7) All this may be the result of a nervious disorder and can be identified with what happens to smokers of opium and eaters of hashish: that enlargement or extension of the ego, that illusion of soaring up beyond what is real, a flashing sensation leaving only a dazed recollection. Blissful visions and illuminations were constant companions of this mystic throughout his life. \"He never doubted the reality of these revelations. He chased Satan with a stick as he would have done a mad dog; he talked to the Holy Spirit as one does to another person actually; he asked for the approval of God, the Trinity and the Madonna on all his projec ts and would burst into tears of joy when they appeared to him. On those occasions, he had a foretaste of celestial bliss; the heavens were open to him, and the Godhead was visible and perceptible to him.(8) Is not this the perfect case of an hall ucinated person? It will be this same perceptible and visible Godhead that the spiritual sons of Loyola will constantly offer to the world—not only for political reasons, leaning on and flattering the deep-rooted inclination in the heart of man for idolatry— but also by conviction, having been well and truly indoctrinated. From the start, mediaeval mysticism has prevailed in the Society of Jesus; it is still the great animator, in spite of its readily assumed worldly, intellectual and learned aspects. Its basic axiom is: \"All things to all men\". The arts, literature, science and even philosophy have been mere means or nets to catch souls, like the easy indulgences granted by its casuists and for which laxity they were so often reproved. To this Order, there is not a realm where human weakness cannot be worked upon, to incite the spirit and will to surrender and go back to a more childish and restful devotion. So they work for the bringing about of the \"kingdom of God\" according to their own ideal: a great flock under the Holy Father's crozier. That learned men could have such an anachronic ideal seems very strange, yet it is undeniably so and the confirmation of an oft-disregarded fact: the pre-emin ence of the emotions in the life of the spirit.

In the first place, every Jesuit chose th is particular Order because of his natural dispositions; but he really becomes a \"son\" of Loyola after rigorous tests and systematic training lasting no less than fourteen years.

He arrived in Jerusalem on the 1st of September, after many adventures, only to leave again soon after, on the orders of the Franciscan's provincial who was not desirious to see the precarious peace between Christians and Turks endangered by an untimely proselytism. The disappointed missionary passed through Venice, Genoa, and Barcelona on his way to the University of Alcala where he started theological studies; it is there also that his \"cure of souls\" amongst voluntary listeners began. \"In these conventicles, the most common manifestations of piety amongst the fair sex were fainting fits ; by that, we realise how hard he applied his religious methods, and ho w such a fervent propaganda would soon arouse the curiosity and then th e suspicion of the inquisitors... \"In April 1527, the Inquisition put Ignatius in prison to try him on the grounds of heresy.

Becoming more prudent, he met withjust six of hi s college friends, two of which will become highly esteemed recruits: Salmeron and Lainez. What did he have in himself that so powerfully attracted young people to an old student? It was his ideal and a little charm he carried on himself: a small book, in fact a very minute book which is, in spite of its smallness, amongst those which have influenced the fate of humanity. This volume has been printed so many times that the number of copies is unknown; it was also the object of more than 400 commentaries. It is the textbook of the Jesuits and at the same time the resume of the long inner development of their master: the \"Spiritual Exercises\".(11) Mr Boehmer says later: \"Ignatius understood more clearly than any other leader of men who preceded him that the best way to raise a man to a certain ideal is to become master of his imagination. We \"imbue into him spiritual forces which he would find very difficult to eliminate later\" , forces more lasting than all the best principles and doctrines; these forces can come up again to the surface, sometimes after years of not even mentioning them, and become so imperative that the will finds itself unab le to oppose any obstacle, and has to follow their irresistible impulse\".(12) Thus all the \"truths\" of the Catholic dogma will have to be, not only meditated, but lived and felt by the one who devotes himself to these \"Exercises\", with the help of a \"director\". In other words, he will have to see and relive the mystery with the greatest possible intensity. The candidate's sensitiveness becomes impregnated with th ese forces whose persistence in his memory, and even more so in his subconscious, will be as strong as the effort he made to evoke and assimilate them. Be side sight, the other senses such as hearing, smell, taste and touch will play their part. In short, it is mere controlled auto-suggestion. The angels ' rebellion, Adam and Eve driven out of Paradise, God's tribunal, the evangelical scenes and phases of the Passion are, as one would say, relived in fron t of the candidate. Sweet and blissful scenes alternate with the most sombre ones at a skilfully arranged rythm. No need to say that Hell has the prominent part in that \"magic lantern show\", with its lake of fire into which the damned are thrown, the awful concert of screams, the atrocious strench of sulphur and burning flesh. Yet Christ is always there to sustain the visionary who doesn't know how to thank him for not having thrown him already into hell to pay for his past sins.

In case you do not believe me, I will quote: \"The third way of praying, by measuring the words and pe riods of silence\". This particular manner of praying consists of leaving out some words between every breath; and a little further: \"Make sure to keep equal gaps between every breath and choking sob and word\". (Et paria anhelituum ac vocum interstitia observet), which means that the man, being inspired or not, becomes just a machine which must sigh, sob, groan, cry, shout or catch one's breath at the exact moment and in the order which experience shows to be the most profitable\". (12a) It is understandable that after four weeks devoted to these intensive Exercises, with a director as his only companion, the candidate would be ripe for the subsequent training and breaking. This is what Quinet has to say when referring to the creator of such an hallucinatory method: \"Do you know what distinguishes hi m from all the ascetics of the past? The fact that he could obser ve and analyse himself logi cally and coldly in that state of rapture, while for all the ot hers even the idea of reflection was impossible. Imposing on his disciples actions which, to him, were spontaneous, he needed just thirty days to break, with this method, the will and reasoning, in the manner in which a rider breaks his horse. He only needed thirty days \"triginta dies\", to subdue a soul. Note that Jesuitism expanded together with modern inquisition: while the inquisitio n dislocated the body, the spiritual Exercises broke up the thoughts under Loyola's machine\".(12b) In any case, one could not examine his \"spiritual\" life too deeply, even without the honour of being a Jesuit; Loyola's methods are to be recommended to the faithful and ecclesi astics in particular, as we are reminded by commentators such as R.P. Pinard de la Boullaye, author of \"Mental prayer for all\"; inspired by saint Ignatius, this very valuable aid for the soul would, we think, be mo re explicit if the title read \"alienation\" instead of \"prayer\".

Ignatius was then forty-four years old. After communion, the animator and his companions vowed to go to the Holy Land, as soon as their studies were finished, to convert the infidels. But the following year found them in Rome where the pope, who was then organising a crusade against the lurks with the German Emperor and the Republic of Venice, showed them how impossible their project was because of it. So Ignatius and his companions dedicated themselves to missionary work in Christian lands; in Venice, his apostolate roused again the suspicions of the Inquisition. The Constitution of the Company of Jesus was at last drafted and approved in Rome, by Paul III, in 1540, and the Jesuits put themselv es at the disposition of the pope, promising him unconditional obedience, Teaching, confession, preaching and charitable work were the field of action for this new Order, but foreign missions were not excluded as, in 1541, Francis Xavier and two companions left Lisbon to go and evangelise the Far East. In 1546, the political side of their career was launched, when the pope chose Lainez and Salmeron to represent him at the Council of Trent in the capacity of \"pontifical theologians\". Mr Boehmer writes: \"Then, the Order was employed by the pope only on a temporary basis. But it performed its functions with so much promptitude and zeal that, already under Paul III, it had implanted itself very firmly into all chosen kinds of activities and won the confidence of the Curia for all time\".(12d) This confidence was fully justified; the Jesuits, and Lainez in particular, together with their devoted friend Ca rdinal Morone, became the cunning and untiring champions of pontifical authority and intangibility of the ( l 2 d ) H.

By their clever manoeuvres and dialectics, they succeeded in defeating the opposition and all \"heretic\" claims including marriage of priests, communion with the two elements, use of the vernacular in services and, especially, reform of the papacy. Only the reform of convents was retained on the agenda. Lainez himself, by a fo rceful counter-attack, upheld pontifical infallibility which was promulgated three centuries later by the Vatican Council. (13) The Holy See emerged st rengthened from the crisis where it nearly foundered, thanks to the steadfa st actions of the Jesuits. The terms chosen by Paul III to describe this new Order in his Bull of Authorisation were then amply justified: \"Regimen Ecclesiae militantis\". The fighting spirit developed more and more as time went on as, beside foreign missions, the activities of Loyola's sons started to concentrate on the souls of men, especially amongst ruling classes. Politics are their main field of action, as all the efforts of these \"directors\" concentrate on one aim: the submission of the world to the papacy, and to attain this the \"heads\" must be conquered first. And to realise this ideal? Two very important weapons: to be the confessors of the mighty and those in high places and the education of their children. In that way, the present will be safe while the future is prepared. The Holy See soon realised the strength this new Order would bring. At first, the number of its members had been limite d to sixty, but this restriction was promptly lifted. When Ignatius died, in 1556, his sons were working amongst pagans in India, China, Japan, the New World, but also and especially in Europe: France, Southern and Western Germany, where they fought against the \"heresy\", in Spain, Portugal, Italy and even England, getting in by way of Ireland.

On the other hand, if these princes rebelled, they found in the Jesuits their worst enemies. In Europe, wherever Rome's interests re quired the people to rise against their king, or if these temporal princes had taken decisions embarrassing for the Church, the Curia knew she would not find more able, cunning, or daring outside the Society of Jesus when it came to intrigue, propaganda or even open rebellion\".(14) We have seen, through the spirit of the \"Exercises\", how the founder of this Company was behind his time in his simplistic mysticism, ecclesiastic discipline and, generally speaking, his conception of subordination.

Rouquette writes boldly: \"Far from being a diminution of man, this intelligent and willing obedience is th e height of freedom... a liberation from oneself s bondage...\"; one only has to read those texts to perceive the extreme, if not monstrous character of this submission of soul and spirit imposed to the Jesuits, making them always docile in struments in their superiors' hands, and even more from their very beginning the natural ennemies of any kind of liberty. The famous \"perinde ac cadaver\" (as a co rpse in the undertaker's hands), can be found in all \"spiritual literature\", according to Mr. Folliet, and even in the East, in the Haschichins' Constitution; th e Jesuits are to be in the hands of their superiors \"as a staff obeying every impulse; as a ball of wax which can be shaped and stretched in any direction; as a small crucifix being lifted and moved at will\"; these pleasant formulas are none the less very enlightening. Remarks and explanations from the crea tor of this Order leave us without any doubt as to their true meaning. Besides, amongst the Jesuits, not only the will, but also reasoning and even moral scruple, must be sacrificed to the primordial virtue of obedience which is, according to Borgia, \"the strongest rampart of Society\". \"Let us be convinced that all is well and right when the superior commands it\", wrote Loyola. And again: \"Even if God gave you an animal without sense for master, you will not he sitate to obey him, as master and guide, because God ordained it to be so.\" And something even better: the Jesuit must see in his superior not a fallible man, but Christ Himself. J. Hu ber, professor of Catholic theology in Munich and author of one of the most important works on the Jesuits, wrote: \"Here is a proven fact: the \"Constitutions\" repeat five hundred times that one must see Christ in the person of the General\".(15) The discipline of the Order, assimilated so often to that of the army, is then nothing compared to the reality. \"Military obedience is not the equivalent of Jesuitic obedience; the latter is more exte nsive as it gets hold of the whole man and is not satisfied like the other, with an exterior act, but requires the sacrifice of the will and laying aside of one's own judgment\".(16) Ignatius himself wrote in his letter to the Portuguese Jesuits: \"We must see black as white, if the Church says so\".

It is not difficult to imagine what could be the results of such an education\".(17) The Order's life of ups and downs—there is not one country from which it wasn't expelled—testifies that thes e dangers were recognised by all governments, even the most Catholic. By introducing men so blindly devoted to their cause to teac hing among the higher classes, the Company—champion of universalism, therefore ultra-montanism—was inevitably recognised as a th reat to civil authority, as the activity of the Order, by the mere fact of their vocation, turned more and more towards politics. In a parallel way, what we call the Jesuitic spirit was developing amongst its members. Nevertheless, the founder, inspired mainly by the needs of foreign and home \"missions\", had not ne glected skilfulness. He wrote in his \"Sententiae asceticae\": \"A clever car efulness together with a mediocre purity is better than a greater holiness coupled with a less perfect skilfulness. A good shepherd of souls must know how to ignore many things and pretend not to understand them. Once he is master of the wills, he will be able wisely to lead his students wherever he may choose. People are entirely absorbed by passing interest s, so we must not speak to them too pointedly about their souls: it would be throwing the hook without the bait\". Even the desired countenance of Loyola's sons was emphatically stated: \"They must hold their heads slightly down, without bending it to the left or r i g h t ; they must not look up, and when they speak to someone, they are not to look them straight in the eyes so as to see them only indirectly...\"(18) Loyola's successors retained this lesson well in their memory, and applied it very extensively in the pursuit of their plans.

An admonitor procurator and assistants, residing in Rome too, will help him generally to administer the Order divided then into five congregations: Italy, Germany France, Spain, England and Am erica. These congregations were themselves divided into Provinces grouping the different establishments of the Order. Only the admonitor (or overseer) and assistants are nominated by the Congregation.

To this militia so tightly knit in th e hand of its chief and which needs the greatest autonomy to make its actions effective, the pope concedes privileges which may seem exorbita nt to other religious Orders. By their Constitutions, the Jesuits were exempt from the cloistered rule which applied to monastic life in general. In fact, they are monks living \"in the world\" and, outwardly, nothing distinguishes them from the secular clergy. But, contrary to this and othe r religious congregations, they are not subjected to the bishop's authority.

He also absolves the irregularity is suing, from bigamy, injuries done to others, murder, assassination... as l ong as these wicked deeds were not publicly known and the cause of a scandal\".(19) Finally, Gregory XIII bestowed on the Company the right to deal in commerce and banking, a right it made use of extensively later on. These dispensations and unprecedented po wers were fully guaranteed to them. \"The popes called even upon princes and kings to defend these privileges; they threatened with the great ex communication \"latae sententiae\" all those who would try to infringe them. In 1574, a bull of Pius V gave the general the right to restore these privil eges to their original scope, against all tempts to alter or curtail them, even if such curtailments were authoritatively documented by papal revocation... By granting the Jesuits such exorbitant privileges which run counter to the Church's antiquated constituti on, the papacy wanted, not only to supp l y them with powerful weapons to fight the \"Infidels\", but especially use them as a bodyguard to defend her own unrestricted power in the Church and against the Church\". \"To preserve the spiritual and temporal supremacy they usurped during the mi ddle ages, the popes sold the Church t o t h e Order of Jesus and, in consequence, surrendered themselves into their hands...

But, with much craftiness, the Order eventually defeated this resistance. \"During the 17th century, they are all-powerful in Spain, among the high classes and at Court. Even Father Neidhart, former German cavalry officer, fully governed the kingdom as Counsellor of State, prime minister and Grand Inquisitor... In Spain as in Portugal, the kingdom's ruin coincided with the rise of the Order...\"(8) This is what Edgar Quinet had to say about it: \"Wherever a dynasty dies, I can see, rising up and standing behind her, a kind of bad genie, one of those dark fi gures that are the confessors, gently and paternally luring her towards death...\"(9) Indeed, one cannot impute Spain's decadence to this Order only. \"Nevertheless, it is true that the Company of Jesus, together with the Church and other religious orders, hast ened her fall; the richer the Order became, the poorer Spain wa s, so much so that wh en Charles II died, the State's coffers did not even contain the necessary amount to pay for 10,000 masses usually said for the salvati on of a deceased monarch's soul.\"(10) (7) and (8) H.

In fact, even in Austria and Bohemia, the break with Rome was so general that the Protestants could reasonably hope to conquer Austria within a few decades. Then how is it this change did not take place and the c ountry was divided into two sections instead?

Loyola's emissaries won the country's he art and mind from the start... From the next generation on, Ingolstadt became th e perfect type of the german Jesuit city\".(14) One can judge the state of mind the Fathers introduced to this stronghold of faith by reading the following: \"The Jesuit Mayrhofer of Ingolstadt taught in his \"Preacher's mirror\": \"We will not be judged if we demand the killing of Protestants, any more than we would by asking for the death penalty on thieves, murderers, counterfeiters and revolutionaries.\"(15) The successors of Albert V, and especially Maximilian I (1597-1651), completed his work. But Albert V already was conscientious in his \"duty\" of assuring his subjects' \"salvation\". \"As soon as the Fathers arrived in Bavaria, his attitude towards Protestants and those favourable to them became more severe. From 1563 on, he pitilessly expelled all recalcitrants, and had no mercy for the anabaptists who had to suffer drownings, fire, prison and chains, all of which were praised by the Jesuit Agricola... In spite of all this, a whole generation of men had to disappear before the persecution was crowned a complete su ccess. As late as 1586, the moravian anabaptists managed to hide 600 victims from the duke Guillaume. This one example proves that there were thousands and not hundreds who were driven out, an awful breach into a thinly populated country. \"But\", said Albert V to the Munich City council, \"God's honour and the salvation of souls must be placed above any temporal interests\". 16) Little by little, all teaching in Bavaria wa s placed in the Jesuits' hands, and that land became the base for their penetra tion in eastern, western and northern Germany. \"From 1585 on, the Fathers converted the part of Westphalia depending on Cologne; in 1586, they appear in Neuss and Bonn, one of Cologne's archbishop's residences; they open colleges at Hildesheim in 1587 and Munster in 1588.

Under her influence, Charles worked hard to \"extirpate the heresy\" from his kingdom and when he died, in 1590, he made his son and successor, Ferdinand, swear that he would go on with this work. In any case, Ferdinand was well prepared for this. \"For five years, he had been a pupil of the Jesuits at Ingol stadt; besides, he was so narrow-minded that, to him, there was no nobler task than the reestablishment of the Catholic Church in his hereditary States.

Of all the St ates, Poland, who had millions of orthodox Christians in her midst, shoul d have had religious tolerance as one of the most essential principles of her interior politics.

Without thinking it over first, the Jesuits took it into their hands to in troduce Ostrepjew to the Palatine of Sandomir who gave him his daughter in marriage; they spoke on his behalf to King Sigismond III and the pope regarding his expectations, and succeeded in making the Polish army rise against the Czar Boris Godounov. As a reward for these services, the false Dimitri ren ounced the religion of his fathers at Crascovie, one of the Jesuits' houses, and promised the Order an establishment in Moscow, near the Kremlin, after his victory over Boris. \"But it was these favours from the cat holics which unleashed the hatred of the Russian Orthodox Church against Dimitri.

In 1574, Father Nicolai and other Jesuits were brought to the recently established school of theology where they became fervent Roman proselytizers, while officially assuming Lutheranism. Then , the clever negotiator Possevino secured the conversion of Jean III and the care of educating his son Sigismond, the future Sigismond III, king of Poland.

His Majesty had no intention of renouncing his amorous affairs, and his confessor was careful to keep off the subject, in spite of it being plain adultery. So, all the royal family w as soon provided with Jesuit confessors only, and their influence grew more and more amongst the high society. The priests of Paris attacked in their \"Writings\" the loose morals of the famous Company's casuists, but to no avail. Pascal himself intervened, in vain, in favour of the Jansenists, during the great theological quarrel of that time; in his \"Provincial letters\", he exposed their too worldly opponents, the Jesuits, to eternal ridicule. In spite of it, the secure place they held at Court assured them of victory, and those of Port-Royal succumbed. The Or der was to win another great victory for Rome, whose consequences were against national interests. It goes without saying that they had only unwillingly accepted the religious peace assured through the Edict of Nantes, and had continued a secret war against the French Protestants. As Louis XIV was getting older, he turned more and more to bigotry under the influence of Madame de Maintenon and Father La Chaise, his confessor. In 1681, they persuaded him to restart the persecution against the Protestants. Finally, on the 17th of October 1685, he signed the \"Revocation of the Edict of Nantes\", making those of his subjects who refused to embrace the Catholic religio n outlaws. Soon after, to accelerate the conversions, those famous \"drago nnade\" started; that sinister name became part of all subsequent attempts to proselytize by fire and chains. While the fanatics cheered, the Protestants fled from the kingdom en-masse. According to Marshal Vauban, France lost in that way 400,000 inhabitants and 60 million francs. Manufacturers , merchants, shipowners, skilful artisans went to other countries a nd brought them the benefit of their abilities. \"17th of October 1685 was a day of victory for the Jesuits, the final (40) H.

Even though the necessity to combat Protestantism in Europe involved its disciples more and more, and this political as well as religious action, of which we just ga ve a short summary, became their main task, they still pursued the evangelisation of distant lands. Their theocratic ideal: to bring the world under the Holy See's authority, required that they should go into all the regions of the globe, in the conquest of souls. Francis Xavier, one of Ignatius' first companions who, like him, was canonised by the Church, was the great pr omoter of Asia's evangelisation. In 1542, he disembarked at Goa and found there a bishop, a cathedral and a convent of Franciscans who, together with some Portuguese priests, had already tried to spread around them the religion of Christ. He gave that first attempt such a strong impetus that he was surnamed the \"Apostle of India\". Actually, he was more a pioneer and \"exciter\" than one who really accomplished something lasting. Fiery, enthusiastic, always on the look-out for new fields of action, he showed the way more than he cleared the ground. In the kingdom of Travancore, at Malacca, on the islands of Banda, Macassar and Ceylon, his pe rsonal charm, and his eloquent speeches did wonders and, as a result, 70,000 \"idolaters\" were converted especially amongst the low caste. To obtain this, he did not despise the political and even military support of the Portuguese. These results, more showy than solid, were bound to rouse inte rest for the missions in Europe as well as throwing a brilliant lust re over the Society of Jesus. The untiring but little persevering apos tle soon left India for Japan, then China, where he was about to enter when he died at Canton, in 1552. His successor in India, Robert de Nobile, applied in that country the same methods the Jesuits used in Eur ope very successfully. He appealed to the higher classes.

He adopted the clothes, habits and way of living of the Brahmins, mixed their rites with Christian ones, all with the approval of Pope Gregory XV. Thanks to this ambiguity, he \"conver ted\", so he claimed, 250,000 Hindus. But, \"about a century after his death, when the intransigent pope Benedict XIV forbade the observance of these Hindu rites, everthing collapsed and the 250,000 pseudo-catho lics disappeared\".(l) In the north Indian territories ofth e Great Mogol Akbar, a tolerant man who even tried to introduce into his States a religious syncretism, the Jesuits were allowed to build an establishment at Lahore in 1575. Akbar's successors granted them the same favours. But Aureng-Zeb (1666-1707), and orthodox Moslem, put an end to this enterprise. In 1549, Xavier embarked for Japan with two companions and a Japanese he had converted at Malacca called Yagiro. The beginnings were not very promising. \"The Japanese ha ve their own mortality and are rather reserved; their past has set them in paganism. The adults look at those strangers with amusement and the children follow them, jeering\".(2) Yagiro, a native, managed to star t a small community of one hundred adherents. But Francis Xavier, who did not speak Japanese very well, could not even obtain an audience from the Mikado. When he left that country, two Fathers stayed behind who eventually secured the conversion of the daimos of Arima and Bungo. Wh en this particular one so decided in 1578, he had been considering the matter for 27 years. The following year, the Fathers settled at Nagasaki. They pretended to have c onverted 100,000 Japanese. In 1587, the internal situat ion of the land, torn apart by clan wars, changed entirely. \"T he Jesuits had taken advantage of that anarchy and their close relations with Portuguese merchants.\"(3) Hideyoshi, a man of low birth, had usurped power and taken the title of Taikosama. He distrusted the Jesuits' political influence, their association with the Portuguese and their connections with the great and wild vassals, the Samourai. In consequence, the young Japanese Ch urch was violently persecuted, six Franciscans and three Jesuits were crucified; many converts were murdered and the Order was banished. Nevertheless, the decree was not carri ed out. The Jesuits continued their apostolate in secret. But, in 1614 , the first Shogun , Tokugawa Yagasu, became uneasy with their occult acti ons and the persecution started again. Besides, the Dutch had taken the pl ace of the Portuguese at the business' counters and were closely watched by the government.

For the Jesuits, the Japanese advent ure had come to an end, and was to remain so for a long time. We can read in the remarkable work of Lord Bertrand Russell \"Science and Religion\" the following racy passage ab out Francis Xavier the miracle worker: \"He and his companions wrote many long letters which were kept; in them, they gave accounts of their labours, but none of those written in his lifetime made any mention of miraculous powers. Joseph Acosta, the Jesuit who was so much troubled by Peru's animals, ex pressly denied that these missionaries had been helped by miracles in their efforts to convert the pagans. But, soon after Xavier's death, stories of miracles started to abound. It was said that he had the gift of tongues, even though his letters were full of allusions to the difficulties he had to master the Japanese language or find good interpreters. \"Stories were told of how, when his friends had felt thirsty at sea, he had changed salt water into fresh. When he dr opped his crucifix into the sea, a crab brought it back to him. According to a later version, he had thrown the crucifix into the sea to still a tempest . When he was canonised in 1622, it was proved, to the satisfaction of the Vatican authorities, that he had accomplished miracles, as no one can become a saint without them. The pope gave his official guarantee to the gift of tongues and was particularly impressed by the fact that Xavier had made the lamps burn with holy water instead of oil. \"This same pope, Urban VIII, refused to believe Galileo's statements. The legend continued to improve: a biography by Father Bonhours, published in 1682, tells us that the saint had resu scitated fourteen persons during his lifetime. \"Catholic authors still attribute to him the gift of miracles; in a biography published in 1872, Father Coleridge of the Society of Jesus restated that he had the gift of tongues\".(4) Judging by the exploits just mentioned, saint Francis Xavier well deserved his halo. In China, the sons of Loyola had a long and favourable time with only a few expulsions in-between; they obtained this on condition they woud work there mainly as scientists and bow to the thousands of years old rite of this ancient civilisation. \"Meteorology was the main subject. Francis Xa vier had already foud out that the Japanese did not know th e earth was round and were very interested in what he taught them on that and other similar subjects. \"In China, it became official and, as the Chinese were not fanatical, things developed peaceably.\" \"An Italian, Fa ther Ricci, was the initiator of it.

He sent for two Fathers who amended the traditional calendar, establishing the accord between the course of the stars and earthly events. Ricci helped with lesser tasks as well; for instance, he drew a mural map of the empire, where he carefully put China at the center of the universe...\"(5) This was the Jesuits' main work in that Celestial Empire; as for the religions side of their mission, the interest in it was minute. It is rather amusing to think that, in Peking, th e Fathers were busy rectifying the astronomical mistakes of the Chines e, while, in Rome, the Holy See persistently condemned the Cope rnican system, and that until 1822! In spite of the fact that the Ch inese had very little inclination for mysticism, the first Catholic church opened at Peking in 1599. When Ricci died, he was replaced by a German, Father Shall von Bell, an astronomer who also published some remarkable tracts in the Chinese language; in 1644, he was given the title of \"Presi dent of the mathematical Tribunal\", which created jealousy amongst the mandarins. In the meantime, the Christian communities organised themselves. In 1617, the emperor must have foreseen the dangers of this pa cific penetration when he decreed the banishment of all foreigners. The goo d Fathers were sent to the Portuguese at Macao in wooden cages. But, soon after, they were called back. They were such good astronomers! In fact, they were just as good as missionaries with 41 residences in C h i n a , 1 5 9 churches and 257,000 baptis ed members.

But I pray Him very humbly to remember, after my death, that my aim in all I did was to procure a protector for the most holy religion in the universe; and this protector was you, the greatest king in the East\".(7) However, in China as in Malabar, this religion could not survive without some artifice. The Jesuits had to brin g the Roman doctrine to the chinese level, identify God with heaven (Tien) or the Chang-Ti (Emperor from on- high), blend Catholic rites with Chin ese rites, accept Confucian teachings, the cult of the ancestors, etc. Pope Clement XI, who was told of it by rival Orders, condemned this doctrinal \"laxism\" and, as a result, all th e missionary work of the Jesuits in the Celestial Empire collapsed.

Only Mexico and Peru, with the memory of Aztec and Inca gods still fresh in their minds, resisted this imported religion for qui te a long time. Also, the Dominicans and Franciscans had already establis hed themselves solidly.

The Jesuits could not find better cond itions to establish, away from the corruption of whites and half-castes, th e perfect type of colony, a city of God according to their heart's desire . At the start of the 17th century, Paraguay was made into a Province by the general of the Order who had been given all powers by the Court of Spain, and the \"Jesuit State\" developed and flourished. These good savages were duly catechised and trained to live a sedentary life under a discipline as gentle as it was strong: \"as an iron hand in a velvet glove\". These patriarchal societies deliberately ignored liberties of any kind. \"All that a Christian possesses, and uses, the hut in which he lives, the fields he cultivates, the livestock which provide his food and clothes, thie arms he carries, the tools he works with, even the only table knife given to every young couple when they set up home, is \"Tupa mbac\" God's property From the same conception, the \"Christian\" cannot dispose of his time and person freely.

None of them can become priest monk, and even less Jesuit... They have practically no liberty left. But they are obviously very happy, materially speaking... In the morning, after mass, each gang of workers go to the fields one after another, singing and preceded by some holy image; in the evening, they come back to the village in the same manner, to hear the catechism or recite the rosary. The Fathers have also thought out some honest entertainments and recreations for the \"christians\" ... \"The Jesuits watch over them like fathers; and, like fathers also, they punish the smallest mistakes...

This not very brilliant result proves that there was some important defect in th e educative methods of the Fathers. What was that defect? The fact that they never tried to develop, in their \"red\" children, the inventive faculties, the need for activity, the feeling of responsibility; they themselves invented games and recreations for their christians, they thought for them instead of encouraging them to think for themselves; they merely submitted th ose who were under their care to a mechanical \"breaking in\" inst ead of educating them\".(11) How could it be otherwise when they themselves had gone through a \"breaking in\" lasting fourteen years?

Another one, Rodrigue de Gois, was so enraptured with her inexpressible beauty that he was seen soaring into the air. A novice of this Order, who died in Rome in 1581, was sustained by the Virgin in his figh t against the devil's temptations; to strengthen him, she gave him a taste of her Son's blood from time to time and \"the comfort of her breasts\".(5) Duns Scot's doctrine of the Immaculate Conception\" was enthusiastically adopted by the Order which was successful in having it made into a dogma by Pius IX in 1854. \"Erasmus satirically depicted the wors hip of Mary of his time. During the fourth century, the tale of Loretto's house had been invented; this house had apparently been brought from Palestine by angels. The Jesuits welcomed and defended this legend. Canisius went as far as producing letters from Mary herself and, thanks to the Order, great wealth started to pour in at Loretto (as at Lourdes, Fatima, etc..) \"The Jesuits brought forth all kinds of re lics of the Mother of God.

Ignatius wanted his disciplies to have a \"perceptible\", or ev en sensual piety, similar to his own, and they obviously succeeded. No wonder they were so successful with the Guaranis; this erotic fetichism suited them perfectly. But the good Fathers always thought it would suit the \"whites\" just as well. As the foundation of their doctrine is an utter contempt for people as human beings, \"whites\" or \"reds\" were just the same, and both had to be treated as if they were children.

Amongst other things, these exercises consist of giving to Mary morning and evening salutations; frequently charging the angles to greet her; expressing the desire to bu ild her more churches than all those built by monarchs put together; carrying day and night a rosary as a bracelet, an image of Mary, etc... \"These practices are enough to assure our salvation and if the devil, when we are about to die, makes claims on ou r souls, we just have to remind him that Mary is responsible for us and he must sort things out with her\".(7) In his \"Pietas quotidiana erga S.D.

Charmot doesn't even try to hide it in what he said about the Jesuit professor in 1943: \"He teaches sc iences, not for themselves, but only with the view to bring about God's greatest glory. It is the rule laid down by Saint Ignatius in his \"Constitutions\". 10) And again: \"When we speak of a whole culture, we do not mean that we teach all subjects and sciences, but we give a literary and scientific education which is not purely secula r and impermeable to the lights of Revelation\".(11) The instruction dispensed by the Jesuits was therefore bound to be more flashy than profound, or \"formalistic\" as it is often called. \"They did not believe in liberty, which was fatal as far as teaching is concerned\", wrote H. Boehmer. \"The truth is that the relative merits of the Jesuits' teaching diminished while science and the methods of education and instruction progressed and developed, on the basis of a wider and deeper conception of Humanity. Buckle said: \"The more civilisation advanced, the more the Jesuits lost ground, not merely because of their own decadence, but because of all the modifications and changes in the minds of those around them... During the 16th century, the Jesuits were ahead, but during the 18th century, they were behind their time\".(12) (9,10,11) F. Charmot, S.J. op.cit., pp.318-319, 508-509, 494. (12) J.

As we have already seen, Ignatius expressed the same idea in different terms and his sons drew their inspiration from it. \"The extraordinary activity deployed by the Order in the field or moral theology already shows that this subtle science had, for him, a much greater practical importa nce than the other sciences\".(13) Mr. Boehmer, who wrote the phrase we just quoted, reminds us that confession was very rare during the Middle Ages and the faithful resorted to it only in the gravest cases. But the domineering character of the Roman Church made the practice of it spread and grow more and more. In fact, during the 16th century, confession had become a religious duty which had to be diligently observed. Ignatius considered it most important and recommended to his disciplies that as many of the faithful as possible should observe it regularly. \"The results of this method were extraordinary. The Jesuit confessors soon enjoyed everywhere the same consideration shown to the Jesuit professors, and the confessional was considered by all as the symbol of the Order's power and activity, as were th e professorial chair and the latin grammar... \"If we read Ignatius' Instructions regarding confession and moral theology, we must admit that, from the beginning, the Order was prepared to treat the sinner kindly, that as time went on, it showed more and more indulgence until this kindness degenerated into slackness...

This is how they won the favours of the nobles and high-ups of this world who always needed the condescension of their confessors more than the mass of ordinary sinners. \"The Courts of the Middle Ages never had any all-powerful confessors. This characteristic figure appeared in the life of the Courts only in modern times and it is the Jesuit Order whic h implanted it everywhere\".(14) Mr Boehmer wrote: \"During the 17th century, these confessors not only obtained an appreciable political infl uence everywhere, but even accepted, and sometimes openly, political posts or functions. It is then that Father Neidhart took the direction of Span ish politics as 'prime minister and Grand Inquisitor'; Father Fernandez sa t and was entitled to speak and vote in the Portuguese Council; Father La Chaise and his successor held the functions of ministers for Ecclesias tical Affairs at the Court of France. \"Let us remember also the part played by the Fathers in general politics, even outside the confessional: Father Possevino as pontifical legate in Sweden, Poland and Russia; Father Petr e, a Minister in England; Father Vota as intimate counsellor of Jean Sobies ki of Poland, as 'maker of kings' in Poland, as mediator when Prussia wa s made into a kingdom; —one must admit that no other Order showed so mu ch interest and talent for politics, and deployed so much activity in it than the Jesuit Order\".(15) \"If the 'indulgence' of these confes sors towards their august penitents helped greatly the interests of the Order and the Roman Curia, it was the same in the more modest spheres where the Fathers used similar convenient methods. With their meticulous, and even meddlesome spirit, which they inherited from their f ounder; the famous \"casuists\" such as Escobar, Mariana, Sanchez, Busenbaum, etc., applied themselves to studying each rule in particular and their applications to all the cases which could be presented at the tribunal of penance; their tracts on \"moral theology\" gave the Company a universal reputation as their subtlity to distort and pervert the most evident moral obligations was so apparent. Here are some examples of these acrobatics: \"The divine Law prescribes \"You shall not bear false witness\". \"There is false witness only if the one who took the oath uses words which he knows will deceive the judge. The use of ambiguous terms is therefore allowed, and even the excuse of mental reservation in certain circumstances...\" \"If a husband asks his adulterous wife if she has broken the conjugal contract, she can say \"no\" without hesitation as that contract still exists. Once she has obtained absolution at the confessional, she can say: \"I am w ithout sin\", if, while she says it, she thinks of that absolution which took the load of her sin. If her husband is still incredulous, she can reassure hi m by saying that she has not committed ( 1 5 ) and (16) H.

In fact, their gallant escorts were treated just as well: \"The Law of God commands: \"You shall not kill\". \"But it doesn't mean that every man who kills sins against this precept. For example, if a nobleman is threatened with blows or beating, he can kill his aggressor; but of course this right is only for the nobleman and not the plebeian, as there is nothing dishonourable for a common man to r eceive a beating... \"In the same way, a servant who helps his master seduce a young girl is not committing a mortal sin if he can fear serious disadvantages or bad treatment in case he refuses. If a young girl is pregnant, a miscarriage can be induced if her fault is the cause of dishonour for herself or a member of the clergy.\"(17) As for Father Benzi, he had his hour of fame when he declared: \"it is only a slight offence to feel the breasts of a nun\", and, because of it, the Jesuits were nicknamed the \"mamillary theologians\". But, as far as that is concerned, the famous Casuist, Thomas Lanchz, deserves the prize for his tract \"De Ma trimonio\", in which the pious author studies with outrageous details all the varieties of \"carnal sin\". Also, let us study further these conven ient maxims as far as politcs are concerned, especially those relati ve to the legitimacy of assassinating \"tyrants\" found guilty of lukewarmness towards the sacred interests of the Hol y See. Mr. Boehmer has this to say: \"As we have just seen, it is not diffi c u l t to guard against mortal sin. Depending on circumstances, we only have to use the excellent means permitted by the Fathers: \"equivocation, mental reservation, the subtle theory of the dir ection of intentions,\" and we will be able to commit, without sin, acts which are considered criminal by the ignorant masses, but in which even the most severe Father will not be able to find an atom of mortal sin\".(18) Amongst the most criminal Jesuitic maxims, there is one which roused public indignation to the highest point and deserves to be examined; it is: \"A monk or priest is allowed to kill those who are ready to slander him or his community.\" So, the Order gives itself the right to el iminate its adversaries and even those of its members who, having come out of it, are too talkative. This pearl is found in the \"Theology of Father L'Amy\". There is another case where this principle finds its application. For, this same Jesuit was cynical enough to write: \"If a Father, yielding to temptation, abuses a woman and she publicises what has happened, and, because of it, dishonours him, this same Father can kill her to avoid disgrace!\" (17) and (18) H.

But, as we have already mentioned, time was not working in its favour. As ideas evolve d and the progress of sciences tended to liberate the minds, ordinary pe ople and monarchs found it more and more difficult to endure the ascendancy of these champions of \"theocracy\". Also, many abuses, born out of it s successes, impaired the Society inwardly. Apart from politics in whic h it was deeply involved as one has seen, to the detriment of national inte rests, its devouring activity had soon made itself felt in the domain of economics. \"The Fathers became involved too much in affairs which had nothing to d o w i t h religion, in commerce, exchange, as liquidators of bankruptcies. The Roman College, which should ha ve remained the intellectual and moral model of all Jesuit colleges had cloth made in huge quantities at Macerata and sold it in fairs at a low price. Their centres in India, Antilles, Mexico and Brazil soon started trading in colonial products. At Martinique, a procurator created vast plantations which were cultivated by negro slaves\".(19) This is the commercial side of Foreign Missions which is just the same today. The Roman Church never scorned at ex tracting a temporal profit from her \"spiritual\" conquests. As far as that is concerned, the Jesuits were just like all other religious Orders; they even surp assed them. In any case, we know that, recently, the White Fathers were amon gst the richest landowners in North Africa. The sons of Loyola were as intens ely active at making the best of the \"pagan's\" labours as at winning their souls. \"In Mexico, they had silver mines and sugar refineries; in Paraguay, tea (19) Pierre Dominique, op.cit., pp.190-191."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"68 THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE JESUITS and cacao plantations, carpet factories; they also reared cattle and exported 80,000 mules every year\".(20 As we can see, the evangelisation of their \"red children\" was a good source of revenue. And to make an even bigger profit, the Fathers did not hesitate to defraud the state treasury, as seen in the well-known story of the so-called boxes of chocolate unloaded at Cadix which were full of gold powder. Bishop Palafox, sent as apostolic visitor by Pope Innocent VIII, wrote to him in 1647 \"All the wealth of South America is in the hands of the Jesuits\". Financial affairs were just as advant ageous. \"In Rome, the coffers of the Order made payments to the Portuguese embassy in the name of the Portuguese government. When Auguste le Fort went to Poland, Vienna's Fathers opened a credit account for this needy monarch with the Jesuits of Varsovie. In China, the Fathers lent money to the merchants at 25, 50 and even 100% in terest\".(21) The scandalous greediness of the Order, its loose morals, its ceaseless political intrigues and also its encroachings upon the prerogatives of the secular and regular clergy had stirred up mortal enmity and hatred everywhere. Amongst the higher classes, it had been brought into complete disrepute and, in France at any rate, its efforts to maintain the people in a formalist and superstitious piety gave way to the inevitable emancipation of the minds. Nevertheless, the material prosperity enjoyed by the Society, the acquired positions at the Courts and esp ecially the support of the Holy See which they thought immovable, maintain ed the Jesuits in their complete assurance, even on the eve of their ruin. Had they not already gone through several storms, suffered about thirty expulsions from the time of their foundation until the middle of the 18th century? Nearly every time, they had been back sooner or later to reoccupy their lost positions. But this new eclipse threatening them was to be nearly total, this time, and last for more than forty years. The strange thing is that the first assault against the powerful Society came from the very Catholic Portugal, one of their principal strongholds in Europe. The influence exercised over that country by England since the beginning of the century was prqbably one of the causes of this uprising. A treaty fixing the boundaries in Americ a, concluded between Spain and Portugal in 1750, had given the Portuguese a vast territory east of the river Uruguay where the Jesuits were working. In consequence, the Fathers had to retreat with their converts on this side of the new frontier, on Spanish territory.

The marquess of Pombal, Portuguese prime minister, felt really insulted. besides, this former pupil of the Jesuit s had not kept their \"trade-mark\" and drew his inspiration from French and E nglish philosophers rather than from his old educators. In 1757, he drove out the Jesuit confessors of the Royal family and forbade the members of the Society to preach. After several quarrels with them, he issued pamphlets to the public—one of which was \"Short account of the Jesu its' kingdom in Paraguay\" which made a great noise—obtained an inquiry into their conduct by pope Benedict XIV and finally banished the Society from all his territories. The affair caused a sen sation in Europe, and esp ecially in France where, soon after, the bankruptcy of Fath er La Valette br oke out; he was a \"businessman\" handling huge transact ions in sugar and coffee for the Company. Its refusal to pay the Father 's debts was fatal. The Parliament, not content with a civil condemnation, examined its Constitutions, declared its establishment in France illegal and condemne d twenty four works of its principal authors. On the 6th of April 1762, it issued a 'statement of arrest' (Indictment) in the following terms: \"The said Institute is inadmissible in any civilised State, as its nature is hostile to all spiritual and temporal authority; it seeks to introduce into the Church and States, under the plausible veil of a religious Institute, not an Order truly desirous to spread evangelical perfection, but rather a political body working untiringly at usurping all authority, by all kinds of indirect, secret and devious means...\" In conclusion, the Jesuits' doctrine was described as follows: \"perverse, a destroyer of all religious and honest principles, insulting to Christian morals, pernicious to civil society, hostile to the rights of the nation, the royal power, and even the security of the sovereigns and obedience of their subjects; suitable to stir up the greates t disturbances in the States, conceive and maintain the worst kind of corruption in men's hearts\". In France, the Society's properties were confiscated for the benefit of the Crown and none of its members was allowed to stay in the kingdom unless he enounced his vows and swore to submit to the general rules of France's clergy. In Rome, the Jesuits' general, Ricci, obtained from Pope Clement XIII a bull confirming the Order's privileges and proclaiming its innocence. But it was too late. In Spain, the Bourbons suppressed all the establishments of the Society, the metropolitan ones as well as the colonial ones. So ended Paguay's Jesuit State. The governments of Naples, Parma, and even the Grand-Master of Malta also banished the sons of Loyola from their territories.

They just managed to find them a wretched sanctuary in Corsica\".(22) \"Clement XIII, elected on the 6th of Ju ly 1758, had resisted a long time the pressing requests of several nations de manding the Jesuits' suppression. He was about to yield and had already ar ranged a consistory for the 3rd of February 1769 at which he was to tell the cardinals about his resolution to comply with the wishes of these Courts; on the night before that particular day, he suddenly felt ill as he was going to bed and cried out: \"I am dying...\". It is a very dangerous thing to attack the Jesuits!\"(23) A conclave assembled and went on fo r three months. At last, cardinal Ganganelli put on the mitre and took the name of Clement XIV. The Courts which had banished the Jesuits kept on asking for the total suppression of the Society. But the papacy was in no hurry to abolish this primordial instrument for the carrying out of its politics, and four years passed before Clement XIV, constr ained by the firm attitude of his opponents, who had occupied some of the pontifical States, at last signed the Brief of dissolution: \"Dominus ac Redemptor\" in 1773. Ricci, the Order's general, was even imprisoned at the castle of Saint-Ange where he died a few years later. \"The Jesuits only appeared to submit to this verdict which condemned them... They wrote innumerable pamphlets against the pope and to incite rebellion; they told lies and slanders without number concerning so-called atrocities committed when their properties in Rome were confiscated\".(24) The death of Clement XIV, fourteen m onths later, was even attributed to them by a section of European opinion. \"The Jesuits, in principle at least, were no more; but Clement XIV knew very well that, by signing their death warrant, he was signing his own as well: \"This suppression is done at last\", he ex claimed, \"and I am not sorry about it.. I would do it again if it was not done already; but this suppression will kill me\".(25) Ganganelli was right; soon, posters star ted to appear on the palace walls which invariably displayed these five letters: I.S.S.S.

The perpetrator of that abominable deed was then able to escape the judgement of the world, but he will not be able to escape God's justice!\"(27) \"We can positively affirm that, on the 22nd of September 1774, Pope Clement XIV died by poisoning\".(28) Meanwhile, the empress of Austria, Marie-Therese, had also banished the Jesuits from all her States. Only Frederik of Prussia and Catherine II, empress of Russia, welcomed them in their countries as educators. But, in Prussia, they only managed to stay for ten years, until 1786. Russia was favourable to them longer but, there also, and for the same reason, they e v e n t u a l l y aroused the animosity of the government. \"... The suppression of th e schism and the rallying of Russia to the pope attracted them like a lamp attract s a moth. They launched an active propaganda programme in the army a nd aristocracy and fought against the Bible Society created by the C zar. They won several successes and converted prince Galitzine, nephew of the Minister for Worship. So the Czar intervened and we have the Ukase of the 20th of December 1815\".(29) No need to say that the grounds for this Ukase, which banished the Jesuits from Saint-Petersburg and Mosc ow, were the same as in all the other countries. \"We came to realise that they did not fulfill the duties expected of them... Instead of living as peaceful inhabitants in a foreign country, they disturbed the Greek re ligion which has been since ancient times, the predominant relig ion in our empire and on which rests the peace and happiness of the nations under our sceptre. They abused the confidence they obtained and turned the youth entrusted to them and inconsistent women away from our worship... We are not surprised that this religious Order was expelled from every country and that their actions were not tolerated anywhere\".(29) In 1820 at last, general meas ures were taken to drive them out of the whole of Russia. But, because of political events favouring it, they had set foot again in western Europe when their Order was solemnly reestablished by Pope Pius VII in 1814. (26) Baron de Ponnat, op.cit., p.223.

The phrase seems plausible enough. The Holy See must certainly have found it hard to part with its most important instrument in the domination of the world. The Order's disgrace, a political measure imposed by circumstances, was gradually attenuated by the successors of Clement XIV: Pius VI and Pius VII; and if the official eclipse of the Jesuits lasted forty years, it was because of the upheavals in Europe resulting from the French Revolution. In any case, that eclipse was never total. \"Most of the Jesuits had stayed in Austria, France, Spain, Italy, mingling with the clergy. They met with each other or gathered in large numbers as much as possible. In 1 794, Jean de Tournely founded the Society of the Sacred Heart in Be lgium as a teaching body. Many Jesuits joined it. Three years later, the Ty rolean Paccanari, who thought he was another Ignatius, founded the Society of the Brothers of Faith. In 1799, the two Societies merged with Father Clar iviere as the head; he was the only surviving French Jesuit. In 1803 , they joined the Russian Jesuits. Something coherent was coming back to life again, but the masses, and even most of the politicians, did not recognise it at first\".(31) The French Revolution, and then the Empire, gave the Company of Jesus an unexpected credibility again; it was a defensive reaction against new ideas springing up in the ancient monarchies.

But under Charles X, narrow-minded and very devout, the Jesuits had it easy. The law which expelled them in 1764 was still being enforced. No matter. They enlivened the famous \"Congregation\", first kind of Opus Dei. This pious brotherhood, composed of ecclesiastics and laymen, was found everywhere, pretending to \"purge\" the army, the magistracy, the administration, the teaching profession; it held \"missions\" all over the country, planting commemorative crosses wherever it went; many of these are still there today; it stirred up the believers to fight the infidels and made itself so hateful that even the very catholic and very legitimist Montlosier exclaimed: \"Our missionaries have started fires ev erywhere. If something has to be sent to us, we would rather have Marseill e's plague than more missionaries\". In 1828, Charles X withdrew the Order's right to teach, but it was too late. The dynasty collapsed in 1830. Hated and covered with shame, the sons of Loyola nevertheless stayed in France, but disguised, as the Order wa s still officially abolished. Louis- Philippe and Napoleon III tolerated them. The Republic scattered them in 1880 only, under the administration of Jules Ferry. The closing of their establishments was effective only in 1901, under the law of separation. During the 19th cen tury, the Company's history in America and half of Europe was equally full of ups and downs as in the past, while fighting the new ideas. \"Wherever liberal-minded people gain ed victories, the Jesuits were expelled.

This law appoints a superior council for Public Instruction in which the clergy dominates, (first art.); it makes the clergy masters of the schools, (art.44); it gives religious associations the right to create free schools, without havi ng to explain about the non-authorised congregations (Jesuits), (art. 17,2); it said that the letters of obedience would be their diplomas, (art.49); M. Barthelemy Saint-Hilaire tries in vain to demonstrate that the aim of the authors of that project is to give th e monopoly to the clergy, and that this law would be fatal to the Univer sity... Victor Hugo exclaims, also vainly: \"This law is a monopoly in the hands of those who try to make teaching come out of the sacristy and the government out of the confessional\".(35) But the Assembly ignores these protestations. It prefers listening to M. de Montalembert who exclaims: \"We will be swallowed up if we don't stop immediately the current trend of rationalis m and demagogy; what's more, it can be stopped only with the help of the Church\". \"M. de Montalembert adds these words to make sure the significance of this law is well described: \"To the demoralising and an archical army of teachers, we must oppose the army of the clergy\". The law was passed. Never before in France had the Jesuits won a more complete victory. M. de Montalembert admitted it proudly... He said: \"I am defending (34) \"Oeuvres de Napoleon III\" (Amyot et Plon, Paris 1856, II, pp.31 and 33).

But let us see how the \"Republic\", presided over by prince Louis-Napoleon, was acting internationally. The revolution of 1848 had, amongst other repercussions in Europe, provoked the uprising of the Romans against Pope Pius IX, their temporal sovereign, who had fled to Gaete. The Roman Republic had been proclaimed. Through a scandalous para dox, it was the French Republic, in agreement with the Austrians and the king of Naples, who put back on the throne the undesirable sovereign. \"A French regiment besieged Rome, took it on the 2nd of June 1849 and restored pontifical power; it managed to maintain itself with the help of a French division of occupation which left Rome only after the first disasters in the Franco-German war of 1870\".(37) This beginning was very promising. \"The coup of the 2nd of December 1851 brought about the proclamation of the Empire. Louis-Napoleon, President of the Republic, had favoured the Jesuits in every way. Now emperor, he refused nothing to his accomplices and allies. The clergy poured out its blessings and \"Te Deum\" profusely on the massacres and proscriptions of the 2nd of December. The one responsible for this abominable ambush was looked upon as a providential saviour: \"The archbishop of Paris, Monseigneur Sibour, who saw the massacres on the boulevard, exclaims: \"The man who was prepared by God has come; the finger of God was never more visible than in the events which produced these great results\". The bishop of Saint-Flour said from his pulpit: \"God pointed out Louis- Napoleon; He already had elected him to be emperor. Yes, my dear brethren, God consecrated him before hand through the blessing of His pontiffs and priests; He acclaimed him Himself; can we not recognise God's elect?\" The bishop of Nevers falsely salute d \"Providence's visible instrument\". \"These pitiable adulations, which could be multiplied still further, deserved a reward. This reward was a complete fre edom given to the Jesuits as long as the Empire lasted. The Society of Jesus was literally master of France for eighteen years... she enriched herself, multiplied her establishments and spread her influence. Her action was felt in all the important events of that time, especially in the expedition to Mexico and the declaration of war in (36) Adolphe Michel, op.cit. pp.55,66.

But, barely two years after he acceeded to the throne, the first of all those wars which succeeded each other throughou t his reign started; history could regard the motives which brought about these wars as unconnected if we didn't see what united them: the defence of the Roman Church's interests. The Crimean war, the first of these mad enterprises which weakened us and was not nationally profitable, is a characteristic example. It was not someone anticlerical, but the Abbe Brugerette, who wrote: \"One must read the speeches the famous Theatine (Father Ventura) gave in the chapel of Les Tuileries during Lent in 1857. He presented the Empire's restorationas God's work... and praise d Napoleon III for having defended the religion in Crimea and ma de the great days of th e Crusades shine a second time in the East... The Crimean war wa s regarded as a compliment to the Roman expedition... It was praised by th e whole clergy, full of admiration for the religious fervour of the troops besieging Sebastapol. Saint-Beuve movingly narrated how Napoleon III had sent an image of the Virgin to the French fleet\".(39) What was this expedition which aroused the enthusiasm of the clergy. M. Paul Leon, member of the Institute, explai ns: \"A quarrel betw een monks revives the question of the East: it was born ou t of rivalries between the La t i n and Orthodox Churches regarding the protection of the Holy places (in Palestine). Who would watch over Bethlehem's church es, hold the keys, direct the work? How is it possible that such small matters could set two great empires against each other?... But, behind the Latin monks is France's Catholic party, provided with ancient privileges and supporter of the new regime; behind the growing demands of the Orthodox, who had grown in numbers, is the Russian influence\".(40) The Czar invokes the protection of the Orthodox Church which he has to assure and, to make it effective, asks that his fleet should use the Dardanelles passage; England, which is b acked by France, refuses, and the war breaks out. \"France and England can reach the Czar only through the Black Sea and the Turkish alliance... From now on, the war of Russia becomes the Crimean war and is entirely centered on the siege of Sebastopol, a costly episode without issue. Bloody battles, deadly epidemics and inhuman sufferings cost France one hundred thousand dead\".(41) We must point out that these one hundred thousand dead were Christ's (38) Adolphe Michel, op.cit., pp.71-72.

Anyw ay, haven't we heard the same, not long ago, during the German occupation, expounded in identical terms by the prelates of His Holiness Pius XII and by Pierre Laval himself, president of the Council of Vichy? In 1863, it is the expedition to Mexico. What is it about? To transform a lay- republic into an empire and offer it to Maximilien, archduke of Austria. Austria is the papacy's number one pillar. The aim is also to erect a barrier which would contain the influence of the Protestant United States over the States of South America, strongholds of the Roman Church. M. Albert Bayet wrote with sagacity : \"The war's aim is to establish a Catholic empire in Mexico and curtail th e peoples' right to self rule; as during the Syrian campaign and the two Chinese campaigns, it tends especially to serve catholic interests\".(43) We know how, in 1867, after the French army had re-embarked, Maximilien, the unfortunate champion of the Holy See, was made prisoner when Queretaro surrendered and was shot dead, making way for a republic of which the victor Juarez was president. Nevertheless, the time was getting near er when France was to pay, once again, much more dearly for the poli tical support the Vatican assured the imperial throne. While the French army was spilling its blood in the four corners of the world, and getting weaker while defending interests which were not hers, Prussia, under the heavy hand of the future \"iron chancellor\", was busy expanding its military might in order to unite the German states in a single block.\" Austria was the first victim of its will and power. In agreement with Prussia which was to seize the Danish duchess of Schleswig and Holstein, Austria was cheated by her accomplice. The war which followed was soon won by Prussia at Sadowa on the 3rd of July 1866. It was a terrible blow for the ancient Hapsburg monarchy which was declining; the blow was just as hard for the Vatican, as Austria had been for so long its most faithful stronghold within the germanic lands. From novw on, Protestant Prussia will exercise her hegemony over them. Unless... the Roman Church finds a \"secular arm\" capable of stopping completely the expansion of the \"heretic\" power.

The worship of saints and their relics, re strained for so long by the cold breath of rationalism, had taken a new vigour. The worship of the holy Virgin, thanks to apparitions at La Salette and Lourdes, acquired an extraordinary popularity. Pilgrimages to these places privileged by miracles multiplied. \"The French Episcopate... favoured new devotions. It warmly and thankfully welcomed, in 1854, the encyclical letter of Pius IX proclaiming the dogma of the Immaculate Conception... It was also the episcopate, brought together in Paris, in 1856, for the baptism of the imperial Prince, who asked Pius IX that the feast of the Sacred-Heart... should be made into a solemn feast of the universal Church\".(46) These few lines clearly show the preponderant influence exercsied by the Jesuits under the Second Empire, in Fr ance as much as over the Holy See, As we saw earlier on, they were and re main the great propagators of these \"particular devotions, old or new\", th is \"perceptible\" and almost sensual piety made the masses excessively scrupulous in religious matters, especially women. As far as that is concerned, we must admit that they were realists. The time had gone—already unde r Napoleon III—when the public as a whole, the learned and the ignorant, took a deep interest in theological questions.

The main acts of this pontificate were all victories for the Jesuits whose all- powerful influence over the Roman Curi a affirmed itself more and more. In 1864, Pius IX published the encyclical letter \"Quanta Cura\", accompanied by the \"Syllabus\" which anathematized the best political principles of the contemporary societies. \"Anathema on all that is dear to modern France! Modern France wants the independance of the state; the 'Syllabus' teaches that the ecclesiastical power must exercise its \"authority without the assent and permission of the civil power. Modern France wants th e liberty of conscience and liberty of worship; the'Syllabus' teaches that the Roman Church has the right to use force and reinstate the Inquisitio n.

It presented the Inquisition as \"the logical consequence of the whole orthodox system\", as \"the summary of the Church's spirit\". It added: \"When she will be able to, the Church will bring back the Inquisition; if she doesn't do it, it is because she cannot do it\".(49) The power of the Jesuits over the Vati can was shown even more strongly, a few years after the 'Syllabus', when the dogma of Pontifical Infallibility was promulgated; the Abbe Brugerette wrote that this dogma was to \"throw over the tragic years of 1870-1871, which put France into mourning, the brightness of a great Christian hope\". The same author added: \"One can say that, during the first half of the year 1870, the Church of France was not in France anymore; she was in Rome, passionately busy with the Genera l Council which Pius IX had just called at the Vatican...\" \"According to Monseigneur Pie, this French clergy had completely \"thrown off its own li veries, maxims and French or Gallic liberties\". This bishop of Poitiers added that it was done as a sacrifice to the principle of authority, sound doctrine and common right; it placed all that under the feet of the sovereign pontiff, made a throne of it for him and sounded the trumpet, saying : \"The pope is our king; not only is his will our command, but his wishes are our rules\".(49a) The resignation of the whole of a \"nat ional\" clergy into the hands of the Roman Curia is clear enough and, becaus e of it, the subjection of the French Catholics to the will of a foreign despot who, under the cover of dogma or morals, was going to impose on them hi s political directions without any opposition. The liberal Catholics protested in vain against the exorbitant pretention of the Holy See to dictate its laws in the name of the Holy Spirit. The Abbe Brugerette informs us, their head, M. de Montalembert, published in the Gazet te de France an article in which he vehemently protested against those who \"sacrifice justice and truth, reason and history, to the idol they set up at the Vatican\".(50) Several notorious bishops such as Fathers Hyacinthe Loyson and Gratry took the same line; the latter not w ithout spirit; Father Gratry said: \"He published successive ly his four Letters to Mons eigneur Deschamps. In them, he did not merely discuss historical ev ents, such as the condemnation of Pope Honorius, who, according to him, opposed the proclamation of pontifical infallibility; but, in a sharp and bitter manner, he denounced also the contempt of authoritative catholics for the trut h, and scientific integrity.

And Gratry added: \"Even today it is being stated that Galileo's condemnation was opportune\". \"You, men of little faith, with miserable hearts an d sordid souls! Your tricks are scandalous. On the day when the great science of nature was raised above the world, you condemned it.\" \"Do not be surprised if men, before forgiving you, expect from you confession, penance, deep contrition a nd amends for your faults\".(51) No need to say that the Jesuits, inspiring agents of Pius IX and all-powerful over the Council, were not anxious abou t confession, penance, contrition or reparation, at a time when they almost reached the goal they had set themselves at the Council of Trent, in the middle of the 16th century. At that time Lainez already supported the idea of papal infa llibility. It only meant consecrating as a dogma a pretention nearly as old as the papacy itself. No other Council until then had been willing to ratify it, but the time seemed just right, then; besides, the patient work of the Jesuits had prepared the national clergy for the su rrender of their last liberties; the imminent collapse of the popes' temp oral power—it happened before the Council voted—called for a reinforcement of his spiritual authority, according to the ultramontanes. The argument prevailed and the\"dictatus papae\" of Gregory VII, principles of the mediaeval theocracy, triumphed right in the middle of the 19th century. What the new dogma especially consecrated was the omnipotence of the Company of Jesus in the Roman Church. \"Under the cover of the Jesuits, who have established themselves at the Vatican since the secular powers have re jected them from all free countries as an association of malefactors, the papa cy has aspired to new ambitions. These evil men, who have made the Gospel into a Spectacle of tears and blood and remain the worst enemies of democrac y and freedom of thought, dominate the Roman Curia; all their efforts concentrat e on maintaining, in the Church, their pernicious preponderance a nd shameful doctrines.\" \"Dedicated to the cause of extreme cen tralisation, irreducible apostles of theocracy, they are the recognised masters of contemporary Catholicism and stamp their seal on its theology, its of ficial piety and its crooked politics\". \"True janissaries of the Vatican, they inspire everything, rule everthing, penetrate everwhere, set up \"informing\" as a system of government, faithful to a casuistry whose profound immorality has been revealed by history and inspired Pascal's immortal pages of sublime mockery.

Daniel-Rops. This confirmation carries even more weight by the fact that it was published in 1959, under the title \"The Reestablishment of the Company of Jes us\", in the Jesuits' own publication \"Etudes\". It is then in a true sp eech for the defence that we read: \"For many reasons, this reorganisa tion of the Company of Jesus had a considerable historical importance. Th e Holy See rediscovered this faithful band, utterly devoted to its cause, a nd which was to be needed soon after. Many Fathers were to exercise, duri ng that century and until now, a discreet, but deep influence on certain dispositions taken by the Vatican; a kind of proverb was even heard in Rome: \"The pope's penholders are Jesuits\". Their influence was obvious in the development of the worship of the Sacred-Heart as well as in the proclamation of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, in the editing of the 'Syllabus' as well as in the definition of 'Infallibility'. The \"Civilta Cattolica\", founded by the Neapolitan Jesuit Carlo Curci, was supposed to reflect the pope's thought during most of Pius IX's pontificate\".(53) This confession is clear enough. We wo uld only remind the departed spirit of this pious academician that, logi cally, and judging by all the previous context, it was rather the pope's thoug ht which was reflected in the opinions of the \"Civilta Cattolica\". No need to say that the Jesuits, all- powerful in Rome, as much because of their spirit as of their organisation, were going to engage the papacy in international politics more and more, as M. Louis Roguelin wrote: \"Since she lost her temporal power, the Church of Rome took advantage of every opportunity to regain all the ground she was constrained to abandon, through a recrudescence of diplomatic activities; as her cleverly concealed scheme is to divide in order to reign, she tried to turn every conflict in her favour.\" Boivent, 1927, pp.79 to 81).

Then, France was conquered; on the other hand, it was a brilliant victory for the Company of Jesus when, in 1873, a law was passed, allowing the building of a basilica of the Sacred-Heart on Montmartre Hill. This church, said to be a \"National wish\", by a cruel irony no doubt, was going to materialise in stone the triumph of Jesuitism, at the place where it commenced its life. At first glance, this invocation to th e Sacred-Heart of Jesus extolled by the Jesuits may seem, though basely idolatrous, quite innocent. \"To realise the danger\", wrote Gaston Bally, \"we must look behind the facade, witness the manipulation of so uls and see the aim of their various associations: the Brotherhood of \"Perpetual Adoration\"; the Brotherhood of the \"Guard of Honour\", the Apos tolate of Prayer, the Reparative Communion, etc, etc. The brotherhoods, associates, apostles, missionaries, worshipers, zealots, gu ards of honour, restorers, mediators and other federates of the Sacred-Heart seem to intend exclusively to, as Mademoiselle Alacoque invited them to, unite their homage to those of the nine choirs of Angels.

We must wonder then if the religious sentiment was a direct answer, for the whole of that society, to the expression of faith revealed by the imposing pilgrimages organised by the bishops and the earnestness of the masses in the churches... \"Without wanting to attentuate in any way the importance of the religious move in France brought about by the two wars of 1870 and 1914, which also raised such high hopes, we must nevertheless admit that this revival of the faith had not the depth, nor the extent which a true religious renewal would have... \"For, even then, the Church of France was unfortunately comprised of not only thousands of unbelievers and advers aries, but also a very large number of those who were catholics only by name and not conviction. Religious practices were performed, not by co nviction, but rather from habit... \"Soon after it was done, France seemed to regret the desperate move which made her send a Catholic majority to the National Assembly, for, five months later, she reversed her position at the complementary elections of the 2nd of July!

All the elections follow ing that consultation of universal suffrage had the same character of re publican and anticlerical opposition. It would be childish to pretend that they were not the expression of society's sentiments and wishes\".(59) The Abbe Brugerette, speaking about the great pilgrimages organised at that time for the \"uplifting of the country\", admits that they were the cause of \"some mistakes and excesses\" which arou sed the suspicions of the \"Church's adversaries\". \"The pilgrimages will be for them enterprises organised by the clergy for the restoration of monarchy in France and pontifical power in Rome. And the attitude taken by the clergy on these tw o aims will look like justifying this accusation from the irreligious press and w ill give, on that account, as we shall see later, a mighty impetus to anticlericalism. Without breaking away from its religious habits revived so much during the years after the war, French society will rebel against this \"government of priests\", as (58) and (59) Abbe Brugerette, op.cit., II, pp.10 to 14."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"THE JESUITS IN FRANCE FROM 1870 UNTIL 1885 91 Gambetta stigmatized it. Deep down, the French people had kept an invincible instinct of resistance against anything which even vaguely resembled the Church's political domination. On the whole, this nation loved religion, but the spectre of \"theocracy\" revived by the opposition press frightened it. The eldest daughter of the Church did not want to forget that she was also the mother of Revolution\".(60) Yet, the clergy with th e Jesuits at their head were making such efforts to persuade the French people to abjure the re publican spirit! \"Since the Falloux law was enforced , the Jesuits, expanded freely their colleges where they brought up the children of the ruling middle-classes and they obviously did not teach th em a great love for the Republic...\" \"As for the \"Assumptionists\" created in 1845 by the intransigent Father d'Alzon, they wanted to give back to the people the faith it had lost...\"(61) But there were many other envious flourishing teaching congregations: Oratorians, Eudistes, Dominicans of the Third-Order, Marianits, Marists, which Jules Simon called \"the second volume\" of the Jesuits bound in asses skin and the famous \"Brothers of the Christian Schools\", better known under the name of Ignorantins, who taught the \"good doctrine\" to the offsprings of the middle-classes as well as to more than one and a half million children of the ordinary people. It is not surprising that this situ ation put the republican regime on the defensive. A law, proposed in 1879 by Jules Ferry, wanted to remove the clergy from the Councils for Public Instruction into which they had been introduced by the laws of 1850 and 1873, and give back to the state's faculties the exclusive right to grade the degrees of the teachers. Article 7 of this law also specified th at \"no one would be allowed to take part in public or free teaching if he belongs to an unauthorised religious congregation\". \"The Jesuits are aimed at before anyone else in that famous article 7. The priests of the deanery of Moret (Sei ne-et-Marne) will declare then that \"they are on the side of all religious communities, including the venerable Fathers of the Company of Jesus\". \"To strike them\", they write, \"is to strike ourselves\"... The confession is explicit. The Abbe Brugerette, who wrote that passage, describes the resistance put up by the Catholics against what he calls a \"treacherous attack\", but he adds: \"The clergy still ignore the immense progress of the laity; it has not understood yet that, because of its oppos ition to the princi ples of '89, it has lost all deep influence over the direction of public spirit in France\".(62) Article 7 is rejected by the Senate , but Jules Ferry invokes the existing laws concerning the congregations.

Debidour. After the 11t h of March, Leo XIII and his Nunc io express a grievous protestation... \"Now it is the turn of all the bishops to defend energetically the religious Orders\".(63) The sons of Loyola were nevertheless e xpelled. But let us listen to what the Abbe Brugerette has to say on that subject: \"In spite of all, the Jesuits, experts at re-entering through the windows when they have been thrown out through the door, had already been successful in putting their colleges into the control of laymen or secular ecclesiastics. Even though not residing in these colleges, they could be seen coming in at certain times of the day to perform duties of direction and supervision\".(64) But the deceit was discovered and the Jesuits' colleges finally closed. In all, the decrees of 1879 were enfor ced on 32 congregations who refused to submit to the legal dispositions. In many places, the expulsion was carried out by the military arm \"manu milita ri\" against the opposition of the faithful aroused by the Fathers. These not only refused to ask for the legal authorisation, but also re fused to sign a declaration disclaiming all idea of opposition to the republican regime; this would have been enough for M. de Freycinet, then president of the Council and favouring them, to still \"tolerate\" them. When the Orders decided to sign this formal declaration of loyalty, the manoeuvre had been made void and M. de Freycinet had to resign because he had tried to negotiate this accord against the wishes of parliament and his colleagues of the Cabinet. The Abbe Brugerette comments on the declaration the religious Orders had to sign and found so repugnant: \"This declaration of respect for the institutions France gave herself freely... may seem very harmless and inoffensive, today, when compared with the solemn oath of loyalty demanded from the German bishops by the Concordat of the 20th of July 1933 between the Holy See and the Reich. \"Article 16.—\"Before taking possession of their diocese, the bishops will take an oath of loyalty before the president of the Reich or a competent Reichsstatthalter in the following terms: \"Before God and on the Holy Scriptures, I swear and promise, as a bishop should, loyalty to the German Reich and the State. I swear and promise to respect and make my clergy respect th e government establishe d according to the constitutional laws. As is my duty, I will work for the good and in the interests of the German State; in the exercise of the holy ministry entrusted to me, I will try to stop everything which would be detrimental to"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"THE JESUITS IN FRANCE FROM 1870 UNTIL 1885 93 it\". (Concordat between the Holy See and the German Reich)(65). The difference is certainly great between a mere promise of non- opposition to France's regime and this solemn pledge to uphold the nazi state. Just as great as the difference between the two regimes, one democratic and liberal, so hated by the Roman Church, the other totalitarian and brutally intolerent, wanted and set up by the united efforts of Franz von Papen, the pope's secr et chamberlain, and Monseigneur Pacelli, nuncio in Berlin and future Pius XII. It is again the Abbe Brugerette who, after having declared that the governnment's aim had been reached as far as the Company of Jesus was concerned, admits also: \"We could not speak of the destruction of the institution of congregations. The women's congregations had not been touched and the authorised ones, \"as dangerous as the others for the lay spirit\", were still standing. We knew also that nearly all the men's congregations, expelled from their houses because of the decr ees of 1880, had quietly gone back to their monasteries\".(66) But this lull was short-lived. The intention of the state to collect taxes and rights of succession on the wealth of the ecclesiastical communities provoked a general outcry amongst th em, as they had no intention to submit to the common law. \"The organisation of resistance was the work of a committee directed by the PP. Bailly, \"Assumptionist\", Stanislas, a Capuchin, and Le Dore, superior of the Eudists... Father Bailly was reviving the great zeal of the clergy by writing: \"Like Saint Laurent, the monks and nuns must go back to the r ack or thumb-screws rather than surrender\".(67) As by accident, the main revivalist of that \"great zeal\", Bailly, was an \"Assumptionist\", or, in fact, a camouflaged Jesuit. As for the rack and the thumb-screws, we could have reminded the good Father that these instruments of torture are in the tradition of the Holy-See and not the one of the republican state. Finally, the congregations paid—about half of what they owed—and the aforementioned Abbe admits that \"the prosperity of their work was not impaired\", as we can well imagine. We cannot go into details concer ning the laws of 1880 and 1886 which tended to assure the confessional ne utrality of the state schools, this \"secularisation\"(67a) which is natural to all tolerant minds, but is rejected by the Roman Church as an abominable attempt at forcing consciences, something she has always claimed for hers elf. We could expect her to fight for this so-called right as violently as for her financial privileges. (66) and (67) Abbe Brugerette, op.cit., pp. 185,196,191.

Of course, the matter is grave: one of the authors, Paul Bert, dared to write that even the idea of mi racles \"must vanish before the critical mind!\" So, more than fifty bishops promulgate the decree of the Index, with fulminating comments, and one of them, Monseigneur Isoard, declares in his pastoral letter of the 27th of February 1883 that the teachers, the parents and the children who refuse to destroy these books will be barred from the sacraments.(67b) The laws of 1886, 1901 and 1904, declaring that no teaching post could be held by members of religious congregations, also starte d a flood of protestations from the Vatican and the \"French\" clergy. But, in fact, the teaching monks and nuns only had to \"secularise\" themsel ves. The only positive result of these legal dispositions was that the professors of the schools \"so-called free\" had from now on to produce adequate pedagogic qualifications, a good thing when we know that, before the last war, the catholic primary schools in France numbered 11, 655 with 824,595 pupils As for the \"free\" colleges, and especially the Jesuits', if their number is being reduced it is because of several factors which have nothing to do with the legal wrangles. The superiority of the university's teaching, acknowledged by the majority of parents, and, more recently, its being without change, are the main causes for its growing popularity.

In fact, the clerical opposition to the regime which France gave herself freely showed itsel f at every opportunity, according to the Abbe Brugerette. In 1873, the attempt to restore monarchy with the Count of Chambord failed, even though strongly supported by the clergy, because the Pretender stubbornly refused to adopt the tricoloured flag, to him the emblem of Revolution. \"Such as it is, Catholicism seems bound to politics, or to a certain kind of politics... Loyalty to the Monarchy was transmitted from generation to generation in the old noble families as well as in the middle-classes and the common people, in the Catholic regi ons of the West and South. Their nostalgia of an ancient a nd idealised Regime, pictured in an epic Middle Age was coupled with the wishes of fervent Catholics whose main preoccupation was the salvation of the religion; th ey rallied, behind Veuillot, with the legitimate and devout royal family of Chambord, considered to be the form of government most favourable to the Church. Out of the union of these political and religious forces was born, in the strained situation after the war, a kind of reactionary mysticism, illustrated perfectly by Monseigneur Pie, bishop of Poitiers, and its best incarnation in the ecclesiastical world: \"France, who awaits another chief and calls for a master..., will again receive from God \"the sceptre of the Universe which fell from her hands for a while\", on the day when she will have learned anew how to go down on her knees\".(68) This picture, described by a Catholic hi storian, is significant.

One declares that an adulterous woman will be forgiven more easily than those who send their children to lay schools, another one: that it is better to stra ngle a child than give support to the regime, a third one: that he will refuse the last sacraments to those who vote for the regime's partisans. The thr eats are carried out: republican and anticlerical tradesmen are boycotted; dest itute people are refused any help and workmen are dismissed\".(69) These excesses from a clergy affected more and more by Jesuitic ultramontanism are even less acceptabl e from the fact that they emanate \"from ecclesiastics paid by the governm ent, as the Concordat is still enforced\". Also, the majority of public opinion is not happy at all with this pressure on the consciences, as the aforementioned author writes: \"As we have seen, the French people, as a whole, is indifferent to religious matters, and we cannot mistake the hereditary observance of religious practices for a real faith... \"T he fact is that the political map of France is identical to her religious map... we can say that in the regions where faith is strong, the French pe ople vote for Catholic candidates elsewhere, they consciously elect anticler ical deputies and senators... They do not want clericalism, which is ecclesiastical authority in the matter of politics and commonly called \"the government of priests\". \"For a large number of Catholics, the fact that the priest, this troublesome man, interferes through the sermon's instructions and the confessional's prescriptions in the behaviour of the faithful, checking thoughts, sentiments, acts , food and drink, and even the intimacies of married life, is enough; they intend, at least, to limit his empire by preserving their independ ence as citizens\".(70) We would like to see this spirit of independence as lively today. But, even though the opinion of that \"large number of Catholics\" was such, the ultramontanes would no t disarm and pursue, at every opportunity, the fight against the hated regime. They thought for a white that they had found the \"providential man\" in the person of General Boulanger, minister for War in 1886, who, having organised his personal (69) and (70) Adrien Dansette, op.cit., II, pp.46, 47, 48."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"THE JESUITS AND THE DREYFUS AFFAIR 97 propaganda extremely well, looked like being a future dictator. \"A tacit agreement\", wrote M.

France has not been taken: she recovers... \"B oulangism\" is crushed at the polls on the 22nd of September and 6th of October 1889...\"(71) We can read, from the pen of the same historian, what the attitude of the pope of that time was regarding this adventurer; he was Leo XIII who, in 1878, had succeeded Pius IX, the pope of the Syllabus, an d who pretended to advise the faithful of France to join the republican regime: \"In August (1889), the German ambassador to the Vatican pretends that the pope sees in the general (Boulanger) the man who will overthrow the French Republic and re-establish the throne; we can read an article in which the \"Monitor of Rome\" envisages that the dictatorial candidate will take over power and that the Church \"could benefit greatly from it\"... General Boulanger sent one of his former officers to Rome with a letter for Leo XIII in which he promises the pope \"that on the day when he would hold in his hands the sword of France, he would do his uttermost to make the rights of the papacy acknowledged\".(72) Such was this Jesuit pontiff; the intransigent clerics objected to his supposed excess of \"liberalism\"! The boulangist crisis revealed well enough the action led by the religious party against the lay Republic, under the cover of nationalism. But the colourless nature of the principal char acter, as well as the resistance of a majority of the nation, had defeated the attempt in spite of all this forced agitation. Nevertheless, these chauvinistic tactics had proved quite effective, especially in Paris, and they were to be used again at another, and better, opportunity. This came about—or was it provoked?—and the disciples of Loyola were, of course, at the head of this movement. \"Their friends are here\", wrote M. Pierre Dominique, \"a bigoted nobility, a bourgeoisie which rejects Voltaire, and many military men. They will especially work on the army, and the result will be the famous alliance of \"the sword and the sprinkler of Holy water\". \"In 1890, it is not the king of France's conscience they rule any more, but the general-staff, or, at least, its chief; then, the \"Dreyfus Affair\" breaks (71) and (72) Adrien Dansette, op.cit., II, pp.114 ss."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"98 THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE JESUITS out, a real civil war which divides France into two\".(73) The Catholic historian, Adrien Dansette, sums up the beginning of the Affair as follows: \"On the 22nd of December 1894, the Captai n of artillery Alfred Dreyfus is proved guilty of treason, condemend to deportation for life imprisonment and cashier ing. Three months earlier, our Intelligence Service had discovered, at the German Embassy, a list of several documents to do with national defenc e; it established a resemblance between the writing of Captain Dreyfus and the one on that list Immediately, the general-staff cried out: \"It's him; it's the Jew\". They only had this presumption as the treason ha d no psychological explanation (Dreyfus had a good reputation, was ri ch and led an orderly life); the unfortunate man is neverthelsss im prisoned, condemned by a military tribunal after an inquiry so swift and partial that the judgement must have been preconceived. To make it worse, it will be learned later that a secret document was given to the judges, without the knowledge of the counsel for the accused... \"But there was more leakage at the ge neral-staff after Dreyfus' arrest and commandant Picquart, chief of the Intell igence Service after July 1895, learns of a certain project called \"petit bleu\" (express letters), between the German military attache and the French commandant (of Hungarian origin) Esterhazy; he is a disreputable man who has nothing but hatred and contempt for his country of adoption. But an officer in the Intelligence Service, Commandant Henry, adds to the Dr eyfus file,—as we shall see- a false document which would be crushing for the Jewish officer if it was genuine; he also erases and re-writes the name of Esterhazy on the \"petit bleu\" to give the impression that the document was faked. So Picquart is disgraced in November 1896\".(74) The disgrace of the chief of the Intellig ence Service is easy to understand: his zeal to dissipate the accumulated darkness was too excessive. The most trustworthy testimony is found in the \"Carnets de Schwartzkoppen\", published after his death, in 1930. It was from Esterhazy, and not Dreyfus, that the author, then first military attache at the German embassy in Paris, received secret documents of the French national defence. \"Already sometime before, in July, Pi cquart thought the time had come to warn by letter the chief of the general-st aff, who was then in Vichy, about his suspicions concerning Esterhazy. The first meeting was on the 5th of August 1896. General de Boisdeffre approved of everything Picquart had done so far concerning this affair and gave him the permission to carry on (73) Pierre Dominique, op.cit., p.239.

Este rhazy, whom I had dismissed, had tried, using his connections with the deputy Jules Roche, to be posted to the ministry for War. presumably to try to get in touch with me again, and had written several letters to the minister for War as well as to his aide-de- camp. One of his letters was given to Picquart who, for the first time, realised that his writing was the same as the one on the \"list\"! He showed a photo of that letter to Du Paty and Bertillon, without telling them, of course, who wrote it... Ber tillon said: \"Oh, that's the writing on the list!\"(75) \"Feeling his conviction of Dreyfus' cu lpability crumbling away, Picquart decided to consult the \"small file\" which had been given only to the Judges, The archivist Gribelin gave it to him. It was evening. Left alone in his office, Picquart opened Henry's unsealed envelope, on which was Henry's paraph written with a blue pencil... Great was his amazement when he realised the nullity of those pitiful documents, none of which could be applied to Dreyfus. For the first time, he knew that the condemned man on the \"Ile du Diable\" (Devils Island) was innocent. Th e following day, Picquart wrote a letter to General de Boisdeffre in which he exposed all the charges against Esterhazy and his recent discovery. When reading about that \"secret file\", the general jumped up, exclaiming: \"Why was it not burned as agreed?\"(76) Von Schwartzkoppen wrote further: \"My position became extremely uncomfortable. This question was before me: should I tell the whole truth and so repair the horrible mist ake and liberate that poor innocent man? If I had been able to act as I wanted to, I would certainly have done just that! Looking at these things in detail, I came to the conclusion that I shouldn't get i nvolved in that matter, for, as things were, nobody would have believed me; also, diplomatic considerations were standing in the way of such an action. Considering that the French government was able to take the necessary measures to clear the matter and make up for the injustice, I really made up my mind not to do anything\".(77) \"We can see coming to life the tactics of the general-staff, notes Adrien Dansette: \"If Esterhazy is guilty, the officers who provoked the illegal condemnation of Dreyfus, and most of all General Marcier, minister for War at that time, are guilty also.

It was to be so all th rough the Affair wh ich was then just beginning. Of course, we were then in an Anti-Semitic fever. The violent dissertations of Edouard Drumont, in the \"Libre Parole\", showed up every day the children of Israel as agents of national corruption and dissolution. The unfavourable prejudice so created incite d a large section of public opinion to believe, \"a priori\", in Dreyfus' guilt. But, later, when the innocence of the accused became evident, the mons trous argument of the \"infallib ility\" of the military tribunal was still upheld, and from now on with a perfect cynicism. Was it the Holy Spirit inspiring these judges in uniform who could not make any mistake? It would be tempting to believe in that celestial intervention—so similar to the one wh ich guarantees papal infallibility-when we read about Father du Lac, of the Company of Jesus, who had a lot to do with the Affair: \"He directed the college of the \"Rue des Postes\" where the Jesuits prepared the candidates for the larger Sc hools. He is a very intelligent man with important connections. He converted Drumont, is the confessor of de Mun and de Boisdeffre, chief of the Ar my's general-staff, whom he sees every day\".(79) The Abbe Brugerette also mentions the same facts quoted by Joseph Reinach: \"Is it not this Father du La c who converted Drumont and urged him to write \"The Jewish France\", who supplied the means to create the \"Libre Parole\"? Does not General de Boisdeffre see the famous Jesuit every day? The chief of the general-staff doesn't take any decision before consulting first his director\".(80) There, on Devil's Island, which deserves its name so well in that deadly climate, the victim of this atrocious plot was treated in an extremely cruel manner, as the Anti-Semitic press had spr ead the report that he had tried to escape. The minister for Colonies, Andre Lebon, gave orders accordingly. \"On the Sunday morning, the 6th of September, the head warder, Lebar, informed his prisoner that he would not, from then on, be allowed to walk in the part of the island which had been r eserved for him, and that he would be confined to his hut. In the evening, he was told that he would be chained at night. At the foot of his bed, made up of three planks, were rivetted two double iron shackles which encircle d the convict's feet.

What was lacking was the will to let it burst forth. The Abbe Brugerette himself testifies of the fact: \"The presumptions of innocence of the convict on Devil's Island multiply in vain; M. de Bulow's declarations at the Reichstag and those transmitted by M. de Munster, his ambassador, to the French government, a l s o state the innocence of Dreyfus in vain; an innocence procla imed also by Emperor Guillaume and confirmed when Schwarzkoppen (the German military attache) was recalled to Berlin as soon as Esterhazy was accused by Mathieu Dreyfus (brother of the convict). The general-staff remains opposed to any re- examination of the trial... Someone is bu sy covering up for Esterhazy. Secret documents are communicated to him for his defence, and even his writing is not allowed to be compared with that on the \"list\"... \"Shielded in that way, the villain Es terhazy is audacious enough to ask to appear before a Council of war. There, he is unanimously acquitted, on the 17th of January 1898, after a deliberation lasting three minutes\".(83) We must mention that, a few months later, when Colonel Henry was convicted of forgery, Esterhazy fled to England and, in the end, confessed that he was the author of the famous \"list\" attributed to Dreyfus. We cannot cite all the many happeni ngs in this drama, the forgeries added to more forgeries in an atte mpt to conceal an obvious truth, the dismissal of the chief of the general staff, the downfall of ministers, the suicide of Henry, detained at Mont Valerien, who slit his throat and so signed with his own blood the confession of his culpability. In December 1898, this semi-official note was published by the German press: \"The declarations of the imperial government have established that no German personality, high or low, had any kind of relations with Dreyfus. Then, from the German point of view, we see no inconvenience as to the unabridged publication of the secret file.(84) At last, the inevitable re-examina tion is decided by the High-Court. Dreyfus has to appear again before the council of war at Rennes, on the 3rd of June 1899, and it is the start of anot her torture for him. \"He could not suppose that he was to meet hatred more odious than when he left and that his former chiefs, conspiring to set him again on the road to Devil's Island, (81) Armand Charpentier, op.cit., p.75.

The illegality of this trial, the guilt of Esterhazy, the criminal manoeuvres of Henry will come out clearly during the twenty-nine sessions of that trial at Rennes. But the council of war... will judge Dreyfus on other spying charges which were never the cause of an accusation or report. All the pr evious leakages will be attributed to him and documents will be produced whic h had nothing to do with him... At last, and contrary to all our legal traditions, we will require that Dreyfus himself establish that such a document or paper was not handed over by him, as if it was not the task of the prosecution to prove the crime any more\".(86) The partiality of Dreyfus' accusers was so obvious that public opinion outside France was aroused. In Germ any, the semi-official \"Cologne Gazette\" published, on the 16th and 29th of August, in the middle of the trial, two articles in which we read the following phrase: \"If, after the declarations of the German government and the debate s of the highest court of appeal in France, someone still believes Dreyfus guilty, we can only answer that person that he must be mentally ill or he conscious wants an innocent to be condemned\".(87) But the hatred, nonsense and fanaticis m were not disarmed for all that Even new forgeries were used, replacing those which had lost all credit. To sum it all up, it was nothing more than sinister buffoonery. The end of it, for Dreyfus, was the condemnation to ten years' detention, with mitigating circumstances! \"This miserable trial provoked an i ndignant stupor all over the world France was despised. Who could have imagined such terrible sorrow?\"(88) exclaimed Clemenceau at the reading of English and German newspapers. Mercy was indispensable. Dreyfus accepted it to \"carry on\", said he, \"seeking the reversal of the awful military mistake of which he was the victim. \"For this reversal, it was no use counting on the justice of the Councils of war. This justice had been seen at work! It came, once again, from the highest court of appeal which, after thorough investigations and long debates, annulled once and for all the verdict of Rennes. A few days later, the Assembly and Senate, by a solemn vot e, reinstated Dreyfus in the army: Dreyfus, upon whom was conferred the Legion of Honour and who (85) See earlier on (86) and (89) Abbe Brugerette, op.cit., II, pp.469, 471, 472.

Their number grew more and more as truth came to light. After the swift acquittal of the traitor Esterhazy, by a Council of war in January 1898, Emile Zola published in the \"Aurore\", Clemenceau's publication, his famous open letter \"I accuse\". He wrote: \"I accuse the first Council of war to have violated the law by condemning an accused person on the gro unds of some document remaining secret, and I accuse the second Council of war to have covered up this illegality by committing also a judicial crime in knowingly acquitting a culprit\". But the \"knights\" of our famous Company were on the watch out to hush up anything which could have enlightened the public. A question from the Catholic deputy de Mun brought Zola before the Assize Court of the Seine, and the couragous writer was condemned to one year imprisonment, the maximum penalty, as a result of this iniquitous trial. Public opinion had been deceived so well by the outcries of the \"clerico- nationalists\" that the elections of May 1898 were in their favour. Nevertheless, the public revelation of forgeries, the dismissal of the chief of the general-staff, the evident criminal partiality of the judges opened the eyes of those sincerely seeking the truth more and more. But these came almost exclusively from the ranks of the Protestants, Jews and laymen. \"In France, the Catholics were few and far between, among whom few were prominent, who took sides with Dreyfus... The action of this handful of people made very little noise. The conspiracy of silence surrounded it ...\"(90) \"Most priests and bishops remain convinced of Dreyfus' culpability\", wrote the Abbe Brugerette. Georges Sorel declares also: \"While the Dreyfus affair brought division amongst all social groups, the Catholic world was absolutely united against a re-examination.\" Peguy himself admits that \"all the political forces of the Church have always been against Dreyfus\". Must we recall the lists of subscriptions open by the \"Libre Parole\" and \"La Croix\", in favour of the widow of the forger Henry who committed suicide? The names of the subscribing priests were often accompanied by \"comments not very evangelical\", as we are told by M. Adrien Dansette who quotes these: \"A certain Abbe Cros asks for a bedside mat made of Jewish s k i n w h i c h h e would be able to stamp on morning and evening; a young priest would like to crush Reinach's nose with his heel; three priests would love to slap the filthy face of the Jew Reinach\".(91) (89) See earlier on.

In the Congregations, things are more virulent: \"On the 15th of July 1898, prize-givi ng day at the College of Arcueil, presided over by Generalissimo Jamont (vice-president of the Superior Council of War), Father Didon, rector of the School Albert-le-Grand, gave a violent speech in which he advocated using violence against the men whose crime had been the couragous de nunciation of a military error... \"Must we\", said the eloquent monk, \"let the wicked go free? Certainly not! The enemy is: intellectualism pretending to despise force, and civilians wanting to subordinate the military.

These calls to bloody repressions, coming from gentle cler ics, especially during the German occupation! As for the cry of hatred against intellectualism, we can find the perfect echo to it in this declarati on from a certain general: \"When someone speaks of intelligence, I draw my revolver\". To crush the thought by force is a principle of the Roman Church which has never altered. The Abbe Brugerette wonders, however , about the fact that nothing disturbed the clergy's belief in the culpability of Dreyfus: \"Such a great and dramatic event, coming like a clap of thunder in a blue sky and bringing to light the Department for forgeries operating at the general-staff, must have opened the eyes, even of those not wanting to find the truth. We are referring to the discovery of forgeries made by Henry... \"Had not the time come for the Fr ench clergy and the Catholics to repudiate a mistake which had gone on fo r too long... They, the priests and the faithful could have gon e, en-masse, and at the eleventh hour like the workmen mentioned in the gospels, to increase the ranks of the defenders of justice and truth... But the most eviden t facts do not always shed their light on minds dominated by certain prejudi ces, as prejudices are opposed to examination and, by their nature, rebel against evidence\".(93) Anyway, what efforts are made to maintain Catholics in error! \"Could they guess that they were scandalously deceived by a press stubbornly keeping covered all the proofs of innocence, all the testimonies favourable to the convict of Devil's Island, and also dete rmined to impede the course of Justice by any means?\"(94) At the forefront of that press was \"L a Libre Parole\", created, as we have (92) Abbe Brugerette, op.cit., II, p.451.

A not very suspicious witness, Father Lecanuet, writes boldly: \"The Congregations and especially the Je suits are denounced by the Affair's historians. And, this time, we must admit that the Jesuits took the first shot with a very thoughtless temerity\".(95) \"The provincial Catholic newspapers, such as the \"Nouvelliste\" of Lyon, to informative and widely read, will nearly all take part in that dark plot against truth and justice. It seems that the watchword was passed around to stop light breaking through and to keep the public in the dark\".(96) In reality, one would need a peculiar blindness not to discern, behind the furor shown by the \"Croix\" in Paris and in the provinces, the \"watchword\" mentioned by the Abbe Brugerette. And one would also be very naive not to know the origin.(96a) M. Adrien Dansette says this also: \"It is the \"Assumptionist\" Order as a whole and with it the Church which are exposed by the campaign of \"La Croix\"... Father Bailly boasts that the 'Holy-Father' approved of him\".(97) In fact, there isn't any doubt concerning that approval! The Jesuits, to whom the \" Assumptionists\" lend their na me, are they not, since the Order was founded, the pope's political instruments? We have to smile at the story cleverly spread around—which is echoed by apol ogist historians—that Leo XIII had apparently \"advised moderation\" to th e directors of \"La Croix\". It is a classical trick, but still somewhat efficacious. Today, there are still some folk who believe in a kind of \"independence\" of the Holy-See's official voice! Let us see now what was published in Rome itself by the \"Civilta Cattolica\", the Jesuits' official publ ication, under the title \"Il caso Dreyfus\": \"The Jews' emancipation has been the re sult of the so-called principles of 1789, whose yoke weighs heavily on al l French people... The Jews hold the Republic in their hands, which is more Hebraic than French... The Jew has been created by God to be used as a spy wherever some treason is being prepared...

As we have just seen, \"harmony\" was also reigning when they were the confessors and counsellors of the ge neral-staffs chiefs. According to the Abbe Brugerette, Gene ral de Boisdeffre, penitent of the Jesuit Father du Lac, tasted the same bitterness as many others before him who were equally deceived by thes e \"directors of consciences\". The confessions of the forger Henry put him under an obligation to resign. \"Being a very honest man, he will himself proclaim that he was \"Scandalously deceived\", and those who knew him were aware that he felt very bitter about the \"plot\" of wh ich he had been the victim\".(99) And the Abbe Brugerette adds that he stopped \"all communications\" with his former confessor \"and even refu sed to see him again when dying\". After reading all this, written and published in the \"Civilta Cattolica\", it would be superfluous to dwell even deeper on the Order's culpability and we can only agree with what Joseph Reinach wrote then: \"You see, it is the Jesuits who contrived this dark affair. And, for them, Dreyfus is only a pretext. What they want, and they admit it, is to strangle the laity and a redirected French Revolution..., abolish foreign gods, the dogmas of 1789\". This is clear enough. But, as some still insist, against all evidence, that there was a possible disagreement between th e pope and his secret army, between the intentions of one and the actions of the other, it is easy to show the emptiness of such a supposition. The case of Bailly is very enlightening in that aspect. What can we read in \"La Croix\" of th e 29th of May 1956? Nothing less than this: \"As we have announced, His Eminence Cardinal Feltin ordered a r esearch into Father Bailly's writings; he was the founder of our publication and the \"Maison de la Bonne Press\". Here is the text of that ordinance dated 15th of May 1956: \"We, Maurice Feltin, by the grace of God and of the apostolic Holy-See, cardinal-priest of the Holy Roman Ch urch whose title is Holy-Mary-of- Peace, archbishop of Paris. \"In view of the plan submitted by th e Congregation of the Assumption's Augustinians and approved by us, to introduce in Rome the cause of God's servant Vincent-de-Paul Bailly, founder of \"La Croix\" and \"Bonne Press\". \"In view of the dispositions... and instructions of the Holy See regarding the act of beatification and resear ch into the writings of God's servants: \"We have ordered and order the following: \"Anyone who knew this servant of God or who can tell us something special about his life must let us know (99) Abbe Brugerette, op.cit., II, pp.435, 454."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"THE JESUITS AND THE DREYFUS AFFAIR 107 about it... \"Anyone who possesses writings of this servant of God must let us have them before the 30th of September 1956, be it printed books, handwritten notes, letters, memoranda... even in structions or advices not wr itten by him, but which he dictated... \"For all these communications, we designate Canon Dubois, secretary of our archbishopric, and promoter of faith for this cause\".(100) Here is a \"servant of God\" well on the way to receive the just reward for his loyal services in the form of a halo. And we dare say that, as far as his \"writings\" are concerned and which were so carefully searched for, the \"promoter of faith\" will have too much to choose from. As for the \"printed\" material, the collection of \"La Croix\", especially between 1895 and 1899, will supply the most edifying kind. \"Their attitude (of the Catholic newspapers), and especially the one of \"La Croix\", constitute at the moment for all \"enlightened and upright minds\", what M. Paul Violet, Catholic member of the Institute calls an \"indescribable scandal\"; and this scandal upholds, in th e Dreyfus Affair, the most shocking mistakes, the lying and crim e against truth, uprightness and justice. \"The Court of Rome\", he adds, \"knows it, as all the Courts of Europe do\".(101) Indeed, the Court of Rome knew better than anyone else! As we have seen, in 1956, she had not forgotten the pious exploits of this \"servant of God\" as she was preparing his beatification. No doubt, the promoter of faith credit ed our future \"saint\" with those famous lists of subscriptions in favour of the widow of the forger Henry, about which the Abbe Brugerette says: \"Today, when we consider those calls for the Inquisition to be brought back, for the persecution of the Jews, for the murder of Dreyfus' defenders, it is like listening to the delirious imaginations of wild and grotesque fanatics. Nevertheless, these are presented to us by \"La Croix\" as a great, comforting and cheering spectacle\".(102) All those pious wishes concerning the Jews, Father Bailly did not have the joy to see them realised, in his lifetime, by these wild fanatics, under the swastika. He could only take delight in that \"great, comforting and cheering spectacle\" from heaven, even thou gh, up there, spectacles of that sort are quite common, according to the \"learned\", and especially Saint Thomas d'Aquin, the Angel of the School: \"In order to help the saints enjoy their blessedness mo re, and increase their thanksgivings to God, they are allowed to contemplate in all its awfulness the torture of the godless... Th e saints will rejoice in the torments (100) \"La Croix\" of the 29th of May 1956. (101) Abbe Brugerette, op.cit., p.443.

As we can see, Father Bailly, Founder of \"La Croix\", had what it takes to make a saint: persecute the innocent, curse those who defend him, give them up to be murdered, uphold with all one's strength lying and iniquity, stir up discord and hatred; these are, to the eyes of the Roman Church, solid titles for glory, and we can understand her wish to bestow the halo on the author of these pious deeds. However, this question is asked, \"I s this 'servant of God' a wonder- worker also? Because we know that, to deserve such a promotion, one must have accomplished miracles well and truly checked.\" What were the miracles accomplished by the director-founder of \"La Croix\"? Was it the transmutation, for his readers, of black into white and white into black? To have presented a lie as the truth and the truth as a lie? Naturally, but a greater miracle was the fact that he persuaded members of the general-staff (and then the public) that, after having committed an initial mistake, and when this mistake was di scovered, it was in their \"honour\" to deny the evidence, transfor ming in that way the mistake into abuse of power! \"Errare humanum est, perseverare diabolicum\". The \"servant of God\" was not taking much notice of that proverb. Instead of letting it inspire him, he hid it under his cassock. In fact, the\"mea culpa\" is for the simple faithful and not the ecclesiastics, nor—as we have just seen— for the military chiefs who have Jesuit confessors. The result—searched for—was the exa ltation of partisan passions and the division of the French people. This is stated by the eminent historian Pierre Gaxotte: \"The Dreyfus Affair was the decisive turning point... judged by officers, it involved the military institution... The Affair grew, became a political conflict, divided families, cut France into two. It had the effects of a war of religion... It created hatred against the officers corps... It started anti-militarism\".(104) When we think of Europe at that time, Germany over-equiped with arms and surrounded by her two allies, when we recollect the Vatican's responsibility in the start of the 1914 conflict, we cannot believe that the diminution of strength in our military potential was not premeditated. How could we not notice that, in fact, the \"Dreyfus Affair\" started in 1894, the year of the Franco-Ru ssian alliance. Then, the spokesmen of the Vatican were very outspoken about the accord with a \"schismatic\" power which, to their eyes, was a scandal. Even today, a \"prelate of His Holiness\", Monseigneur Cristiani, dares write: \"Through politics strangely blind and ill considered, our country seemed to take pleasure in provoking war-like inclinations in her formidable (103) \"Somme theologique\", in Supple.

But they will, I am afraid, only overthrow themselves\".(107) In fact, when opinion was enlightene d, the reaction was fatal. Ranc had learned the lesson of the Affair when he exclaimed: \"The Republic will break the power of the Congregations, or she will be strangled\". In 1899, a ministry \"of republican defence\" was constituted; Father Picard, superior of the \"Assumptionists\", Father Bailly, director of \"La Croix\", and ten other members of that Order were brought to trial before the tribunal of the Seine for breach of the law on associa tions. The Congregation of the \"Assumptionists\" was dissolved. Waldek-Rousseau, president of the Council, declared in a speech pronounced at Toulouse on the 28th of October 1900: \"Dispersed, but not suppressed, the religious Orders fo rmed themselves again, bigger in numbers and more militant; they cover the territory with the network of a political organisation whose links are innumerable and tightly knit, as we have seen through a recent trial\".

The resistance of the clerics to the application of the law would be enough to show how necessary it was. This resistance will only strengthen the government's attitude, especially under minister Combes; and Rome's intransigence, especially when Pius I succeeded to Leo XIII, will bring ubout the law of 1904, abolishing the teaching Orders. After that, friction between the French government and the Holy See will be constant. Besides, the elec tion of the new pope was done in significant circumstances. \"Leo XIII died on the 20th of July 1903. The conclave, meeting to designate his successor, gives, after several ballots, 29 votes for Cardinal Rampolla,—42 are needed to be elect ed—, when the Austrian Cardinal Puzyna stands up and declares that His Apostolic Majesty the Emperor of Austria, king of Hungary, is inspired officially to excl ude the secretary of State to Leo XIII. We know that Cardinal Rampolla is pro-French\".(108) Cardinal Sarto is elected. Through the manoeuvre of Austria, which substituted itself for the Holy-Spirit to \"inspire\" the cardinals of the conclave, this election is a victory fo r the Jesuits. Indeed, the new pontiff, described as a mixture of \"village priest and archangel with a fiery sword\", is the perfect type of man wished for by the Order. This is what M. Adrien Dansette says about it: \"When we love the pope, we do not limit the field in which he can and must exercise his will\".(109) Or this from his first consistorial address: \"We know that we will shock many people when we declare that we will necessarily be involved in politics. But anyone wanting to judg e fairly can see that the Sovereign Pontiff, invested by God with a supreme authority, doesn't have the right to separate politics from the domain of faith and morals\".(110) So Pius X, as soon as he had acceeded to Saint- Peter's throne, publicly declared that, for him, the pope's authority must be felt in every domain, and that political clericalism is not only a right but a duty. He also chose for his secretary of State a Spanish prelate, Monseigneur Merry del Val who was thirty-eight years old and, like him, passionately pro-German and anti-French. This state of mind is not surprising when we read these words from the Abbe Fremont: (108) (109) and (110) Adrien Dansette, op.cit., pp.317, 318, 319."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"112 THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE JESUITS \"Merry del Val, whom I met at th e Roman College, was the \"Jesuits' favourite pupil\". ( 1 l l ) The relations between the Holy See and France soon felt the effects of that choice. First of all, it was the nomination of bishops by the civil power which brought about a conflict. \"Before the war of 1870, the Holy See learned the names of the new bishops only after they had been nominate d. The pope reserved the right, if one was not acceptable to him, to stop hi m being a bishop by withholding the canonical institution. In fact, the difficulties were enormous as the governments, under any kind of regime, were careful to elect candidates worthy of the episcopal office\".(112) As soon as Pius X was pope, most of the nominations for new bishops were refused by Rome. Besides, the nuncio in Paris, Lorenzelli, was, as we are told by M. Adrien Dansette, \"a theologian who has gone astray in diplomacy and madly hostile to France\". Some will say: \"Just another one added to all the others!\" But such a choice for such a post clearly shows what were the intentions of the Roman Curia towards our country. This systematic hostility was going to show itself even more clearly in 1904, when M. Loubet, president of the Republic, went to Rome to return the visit paid to him in Paris sometime before by the king of Italy, Victor-Emmanuel III. M. Loubet wished to be received by the pope also. But the Roman Curia produced a supposed \"invincible protoc ol\": \"The pope could not receive a head of state who, when visiting the king of Italy in Rome, seemed to acknoweldge as lawful the \"usurpation\" of that ancient pontifical State. But there were precedents: twice, in 1888 and 1903, a head of state—and not one of the less important—had been received in Rome by the king of Italy and the pope. Of course, this visitor was not the president of a Republic, but the German Emperor Guillaume II... The same honour had been given to Edward VII, King of England, and the Czar. The insulting intention of that refusal was evident, and even emphasised by a note sent to the various chancellories by the secretary of State Merry del Val. A Catholic author, M. Charles Ledre, recently wrote this concerning the matter: \"Could the pontifical diplomacy ignore the decisively important objective which, behind the visit of president Loubet to Rome, was really takingshape?\"(113) Of course, the Vatican knew about the plan to separate Italy from her partners of the Triple Alliance: Germany and Austria-Hungary, these two (111) Agnes Siegfried, op.cit., p.342.

This was the very crux of the matter, and was, in fact the reas on for the Vatican's frequent bursts of temper. Other conflicts arose concerning French bishops, considered in Rome to be too Republican. At last, tired of the constant difficulties arising from the Vatican's infringements of the terms of the Concordat, the French government put an end, on the 29th of July 1904, to \"relations which were made void by the Holy See\". The breaking of diplomatic: relati ons was bound to lead, soon after, to the separation of Church and state. \"We find it normal today\", wrote M. Adrien Dansette, \"that France should maintain displomatic relations with the Holy See, and that State and Church should live unde r the regime of separation. Diplomatic relations are necessary as France must be represented wherever she had interests to defend, outside any doctrinal consideration. But separation is necessary as, in a democracy founded on the sovereignty of a people divided by several beliefs, the state only owes liberty to the Church\".(l 14) And the author adds: \"This is, at least, the general opinion\". We can only agree with this reas onable opinion, without forgetting, of course, that the papacy would never endorse it. The Roman Church never stopped proclaiming her preeminence over civil history, throughout her own history, and, for want of being able to impose it openly in recent times, she has done her best to implant it with the help of her secret army, the Company of Jesus. Besides, it was at that time that Fath er Wernz, general of this Order, wrote: \"The State is under the Church's jurisdiction; so, secular authority is indeed under the subjection of ecclesiastical authorty and has to obey\".(U5) That is the doctrine of these intransigent champions of theocracy, counsellors as well as those who execute their commands, who made themselves indispensable at the Vatican, so much so that, today, it would he absolutely impossible to distinguish even the smallest difference hetween \"the black pope\" and \"the white pope\"; they are one and the same. And, when we refer to the politics of the Vatican, we simply mean the Jesuits' politics.

In spite of the advice from the French episcopate, he rejects all settlement, on the 10th of August 1906, in the encyclical letter \"Gravissimo\". This is another disappointment for the liberal Catholics: \"When I think\", exclaims Brunetiere, \"that what is refu sed to the French Catholics, with the certain knowledge that such refusal w ill unleash a religious war in our poor country which needs peace so much, is gr anted to the German Catholics, that the \"local associations\" have been operating there for thirty years to everyone's satisfaction, I cannot help, as a patriot as well as a Catholic, feeling most indignant\".(118) There was some trouble, in fact, when an inventory of ecclesiastical properties was taken, but not a religious war...

This is what we are told by the Catholic writer, Joseph Rovan, who also explains it: \"Bismark will be the first Protestant to receive the \"Order of Christ\" with jewels, one of the highest honours of the Church.

The \"Zentrum\" enters the war (of 1914) convinced of the uprightness, purity and moral integrity of its country's leaders, of the agreement of their plans and programme with the plans of eternal justice\".(121) As we can see, the papacy had done what was necessary to implant this conviction. Besides, as Mons eigneur Fruhwirth said in 1914: \"Germany is the base on which the Holy-Father can and must establish gtreat hopes\".

France had firmly decided not to stand alone opposite her 'formidable neighbour' and Austria-Hungary. Politics so \"bli nd and ill-considered\", according to Monseigneur Cristiani, were looked upon most unfavourably by the Catholic Holy of Holies. For, besides jeopardizing the \"thorough bleeding\" godless France needed, these politics were a priceless support for schismatic Russia, this lost sheep whose return to the Roman Catholic fold had never ceased to be hoped for, though its accomplishment might mean a war. But for the time being the Orthodox Church stayed firmly implanted in the Balkans, especially in Serbia, where th e treaty of Bucarest, ending the conflict of the Balkans, had made it a centre of attraction for the Slavs of the South and in particular for those under the yo ke of Austria. The ambitious plans of the Vatican and the apostolic imperialism of the Hapsburgs were then in perfect accord, as in the past. To Rome and Vienna, the growing power of Serbia marked her out as the enemy to overthrow. This is indeed established in a diplomatic document found in the Austrian- Hungarian archives; it reports, for th e benefit of the Au strian mi nister Berchtold, on the talks Prince Schonburg had at the Vatican in October- November 1913: \"Amongst the subjects discussed first of all with the cardinal secretary of State (Merry del Val) last week, th e question of Serbia came up, as anticipated. First of all, the cardinal expressed his joy at our firm and opportune attitude of recent months. During the audience I had that day with His Holiness, the Holy-Fathe r, who started the conversation by"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"THE FIRST WORLD WAR mentioning our energetic steps ta ken in Belgrade, he made some characteristic remarks: \"It would cert ainly have been better\", said his Holiness, \"if Austria-Hungary had punished the Serbians for all the wrongs they had done\".(l) So, the war-like sentiments of Pius X were clearly expressed in 1913 already. There is nothing surprising about this when we consider the inspirers of Roman politics. \"What were the Hapsburgs supposed to do? Chastise Serbia, an Orthodox nation. The prestige of Aust ria-Hungary, of these Hapsburgs who, with the Bourbons of Spain, were the last supporters of the Jesuits, and especially the prestige of the heir, Francois-Ferdinand, their man, would have been greatly increased. For Rome , the affair became one of almost religious importance; a victory of apostolic monarchy over Czarism could be considered as a victory of Rome over the schism of the East\".(2) However, the affair dragged on in 1913. But, on the 28th of June 1914, the archduke Francois-Ferdinand was murdered at Sarajevo. The Serbian government had nothing to do with this crime committed by a Macedonian student, but it was the perfect excuse for the emporer Francois-Joseph to start hostilities. \"Count Sforza maintains that the main problem was to persuade Francois-Joseph that war was necessary. The advice of the pope and his minister was the one which c ould best influence him\".(3) This advice was of course given to the emperor, and of the kind which could be expected from this pope and his minister, \"favourite pupil of the Jesuits\". While Serbia was trying to ma intain peace by giving in to all the wishes of the Austrian government which had sent a threatening note to Belgrade, Count Palffy, Austrian repres entative to the Vatican, gave to his minister Berchtold, on the 29th of July, a summary of the talks he had had on the 27th with the cardinal-secretary of State, Merry del Val; this conversation was about \"the questions which are disturbing Europe at the moment\". The diplomat scornfully denies the \"fanciful\" rumours about the supposed intervention of the pope who apparently \"implored the emperor to spare the Christian nations the horrors of war\". Having dealt with these \"absurd\" suppositions, he expounds the \"real opinion of the Curia\", as conveyed to him by the secretary of State: \"It would have been impossible to detect any spirit of indulgence and conciliation in the words of His Eminence. It is true that he described the note to Serbia as very harsh, but he nevert heless approved of it entirely and, at the same time and indirectly, expressed the wish that the Monarchy ( 1 ) \"Document\" P.A.

Indeed, added the cardinal, it was a pity that Serbia had not been humiliated much earlier, as it could have been done, then, without such great risks attached. This declaration echoes the wishes of the pope who, over the past few years, often expressed regret that Austria-Hungary had neglected 'chastising' her dange rous neighbour on the Danube\".(4) This indeed is just the opposite to the \"fanciful\" rumours about a pontifical intervention in favour of peace. In fact, the Austrian diplomat is not the only one who reports on the \"real opinion\" of the Roman pontiff and his minister. The day before, on the 26th of July , Baron Ritter, Bavarian Charge d'Affaires to the Vatican, had written to his government: \"The pope agrees with Austria dealin g severely with Serbia. He doesn't think much of the Russian and French ar mies and is of the opinion that they could not do very much in a war agai nst Germany. The cardinal-secretary of State doesn't see when Austria could make war if she does not decide now\".(5) So, the Holy See was fully conscious of the \"great risks\" represented by a conflict between Austria and Serbia, but, nevertheless, did all in its power to encourage it. The Holy-Father and his Jesuit counse llors were not concerned about the sufferings of \"Christian nations\"! It w as not the first time that these nations were used for the benefit of Roman politics. The opportunity wished for had come at last to use the Germanic secular arm against Orthodox Russia, \"godless\" France which needed a \"thorough bleeding\", and, as a bonus, against \"heretic\" England. Everything seemed to promise a \"lively and happy\" war. Pius X did not see its unfolding and result, both contrary to his forecasts. He died at the beginning of the conflict, on the 20th of August 1914. But. forty years later, Pius XII canonised this augu st pontiff, and the \"Precis d'Histoire Sainte\" (Summary of Holy History), used for parochial catechism, dedicated to him these edifying words: \"Pius X did all he could to prevent the start of the 1914 war and he died of anguish when he foresaw the sufferings it would unleash\". If this was satire, it could not be put in a better way! A few years before 1914, M. Yves Guyot, a true prophet, said: \"If war breaks out, listen, you men who think that the Roman Church is the symbol of order and peace, and do not search for blame outside of the (4) \"Veroffentlichungen der (Commission fur Neue re Geschichte Osterreichs\", 26 Wien- Leipzig 1930, pp.893, 894.

The military excursion, in France, which the Kaiser boasted he was going to make, was stopped at the Marne and the aggressor brought back to the defensive after every one of his furious attacks. But, at least, pontifical diplomacy brought him all the help possible, and this is not surprising when we consider that Divine Providence seemed to delight in favouring the central empires. Indeed, Cardinal Rampolla, considered to be pro-French—and for that reason kept away from the pontifical throne on a veto from Austria— wasn't any more amongst those who could become pope as he had died a few months before Pius X, a death it seems very opportune. But this was not the whole of \"God's\" intervention: As he had promised, even before voting took place, the new pope, Benedict XV appointed Cardinal Ferrata as secretary of State. But the cardinal(7) did not even have the time to take up fully his new position. Having entered the secretary's office at the end of September 1914, HE DIED SUDDENLY on the 20th of October, victim of a terrible indisposition after partaking of some \"LIGHT REFRESHMENTS\". \"He was sitting at his desk when he suddenly became violently sick. He fell as if lightning had struck him. The servants hastened to come to his help. The doctor, who had been called immediately, realised straightaway the gravity of the situation and aske d for a quick consultation. As for Ferrata, he had already understood and knew there was no hope... He pleaded that he should not be left to die at the Vatican... The medical consultation took place immediately at his hotel with six doctors... They refused to draw up a medical bulletin; the one published bore no signatures\".(8) He was not suffering fro m any kind of sickness or infirmity. \"The scandal of this death was such that an inquest could not be avoided. The result of it was: a jar had been broken at the office. The presence of pounded glass in the sugar bowl used by the cardinal was explained quite simply in that way. Granulated s ugar can be useful! The inquest was stopped there...\"(9) The Abbe Daniel adds that the sudden departure, a few days later, of the servant of the deceased cardinal provoke d quite a lot of remarks, especially as he had apparently been the servant of Monseigneur Von Gerlach before his master entered Holy Orders.

It is again the Abbe Brugerette who describes the \"entourage of the Holy See\": \"Professors or ecclesiastics, they are not put off by any obstacles in their pursuit of impressing on the Italian cl ergy and the Catholic world in Rome respect and admiration for the Germanic army, contempt and hatred for France\".(l 1) Ferrata, who favoured neutrality, had died just at the right time, and Cardinal Gasparri became secretary of State; in perfect agreement with Benedict XV, he did his best to serv e the interests of the central empires \"Considering all this, it is not surprising then that Pope Benedict XV, in the following months, worked hard to maintain Italy on the path of intervention which would best serve the Jesuits, friends of the Hapsburgs...\"(12) At the same time, the morale of the Allies was cunningly undermined. \"On the 10th of January 1915, a decree signed by Cardinal Gasparn, secretary of State to Benedict XV, orde red that a day of prayer should be observed to hasten peace... One of the compulsory exercises of piety was the reciting of a prayer written by Benedict XV himself... The French government ordered that the pontifical document shou ld be seized. This prayer for peace was considered to be a softening and destructive manifestation capable of slackening the efforts of our armies, at a time when the German hordes were feeling the irresistible pressure which would push them out of our territory, and when the Kaiser could see coming the terrible punishment his unpardonable crimes deserved... The pope, it was said, wanted p eace come what may, at a time when it could only be in favour of the central empires. The pope does not like France; he is \"German\".(13) M. Charles Ledre, another Cath olic writer, confirms: \"On two occasions, mentioned in some famous articles of \"La Revue de Paris\", the Holy See, by inviting Italy and later the United States to ke ep out of the war, did not merely wish for a quicker end of the conflict... According to the Abbe Brugerette, it served the interests of our enemies and worked against us\".(14) But the actions of the Jesu its, therefore the actions of the Vatican, were not only felt in Italy and the United States.

Nothing was considered too insignificant if it could help this great task, and bring about peace by provoking some weakness amongst the Allies. \"There was worse: Solicitations for a separate peace. Between the 2nd and the 10th of January 1916, some German Catholics went to Belgium to preach, in the name of the pope they said, a separate peace. The Belgian bishops accused them of lying, but the nuncio and the pope remained silent... \"Then, the Holy See thought of brin ging together France and Austria, so hoping to make France sign a separate peace or demand that, with her allies, they should negotiate a general peace... A few weeks later, on the 31st of March 1917, Prince Sixte of Bourbon gave the famous letter of the emperor Charlesto the president of the Republic. \"As the manoeuvre had failed on this side of the Alps, it was bound to be tried again elsewhere, in England, in America, and especially in Italy... \"Break up the temporal forces of the 'Entente' in order to stop its offensive attacks, ruin its moral pr estige with the view to weaken its courage and bring it to terms... these two things make up the politics of Benedict XV and all the efforts of his impartiality always have been and are still aimed at hamstringing us\".(15) This was written by a notorious Cathol ic, M.

Erzberger published in the \"Germania\" of the 22nd of April 1921, that the proposal of peace proclaimed by the Pope in August 1917 had been preceded by a secret accord between the Holy See and Germany\".(16) Another interesting point is that the ecclesiastical diplomat who negotiated this \"secret accord\" was the nuncio in Munich, Monseigneur Pacelli, future Pius XII. One of his apologists, the R.P. Jesuit Fernesolle, wrote: \"On the 28th of May (1917), Monseigneur Pacelli presente d his letters of a ppointment to the king of Bavaria... He tried hard to en list the co-operation of William II and the chancellor Bethmann-Holveg.

Yet, when the Allies signed the treaty of Versailles, in July 1919, they were so conscious of the part played by the Vatican in the conflict that it was carefully kept away from the co nference table. And, even more surprising, it was the most Catholic State, Italy, which had insisted on its exclusion. \"Through art. XV of the pact of London (26th of April 1915), which defined Italy's participation in the war, Baron Sonnino had obtained the promise from the other Allies that they would oppose any intervention of the papacy in the peace arrangements\". 18) This measure was wise but insufficient. Instead of applying the sanctions against the Holy See which it deserved for sparking off the first world war, the victors did nothing to prevent the further intrigues of the Jesuits and the Vatican; these eventually, 20 years later, led to a catastrophe even worse, maybe the worst the world has known.

Russia, instead of coming back to the Roman fold, had become marxist, anti-clerical and officially atheistic. As for invincible Germany, it foundered in the chaos. But the proud nature of the Company w ould never consider confessing a sin. When Benedict XV died, in 1922, it was ready to start again on a new basis. Is it not all-powerful in Rome? Let us listen to M. Pierre Dominique: \"The new pope Pius XI who is, according to some, a Jesuit, tries to patch things up. He asks the Jesuit Father d'Herbigny to go to Russia, in an attempt to rally whatever is left of Catholicism, and especially to see what could be done. Vague and big hope: to rally around the pontiff the persecuted Orthodox world. \"In Rome, there are thirty-nine eccles iastical colleges, whose foundation marks the dates of great counter-offensives; most of these counter- offensives were Jesuitical in their wo rking and direction: Germanic college (1552), English (1578), Irish (1628, re -established in 1826), Scottish (1600), North-American (1859), Canadian (1888), Ethiopian (1919, re-constituted in 1930). \"Pius XI creates the Russian college (Ponteficio collegio russo di S. Teresa del Bambino Gesu) and puts it under the Jesuits' care. They also look after the Oriental Institute, the Institute of Saint-John Damascene, the Polish college, and later the Lithuanian college. Are these reminders of Father Possevino, Ivan the Terrible and the false Dimitri? The second of the three great objectives during Ignatius' time takes first place.

The famous \"Russicum\" is created and its clandestine missionaries will take the Good News to this schismatic co untry.(19a) One century a f t e r their explusion by Czar Alexander the First, the Jesuits will again undertake the conquest of the Slav world. Since 1915, their general is Nalke von Ledochowski. From M. Pierre Dominique again: \"Some will say that I see Jesuits everywhere! But I am compelled to point out their presence and actions; to say that they were behind the monarchy of Alphonso XIII whose confessor was Father Lopez; that, when the Spanish monarchy was ended and their monasteries and colleges burned down, they were found again behind Gil Robles, then, when civil war broke out, behind Franco. In Portugal, they uphold Salazar. In Austria and Hungary, the Emperor Charles who was dethroned three times; (what part did they play in those attempts to regain the throne of Hungary? Who knows!) They kept the seat warm not knowing much for whom or what. Monsignor Seipel, Dolfuss and Schussnigg are from their ranks. They dream for a wh ile of a great Germany, with a Catholic majority, to which the Austrians would necessarily belong: a modern version of the old 16th century alliance between the Wittelsbach and Hapsburg. In Italy, they support first of all Don Sturzo, founder of the popular party, then Mussolini... The Jesuit Father Tacchi Venturi, general-secretary of the Company, served as the middleman between Pius XI, whose confessors are Fathers Alissiardi and Celebrano (Jesuits), and Mussolini. \"The pope, in February 1929, at the time of the treaty of Lateran, calls Mussolini \"the man whom Providence allowed us to meet\". Rome does not condemn what is commonly called the \"Ethiopian aggression\" and, in 1940, the Vatican is still Mussolini's sincere friend. \"The Jesuits have their secret abode in it. From there, they survey the Universal Church with the cold and calculating eye of the politician\".(20) This is a perfect summary of the Jesuit activity between the two world wars. The \"secret abode\" of Loyola's sons is the political brain of the Vatican. The confessors of Pius XI are Jesuits; those of his successor, Pius XII, will also be Jesuits and Germans for good measure. No matter if, because of it, the plot becomes evident: everything, it seems, is ready for revenge. (19) and (20) Pierre Dominique, op.cit., pp.253, 254.

Italy will be the first field of action. There is, there, a noisy socialist chief who gathers ex- servicemen around him. This man proclaim s an apparently intrasigent doctrine, but he is ambitious and lucid enough to realise how precarious his pos ition is, in spite of his extravagent boastings. Jesuit diplomacy will soon win him over to its side. M. Francois Char les-Roux, of the Institute, who was our (i.e. French) ambassador to the Vatican at that time, says: \"At the time when the future Duce was only a simple deputy, Cardinal Gasparri, secretary of State, had a secret interview with him... The fascist chief had immediately agreed that the pope should exercise a temporal sovereignty over a part of Rome... \"When reporting to me about that interview, Cardinal Gasparri concluded: \"With this promise, I was sure that, if this man came to power, we would succeed\". \" \"I will not mention his account of the negotiations between the secret agents of Pius XI and Mussolini...\"(21) These secret agents, the main one be ing the Jesuit Father Tacchi Venturi, fullfilled their mission extremely well. This is not surprising when we know that Father Tacchi Venturi was secr etary of the Company of Jesus and Mussolini's confessor at the same time . In fact, he was \"directed\" into this \"cajolery\" of the Fascist chief by the general of his Order, Halke von Ledochowski, as we are told by M.

The Catholic \"Zentrum\" of Monsignor Kass assured, by its massive vote, the dictatorship of Nazism. In fact, Italy had been, in 1922, the trial ground for the new formula of authoritarian conservatism: fascism, dressed up, when local circumstances demanded it, with some pseudo-socialism.

This memorial thirty-three meters high bears the inscription \"Mussolini- Dux\" and is decorated with mosaics and inscriptions praising fascism. The phrase \"Long live the Duce\" is repeated more than one hundred times and the slogan \"Many enemies means much honour\" several times as well. The monument has, on either side, marble blocks commemorating the main events of fascism, from the foundation of the publication \"Popolo d'ltalia\", by Mussolini, until the establishment of the short-lived fascist empire, and including the war in Ethiopia. The obelisk was to be crowned with a gigantic statue of Mussolini, as a naked athlete, nearly one hundred metcrs high. But the regime collapsed before this strange project could be realised. \"After a year of controversy, the Segni government has just decided that the duce's obelisk should stay\".(24) The war, the blood which flowed profusely, the tears and the ruins do not matter. They are mere trifles, small spots on the monument erected to t h e glory of \"the man whom Providence allowed us to meet\", as he was described by Pius XI. No shortcomings, mistakes or crimes can erase his main merit: the fact that he re-established the temporal power of the pope, proclaimed Roman Catholicism as the religion of the State, and gave the clergy, through laws s till being enforced, complete power over the life of the nation. It is to testify to this that Mussolini's obelisk must stand in the heart of Rome, for the benefit of foreign tourists looking at it admiringly or ironically, and in the hope of better times which would allow the erection of the \"naked athlete\" one hundred meters high, symbolic champion of the Vatican. The Lateran Treaty, by which Mussolini showed his gratitude to the papacy, gave the Holy See, apart from the payment of one thousand 750 million liras (i.e. £20,000,000) the tempor al sovereignty over the territory of Vatican city.

There, the star of the future German dictator starts to rise; he is also a Catholic, like his most important associates. Of that country, cradle of nazism, M. Maurice Laporte tells us: \"Its two enemies ar e called Protestantism and Democracy\". Prussia's anxiety is therefore understandable. \"It is easy to guess what kind of sp ecial care the Vatican gives Bavaria where Hitler's National-Socialism recruits its strongest contingents\".(28) To take from \"heretic\" Prussia the control of the German \"secular arm\" and transfer it to Catholic Bavaria; what a dream!

M. Francois Charles-Roux writes: \"During the contemporary epoch world politics never felt the Catholic intervention more than during the ministry of Monseigneur Pacelli\".(30) And from M. Joseph Rovan: \"Now, Ca tholic Bavaria... is going to welcome and protect all those who sow trouble, all those confederates and assassins of de la Saint-Vehme\".(31) From amongst these agitators, the choice of Germany's \"regenerators\" will fall upon Hitler, who is destin ed to triumph over the \"democratic mistakes\" under the Holy Father's standard. Of course, he is a Catholic, like his principal collaborators. \"The nazi regime is like a return to the government of southern Germany. The names and origins of its chiefs demonstrate it: Hitler is specifically Austrian, Goering is Bava rian, Goebbels is Rhenish, and so on\".(32) In 1924, the Holy See signs a Concordat with Bavaria. In 1927, we can read in \"Cologne's Gazette\": \"Pius XI is certainly the most German pope who ever sat on the throne of Saint-Peter\". His successor, Pius XII, will rob him of this palm. But, for the time being, he pursues his diplomatic career—rather his political career—in this Germany for which, as he later told Ribbentr op, \"he would always have a special affection\".

With many other bishops, he tried to warn the faithful against \"the pagan ideal of the nazis\". Obvi ously, this prelate had not understood papal politics, but he was soon going to be taught. \"The \"Mercure de France\" ga ve an excellent study in 1934: \"In the beginning of 1932, German Catholics did not consider they had lost the cause but, in the spring, their chiefs seemed somewhat irresolute: they had been told that \"the Pope was personally in favour of Hitler\". \"That Pius XI was sympathetic to Hitler should not surprise us... For him, Europe could settle down again only through Germany's hegemony... The Vatican had thought of changing the centre of gravity of the Reich, through the Anschluss, for a long ti me, and the Company of Jesus was openly working towards that aim (Led ochowski's plan), especially in Austria. We know how Pius XI depended on Austria to make what he called his politics triumph. What had to be prevented was the hegemony of Protestant Prussia and, as the Reic h was the one to dominate Europe... a Reich had to be rebuilt where the Catholics would be masters... \"In March 1933, the German bishops, meeting at Fulda, took advantage of the speech Hitler gave at Potsdam to declare: We must admit that the highest representative of the government of the Reich, who is at the same lime the head of the national-socialist movement, has made public and solemn declarations, by which the inviolability of the Catholic doctrine, the work and unchangeable rights of the Church are recognised... \"Von Papen leaves for Rome. This man, whose past is so wicked, becomes a pious pilgrim with the mission to conclude a Concordat (for the whole of Germany) with the Pope. He too will have to emulate Mussolini's overtures towards the Vatican.(34) In fact, the same happens in both countries: in Italy, the Catholic party of don Sturzo ensures Mussolini's accessi on to power; in Germany, the \"Zentrum\" of Monseigneur Kaas does the same for Hitler—and, on both occasions, a Concordat seals the pact. M. Joseph Rovan admits this as follows: \"Thanks to von Papen, deputy at the Zentrum since 1920 and owner of the party's official publication (33) Walter Gorlitz and Herbert A.

Alr eady during that year (1933), apart from the massacre of Jews and assassinations perpetrated by the Nazis. there were 45 concentration camps in Germany, with 40,000 prisoners of various political opinions, but mostly liberals. Franz von Papen, the pope's secret chamberlain, defined perfectly the d eep meaning of the pact between the Vatican and Hitler by this phrase wort h engraving: \"Nazism is a Christian reaction against the spirit of 1789\". In 1937, Pius XI, under the pressure of world opinion, \"condemned\" the racial theories as incompatible with Ca tholic doctrine and principles, in what his apologists amusingly call the \"terrible\" encyclical letter \"Mit brennender Sorge\". Nazi racism is condemne d, but not Hitler, its promoter: \"Distinguio\". And the Vatican takes care not to denounce the \"advanta gous\" Concordat concluded, four years earlier, with the nazi Reich. While the cross of Christ and the Swastika were co-operating in Germany. Benito Mussolini set forth on th e easy conquest of Ethiopia, with the Holy Father's blessing. \"...

Camille Cianfarra: \"The Italian occupation of Albania was very advantagous for the Church... Out of a population of one million Al banian people, which became Italian subjects, 68% were Moslems, 20% Gr eek Orthodox and only 12% Roman Catholics... From the political point of view, the annexation of the country by a Catholic power was bound to improve the position of the Church and please the Vatican\".(40) In Spain, the establishment of the republic had not ceased to be resented by the Roman Curia as a personal offence. \"I never dared mention the Spanish question to Pius XI\", wrote M. Francois Charles-Roux. \"He probably would have reminded me that the Church's interests, in that great and historical land of Spain, were a matter for the papacy only\".(41) So, this \"protected hunting-ground\" was soon provided with a dictator simi l a r to those who had been alread y successful in Italy and Germany. The adventure of General Franco only started in mid-July 1936 but, on the 21st of March 1934, the \"Pact of Rome\" had been sealed, between Mussolini and the chiefs of Spain's reactionary parties, one of whom was M. Goicoechea, chief of the \"Renovacion Es panola\". By this pact, the Italian fascist party undertook to supply the rebe ls with money, war material, arms and ammunition. We know that they even did more than what they had promised, and that Mussolini and Hitl er kept on \"refuelling\" the Spanish rebellion with material, aviation and \"volunteers\". As for the Vatican, oblivious of its ow n principle that the faithful must respect the established government, it oppressed Spain with its threats. \"The Pope excommunicated the he ads of the Spanish Republic and declared spiritual war between th e Holy See and Madrid. Then he produced the encyclical le tter 'Dilectissim i Nobis'...

Belgium was also looked after by Ca tholic Action, needless to say, an organisation eminently ultramontane and Jesuitical. The ground had to be prepared for the approaching invasion of the Fuhrer's armies! So, under the pretence of \"spiritual renewal\", the Hitlerite Fascist gospel was d iligently preached there by Monseigneur Picard, Jesuit, Father Arendt. Jesuit, Father Foucart, Jesuit, etc. A young Belgium, who was their victim like many others, testifies to this: \"At that time, all of us were already obsessed with a kind of fascism... The Catholic Action to which I belonged was very sympathetic to Italian fascism... Monseigneur Picard pr oclaimed from the rooftops that Mussolini was a genius and wished fervently for a dictator... Pilgrimages were organised to favour contacts with Ital y and Fascism. \"When, with three hundred students, I went to Italy, everybody, on our return home, saluted in the Roman fashion and sang Giovinezza.(43) Another witness says: \"After 1928, the group of Leon De grelle regularly collaborated with Monseigneur Picard... Monseigneur Picard enlisted the help of Leon Degrelle for a particularly important mission: to manage a new publishing house at the Catholic Action centre. This publishing house was given a name which soon became famous: it was 'Rex'... \"The calls for a new regime multiplied... The results of this propaganda in Germany were observed with much interest. In October 1933, an article in 'Vlan' reminded us that the Nazis numbered only seven in 1919, and that Hitler brought them, a few years later, no other dowry than his talent for publicity... Founded on similar principles, the 'rexist' team started an active propaganda programme in the country. Their meetings soon attracted a few hundreds, then thousands of listeners\".(44) Of course, Hitler had brought to the new-born national-socialism, as Mussolini did to Fascism, more than th e talent for publicity:- the support of the papacy! Being only a pale shadow of these two, Leon Degrelle, chief of \"Christus Rex\", was the beneficiary of the same support—but for a very different purpose, as his job was to open his country to the invader. M. Raymond de Becker says: \"I collaborated with the 'Avant-Garde'... This publication (issued by Monseigneur Picard) aimed at breaking the ties (43) and (45) Raymond de Becker: \"Livre des viva nts et des morts\" (Ed. de la Toison d'Or Brussels 1942, pp.72,73,175).

Maybe we remember also that the apostle of \"Christus Rex\", donn ing the German uniform, went, accompanied by much publicity, to \"fig ht on the Eastern front\" at the head of his \"Waffen SS\", recruited main ly amongst the youth of Catholic Action; then an opportune retreat enab led him to reach Spain. But, before that , he gave full vent to his \"patriotic\" feelings for the last time. M. Maurice de Behaut writes: \"Ten years ago (in 1944), the port of Anvers, the third most important in the world, fell almost intact into the hands of the British troops... At the time when the population was beginning to see the end of its sufferi ngs and privations, the most diabolic nazi invention fell on it: the flying bombs, V1 and V2. This bombardment, the longest in History, as it went on for six months, day and night, was kept carefully hidden, on the order of the alli ed headquarters. This is the reason why, today, the martyrdom of the cities of Anvers and Liege is still generally ignored. \"On the eve of the first bombardment (12th of October), some had heard on Radio Berlin the alarming remarks of the \"rexist\" traitor Leon Degrelle: \"I asked my Fuhrer\", he screeched, \"for twenty thousand flying bombs. They will chastise an idiotic people. I promise you that they will make of Anvers a city without a port, or a port without a city\". \"... From that day on, the rhythm of the bombardments was going to accentuate, catastrophes a nd disasters being the re sults, while the traitor Leon Degrelle was bawling on Radio Berlin, promising cataclysms even more terrible\".(46) Such was the last farewell to his ho meland of this monstrous product of the Catholic Action. Obedient pupil of Monseigneur Picard, Jesuit, Father Arendt, Jesuit, etc., the chief of \"Christus Rex\" strictly followed the papal rules. \"The men of the Catholic Action\", wrot e Pius XI, \"would fail in their duty if, as opportunities allow it, they did not try to direct the politics of their province and of their country\".(47) Indeed, Leon Degrelle did his duty and the result—as we have seen— was in proportion to his zeal. We read in M. Raymond de Beckers's book: \"The Catholic Action had found, in Belgium, exceptional men to orchistrate its themes, such as Monsignor Picard (the most important )...

So, these two leaders of the Belgian Catholic Action, both working under the crook of Cardinal Van Roey, had apparently never met! By what mi racle? Of course, the former Canon doesn't tell us that; since then, he has been made \"Monseigneur\" by Pius XII and director of the 'jocist' movements for the whole world. Another miracle: nor has Mons eigneur Cardijn ever met the disreputable chief of 'Rex' during the great congress described by Degrelle: \"I remember the great congress of the Catholic Youth at Brussels, in 1930. I was behind Monseigneur Picard, who himself was at the side of Cardinal Van Roey. One hundred thousand youths had marched past us for two hours, cheering the religious authorities assembled on the platform...\"(49) Where, then, was the h ead of the J.O.C. hiding, whose troops were taking part in that gigantic march p ast? Was it, through a special decree of Providence, that these two men were condemned to rub shoulders without seeing each other, on official platforms as well as at the Catholic Action centre which they attended constantly? Monseigneur Cardijn, a Jesuit, goes furt her. He pretends to have also \"verbally\" fought 'rexism'. Really, this Catholic Action was a peculiar organisation! Not only were the chiefs of its two principal \"movements\" 'J.O.C. and Rex' playing hide and seek in the corridors, but also one coul d as he says, \"fight\" what t h e other did with the full approval of the \"hierarchy\"! This fact cannot be disputed: Degrelle was put at the head of 'Rex' by Monseigneur Picard himself, under the authority of Cardinal Van Roey and the apostolic nuncio Monsei gneur Micara. So, according to Monseigneur Cardijn, he keenly disapproved of the actions of his colleague in Catholic Action, under the patron age, like himself, of Belgium's Primate,—and without any consideratio n for the Nuncio, his \"protector and revered friend\", according to Pius XII\".(50) The assertion is rather severe. We are even more aware of it when we examine what was the attitude, after Hitler's invasion of Belgium, of those such as Monseigneur Cardijn and hi s associates who, today, repudiate Degrelle and 'rexism'. In a book which was \"put under the bushel\" when it was published, the chief of 'Rex' himself refreshed memories, as we shall see, and, to our knowledge, what he said was never refuted.

Also in these memoirs which fell—or rather were thrown into the oubliette—we find some very interesting details concerning the \"Boerenbond, the great Catholic and political and financial machine of Cardinal Van Roey which largely financed the Flemish section of Louvain's University...\"(52) \"The printing-house \"Standaard\" was ma king sure its presses were kept working by printing the most collaborationist appeals of the V.N.V.

Gaston Gaillard: \"The Flemish-speaking Catholics and the autonomist Catholics of Alsace justified their attitude by thei r tacit support always given to the Germanic propaganda by the Holy See. When they referred to the memorable letter sent by Pius XI to his secretary of State, Cardinal Gaspari, on the 26th of June 1923, they were easily convinced that their politics had the approval of Rome, and, of course, Rome did nothing to persuade them otherwise.

It also confirmed once again the \"tacit support\" always given to the Germanic expansion by the Holy See, and himself in particular. Today, we can but scornfully smile when we see the Jesuits of His Holiness quibble over something so obvious and repudiate all complicity with the fifth column they themselves had organised, and especially with Degrelle. As for him— safely kept in his refuge as he knows too much—he can recollect at leisure the famous vers es of Ovid: \"Donee eris felix, multos munerabis amicos. Tempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris\".(55) We smile when we read the following from R.P. Fessard (Jesuit): \"In 1916 and 1917, we waited for the American reinforcements with so much impatience! In 1939, we sadly realised that, even after war had been declared, Hitler was looked upon favourably by a large part of American opinion; even, and especially by Catholics! In 1941 and 1942, we wondered again if the United States would or would not intervene\".(56) So, it seems the Good Father viewed the results obtained in America by his own Jesuitical brothers \"With sadness\"! For, and this is an historical fact, the \"Christian Front\", a Catholic movement opposed to the United State's intervention, was directed by the Jesuit Father Coughlin, a notorious pro- Hitlerite. \"This pious organisation lacked nothing and received, from Berlin, a plentiful supply of propaganda material prepared by Goebbel's office. \"Through is publication 'Social Justice' and radio broadcasts, the Jesuit Father Coughlin, apostle of the swastik a, reached a vast public. He also looked after secret \"commando cells\" in the main urban centres, led according to the sons of Loyola's methods and trained by Nazi agents\".(57) A secret document of the Wilhelmstrasse clarifies the following point: \"Studying the evolution of anti-semitism in the United States, we note t h a t t he number of listeners to the radio broadcasts of Father Coughlin, w e l l - known for his anti-semitism, exceeds 20 millions\".(58) (54) Gaston Gaillard: \"La fin d'un temps\" (Ed.

(62) Not surprisingly, it was the secret ch amberlain who led the whole affair which ended, on the 11th of March 1938, with the resignation of the pious Schussnigg (pupil of the Jesuits), in fa vour of Seyss-Inquart, chief of the Austrian Nazis. The following day, the German troops entered Austria and the puppet government of Seyss-Inquart proclaimed the union of the country to the Reich. This event was welcomed by an enthusiastic declaration of Vienna's archbishop: Cardinal Innitzer (Jesuit). \"On the 15th of March, the Germ an press published the following declaration from Cardinal Innitzer: \"The priests and the faithful must unhesitatingly uphold the great German state, and the Fuhrer whose struggle to set up Germany's power, honour and prosperity is in accord (62) G.E.R.

Then, the 'Mercure de France' justifiably observed: \"... These bishops have not taken a decision which involves the Church as a whole on their own accord; the Holy See gave th em directives which they merely followed\".(65) This is obvious.

The Vatican's licensed thurifers keep on reminding their readers that Pius XII \"protested\" against the aggr ession in the encyclical letter \"Summi Pontificatus\". In reality, this ludicrous document, like all other such documents, which numbers no less th an 45 pages, contains only one phrase, at the end, concerning Poland crushed by Hitler. And this short allusion is an advice to the Polish people to pray much to the Virgin Mary! The contrast is striking between tho se few words of trite condolences and the nattering pages devoted to fascis t Italy and the exaltation of the Lateran Treaty; this treaty was concluded by the Holy See and Muss'olini, Hitl e r ' s collaborator who, at the time when the pope was writing his encyclical letter, delivered a scandalous speech, as a challenge to the world, and started it with these words: \"Liquidata la Polonia!\" But what risks are there in using these derisory alibis, wh en preaching to the converted? Besides, how many of them would be anxious to examine such references? Nevertheless, when we study the Vatican's behaviour in this affair, what do we see? First of all, we see the nuncio in Warsaw, Monseigneur Cortesi, urge the Polish government to give in to Hitler in everything: Dantzig, the \"corridor\", the territories where German minorities li ve (68). Then, when this is done, we see also the Holy-Father lend his help to the aggressor when trying to make Paris and London ratify the amputati on of a large part of his \"dear Poland\".(69) To those who would be surprised at such behaviour towards a Catholic country, we will quote a famous precedent: after the first division of Poland in 1772, a catastrophe in which the Jesuits' intrigues played a large part, Pope Clement XIV, when writing to the Empress of Austria, Marie-Therese, expressed his satisfaction as follows: \"The invasion and division of Poland were not done for political reasons only; it was in the interests of religion, and necessary to the spiritual profit of the Chruch, that the Court of Vie nnna should extend its domination over Poland as much as possible\". Obviously, there is nothing new un der the sun—especially at the Vatican. In 1939, there was no need to change one single word in that cynical declaration, apart from \"the spir itual profit of the Church\" which, this time, consisted of several million Polish Catholics joining the Great Reich.

In Czechoslovakia, the Vatican did even better: it provided Hitler with one of its own prelates, a secret chamberlain, to be made into the head of this satellite state of the Reich. \"The Anschluss had made a great noise in Europe. From now on, the hitlerian threat was hovering over the Republic of Czechoslovakia and war was in the air. But, at the Va tican, nobody seemed concerned. Let us listen to M. Francois Charles-Roux: \"In the middle of August, I had tried to persuade the pope that he should speak in favour of peace—a just peace, of course... My first attempts were unsuccessful. But, from the beginning of September 1938 on, when the international crisis reached its worst leve l, I started gathering, at the Vatican, soothing impressions contra sting strangely with th e rapidly deteriorating situation.\".(70) \"All my attempts\", adds the former French ambassador, \"received the same answer from Pius XI: \"It would be useless, unnecessary, inopportune\". I could not understand his obstinacy in keeping silent\". (71) Events were soon going to explain th is silence. It was first of all the annexation of Sudetenland by the Reich, with the support of the Christian Social Party, of course; this annexation was ratified by the Munich accord, and the Republic of Czechoslovakia was divided. But Hitler, who had undertaken to respect its territorial integrity, intended in reality to annexe the Czech countries independent of Slovakia, and reign over it as well by his own appointee. It was easy for him to attain these ends as most of the main political Slovakian chiefs were Catholic ecclesiastics, according to Walter Hagen (72), and, amongst these, the priest Hlinka (Jesuit), had at his dosposal a \"guard\" trained on nazi S.A. principles. We know that, according to canon law, no priest can accept a public post or a political mandate without the Holy See's consent. This is confirmed and explained by th e R.P. Jesuit de Soras: \"How could it be otherwise? We have said so already: a priest, by virtue of the 'character' his ordination marked him with, by virtue of the official functions he exercises within the Church itself, by virtue of the cassock he wears, is bound to act as a Catholic, at least when a public acti on is concerned.

As anticipated, on the 15th of Marc h 1939, Hitler annexed the rest of Bohemia and Moravia, and put the Re public of Slovakia, which he had created with a stroke of his pen, \" under his protection\". At the head, he placed Monseigneur Tiso (Jesuit), \"who dreamed of combining Catholicism and Nazism\". A noble amb ition, and easily realised as it had already been proved by the Germ an and Austrian episcopates. \"Catholicism and Nazism\", proclaimed Monseigneur Tiso, \"have much in common; they work hand in hand at reforming the world\".(74) Such must have been also the Vatican's opinion as—in spite of the \"terrible\" encyclical letter \"Mit Brennender Sorge\"—it did not haggle over its approval of the gauleiter priest. \"In June 1940, Radio Vatican announced: \"The declaration of Monseigneur Tiso, chief of the Slovakian state, stating his intention to build up Slovakia according to a Christian pl an, has the full approval of the Holy See\".(75) \"Tiso's regime, in Slovakia, was espe cially afflicting for the Protestant Church of that country, which comp rised one fifth of the population. Monseigneur Tiso tried to reduce the Protestant influence to its minimum, and even eliminate it... Influential members of the Protestant Church were sent to concentration camps\".(76) These could count themselves fortunate, as we consider this declaration from the Jesuits' general Wernz, a Prussian (1906-1915): \"The Church can condemn heretics to death as any ri ghts they have is because of our forbearance\". Let us see now what kind of apostolic gentleness was used by the gauleiter prelate Tiso towards the Jews : \"In 1941, the first contingent of Jews from Slovakia and upper-Silesia arrive at Auschwitz; from the start, those who were not able to work are sent to the gas chamber, in a room of the building containing the crematory furnaces\".(77) Who wrote this? A witness who could not be challenged, Lord Russell of Liverpool, a judicial counsellor at the trials of war criminals. So, the Holy See had not \"lent\" one of its prelates to Hitler in vain. The Jesuit head of state was doing a goo d job and the satisfaction expressed by Radio Vatican is understandable.

The love for our fellow-men and the love for our country have developed into a fruitful fight against the enemies of nazism\".(78) Another high dignitary of the Roman Church, in a neighbouring country, could have appropriated this declaration of Monseigneur Tiso to himself. For, if the foundations of the Slovakian \"City of God\" were hatred and persecution, according to the steadfast tradition of the Church, what can be said of the eminently Catholic state of Croatia, offspring of the collaboration between the killer Pavelitch and Monseigneur Stepinac, and with the assistance of the pontifical legate Marcone! We would have to look back as far as the conquest of the New World, couple the actions of the adventurers of Cortes and the no less ferocious converter monks to find something worth comparing with the atrocities of those Oustachis\", upheld, commanded and prompted by madly fanatical clerics. What these \"Assassins in the Name of God\", as they were so rightly nicknamed by M. Herve Lauriere, did over four years defies all imagination, and the annals of the Roman Church, even though so rich in such material, cannot produce the equivalent in Europe. Do we need to add that the crony of the blood-thirsty Ante Pavelitch was Monseigneur Stepinac, another Jesuit? The Croatian terrorist organisation of the \"Oustachis\", led by Pavelitch, had come to the notice of the French people through the assassination, in Marseille, of King Alexander the First of Yugoslavia and our Foreign- Affairs' minister, Louis Barthou, in 1934. \"As Mussolini's government was obviously mixed up in the crime\"(79), the extradition of Pavelitch, who had taken refuge in Italy, was demanded by the French government; the Duce obviously took care not to grant it, and the Assize Court of Aix-en-Provence had to impose the death sentence by default on the head of the \"Oustachis\". This chief of terrorists, hired by Mussolini, \"worked\" for the Italian expansion on the Adriatic coast. When, in 1941, Hitler and Mussolini invaded and divided Yoguslavia, this supposed Croatian patriot was put. by them, at the head of the satellite state they created under the name of \"Independent State of Croatia\". On the 18th of May of that same year, in Rome, Pavelitch offered the crown of th at state to the Duke of Spolete who took the name \"Tomislav II\". Of course, he took care never to set foot on the blood-stained soil of his pseudo-kingdom. \"On the same day, Pius XII gave a private audience to Pavelitch and his (78) Henriette Feuillet: \"France Nouvelle\", 25th of June 1949.

In fact, on the 18th of May 1941, when Pius XII gladly welcomed Pavelitch and his gang of killers, the massacre of Orthodox Croats was at its height, concu rrently with forced conversions to Catholicism\".(79a) It was the Serbian minority of the population they were after, as the author Walter Hagen explains: \"Thanks to the 'Oustachis', the country was soon transformed into a bloody chaos... The deadly hatred of the new masters was directed towards the Jews and Serbians who were officially outlawed... Whole villages, even whole regions were sytematically wiped out... As the ancient tradition wanted Croatia and the Catholic Faith, Serbia and the Orthodox Church to be synonymous, the Orthodox believers were constrained to join the Catholic Church. These compulsory conversions constituted the comp letion of \"croatisation\".(80) Andrija Artukovic, minister of the Inte rior, was the great organiser of these massacres and compulsory conversions; but, while doing it, he \"morally\" defended himself, according to a witness in a high position. Indeed, when the Yugoslav government asked for his extradition from the United States where he had taken ref uge, someone spoke on his behalf: the R.P. Jesuit Lackovic, residing also in the United States, and secretary to Monseigneur Stepinac, archbishop of Zagreb, during the last war. \"Artukovic\", states the Jesuit, \"was the lay spokesman of Monseigneur Stepinac. Between 1941 and 1945, not one day went by without seeing him in my office or myself going to his. He asked the archbishop's advice on all his actions, as far as their moral aspect was concerned\".(81) When we know what the \"actions\" of this executioner were, we realise what kind of edifying \"moral\" advice Monseigneur Stepinac gave him. Massacres and \"conversi ons\" took place until the Liberation, and the good-will of the Holy-Father towards the killers never altered. One must read, in the Croatian Catholic newspapers of that time, the exchanges of compliments between Pius XII and Pavelitch, the \"Poglavnik\", to whom Monseigneur Sa ric, Jesuit archbishop of Sarajavo and a poet in his spare time, dedicated verses impregnated with a rapturous adoration.

It is, alas, too evident that, without the support of Monseigneur Stepinac, on the religious and political side, Ante Pavelitch would never have ob tained the collaboration of Catholic Croats to such an extent\".(83) To comprehend the full extent of that collaboration, one must read the Croatian Catholic press, the \"Katolic ki Tjednik\", the \"K atolick List\", the \"Hrvatski Narod\", and so many other pub lications which vied with each other in flattering the bloody \"Poglavnik\"; Pius XII was so pleased that he was a \"practising Catholic\", and the high esteem of the Sovereign Pontiff embraced even the accomplices of the great man. The \"Osservatore Romano\" informs us that, on the 22nd of July 1941. the pope received one hundred members of the Croatian Security Police, led by the chief of Zagreb's police, Eugen Kvaternik-Dido. This group of Croatian S.S., the pick of the executioners and torturers operating in the concentration camps, were presented to the Holy-Father by one who perpetrated crimes so monstrous that his own mother committed suicide in despair. The goodwill of His Holiness Pius XII is easily explained by the apostolic zeal of these killers. Another \"practising Catholic\", Mile Budak, minister for Worship, exlcaimed in August 1941, at Karlovac: \"The \"Oustachi\" movement is based on re ligion. All our work rests on our loyalty to religion and the Catholic Church\".(84) Besides, on the 22nd of July, at Go spic, the same minister for Worship had perfectly defined this work: \"We will ki ll some Serbians, deport others, and the rest will be compelled to' embrace the Roman Catholic religion\".(85) This fine programme was carried out to the letter. When the Liberation put an end to this tragedy, 300,000 Serbians and Jews had been deported and more than 500,000 massacred. By this means the Roman Church had also made 240,000 Orthodox believers enter its fold... who quickly went back to the religion of their ancestors when their freedom was restored.

The same author adds: \"With the death of the great Croatian tribune, Raditch, Croatia loses its main opponent to political clericalism which will embrace the mission of the Cathol ic action defined by Friedrich Muckermann. This German Jesuit, well-known before H itler's advent, made it known, in 1928, in a book whose foreword was written by Monseigneur Pacelli, then apostolic nuncio in Berlin. Muckermann expressed himself as follows: \"The pope appeals in favour of the Catholic Action's new crusade. He is the guide who carries the standard of Christ's Kingdom... The Catholic Action means the gathering of world Catholicism. It must live its heroic age... The new epoch can be acquired for Christ only through the price of blood\".(88) Ten years after this was written, the one who wrote the foreword of the Jesuit Father Muckermann's book sat on the throne of Saint-Peter and, during his pontificate, \"the blood for Ch rist\" literally flowed in Europe; but Croatia suffered the worst of the atrocious deeds of that \"new epoch\". There, not only were the priests a dvocating all out slaughter from the pulpit, but some even marched at the head of the murderers. Others held, apart from their sacred ministry, official posts as prefects or chiefs of the \"Oustachi\" police, even as chiefs of concentration camps where horrors were not outdone by even Dachau or Auschwitz.

His Holiness Pius XII was personally represented at Zagreb by an eminent monk, the R.P. Marcone. This \"Sancti Sedis Legatus\" was given the place of honour at all the ceremonies of the \"Oustachi\" regime, and had himself sanctimoniously photographed at the home of the chief of killers— Pave litch— with his family which received him as a friend. \"Birds of a feather flock together\". So, the most sincere cordiality always reigned in the relations between the assassins and ecclesiastics—of course, many of these ecclesiastics held both positions, for which they were never blamed. \"The end justifies the means\". When Pavelitch and his 4,000 \"Oustachis\"—which included archbishop Saric, a Jesuit, bishop Garic and 400 cler ics—left the scene of their exploits to go first to Austria then on to Italy, they left behind part of their \"treasures\": films, photographs, re corded speeches of Ante Pavelitch, chests full of jewels, gold coins, gold and platinum from the teeth, bracelets, wedding rings and pieces of dentures made of gold and platinum. This spoil taken from the poor wre tches who had been murdered were hidden at the Archiepiscopal palace where they were eventually found. As for the fugitives, they took advantage of the \"Pontifical Commission for Assistance\", created expressly to save war criminals. This charitable institution hid them in convents, mainly in Austria and Italy, and provided the chiefs with false passports which enabled them to go to \"friendly\" countries, where they would be able to enjoy the fruits of their robberies in peace. This was done for Ante Pavelitch, whose pres ence in Argentina was revealed, in 1957, through an attempt upon his life in which he was wounded.

Monseigneur Stepinac who had, as he said, a \"clear conscience\", stayed in Zagreb where he was tried in 1946. Condemned to hard labour, he was in fact only made to reside in his native village. The penance was easy to bear, as we can see, but the Church needs martyrs. The archbishop of Zagreb was then made a member of the holy cohort, in his lifetime, by Pius XII who hastened to confer on him the title of \"Cardinal\", in recognition of \"his apostolate which displays the purest brightness\". We are acquainted with the symbolic meaning of the Cardinals' Purple: the one who dons it must be ready to confess his Faith \"usque ad sanguinis effusionem\": to the point of shedding blood.

We cannot give here a full analysis but will say this: The book is entitled \"The Dossier of Cardinal Stepinac\", which seems to promise the reader an objective exposition of the trial at Zagreb. In fact, in this volume which numbers 285 pages, we find the speeches of the archbishop's two counsels in full, accompanied by ex tensive remarks from the author, but, neither the charge itself, nor the sp eech for the prosecution are mentioned, even briefly. The R.P. Dragoun seems to ignore th e French proverb \"Qui n'entend qu'une cloche n'entend qu'un son\" (there are two sides to every story)-unless, of course, he knows it too well! Be that as it may, this systematic oblite ration of the opposite side of the story would be enough to close the debate. Let us consider, though, the good reasons invoked for the discharge of Zagreb's archbishop. But fi rst of all, this question: Was Monseigneur Stepinac really the metropolitan of Croatia and Slovenia? The book of the R.P. Dragoun does not answer this question. On page 142 of that book, we read this concerning the copy of a report by Monseigneur Stepinac, the authenticity of which was contested by the defence: \"In the text of the copy, the archbi shop is described as \"Metropolitan Croatiae et Slavoniae\", but the archbishop is not a metropolitan and never presented himself as such. This would clear the matter up if we didn't read, on page 114, the following taken from Monseigneur Stepinac's own declarations before the tribunal: \"The Holy See often emphasized that the small nations and the national minorities have the right to be free. Should not I, as \"bishop and metropolitan\", have the right to discuss it?\" The more we read, the less we understand! No matter! As we are reminded again and again, Monseigneur Stepinac could not influence in any way the be haviour of his flock and clergy. The To those who bring out the articles of the Catholic press praising the accomplishments of Pavelitch and his hired assassins, the answer is: \"It is simply ridiculous to make Monseigneur Stepinac responsible for what the newspaper wrote\"."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"GERMAN AGGRESSIONS AND THE JESUITS 1 51 Even when this paper was the \"Katolicki List\", the most important Catholic publication in Zagreb, dioce se of Monseigneur Stepinac! In those conditions, we won't bother mentioning the \"Andjeo Cuvar\" (The Guardian Angel) belonging to the Franciscans, the \"Glasnik Sv. Ante\" (The Voice of Saint-Anthony) to the conventu als of the \"Katolicki Tjednik\", (The Catholic Weekly) of Sarajevo, bishop Sa ritch, nor, of course, the \"Vjesnik Pocasne Straze Srca Isusova\" (The Publication of the Guard of Honour of the Heart of Jesus(!), belonging to the Jesuits). So, it is claimed that Monseigneur St epinac, \"contested metropolitan\", had no influence over these publications, of which he was president, and which constantly tried to surpass each other in their adulation of Pavelitch and his regime of blood. Neither did he have any authority, so they say, over the \"Oustachi\" bishops Sacric, Garic, Aksamovic, Simrak, etc., who showered praise on the Poglavnik and applauded his crimes , nor over the \"Crusaders\" of the Catholic Action, these auxiliaries of \"Oustachi\" converters, nor over the Franciscans murderers, nor over the nuns of Zagreb who marched past, their hands raised in the hitlerian fashion. What a strange \"hierarchy\" which had authority over nothing and nobody! The fact that he sat, with ten other Catholic priests, in the \"Sabor\" (\"Oustachi\" Parliament) does not compromise the archbishop—or, at least, we must presume this, as the fact is simply ignored. We should not reproach him either for his presidency over Episcopal Conferences nor over the Committee for the application of the Decree concerning the conversion of Orthod ox people. In this apology, the \"humanitarian\" pretext of having made so many enter the Roman Church by force, is fully—and skilfully—expounded. We read this, concerning the \"awful dilemma\" facing Monseigneur Step inac: \"His pastoral duty was to maintain intact the canonical principles but, on the other hand, dissidents who refused to embrace Catholicism were massacred; so, he lessened the severity of the rules.\" We become even more bewildered when we read a little further on: \"He tried to resolve this dramatic alternative in the circular letter of the 2nd of March 1942, in which he ordered the priests to closely screen the motives for conversion\". This is indeed a peculiar method to \"a ttenuate the severity of the rules\" and resolve the \"dramatic alternative\"! Was Monseigneur Stepinac opening or shutting the doors of the Roman Church to the false converts? It would be absolutely impossible to find it out if we referred only to this speech for the defence. The archbishop's apologists seem to choose the \"shutting\" , though, when they declare: \"...

In the diocese of Gornji Karlovac alone, part of Zagreb's archbishopric, 40,000 people were re-baptised\". It is evident that such results could be obtained only through mass- conversions of whole villages, such as Kamensko, in that same archdiocese of Monseigneur Stepinac, where 400 lost shee p returned to the Roman fold in one day, \"spontaneously and without any pressure on the part of civil and ecclesiastical authorities\". Then why conceal these numbers? If they were really due to the \"charitable sentiments\" of the Croatia n Catholic clergy, and not to the cynical exploitation of terror, they should have been proud of them. The truth is that the veil thrown ov er these infamies in an attempt to hide them is transparent and not wide enough. To c over Stepinac, others have to be uncovered: Bishops Saric, Garic, Simrak, the prie sts Bilogrivic, Kamber Bralo and their associates—the Franciscans and Jesuits have to be uncovered, and finally the Holy See. We might as well leave this peculiar archbishop to enjoy his \"clear conscience\", this primate of Croatia s upposedly stripped of any authority, calling himself \"metropolitan\" when he wasn't so and who, to crown the paradox, was opening doors when shutting them. But, at the side of this fantastic prelate, there was another one, consistent and corpulent, the R.P. Marcone, personnal repres entative of Pius XII. Was this \"Sancti Sedis legatus\" also destitute of any authority over the Croatian clergy? Nobody knows! For the \"dossier\" so well expurgated makes no mention whatsoever of this great pe rson; we could even be oblivious of his existence if we didn't have other information, such as photographs which show him officiating at Zagreb's cathedral, enthroned, amongst the \"Oustachi\" general-staff, and above all sharing a me al with the family of Pavelitch, the \"practising\" Catholic who organised the massacres. Confronted by such a document, it is not surprising that the presence of the pope's representative was \"blacked -out\"; the mystics would call this \"enlightening darkness\"! But these few li nes from the \"dossier\" are even more enlightening: \"The procurator himself, in his bill of indictment, names the Holy See's Secretary of State, Cardinal Maglione, who had, in 1942, advised Archbishop Stepinac to establish more cordial and sincere relations with the \"Oustachi\" authorities\".(92b) This is sufficient to put an end to any more quibbling.

The Holy See itself was urging Monseigneur Stepinac to collaborate with them, and the personnal representative of Pius XII, by taking his place at Pavelitch's table, was a pplying the pontifical instructions to the letter: sincerity and cordiality in the relations with murderers of Orthodox believers and Jews. This does not surprise us! But what do the Jesuits think of it all, as they obstinately affirmed that the constant co-operation given to the dictators, by the prelates of His Holiness, was an \"option\" entirely personal and not dictated by the Vatican? When Cardinal Maglione sent the previously mentioned recommendations to Zagreb's archbishop, was it his \"personal option' he expressed, under the seal of the State's secretary's office? The proof of the conniv ance between the Holy See and the \"Oustachis\" supplied by the R.P. Dragoun, which has just been mentioned, puts an end to this chapter. But here is a new confirmation of the evangelical sentiments which flourished, and still flourish amongst the faithful of the Croatian Catholic Church towards the Orthodox Serbians. The \"Federation Ouvriere Croate en France\" (Federation of Croatian workmen in France) sent out an invitation to the solemn meeting organised for Sunday, 19th of April 1959, at the \"General Confederation of Christian workmen\" centre, in Paris, to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the foundation of the \"Oustachi\" Croatian state. This invitation read: \"The ceremony will start with holy mass being said at the Church of Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. But the reader, edified by this pious start, is the more startled when he discovers, soon after, this straight exhortation: \"DEATH TO THE SERBIANS... !\"(93) So, this not so banal document expresses the regrets that not more of these \"brothers in Christ\" were killed. The book of the R.P. Dragoun, rector of the Croatian Mission in France, implies that the welcome given by the French Catholics to the Croatian refugees was not warm enough. We are told this on pages 59 and 60, and, on pages 280 and 281, the author mentions the \"grevious disappointment\" these refugees experience d at \"being met by a total lack of understanding on the part of their brothers in the faith\". Considering the aforementioned document, this \"lack of understanding\" seems comprehensible; we are glad that our fellow-countrymen, in s p i t e of the most grand invitations, show little sympathy to a form of piety in which the call to murder walks hand in hand with the \"holy mass\", in the best Roman and \"Oustachi\" tradition.

On the 10th of February 1960, the infamous archbishop of Zagreb, Alois Stepinac, died at his native village of Karlovice, where he had been made to reside. This death gave the Vatican an opportunity to organise one of its spectacular manifestations for which it excels. On that occasion, a lot had to be done as many Catholics had no illusions as far as the Stepinac \"case\" was concerne d. So, the Holy See surpassed itself to give this apotheosis all the pomp possible. The \"Osservatore Romano\" and all the Catholic press dedicated many columns to the rapturous praises of the \"martyr\",, his \"spiritual testament\", and the speeches of His Holiness John XXIII proclaiming \"his respect a nd supernatural affection\"; these were the motives which prompted him to give to this cardinal who was not part of the Curia the honours of a solemn service at St. Peter's, in Rome, where he himself would give the General Absolution. And to complete this glorification, the press announced that the beatification of that illustrious person would soon be started. We must admit that he deserved so much praise, and even the halo, for 'having observed the \"holy obedience\", and carried out to the letter the pressing instructions of the Holy See concerning the \"cordial and sincere\" relations wished for between himself and the \"Oustachis\".

In France, the same undermining action was going on; it started when Mussolini came to power and ended up, in 1940, with the collapse of the national defence. As for Belgium, it was, so we are told, the \"spiritual values\" which had to be rest ored for the good of the country. The F.N.C.: \"Federation nationale catholiq ue\" (National Catholic Federation) was born and placed under the presidency of General de Castelnau; as many as three million adherents joined it. The choice of its chief was clever: the general, a great military figure and, then, 78 years of age, covered with his personal prestige—but, of course, un known to him—an intense clerico- fascist propaganda programme. That the F.N.C, as the whole Cath olic Action, was Jesuit through and through is obvious to anyone. But we know also that the good Fathers, whose besetting sin is pride, like to put their signa ture on the creations of their genius. This they did for the F.N.C. when they consecrated this Catholic army to the Sacred-Heart of Jesus, a worship set up by their Company and whose basilica stands on Montmartre hill, from where Ignatius of Loyola and his companions set off to conquer the world. A book concerning the F.N.C, whose foreword was written by the R . P . lanvier, preserved for posterity the ac t of consecration read \"at the altar\" by the old general. We will quote just a few phrases: \"Sacred Heart of Jesus, The chiefs and representatives of French Catholics, prostrating themselves now before you, have assembled and organised the Nationa l Catholic Federati on (F.N.C.) to re-establish your reign over this land... All of us, those who are present and those who are absent, have not always been irrepr oachable... We carry the burden of the crimes the French nation committed against you...

We wa nt everything to be bent before and devoted to your service... \"Sacred Heart of Jesus, we beseec h you, through the Virgin Mary, to receive the homage... \"etc\".(94) As for the \"crimes of the French na tion\", the same Catholic author enumerates them: Fatal words and general directives: soci alism is condemned... liberalism is condemned... Leo XIII showed that the freedom of worship is unjustifiable. The pope also showed that the freedom of speech and expression cannot be justifiably ac corded... So, the freedom of thought, press, teaching and worship, considered by some as rights natural to man, cannot possibly be given... \"We must\", said Pius XI, \"re-instate these teachings and regulations of the Church\". Such is the main aim of the F.N. C., under the Hierarchy's control assured by the decentralization of the diocesan Committees. \"In the Catholic Action, as in the war, the famous word of General de Castelnau remains true: \"Forward\".(95) This is certainly clear and explicit. We know, then, what to expect when we read this, from Pius XI: \"The Catholic Action is the faithful's apostolate...\" (Letter to Cardinal Van Roey, 15th of August 1929). Strange apostolate, consisting of the rejection of all liberties valued by civilised countries and to be the patron of, instead of, of the totalitarian gospel! Is this \"the right to communi cate to other minds the treasures of Redemption\"? (Pius XI, \"Non abbiamo bisogno\"). In Belgium Leon Degrelle and his fri ends, heroes of the Catholic Action spread around them these \"treasures of Redemption\"... revised and up- dated by the Jesuit Father Staempfle, the discreet author of \"Mein Kampf\". It was the same in France where lay ap ostles, \"joining in the activity of the hierarchical apostolate\" (Pius XI \"dixit\"), were busy setting up another \"collaboration\". Let us read what Franz von Papen, the pope's secret chamberlain and the Fuhrer's right hand man, wrote concerning this subject: \"Our first meeting took place in 1927, when a German delegation, to which I had the honour to belong, came to Paris, for the \"Social Week of the Catholic Institute\", under the presidency of Monseigneur Baudrillart (94) and (95) Georges Viance: \"La Federation nationale catholique\", foreword by the R.P.

PP. Delattre (Jesuit), de la Briere (Jesuit) and Denset (Jesuit)... were present at these conferences\".(96) Further on, the good apostle adds th at, at times, \"this conference of Catholics reached superhuman heights of greatness\". This \"greatness\" reached its zenith on the 14th of June 1940, the day which saw the flag adorned with the swastika fly victoriously over Paris. We know that Goebbels, chief of hitleri an propaganda, indicated that date three months before, on the 14th of Ma rch, and that the German offensive was only launched on the 10th of May. The accuracy of this forecast is not as astonishing as it may seem. \"Here is the secret report of agent 654 J.56, working for the German Secret Service, who sent these revelations to Himmler: \"Paris, 5th of July 1939. \"I can declare that, in France, the situation is now in our hands.

Men like Luchaire, Bucard, Deat , Doriot... and Abel Bonnard (of the French Academy)\".(97) (This particular one fled to Spain at the Liberation. He came back to France on the 1st of July 1958, gave himself up, but was immediately released on a temporary basis by the president of the High-Court of Justice!) The extremely well documented book of M. Andre Guerber gives details of payments allocated to these traitors by the German SR. This money was well and truly earned, for their work was very effective. Besides, the atmosphere had been prepared for a long time, now. To \"regenerate\" the land according to the wishes of the Catholic Action, a whole brood of apprentice-dictators, on the model of Leon Degrelle, had hatched, men like Deat, Bucard, Doriot who was—according to M. Andre Guerber—\"agent No.56 BK of the German Secret Service\". Of all this motley band he was also the one best thought of by the archbishopric and those well-dis posed towards them... and, of course, by Hitler who, later on at Sigmaringen, gave him full power. Doriot was the rising star; but, for the immediate future and to treat cautiously the transition after the foreseen and wanted defeat, another man was needed, a highly respected military chief who would be able to dress up (96) Franz von Papen: \"Memoires\" (Flammarion, Paris 1953, p.91).

Amongst us, there must be men of the cloth who are the workmen in the great national restorations. But what are the necessary conditions they need to accomplish this mission? Natural qualities of intelligence and character; also supernatural qualities that is to say obedience to God and His Law is just as indispensable, as this political work is moral and religious before anyt hing else. These saviours are men with generous hearts who work only for the glory of God...\"(98) When the disciple of Loyola expou nded these political and religious thoughts, he knew who this pious \"sav iour\" would be, as his name was not a secret amongst clerics and fascists; this is told us by M. Francois Ternand: \"A clever and persistant propaga nda campaign began in favour of a \"Petain dictatorship\"... \"In 1935, Gustave Herve published a pamphlet which we are going to examine... The tract is entitled \"We need Petain\"... its foreword is an enthusiastic apology of the \"Italian recovery\" and \"the even more amazing recovery of Germany\", also an exaltati on of the wonderful chiefs who were the authors of these recoveries. Now what about our own French people?... There is a man around whom we could gather... We also have a providential man... Do you want to know his name? It is Petain\". \"We need Petain\", for the homeland is in a dangerous position; and not only the homeland, but Catholicism also: \"Christian civilisation is condemned to death if a dictatorial regime is not set up in every country\"... \"Listen: \"In peace time, a regime can only be swept away by a coup d'Etat if it is willing or if it has no support from the army and administrations. The operation can be a success only throug h a war and especially a defeat\".(99) So, the path to follow was already ma de clear in 1935 to \"re-christianise\" France, the regime had to be swept away, and the best way to attain this was to suffer a military defeat which would place us under the German yoke. In 1943, this was confirmed by Pierre Laval, the pope's count and president of the Vichy government: \"I hope Germany will be victorious.

Listen to him: \"Hitler's war is a noble enterprise undertaken for the defence of European culture\".(102) So, on both sides of the Atlantic, as i ndeed all over the world, the clerical voices were singing the praise s of victorious Nazism. In France, Cardinal Suhard, archbishop of Paris, set the example to all the episcopate by \"collaborating\" fully, and so did the Jesuit nuncio Monseigneur Valerio Valeri.

In the end, it consented to recall three of them. \"France has forgotten...\", wrote M. Maurice Nadeau.

We know that the cardinal's behaviour during that period had been severely criticized after the Liberation. When General de Gaulle arrived back in Paris, in August 1944, he refused to meet the cardinal at the \"Te Deum\" in Notre-Dame. At that time, the prelate was openly accused of \"collaborationist tendencies\". The Holy-Father's congratulations are then understandable. But there is another story of \"Te Deum\" even more edifying!: After the allies disembarked, the ci ty of Rennes suffered much in the fighting which followed, and many di ed amongst the civilian population as the commanding officer of the German garrison had refused to evacuate them.

To thank Heaven for the liberation of his city was an intolerabl e scandal to the eyes of this prelate.

Hitler then stopped, saying that he couldn't say any more..\"(108) Another highly placed hitle rian, Walter Schellenberg, former chief of the German counter-espionage, completed this confidence from the Fuhrer, after the war: \"The S.S. organisat ion had been constituted, by Himmler, according to the principles of the Jesuits' Order. Their regulations and the Spiritual Exercises prescribed by Ignatius of Loyola were the model Himmler tried to copy exactly... The \"Reichsfuhrer SS\" —Himmler's title as supreme chief of the SS—was to be the equivalent of the Jesuits' \"General\" and the whole structure of the direction was a close imitation of the Catholic Church's hierarchical order. A mediaeval castle, near Paderborn in Westphalia, and called \"Webelsbourg\", was restored; it became what could be called a SS monastery\".(109) For their part, the best theological pens were busy demonstrating the similarity between the Catholic and Nazi doctrines. And, for that work, the sons of Loyola were the busiest. As an example, let us see how Michaele Schmaus, Jesuit theologian, presented to the public a series of studies on this subject: \"Empire and Church\" is a series of writings which should help the building up of the Third Reich as it unites a national-socialist state to Catholic-christianity... The national- socialist movement is the most vigorous and massive protest agains t the spirit of the 19th and 20th centuries... A compromise between the Catholic faith and liberal thinking is impossible... Nothing is more contrary to Catholicism than democracy... The re- awakened meaning of \"strict authority\" opens up again the way to the real interpretation of ecclesiastical authority... The mistrust of liberty is founded on the Catholic doctrine of original sin...

The similarity is obvious between the passion ate anti-liberalism of this Jesuit from Munich and the equal fanaticism expres sed during the \"act of consecration of the F.N.C. in the basilica of Montma rtre\". During the occupation, the R.P. Merklen wrote: \"These da ys, liberty no longer seems to merit any esteem\".(l 11) Quotations such as these could be multiplied by the thousand. Is not this hatred of liberty under all its form s the character itself of the Roman Master? It is easy also to understand ho w the Catholic \"doctrine\" and the nazi \"doctrine\" could harmonise so well. The one who ably demonstrated this accord, \"The Jesuit Michaele Schmaus\", was called by 'La Croix', ten years after the war, the \"great theologian of Munich\"( 112), and nobody will be surprised to learn that he was made a \"Prince of the Church\" by Pius XII . Under the circumstances, what becomes of the \"terrible\" encyclical letter \"Mit brennender Sorge\", from Pius XI, which was supposed to condemn nazism? No casuist has tried to tell us... naturally! The \"great theologian\" Michaele Schm aus had many rivals, according to a German author who sees in the \"K atolisch-Konservatives Erbgut\" the strangest book ever published by the German Catholic Publications: \"This anthology which brings together texts from the main Catholic theorists of Germany, from Gorres to Vogelsang, makes us believe that national-socialism was born out of Catholic ideas\".(113) When writing this, the author certainly didn't realise he was describing it so perfectly. Another well informed person, the mainspring of the pact between the Holy See and Berlin and the pope's secr et chamberlain, Franz von Papen, was even more explicit: \"The Third Reich is the first world power which not only acknowledges but also puts into practice the high principles of the papacy\".(l 14) To this, we will add the result of this \"putting into practice\": 25 million victims of the concentration camps—the official figure issued by the United Nations Organisation. Here, we find it necessary to add something especially for candid minds, for those who cannot admit that the organised massacres were one of the papacy's \"high principles\".

Let us set aside the superabundant testimonies about the clerical ferocity of years gone by to consider the 20th century. We will not recall either the exploits of men like Stepinac and Marcone in Croatia, nor Tiso in Slovakia, but wi ll confine ourselv es to examining the orthodoxy of certain \"high principles\" they put so well into practice. Are they really out-dated today—these principles—disowned by an \"enlightened doctrine\", officially rejected by the Holy See with other mistakes of a dark past? It is easy to find out. Let us, for example, open the \"Gr eat Apologetics\", by the Abbe Jean Vieujan, which can hardly be describ ed as mediaeval as it is dated \"1937\". What do we read? \"To accept the principle of the Inqui sition, one only needs a Christian mentality, and this is what many Chri stians lack... The Church has no such timidity\".(116) One could not put it better. Is another proof, no less orthodox an d modern, necessary? Listen to the R.P. Janvier, a famous conference speaker at Notre-Dame: \"By virtue of her indirect power over temporal matters, should not the Church have the right to expect Catholic States to oppress heretics even to the point of death, so as to suppress them? Here is my answer: \"I do advocate this, even to the point of death!... Leaning first of all on the practice, then on the teaching of the Church itself; and I am convinced that no Catholic would say the opposite without erring gravely\".(117) We could not accuse this theologian of speaking in riddles. His speech is clear and concise. It would be impossible to say more with fewer words. Everything is there, concerning the right the Church arrogates to herself to exterminate those whose beliefs do not correspond with hers: the \"teaching\" which compels her, the \"practice\" which legitimates by tradition, and even the \"call to the Christian states\", of which the hitlerian crusade was such a perfect example. The following words, far from ambigious, were not pronounced in the darkness of the Middle-Ages either: \"The Church can condemn heretics to death, for any rights they have are (115) \"Temoignage chretien\", 6th of D ecember 1957.

The author of this was the Jesuits' gene ral Franz Wernz (1906-1915), and the fact that he was German as well gives even more weight to his declration. During the 20th century also, Cardinal Lepicier, notoroius prince of the Church, wrote: \"If someone professes publicly to be an heretic or tries to pervert others, by his speech or example, he can not only be e x c ommunicated, but also justly killed...\"(118 & 118a). If that's not a characteristic appeal to murder, I might as well be \"changed into a peppermill\" as the late Courteline said. Is the Sovereign Pontiffs contribution wanted as well? Here it is, from a modern pope whose \"liberalism\" was criticised by intransigent clerics, the Jesuit Pope Leo X III: \"Anathema on the one who says: the Holy Spirit does not want us to kill the heretic\". What higher authority could be invoked after this one, apart from that of the Holy Spirit? Even though this may displease t hose who manipulate the smokescreen (reference to those who put out smoke sign als during the choice of a Pope), the soothers of disquieted consciences, the papacy's \"high principles\" remain unchanged and, amongst other things, the extermination for the Fait h is as valid and canonical today as it w as in the past. A conclusion most \"enlightening\"—to use a wo rd dear to mystics—when we consider what happened in Europe between 1939 and 1945. \"Hitler, Goebbels, Himmler and most members of the party's \"old guard\" were Catholics\", wrote M. Frederic Hoffet. \"It was not by accident that, because of its chiefs' religion, the Natio nal-socialist government was the most Catholic Germany ever had... This kinship between National-socialism and Catholicism is most striking if we study closely the propaganda methods and the interior organisation of the party. On that subject, nothing is more instructive than Joseph Goebbel's works. He had been brought up in a Jesuit college and was a seminarist before devoting himself to literature and politics... Every page, every line of his writings recall the teaching of his masters; so he stresses obedience... the contempt for truth... \"Some lies are as useful as bread!\" he proclaimed by virtue of a moral relativism extracted from I gnatius of Loyola's writings...\"(119) Hitler did not award the palm of Je suitism to his chief of propaganda, though to the Gestapo's chie f, as he told his favourites: \"I can see Himmler as our Ignatius of Loyola\"(120).

First of all, we notice that Kurt Heinrich Himmler, Reichsfuhrer of the SS, Gestapo and German police forces, seemed to be the one most impregnated by clericalism amongst the Catholic members of Hitler's entourage. His father had been director of a Catholic school in Munich, then tutor of Prince Ruprecht of Bavaria. His brother, a Benedictine monk, lived at the monastery of Maria Laach, one of the Pan-German high places. He also had an uncle who had held the important position of Canon at the Court of Bavaria, the Jesuit Himmler. The German author Walter Hagen give s also this discreet information: \"The Jesuits' general, Count Halke von Ledochowski, was ready to organise, on the common basis of an ti-communism, some collaboration between the German Secret Se rvice and the Jesuit Order\".(121) As a result, within the SS Central Se curity Service, an organisation was created, and most of its main posts were held by Catholic priests wearing the black uniform of the SS. The Jesuit Father Himmler was one of its superior officers. After the Third Reich's capitulation, the Jesuit Father Himmler was arrested and imprisoned at Nuremberg. His hearing by the international tribunal would have apparently been most interesting, but Providence was keeping a watchful eye: Heinrich Himmler's uncle never appeared before that court. One morning, he WAS FOUND DEAD IN HIS CELL, and the public never learned the cause of his death. We will not insult the memory of this cleric by supposing that he willingly ended his days, against the solemn teaching laws of the Roman Church. Nevertheless, his death was as sudden and opportune as the one of another Jesuit, sometime before, Fa ther Staempfle, the unrecognised author of 'Mein Kampf'. St range coincidence indeed... But let us come back to Kurt Heinrich Himmler, chief of the Gestapo, which meant he held in his hand the e ssential reins of power of the regime. Was it his personal merits which earned him such a high position? Did Hitler see in him a superior genius when he compared him to the creator of the Jesuit Order? It is certainly not what the testimonies of those who knew him imply as they saw in him nothing more than mediocrity. Was that star shining with a borrow ed brightness? Was it really Kurt Heinrich Himmler, the ostensible chief, who actually reigned over the Gestapo and the secret services? Who was sending millions of people, deported for political reasons, and Jews to their death? Was it the flat-faced nephew or the uncle, former Canon at the Court of Bavaria, one of von Ledochowski's favourites, a Jesuit Father and superior officer of the SS?

However, the spell binding actors on whom the public's gaze is fixed have all come from behind the scenes. This is more than evident when we study these \"sacred monsters\" and realise that they are far from equal to the individuals they are supposed to represent. Such seems to have been the case of Hi mmler. But wouldn't it be right to say the same of the one whom he helped as his right hand man, Hitler? When we saw Hitler gesticulating on the screens or heard him bawling his hysterical speeches, did we not have the impression of looking at the movements of an automaton ill adjusted, with overstretched springs? Even his most simple and composed movements reminded us of a mechanical puppet. And what about his dull and globular eyes, flabby nose, bloated physiognomy whose vulgarity could not be disguised by that famous lock of hair and brush moustache whic h seemed glued under his nostrils. Was this snarler at public meetings re ally a chief? the \"real\" master of Germany, an \"authentic\" Statesman whose genius was going to turn the world upside-down? Or was he just a bad substitute for al l that? A covering skin cleverly blown up and a phantom for the use of the masses, a rabble rouser? He himself admitted it when he said: \"I am only a clarion\". M. Francois- Poncet, then French ambassador to Berlin, confirms that Hitler worked very little, was not a reader and let his collaborators have their own way. His helpers gave the same impression of emptiness and unreality. The first one, Rudolf Hess, who flew to England in 1941, looked on his own trial at Nuremberg as a total stranger, and we ne ver learned if he was completely insane or just a lunatic. The second one was the grotesque Goering, vain and obese, who wore the most spectacular comic-opera uniforms, a glutton, a great robber of paintings and, to top it all, a morphine drug addict. The other main personalities of the party bore the same resemblance and, at the trials of Nuremberg, it was one of the journalists greatest surprises to have to report that—apart from their own particular defects— these Nazi heroes lacked in intellect, character, and were more or less insignificant.

What a will! From the confidences of some of his companions, we get the picture of a man constantly undecided; this \"formidable man\" who was going to \"invade everything\", with elemental force (to use terms of Cardinal Ratti, future Pius XI), did not resist the advan ces made to him by the Jesuit Cardinal Gasparri, secretary of State, on behalf of the Vatican. Just a few secret meetings persuaded the revolutionist to enlist bag and baggage under the Holy Father's standard , to carve out the brilliant career we know so well, and the well known former minister Carlo Sforza could write: \"One day, when time will have attenuated the bitterness and hatred, it will be recognised we hope, that the orgy of bloody brutalities which turned Italy into a prison for twenty years, and ruins through the 1940-1945 war, found its origin in an almost uniqu e historical case: the utter disproportion between the legend artificially created around a name and the real capacities of the poor devil who bore that name, a man who was not obstructed by culture\".(122) This perfect formula is applicable to Hitler, as well as Mussolini: same disproportion between the legend and capacities, same lack of \"culture\" in those two mediocre adventurers with almost identical pasts; their lightning careers can find an explanation only in their gift for haranguing the masses, a gift which brought them before the glare of publicity. That the legend was \"artifically crea ted\" is evident enough when we know that, today, the Fuhrer's retrospective apparition on the screens of Germany provokes nothing more than a huge laugh. But was not the obvious inferiority of these \"providential men\" the very reason for which they were chosen to be elevated to power? The fact is that the same lack of personal qualities can be found in all those the papacy elected to be its champions. In Italy and Germany, there were some \"real\" statesmen, \"real\" chiefs, who were able to take the helm and govern wi thout having to resort to this delirious \"mystic\". But these were too bright intellectually and not sufficiently pliable. The Vatican, and especially th e \"black pope\", von Ledochowski, could not have held them \"as a baton in his hand\", according to the fiery formula, and made them serve his aims at all costs until catastrophe struck.

Bavaria had to be separated from the German Republic of Weimar—and, as by chance, the agitator Hitler, of Austrian orig in, was then a Bavarian separatist. But the chance to realise this fe deration and place a Hapsburg at its head became more and more slim , whilst Monseigneur Pacelli, the nuncio who had left Munich for Be rlin, became the more conscious of the German Republic's weakness beca use of the poor support the Allies gave it. The hope to get hold of Ge rmany as a whole was then born at the Vatican and the plan was modified accordingly: \"The hegemony of Protestant Prussi a had to be prevented and as the Reich was to dominate Europe—to avert the Germans' federalism—a Reich had to be reconstituted in which the Catholics would be masters\".(123) This was enough.

The liberals and Jews had plenty of spare time to find out that these principles were far from out-dated, as the most orthodox voices confirmed it. The right the Church arrogates herself to exterminate slowly or speedily those who are in the way was \"put into practice\" at Auschwitz, Dachau, Belsen, Buchenwald, and other death camps. The Gestapo of Himmler, \"our Ignati us of Loyola\", diligently performed these charitable deeds; civilian and military Germany had to submit \"perinde ac cadaver\" to th is all-powerful organisation. No need to say that the Vatican w ashed its hands of these horrors. When giving an audience to Dr Nerin F. Gun, a Swiss journalist who had been deported himself and who wondered why the pope had not intervened, at least by providing some assistance to so many unfortunate people, His Holiness Pius XII had the affrontery to answer: \"We knew that, for political reasons, viol ent persecutions were taking place in Germany, but We were never inform ed as to the inhuman character of the Nazi repression\".(124) And that at the time when the speaker of Radio Vatican, the R.P.

In Slovakia— as we know—Monseigneur Tiso, the Jesuit Gaul eiter, was also free to persecute the \"separated brethren\" even though Germany, to which his State was a satellite, was mainly Protestant. It says a lot about the influence the Roman Church had in the Hitlerian Reich! We have also seen the part played in Croatia by the representatives of that Church, in the extermination of Orthodox believers.

But we find something even better, in M. Leon Poliakov's book: \"The proposal of the Protestant Church in France that, together with the Roman Church, they should take some measures against th e rounding-up of Jews, during the Summer of 1942, was rejected by the Catholic dignitaries\".(129) Many Parisians still remember how the Jewish children were taken from their mothers and sent, by special trains, to the crematory furnaces of Auschwitz. These deportations of chil dren are confirmed, amongst several other official documents, in a note of the \"SS Haupsturmfuhrer Danneker\", dated 21st of July 1942. The awful callousness of the Roman Church—and of its chief in particular—inspired, not long ago, these revengeful lines from the aforementioned periodical \"L'Arche\": \"Over five years, Nazism was the author of outrage, profanation, blasphemy and crime.

For the benefit of our readers not yet fully convinced, we will quote the following official German document which sets out the Vatican's dispositions—and those of the Jesuits—towards the Jews, before the war: \"Studying the evolution of anti-semitism in the United States, we note with interest that the number of listeners to the radio broadcasts of Father Coughlin (a Jesuit), well known fo r his anti-semitism, exceeds 20 millions\".(131) The militant anti-semitism of the Je suits in the United States, as everywhere else, is not surprising on the part of these ultramontanes, as it is in perfect accord with the \"doctrine\". Let us see what M. Daniel-Rops, of the French Academy, has to say on the subject; this author specialises in pious literature and publishes only under the au spices of \"the Imprimatur\". We read in one of his best known works, \"Jesus and His times\", published in 1944, during the German occupation: \"Over the centuries, wherever the Jewish race was scattered, blood flowed, and always the call for murder uttered at Pilate's judgment hall drowned the cry of despair repeat ed a thousand times. The face of a persecuted Jewish nation fills History, but it cannot obliterate this other face, smeared with blood and spittle, fo r which the Jewish crowd felt no pity. No doubt, Israel had no choice in the matter and had to kill its God after disowning Him, and, as blood mysteriously calls for blood, Christian charity may have no choice either; should not the divine will compensate with the horror of the progroms the unbearable horror (the Crucifixion') ( 132) How well said! Or, to put it more bluntly: if millions of Jews had to go through the gas chambers and crematory furnaces of Auschwitz, Dachau and elsewhere, it was their just desert. This adversity was wanted by the \"divine will\" and \"Christian charity\" would err if turning towards them. The eminent professor M.

Jules Isaac brings to our notice that the phrases in question have been altered by the publisher \"in the more recent editions\" of this edifying book—that is to say, after the Liberation. There is \"a time\" for everything: the crematory furnaces were out-dated. So, from the doctrinal affirmation of the papacy's high principles to their putting into practice by Himmler, \"our Ignatius of Loyola\", the ring is closed—and we will add the half mad an ti-semitism of the F uhrer thus loses much of its mystery.

The things which were imagined, before the war, in an attempt to explain the evident disproportion between the man and the part he had to play! There was a gap, an obvious vacuum felt by all. To fill this gap, legends were abounding: stories were spread abroad not always without the secret purpose of misleading!, Occult sciences, oriental magicians, astrologers inspired, so we were told, the sleep-walking hermit of Berchtesgaden. And the choice of the swastika as the Nazi party's in signa, which originated from India, seemed to corroborate the idea. M. Maxime Mourin refuted this particular assertion: \"Adolf Hitler had been a pupil at the school of Lambach and sang amongst the choir boys in the abbey bearing the same name. He discovered the swastika there, as it was the heraldic sign of Father Hagen, the abbey's administrator\".( 134) The Fuhrer's \"inspirations\" are also easily explained, without having to resort to mysterious or exotic philosophies. If it is obvious that this \"son of the Catholic Church\", as he was described by Franco, was submitted to the impulses of mysterious leaders, we know also that these had nothing to do with oriental magic. The earthly hells which devoured 25 million victims bear another stamp, easily recognisable: the one of people who had to go through a lengthy and meticulous training, as prescribed in the \"Spiritual Exercises\" (of the Jesuits).

Beyond the small Serbian nation, th e Vatican aimed at Russia, the traditional protector of Orthodox believers in the Balkans and the East. M. Pierre Dominique wrote: \"To Rome, this affair became most important; a victory of apostolic monarchy over Czarism could be looked upon as a victory of Rome over the schism of the East\".(135) The Roman Curia was in no way concerned that such a victory could only be acquired through a gigantic holocaust. The risk, rather the certainty of it, was accepted, as the alliances made it unavoidable. Urged on by his secretary of State, the Jesuit Merry del Val, Pius X made no secret of it and the Bavarian Charge d'Affaires wrote to his government, on the eve of the conflict: \"He (the pope) does not think the French and Russian armies would be successful in a war against Germany\".(136) This wicked calculation proved wr ong. The first World War, which ravaged the north of France and left several millions dead, did not fulfil Rome's ambitions; it divided Austria- Hungary instead, so depriving the Vatican of its main stronghold in Europe and liberating the Slavs who were part of that double monarchy from Vienna's apostolic yoke. In addition, the Russian revolution li berated from the Vatican's control those Roman Catholics, for the most part of Polish origins, who lived in the Czars former empire. The defeat was total.

It was of no importance that 25 millions died in concentration camps, 32 millions soldiers were killed on the battle fields and 29 millions were wounded and maimed; these are the offici al statistics of the United Nations Organisation (137) and show the magnitude of that carnage! This time, the Roman Curia thought her aims had been reached, and one could read in 'Basler Nachrichten' of Basle: \"The German action in Russia poses the question of that country's evangelisation; the Vatican is most highly interested in it\".(138) And this, from a book devoted to the glorification of Pius XII: \"The Vatican and Berlin signed a pact allowing the Catholic missionaries of the Russicum college to go to occupied territories and the placing of the Baltic territories under Be rlin's nunciature\".(139) The \"catholicisation\" of Russia was about to be launched, under the protection of the Wehrmacht and SS, in the manner Pavelitch and his associates were carrying it out in Croa tia, but on a much vaster scale.

We smile while reading the vehement contestation of Pius XII's thurifers who tell us that Hitler's war was not a real \"crusade\", when that word is me ntioned in the Holy Father's Message. The \"volunteers\" the pope called to arms were those of the \"Azul Division\" and those recruited by Cardinal Baudrillart in Paris. \"Hitler's war is a noble enterprise in the defence of European culture\", he exclaimed on the 30th of July 1941. We note, though, that the Vatican is not interested any more in the defence of this culture now that it st rives to make African nations revolt against France. Pius XII said: \"The Catholic Church does not identify herself with western culture\". (141 and 141a) The impostures and gross contradict ions are endless on the part of those who accuse Satan of being the \"father of all lies\". The defeat sustained in Russia by Hitler's armies, \"these noble defenders of European culture\", involved also the Jesuit converters. One wonders what Saint-Theresa was doing before such a disaster! Pius XI had proclaimed her \"patron-saint of unfortunate Russia \" and Canon Coube represented her standing, \"smiling but as terrible as an army set for battle against the Bolshevist giant\".(142) Had the Saint of Lisieux—used for all kinds of work by the Church— succumbed under the new and gigantic task assigned to her by the Holy lather? It would not be surprising. But, instead of the little saint, there was still the Queen of Heaven who had taken upon herself, in 1917 already, under certain conditions, to bring back schismatic Russia to the Roman Ch urch's fold. Let us read what 'La Croix' said about it: \"We will remind our readers that the Virgin of Fatima had herself promised the conversion of the Russia ns, if all Christians sincerely and joyfully practised all the commandments of the evangelical law\".(143) We want to point out that, accor ding to the Jesuit Fathers who are great specialists in miraculous matters, the celestial Mediator recommended as especially effective the daily use of the rosary. This promise from the Virgin had ev en been sealed by a \"dance of the Sun\", a wonder which occurred again in 1951, in the gardens of the Vatican, for the benefit of His Holiness Pius XII only. Nevertheless, the Russians entered Berlin, in spite of the crusade called tor by the pope—and, until now, the fellow-countrymen of Mr. Khrushchev have not shown any eagerness, as far as we know, to appear (141) \"Le Monde\", 13th of April 1956 (Congress of African catholic students).

What went wrong? Had christains not 'told' sufficient beads on their rosaries? Were Heaven's requisite number of 'tens' not fulfilled? We would be tempted to believe this to be the cause if there wasn't that rather scabrous detail in the wonderful story of Fatima. The promise of Russia's conversion, sensibly given to the clairvoyant Lucia in 1917, was \"revealed\" by her in 1941 only, when she had become a nun, and made public in October 1942 by Cardinal Schuster, a keen partisan of the Rome- Berlin Axis; it was made public by reques t, or shall we say order, from Pius XII—this same Pius XII who, th ree months later, expressed the aforementioned call for a Crusade. Very \"enlightening\" indeed: One of Fatima's apologists admits that, because of it, the matter \"evide ntly loses some of its prophetic value...\"(144) This is the least one coul d say about it! A certain canon, great specialist in the matter of the \"Portugues e miracle\" tells us in confidence: \"I must confess that, as far as I am concerned, it is only with great reluctance that I added to my first editions the text revealed to the public by His Eminence Cardinal Schuster...\"(145) We certainly understand the good canon's feelings: So, the Holy Virgin told the shepherdess Lucia, in 1917: \"If my requests are heeded, Russia will be converted...\", while charging her to keep this \"secret\" to herself. How, then, could the Christians have come to know these \"requests\" and meet them? \"Credibile quia ineptum\". It seems that, from 1917 until 1942, \"unfortunate Russia\" did not need to have prayers offered on her behalf, and that they were urgently needed only after the Nazi defeat at Moscow and when von Paulus was trapped in Stalingrad. At least, it is the only conclusion this late revelation allows. The supernatural—as we have said already—is a powerful thing, but it must be handled with some care. After Montoire, the Jesuits' gene ral, Halke von Ledochowski, already spoke haughtily about the general meeting the Company would hold in Rome, after England had capitulated, the importance and brilliance of which would not find an equal in all its history. But Heaven had decided otherwise, in spite of Saint-Theresa and the Lady of Fatima. Great Britain braced herself against the enemy, the United States entered the war, (even though the Jesuit Father Coughlin had (144) Michel Agnellet: \"Miracles a Fatima\" (Ed. de Trevise, Paris 1958, p.54).

For Ledochowski, it was the collapse of his great dream. Wehrmacht, SS, \"cleaner-ups\" and Jesuit converters were retreating together. The general's health did not stand up to such a disaster and he died. Let us see, though, what this \"Russicum\" is which Pius XI and von Ledochowski added, in 1929, to the already so rich and varied Roman organisation. \"With the apostolic Constitution \"Quam Curam\", Pius XI created this Russian seminary, in Rome, where young apostles of every nationality would be trained, \"on condition that they adopt, before anything else, the Byzantine-Slav rite, and that their minds were made up to devote themselves entirely to the task of bringing Russia back into Christ's fold\"(146) This is the aim of the Russian pont ifical College, alias \"Russicum\", the Oriental pontifical Institute and the Roman College—these three Centres are also administered by the Company of Jesus. At the \"Roman College\"—45, Piazza del Gesu—we find the Jesuits' noviceship and, amongst the novices, some bear the name of \"Russipetes\", as they are destined to \"peter e Russiam\", or go to Russia. Orthodox believers should watch out, for so many valorous champions are determined to crush them. We must point out, though, that the aforementioned \"Homme nouveau\" affirms: \"All these priests are certainly destined to go to Russia. But this project cannot be realised for the time being\".(147) According to this particular publica tion, the Soviet press calls these apostles \"the Vatican's parachutists\". And, from the testimony of someone well-informed on the subject, we come to the conclusion that this name fits them quite well. The person in question is no less than the Jesuit Alighiero Tondi, professor at the Gregorian pontofical University, who repudiated Ignatius of Loyola, the \"Spiritual Exercises\" though not without a considerable row and resigned from the famous Company, together with its pomp and deeds. We can read the following, amongst other declarations, in an interview he gave to an Italian newspaper: \"The activities of the Collegium Russ icum and other organisations linked to it are many and varied. For example, to gether with Italian fascists and what remains of Geman nazism, the Jesuits organise and co-ordinate the various anti-Russian groups, on the ecclesiastical authority's order.

In spite of the lessons of History, not fully known or too quickly forgotten, the one who calls himself \"Christ's vicar\" must necessarily incarnate, in the eyes of many, the ideal of love and fraternity taught by the Gospel. Does not logic, as well as sentiment, want it to be so? In reality, the events make us realise that this favourable presumption must be greatly abated—and we believe that it has been sufficiently demonstrated. But the Church is prudent—as we are often reminded—and it is seldom that her real actions are not surrounded by the indisp ensable precautions which will take care of appearances. \"Bonne renommee vaut mieux que ceinture doree\" (A good reputation is better than a golden belt), says the proverb. But it is even better to possess both. The Vatican— immensely rich—guides itself by this maxim. Its political lust for domination always assumes \"spiritual\" and humanitarian pretexts, proclaimed \"urbi and orbi\" by an intense propaganda which a goldplated belt provides for—and the \"good reputation\", thus preserved, maintains the inflow of gold to the said belt. The Vatican does not deviate from that line of conduct and, when the stand it takes in international affairs is clearly revealed through the attitude of its hierarchy, the legend of its absolute impartiality is kept alive by those solemn and ambiguous encyclical letters and other pontifical documents. R ecently, the hitlerian era multiplied such examples. But could it be otherwise of an authoritative power which is supposed to be transcedent and universal at the same time?

This is what happened in Rome, on the 7th of January 1960, concerning the \"summit\" conference which was to br ing together heads of Eastern and Western governments, in an attempt to settle the conditions of a truly peaceful co-existence between the de fenders of two opposite ideologies. Of course, the Vatican's position before such a project did not leave us in any doubt. In the United States, Cardinal Spellman demonstrated it plainly by urging Catholics to show their hostility to Mr. Khrushchev when he was the guest of the American president. For his part, and without expressing it clearly, His Holiness John XXIII had show n little enthusiasm for the \"detente\" in his Chritmas message. The \"hope\" it e xpressed, to see peace set up in the world, a wish which is a \"must\" in such a document, seemed very weak accompanied as it was with many calls to Western leaders to be prudent. But, so far, the Vatican put on a good face. What happened, then, within less th an two weeks? Did another long- cherished \"hope\"—to see the first one fa il—prove vain? Did the decision of Mr. Gronchi, president of the Italian Republic , to go to Moscow make the cup of Roman bitterness overflow? Whatever happened, the storm broke out suddenly on the 7th of January—and the ecclesiastical thunders burst (with unprecedented fury) upon the \"Christian\" Statesmen, guilty of want ing an end to the cold war. On the 8th of January, \"Le Monde\" printed the following: \"On the day the president of the Italian Republic was to leave to pay a minutely-prepared official visit to Moscow's leaders, Cardinal Ottaviani, successor of Cardinal Pizzardo as secretary of the Holy-Office congregation, or chief of the Church's supreme tribunal, delivered a most astonishing speech in the bascilica of \"Saint-Marie-Majeure\", during a morning propitiatory service for \"the Church of Silence\". \"Never before had a prince of the Chur ch, holding one of the Vatican's most important posts, attacked the Soviet authorities, so furiously, nor reprimanded so harshly the West ern powers who dealt with them\". \"Le Monde\" gave substantia l excerpts of that violent speech which amply justified the qualificative of \"most astonishing\" it had just used. \"Tamerlanes's times are back\", affirmed Cardinal Ottaviani—and the Russian leaders were described as \"new antichrists\" who \"condemn to deportation, imprison, massacre, and leave nothing but wasteland behind them\". The orator was shocked that nobody anymore was \"scared to shake hands with them\", and that, \"on the contrary, a race was arrange d to see who would be the first to do so and exchange smiles with them\".

The Western \"politicians and statesmen \" who, according to the cardinal, \"grow stupid with terror\", were severely hauled over the coals—as were all the \"Christians\" who \"do not react or leap with rage any more...\" Finally, this virulent and significant conclusion: \"Can we declare ourselves satisfied with any kind of detente when, in the first place, there cannot be any sort of cal m, within humanity, unless we observe an elementary respect for conscience, our faith, the face of Christ covered once more with spittle, crowned with thorns and struck? Could we hold out our hand to those who do this?\" These dramatic words cannot make us forget that the Vatican can hardly speak of \"respect for consciences\" as it shamelessly oppresses them in countries where it dominates, such as in Franco's Spain where the Protestants are persecuted. In fact, it is most impudent—on the part of the Holy-Office's secretary es pecially!—to demand that others observe this elementary respect\" when the Roman Church rejects it entirely. The encyclical letter \"Quanta cura\" and the \"Syllabus\" are explicit: Anathema on the one who says: every ma n is free to embrace or profess the religion his judgment considers to be right\". (\"Syllabus\", article XV) \"... It is madness to think that the freedom of conscience and worship are mere rights to every man.\" (\"Encyclical letter \"Quanta cura\") Judging by the way it treats \"heretics\" , it is no wonder that the Vatican systematically condemns all attempts to come to terms between \"Christian\" States and those who are officially atheistic. \"Non est pax impilis\"—\"No peace for the wicked\"! And the Jesuit Father Cavelli, like many others before him, proclaims that this \"intransigence\" is the Roman Church's \"most imperative law\". As a counterpart to this explosion of fury on the cardinal's part, we will quote another article which appeared in the same number of \"Le Monde\", on the 9th of January 1960: \"Humanity is approaching a situat ion where mutual annihilation becomes a possibility. In the world today, there is no other event which can be compared, in importance, to this... We must then strive incessantly for a just peace\".

All the members of that famous Company work within the corridors of power, and their action, without making a great deal of noise, can be singularly effective, that is to say evil.

The fate of the nations can be decided better there than around tables\". Its thurifers cannot find refuge in ambiguity any more. The alternative is perfectly clear: \"detente or cold war\".—The Vatican chooses war— and does not hide the fact. This choice should not surprise anyo ne—if past experience, even in the recent past, has been a lesson to us.

We would misjudge the Vatican by thinking it capable of renouncing a hope as old as the Eastern schism itself, the one of bringing back Or thodox believers under her obedience through a military success. Hitler's rise was due to this obstinate hope— but the final defeat of his Crusade still did not open the eyes of the Roman Curia to the folly of such an ambition.

We wager also that it did not cast any shadow over \"the prolonged conversation Mr. Adenauer had with Cardinal Tardini, the Holy See's secretary of State, whom he entertained for luncheon at the German Embassy\".(153) The spectacular intrusion of the Ho ly-Office in international politics, voiced by Cardinal Ottaviani, shocked even Catholics who were long accustomed to the Roman Church's encr oachments in the affairs of State. Rome was aware of it. But the perpetuation of the cold war is so vitally important to the Vatican's political power, and even its financial prosperity, that it did not hesitate repeating such political views, even though the first one had been badly received. The journey Mr. Khrushchev made to France, in March 1960, gave it another opportunity. Dijon was one of the cities the Soviet leader was to visit. Like all his colleagues in the same situation, the mayor of Dijon had to welcome courteously the guest of the French Republic. The chief city of Burgandy had an ecclesiastic as its deputy-mayor, Canon Kir. According to the canonical law, the Holy See had expressly authorised thc priest to accept this double mandate—with all the functions and duties entailed. However, his bishop forb ade the mayor-canon to receive Mr. Khrushchev. On that occas ion, the municipal sash had to give way to the cassock. So, the visitor was welcomed by an assistant who stood in for the absent deputy-mayor. But the unconstrained manner in which the \"hierarchy\" scoffed at civil authority on that occas ion aroused the sharpest comments, On the 30th of March, \"Le Monde\" wrote: \"Who is actually exercising authority over the mayor of Dijon: the bishop or the prefect? And above these representatives of a central power: the pope or the French government? This is the question asked In everyone...\" The answer is not doubtful: theocracy first. But, from now on, to be received by a cassock wearing mayor, will the guests of the French Republic have to be supplied with confession tickets? In the aforementioned article, the edito r of \"Le Monde\" also rightly says: \"Beyond this French interior question, the Kir affair brings to our notice a larger problem.

In the United States especially, the public , which had already witnessed the hostile demonstrations organised by the cardinals Spellman and Cushing during Mr. Khrushchev's visit, starte d to question the real independence a Roman Catholic president could preserve with regard to the Holy See. Many feared, in that case, to see the foreign politics of the country bent in favour of the Roman Church's interest s—to the prejudice of the nation's interests, no small danger in any circumstances, but above all in the present situation. The resistance to the move for an East-West \"detente\" was then organised \"openly\", after the \"bomb\" thrown by Cardinal Ottaviani. A ridiculous instrument, some may say, compared with those which threatened to bury under ruins—soon er or later—nations mad enough to remain in the deadlock of a snarling antagonism. But we can see that the Vatican, compelled to use \"spiritual\" arms, endeavoured to make the best of them. The Jesuits, who steer its diplomacy, were doing their uttermost to ward off the worst \"calamity\" which ever hovered over the Holy See: an international accord which excluded resorting to war. What would become of the Vatican's prestige, its political importance and all the advantages, pecuniary and others, which proceed from it if, because of such an accord, it could not plot an ymore, use its influence, haggle over its co-operation with governments, favour some and bully others, oppose nations, create conflicts for the benefit of its own interests— and if, to serve its immoderate ambitions, it c ould not find any more soldiers? *No one can be deceived—and the Jesuits even less than others—a general disarmament would toll the knell of the Roman Church as a world power. And the \"spiritual\" head itself would totter. We must then expect to see the sons of Loyola opposing with all their arsenal of tricks the desire for peace of nations and governments. To ruin the edifice whose foundations are tentatively laid, they will not spare their mines and counter mines. It is a war without mercy, a holy war, sparked off by Cardinal Ottaviani's mad speech. And th e Company of Jesus will pursue it with the blind obstinacy of the insect—\" ad majorem papae gloriam\"— without any anxiety as to the catastrophes which will result. The world must perish, rather than the supremacy of the Roman Pontiff! *PUBLISHER'S NOTE: Edmond Paris was at a disadvantage in that he wasn't aware that a shift was already under way by the 'Whore of Revelation\" to fulfill Bible proph ecy.

J.T.C. Conclusion We have recapitulated, in this book, the main manifestations of the multiform activity deployed by the Company of Jesus, during four centuries; we have established also that the militant, even military, character of this famous and ultramontane institution fully justifies the title often attributed to it of \"secret army of the Papacy\". To the front of the action, for the glory of God—and especially of the Holy See—is the order these ecclesiastical soldiers gave themselves and of which they are proud; at the same time, they endeavour, through the book and pious press which they supervise, to disguise as much as possible and present as \"apostolic\" enterprises the action they exercise in their favourite field: the nations' politics. The clever camouflage, the protestations of innocence, the railleries about the \"dark schemings\" attribut ed to them by the disordered imagination of their enemies—and which are groundless, according to them—all this is outweighed by the unanimous hostility of public opinion towards them, always and everywhere, and by the inevitable reaction to their intrigues which brought about their explulsion from every country, even from the most strongly Catholic. These fifty-six expulsion s, to quote only the ma in ones, provide an invincible argument! It would be sufficient to prove the evil nature of this Order. How could it not be injurious to civil societies as it is the papacy's most efficacious instrument in imposing its law on temporal governments, and that this law—by nature—has no considera tion for the various national interests? The Holy See, being essentially opportu nist, does embrace these interests when they coincide with its own—we saw th is happen in 1914 and 1939—but, if it brings them a substantial help then, the final result is not beneficial for all that.

By observing some vigilance, one can be forewarned of its underhand thrusts, but its embraces are deadly. On that subject, Mr. T. Jung wrote, in 1874, the following lines which have not grown old-'The power of France is in inverse ratio to the intensity of her obedience to the Roman Curia\".(l) And from a more recent witness: M. Joseph Hours, when studying the effects of our very relativ e \"disobedience\", he wrote: \"There is no doubt about it; right through the continent (and maybe, today, all over the globe), wherever Catholicism is tempted to become political, it is also tempted to become anti-French\".(2) A just remark indeed, even though the term \"tempted\" is rather weak. We will nevertheless conclude that \"to obey\" would be more to the point. Is it not better, in fact, to expose onesel f to this hositlity, rather than to have to come to this conclusion, lik e Colonel Beck, former Foreign Affairs minister of the very Catholic Poland (2a)\". \"The Vatican is one of those principa lly responsible for the tragedy of my country. I realised too late that we ha d pursued our foreign politics just to serve the sole interests of the Catholic Church\". Moreover, the fate of the very aposto lic empire of the Hapsburgs was not too encouraging; as for Germany, so dear to the hearts of popes, and especially Pius XII's, she could not be pleased, finally, with the costly favours Their Holiness lavished on her. In fact, we wonder if the Roman Church reaped any profit at all from this mad aspiration to govern the world, a pretension kept alive by the Jesuits more than anyone else. In the course of four centuries in which these firebrands spread strife and hatred, slaughter and ruins in Europe, from the Thirty Years War until the Hitler Crusade, did the Church enjoy gain or suffer loss? The answer is easy: the clearest and most incontestable result is a continuous diminution of the \"heritage of Saint-Peter\"—a sad end to so many crimes! Did the Jesuits' influence obtain better results within the Vatican itself? It is very doubtful. A catholic author wrote: \"They always aim at concentrating the ecclesiastical power which they control. The pope's infallibility exas perates bishops and governments: they nevertheless ask forit at the Council of Trent and obtain it at the Vatican Council (1870)... The Company's prestige fascinates, within the Church, its (1) T. Jung: \"La France et Rome\", (Charpentier, Paris 1874, p.369).

We have respect or, at least, we fear it; we think it can do anything, a nd we behave accordingly\".(3) Another catholic writer strongly stated the effects of this concentration of power in the Pontiffs hands: \"The Society of Jesus was suspicious of life, the source of heresy, and opposed authority to it. The Council of Trent seems already to be the testament of Catholicism. It is the last genuine Council. \"After that, there will only be the Vatican Council which consecrates the abdication of the councils. We are well aware of the popes' gain at the end of the councils. What a simplification—what an impoverishment also! Roman Christianity takes possession of its character of absolute monarchy, founded now and fo rever on papal infallibility. The picture is beautiful but life bears its costs. Everything comes from Rome, and Rome is left to lean only on Rome\".(4) Further on, the author sums up what the famous Company must be credited for: \"It delayed maybe the de ath of the Church, but by a kind of pact with death\".(5) A kind of sclerosis, if not necrosis, is spreading and corrupting the Church, under that Loyolan ascendancy. Vigilant guardians of the dogma, whose antiquated character they accentuate with their aberrant worship of the Virgin Mary, the Jesuits, masters of the Gregorian Pontifical University which was founded by Ignatius of Loyola, check the teaching of the seminaries, supervise the Missions, reign at the Holy-Office, animate the Catholic Action, censure and direct the religious press in every country, patronize with tender love the great centres of pilgri mages: Lourdes, Lisieux, Fatima, etc. In short, they are everywhere, and we can regard as significant the fact that the pope, when ministering at the mass, is necessarily assisted by a Jesuit; his confessor is always a Jesuit, too. By working at perfecting the concentration of power in the hands of the Sovereign Pontiff, the Company is in fact working for itself and the pope, apparent beneficiary of that work, could echo these famous words: \"I am their chief, so I follow them\". So, it becomes more and more hopeless trying to distinguish the action of the Holy See from the one of the Company. But this Order, the very back bone of the Church, tends to dominate her entirely. For a long time now, the bishops have been nothing more than \"civil servants\", docile executors of the orders coming from Rome, or rather from the Gesu.

The Catholic press, under their direct control, assumes some variety of inspiration, to give its readers the illu sion of a kind of independence, to be open to \"new\" ideas: the Fathers, who are all things to all men, willingly practise these juggler's tricks which deceive only the star-gazers. But, behind these petty amusements, the ev erlasting Jesuit is watching, about whom an aforementioned author wrote: \"Intransigence is inborn in him. Capable of being a shuffler, because of his craftiness, he only excels at being stubborn\".(6) We find excellent examples of that stubborness and insidious bias in the patient work of the Company's members, to conciliate, for better or worse, the \"modern\" and scientific spirit to which th ey take care to be attentive with the demands of the \"doctrine\" in genera l and, especially, with these rather idolatrous forms of devotion—the worship of Mary and wonderworking—of which they remain the most zealous propagators. To say that these efforts are crowned with success would be an exaggeration: when blending water and fire, we obtain mainly steam. But even the inconsistency of these clouds is rather pleasing to certain subtle minds, even though warned about the dangers too much precision in the thoughts brings to a sincere piety. \"Vade retro, Satanas\"! As far as that is concerned, German metaphysics are most helpful; we find in them everything we need, and even the opposite.

Nowadays , the beneficiaries of a newly-found or re-discovered Faith enjoy other favours, especially in the academic and scientific worlds: the not very clever student passes examinations without difficulties; the professor is given the professorial chair of his choice; the physician who is a \"believer\", in addition to rich clients, has preference when wanting to join some important society, etc..

This can be seen in Spain, so we are told, and even elsewhere. In \"Le Monde\" of the 7th of May 1956, M. Henri Fesquet devoted an important article to the Spanish \"Opus Dei\". When defining the action of the pious and occult organisation, he wrote: \"Its members... aim at helping intellectuals to reach a religious state of perfection through the exercise of their professions, and sanctify professional work\". This is no new story, and M. Fesquet kno ws it, for he says a little further on: \"They are accused—and the fact doesn't seem deniable—of wanting to occupy the keyposts of the land, to be at the core of the University, administration, government, to prevent from entering or even expel from them unbelievers and liberals\". The \"Opus\" apparently entered France \"clandestinely\" in November 1954, \"brought in\" by two priests and five laymen, doctors or medical students. That may be so, but we doubt if this reinforcement coming from \"tras los montes\" was really necessary to the pursuit of their work which has been going on for a long time now, in France, mainly in the medical and academic worlds, as certain scandals in examinations and competitions revealed it. In any case, the French branch of this Action, supposed to be \"God's work\", doesn't seem to be clande stine after all, judging by what Francois Mauriac wrote about it: \"... I was the recipient of a strange confid ence, so strange in fact that, if it had not been signed by a Catholic writer who is one of my friends and whom I trust, I would think it was a practical joke. He had offered an article to a periodical which accepted the offer gladly , but never acknowledged its receipt. Months go by, my friend becomes anxious, makes inquiries, and eventually receives this answer from the director of that periodical: \"As you probably know, the \"Opus Dei\" has been checking what we publish for the past few months. And this \"Opus Dei\" absolutely refused to allow that text to be printed\". This friend asks me the question: \"What is the \"Opus Dei\"? And I, too, openly and candidly ask it...\"(7) This question—about which M. Francois Mauriac hints is not as \"candid\" as he says—the eminent academician could have asked it from people he knew well: writers, publis hers, booksellers, men of science, lecturers, theatre and cinema people—unless he preferred to inform himself quite simply at the editing centres. As for the opposition the \"Opus Dei\" is supposed to meet from certain Jesuits, we see in it nothing more than gr oup rivalry.

In fact, the same publication \"Le Monde\" printed an article by M. Jean Creach, ironically inviting us to admire an \"Auto-da-fe of the Spanish Jesuits\", fortunately limited to the works of Fr ench literature. Indeed, this Jesuit censor doesn't seem to be a \"modernist\", judging by what M. Jean Creach says: \"If Father Garmendia had the power of Cardinal Tavera, the one whose gaze was resuscitated by Greco like lightning in a greenish mask, above the purple, Spain would be acquainte d only with our literature by emasculated... or even beheaded authors\". Then, after quoting several amusing examples of the Reverend Father's purifying zeal, the author tells this pertinent reflection: \"Are the brains formed by our Jesuits so weak that they cannot confront even the smallest danger to triu mph over it themselves?\", whispered a mischievous tongue? \"Tell me, dear friend; if they are incapable of it, what is the value of the teaching which renders them so feeble?\"(8) To this humorous critic, we can answer that the said weakness of the brains moulded by the Jesuits is, in f act, the main value of their teaching— and its danger as well. This is the place to which we always have to return. Through a special vocation—and in spite of some honourable, even famous, exceptions— they are the sworn enemies of freedom of the mind: Brainwashed brainwashers! This is their strength, as well as th eir weakness and injuriousness. M.

An undeniable fact remains: the nati onal-socialist government, \"the most Catholic Germany ever had\"(10), was also and by far the most abjectly cruel—without excluding from the comparison the barbarian epochs. Painful declaration indeed for many believers, but one it would be wise meditating upon. In the Order's \"burgs\", where the training was a copy of the Jesuitic method, the master—apparent, at least—of the Third Reich formed this \"SS elite\" before which, according to his wishes, the world \"trembled\"—but also vomited with disgust. The same causes produce the same results. \"There are disciplines too heavy for the human soul to bear and which would utterly break a conscience...

Finally, we borrow from the same author, who analysed Jesuitic fanaticism so well, this final judgment: \"We reproach the Company with its skill, its politics and deceit, we ascribe to it all the calculations, all the hidden motives, all the underhand blows; we reproach her even with th e intelligence of its members. Yet there isn't one country where the Soci ety has not experienced great disappointment, where it hasn't behaved in a scandalous manner and drawn upon itself righteous anger. \"If their machiavellism had the depth ge nerally attributed to it, would these grave and thoughtful men constantly throw themselves into abysses human wisdom can foresee, into catastrophes th ey were bound to expect as the Order experienced similar ones in all civilized States? \"The explanation is simple: a powerful genius governs the Society, a genius so powerful that it thrusts it sometimes even against stumbling- blocks, as if it could break them, ad majorem Dei Gloriam\". \"This genius is not the one of the genera l, of his advice, of the provincials, nor the heads of every household... \"It is the living genius of this va st body, it is the inevitable strength resulting from this gathering of sacrif iced consciences, bound intelligences; it is the explosive strength and domineer ing fury of the Order, resulting from its nature itself.
