It is a legacy that fosters sexism, raci sm, the intoler- ance of difference, and the desecration of the natu ral environ- ment. The Church, throughout much of its history, h as demon- strated a disregard for human freedom, dignity, and self- determination. It has attempted to control, contain and confine spirituality, the relationship between an individua l and God. As a result, Christianity has helped to create a socie ty in which people are alienated not only from each other but a lso from the divine. This Christianity—called \"orthodox Christianity\" he re—is embedded in the belief in a singular, solely mascul ine, authori- tarian God who demands unquestioning obedience and who mercilessly punishes dissent. Orthodox Christians b elieve that fear is essential to sustain what they perceive to be a divinely ordained hierarchical order in which a celestial Go d reigns singularly at a pinnacle, far removed from the eart h and all humankind. While orthodox Christianity originally represented but one of many sets of early Christian beliefs, it was these Christians who came to wield political power. By adapting their Ch ristianity to appeal to the Roman government, they won unpreceden ted authority and privilege. Their church became known as the Church.

In doing so, the Church consistently chose tenets and ideologies that best supported its control over the individual and society. As it took over leadership in Europe and the Roman Empire collapsed, the Church all but wiped out education, technology, science, medicine, history, art and commerce. The C hurch amassed enormous wealth as the rest of society lang uished in the dark ages. When dramatic social changes after the t urn of the millennium brought an end to the isolation of the e ra, the Church fought to maintain its supremacy and control. It ra llied an increasingly dissident society against perceived en emies, instigating attacks upon Muslims, Eastern Orthodox Christians, and Jews. When these crusades failed to subdue diss ent, the Church turned its force against European society it self, launching a brutal assault upon southern France and instituti ng the Inquisi- tion. The crusades and even the early centuries of the In quisition did little to teach people a true understanding of orthodox Christianity. It was the Protestant Reformation and the Catholic Counter Reformation that accomplished this. Only du ring the Reformation did the populace of Europe adopt more t han a veneer of Christianity. The Reformation terrified p eople with threats of the devil and witchcraft. The common per ception that the physical world was imbued with God's presence a nd with magic was replaced during the Reformation with a ne w belief that divine assistance was no longer possible and t hat the physical world belonged only to the devil.

People came to attri bute their sense of powerlessness, not so much to their sinful human nature as to their insignificance in such a world. The the ories of scientists and philosophers such as Isaac Newton, R ene Descartes and Charles Darwin reinforced orthodox Christian be liefs such as the inevitability of struggle and the necessity for domination. Such beliefs, however, are now proving not only to have serious drawbacks, but also to be scientifically limited. Orthodox Christianity has also had devastating impa ct upon humanity's relationship with nature. As people bega n to believe that God was removed from and disdainful of the phy sical world, they lost their reverence for nature. Holidays, whi ch had helped people integrate the seasons with their lives, were changed into solemn commemorations of biblical events bearing no connection to the earth's cycles. The perception of time chang ed so that it no longer seemed related to seasonal cycles.

Those who sought to control spirituality, to restri ct personal relationships with God, gained prominence within th e first centuries of the Christian era. Their beliefs forme d the ideologi- cal foundation for much of the dark side of the Chr istian church's history. Committed to the belief in singul ar supremacy, these orthodox Christians thought that fear and sub mission to hierarchical authority were imperative. Not all Chr istians agreed. In fact, contrary to the conventional depiction of the first centuries of Christianity as a time of harmony and unity, early Christians disagreed about everything from the natu re of God and the roles of men and women to the way one finds enlighten- ment. Perhaps most pivotal to the group of Christians who would triumph—called \"orthodox Christians\" here*—was the belief in a singular supremacy, the belief that divinity is m anifest in only one image.

Different genders, races, classes, or beliefs are all ordered as bette r-than or less- than one another. Even the notion of two differing opinions existing harmoniously becomes foreign; one must pre vail and be superior to the other. Within such a belief structure, God is understood t o reign singularly from the pinnacle of a hierarchy based n ot upon love and support, but upon fear. The Bible repeatedly ex horts people to fear God: \"Fear God, and keep His commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.\" 1 \"Blessed is everyone that feareth the Lord.\" 2 \"Fear Him, which after He hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear Him.\" 3 The third century Church Father, Tertullian, could not imagin e how God could not demand fear: But how are you going to love, without some fear that you do not love? Surely [such a God] is neither your Father, towards whom your love for duty's sake should be consistent with fear because of His power; nor your proper Lord, whom you should love for His humanity and fear as your teacher. 4 One's beliefs about God have impact upon one's beli efs about society. As the Lord's Prayer states, God's will sh ould \"be done on earth as it is in heaven.\" Orthodox Christians believed that people should fear their earthly ruler as they fear God. The fourth century St. John Chrysostom describes the ab solute necessity for fear: . ..if you were to deprive the world of magistrates and the fear that comes from them, houses, cities and nations would fall upon one another in unrestrained confusion, there being no one to repress, or repel, or persuade them to be peace- ful through the fear of punishment. 5 "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"6 THE DARK SIDE OF CHRISTIAN HISTORY To the orthodox, fear was essential to maintaining order. Christians, such as the second century Marcion, who stressed the merciful, forgiving and loving nature of God, f ound them- selves at odds with the orthodox. In orthodox Chris tian eyes, God must be prone to anger and demand discipline an d punish- ment. Tertullian wrote: Now, if [Marcion's God] is susceptible of no feeling of rivalry, or anger, or damage, or injury, as one who refrains from exercising judicial power, I cannot tell how any system of discipline—and that, too, a plenary one—can be consistent in him. 6 Scholars have suggested that the first line of the Christian creed, \"I believe in one God, Father Almighty, Maker of he aven and earth,\" was originally written to exclude Marcion's followers by emphasizing the monotheistic and judgmental nature of God. 7 Orthodox Christians placed great importance upon th e singular authority of the bishop, upon rankings wit hin the clergy, and upon distinction between the clergy and the lai ty. As there is only one God in heaven, declared the first centu ry bishop, Ignatius of Antioch, so there can be only one bisho p in the Church. 8 \"Your bishop presides in the place of God, and you r [priests] in the place... of the apostles,\" he wrot e. \"Apart from these, there is no church.\" 9 Such beliefs and attitudes, however, were certainly not shared by all Christians. The or thodox emphasized rank to such an extent that one Gnostic Christian wrote of them: \"They wanted to command one another, outriva- lling one another in their vain ambition,\" lusting \"for power over one another,\" \"each one imagining that he is s uperior to the others.\" 10 Not all Christians accepted the belief in singular supremacy.

Some th ought of the divine as a dyad; one side being \"the Ineffable, th e Depth, the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"SEEDS OF TYRANNY 7 Primal Father\" while the other side was \"Grace, Sil ence, the Womb and Mother of the All.\" 11 In the Gnostic Apocryphon of John, a vision of God appears saying, \"I am the Father, I am the Mother, I am the Child.\" 12 Theodotus, a Gnostic teacher, said, \"each one knows the Lord after his own fashion, and not all in the same way.\" 13 To root out Gnostic Christians from the orthodox, the second century orthodox Bishop Irenae us encour- aged Christians to \"confess with the tongue one God the Father.\" 14 Without the belief in singular supremacy, it follow ed that Gnostic Christians would also reject hierarchical o rder and strict rankings within their church. In contrast to the or thodox Ignatius of Antioch who believed that the rankings of bishop , priest and deacon mirrored the heavenly hierarchy, 15 some Gnostic Chris- tians did not even differentiate between clergy and laity, much less between stations of the clergy. Tertullian des cribed the Gnostics: So today one man is bishop and tomorrow another; the person who is a deacon today, tomorrow is a reader; the one who is a priest today is a layman tomorrow; for even on the laity they impose the functions of priesthood! 16 And: ...they all have access equally, they listen equally, they pray equally—even pagans, if any happen to come... They also share the kiss of peace with all who come... 17 Within an orthodox belief structure, there is no un derstanding of shared authority and supremacy between genders; one must be superior to the other. Perceiving the singular face of God to be male, orthodox Christians considered male s upremacy an extension of heavenly order.

In the first letter to Timothy, St. Paul says: Let a woman learn in silence with all submissiveness, I permit no woman to teach or to have authority over men; she is to keep silent. 21 When Christian monks in the fourth century hacked t he great scholar Hypatia to death with oyster shells, St. Cy ril explained that it was because she was an iniquitous female wh o had presumed, against God's commandments, to teach men. 22 There were early Christians, however, who embraced neither the idea that God is exclusively male, nor the conc ept of male supremacy. An early group known as the Essenes, man y of whose writings have been discovered in the Dead Sea Scrolls, thought of divinity as having a feminine aspect. In the Essene Gospel of Peace, Jesus says, \"I will lead you into the kingdom of our Mother's angels...\" 23 A Gnostic text tells how Eve, the daughter of Sophia who had wished the first heavenl y light into the world, gives life to Adam: ...[Eve] said, 'Adam, live! Rise up on the earth!' Immediately her word became a deed. For when Adam rose up, immediately he opened his eyes.

Some belie ved that she was the first to see Jesus Christ resurrected and t hat she challenged Peter's authority as part of the emergin g Church hierarchy. Tertullian was appalled at the role of w omen among Gnostics: The... women of the heretics, how wanton they are! For they are bold enough to teach, to dispute, to enact exorcisms, to undertake cures —it may be even to baptize! 25 Another point of contention among Christians dealt with the nature of truth and how an individual might become enlightened. Much of this argument centered around the resurrect ion of Christ, around whether it was Christ's physical bod y or his spirit that had been resurrected. Orthodox Christians insi sted that it had been Christ's physical body, to use Tertullian' s words, his \"flesh suffused with blood, built up with bones, in terwoven with nerves, entwined with veins... \" 26 They believed that since it was Christ's physical body, the resurrection was a one-time occurrence, never to be experienced again. The orthodox insisted that one could learn of Chris t only through those who had experienced this resurrection , the Apostles, or those men appointed as their successor s. This confined power and authority to a small few and est ablished a specific chain of command. 27 It restricted the avenues through which one could discover God. Orthodox, catholic (\" universal\") Christians claimed to be those appointed successors of the Apostles and thus the only ones who could enlighten others.

Even the canonized gospels of M ark and John relate how Jesus first appeared, not to Peter or to the Apostles, but to Mary Magdalene. 31 By Jesus's saying to Mary \"Touch me not,\" 32 some think that Jesus implied he was in spirit for m rather than in physical body. Believing Christ's spirit to have been resurrected suggests that anyone, regardless of his or her rank, could experience or \"see the Lord\" in dreams or vis ions. Anyone could become empowered with the same authori ty as the Apostles. 33 Anyone could have access to and develop his or her own relationship with God. Christians disagreed about the very nature of truth . To the orthodox, who believed that truth could come only t hrough the successors of the Apostles, truth was static and ne ver-changing. It had been revealed only once at the resurrection. Consequently, they thought that one should learn of God only thro ugh the Church, not from personal inquiry and not from one' s own experience. Blind faith was considered more importa nt than personal understanding. Bishop Irenaeus cautioned n ot to seek answers \"such as every one discovers for himself,\" but rather to accept in faith that which the Church teaches and w hich \"can be clearly, unambiguously and harmoniously understood by all.\" 34 He wrote, \"If... we cannot discover explanations of all those things in Scripture... we should leave things of th at nature to God who created us, being most properly assured tha t the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"SEEDS OF TYRANNY 11 Scriptures are indeed perfect.\" 35 Tertullian declared: We want no curious disputation after possessing Christ Jesus, no inquisition after enjoying the gospel! With our faith, we desire no further belief. 36 One should unquestioningly accept and submit to wha tever the Church teaches. Indeed, orthodox Christians deemed rigorous persona l pursuit of truth and understanding an indication of heresy. As Tertullian wrote: This rule... was taught by Christ, and raises amongst ourselves no other questions than those which heresies introduce, and which make men heretics. 37 And: But on what ground are heretics strangers and enemies to the apostles, if it be not from the difference of their teaching, which each individual of his own mere will has either advanced or received? 38 Since the orthodox believed truth to be known only to the successors of the Apostles, one could learn of it only by accepting the Church's teachings in blind faith. Others, however, believing that Christ's spirit and presence could be experienced by anyone at any time, conside red truth to be dynamic and ever-increasing. Some Gnostics belie ved that truth and Gnosis or \"knowledge\" was found, not by looking to the Church, but by looking within oneself. Self-kno wledge would lead to knowing God. A Gnostic teacher named Monoim us wrote: Look for (God) by taking yourself as the starting point... Learn the sources of sorrow, joy, love, hate... If you carefully investigate these matters you will find him in yourself. 39 "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"12 THE DARK SIDE OF CHRISTIAN HISTORY The first century Simon Magus taught that within ea ch human being dwells \"the Boundless power, which... is the root of the universe.\" 40 The path to enlightenment involved not simply accepting the words of the Church on faith, but an active personal search for understanding. A Gnostic text r eads \"...the rational soul who wearied herself in seeking—she le arned about God.\" 41 These Christians believed self-exploration to be im perative to one's spiritual path. In the Gnostic Gospel According to Thomas, Jesus says: If you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you. If you do not bring forth what is within you, what you do not bring forth will destroy you. 42 They believed that searching could dispel the ignor ance that produced a nightmarish existence in which one is ca ught in \"many illusions\" and experiences \"terror and confus ion and instability and doubt and division. \" 43 The Gospel of Truth reads: ignorance... brought about anguish and terror. And the anguish grew solid like a fog, so that no one was able to see. 44 Searching within oneself could bring the knowledge and enlightenment to dispel such ignorance. They believ ed that Jesus had encouraged self-exploration. Jesus said, \"Seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you\" and \" the Kingdom of God is within you.\" 45 Just as the orthodox wanted to control truth, so th ey wanted strict control over who could dispense that truth. Early Christians differed sharply about the role of the C hurch. Gnostic Christians who valued personal exploration believed that the structure of the Church should remain flexible, whi le orthodox Christians insisted upon strict adherence to a sing ular Church. 46 Bishop Irenaeus insisted there could be only one ch urch, and outside that church \"there is no salvation.\" 47 He said of the"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"SEEDS OF TYRANNY 13 Church, \"she is the entrance to life, all others ar e thieves and robbers.\" 48 Ignatius, the Bishop of Antioch, wrote, \"Let no ma n deceive himself: if any one be not within the altar , he is deprived of the bread of God. \" 49 And Clement, the Bishop of Rome from 90-100 C.E., argued that God alone rules all things , that He lays down the law, punishing rebels and rewarding the ob edient, and that His authority is delegated to Church leaders. Clement went as far as to say that whoever disobeys these divine ly ordained authorities has disobeyed God Himself and should re ceive the death penalty. 50 Long before the Church's attempt to control spiritu ality would take its devastating toll, the seeds of its tyranny were evident in the ideology of early orthodox Christians. Their be lief in singular supremacy limited the way one could unders tand God and it eliminated any representation of shared supr emacy. It encouraged a fear-based authoritarian structure tha t segregates people into positions of superiority or inferiority , restricts personal empowerment, and demands unquestioning obe dience.

Christianity owes its large membership to the polit ical maneuvering of orthodox Christians. They succeeded in turning Christianity from an abhorred minor cult into the o fficial religion of the Roman Empire. Their goal was to create what Bishop Irenaeus called \"the catholic church dispersed thro ughout the whole world, even to the ends of the earth.\" 1 To that end, they used nearly any means. They revised Christian writi ngs and adapted their principles to make Christianity more acceptable. They pandered to Roman authorities. They incorporat ed elements of paganism. Orthodox Christianity appealed to the government, not as a religion that would encourage enlightenmen t or spiritual- ity, but rather as one that would bring order and c onformity to the faltering empire.

The 313 C.E. Edict of Milan, for exam ple, granted everyone religious freedom so \"whatever divinity (i s) enthroned in heaven may be well-disposed and propitious towar ds us and all those under our authority.\" 2 Christians, however, believing theirs to be the one and only God, refused to allow Him to be worshipped alongside others. When they refused to p rofess loyalty to the Roman pantheon of gods, Christians w ere seen as likely traitors to the Roman state. For once Roman emperors began to represent themselves as divine, loyalty to the Roman gods also symbolized loyalty to the Roman state. Christians held attitudes that did little to endear them to Romans. Bishop Irenaeus, for example, declared, \"We have no need of the law for we are already far above it in our godly behavior.\" 3 Accounts from around the year 200 reflect the dislike Romans had for Christians: ...they were 'the ultimate filth', a gang 'of ignorant men and credulous women', who 'with meetings at night, solemn fasts and inhuman food' made up 'a hole-in-the-corner, shadow- loving crew', 'silent in public but clacking away in corners', 'spitting on the gods and laughing at holy things...' 4 Yet, despite such an environment, Christians won no t only acceptance but political prominence as the official religion of the Roman Empire under Emperor Constantine in the fourt h century. The orthodox used politically expedient means to ac complish such ends. They designed an organization not to enc ourage spirituality, but to manage large numbers of peopl e. They simplified the criteria for membership.

Some Gnostic Christians, for example, insisted that Jesus had said, \"By their fruits ye shall know them...\" 7 Baptism did not necessarily make one a Christian, they said, since many people \"go down into the water and come up without having received anything.\" 8 The simple standards of the orthodox, however, made it much easier to garner a large following. Orthodox Christians assembled the Bible not to brin g all the gospels together, but rather to encourage uniformit y. From the plethora of Christian gospels, Bishop Irenaeus comp iled the first list of biblical writings that resemble today's New Testament around 180 C.E. By 393 and 397, Bishop Athanasius h ad a similar list ratified by the Church councils of Hip po and Carthage. 9 By prohibiting and burning any other writings, the Catholic Church eventually gave the impression that this Bible and its four canonized Gospels represented the only original Christian view. And yet, as late as 450, Theodore o f Cyrrhus said that there were at least 200 different gospels circulating in his own diocese. 10 Even the Catholic Encyclopedia now admits that the \"idea of a complete and clear-cut canon of the New Testament existing from the beginning... has no fou ndation in history.\" 11 Beyond choosing from the many gospels and writings to construct the Bible, the Church edited its message with each translation.

Attempts at uniformity did not entirely succeed. Ev en the four canonized Gospels contradict one another. The Gospe l of Matthew tells us that Jesus was an aristocrat desce nded from David via Solomon, whereas the Gospel of Luke tells us that Jesus was from much more humble stock, and the Gosp el of Mark says that Jesus was born to a poor carpenter. At his birth, Jesus was visited by kings according to Matthew, bu t according to Luke, he was visited by shepherds. And at Jesus' s death, the Gospels of Mark and Matthew tell us that Jesus's la st words were \"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\" B ut according to Luke, he said, \"Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit,\" and in John he says simply, \"it is fini shed.\" 15 As the authors of Holy Blood, Holy Grail ask, \"How can (the Gospels) be unimpugnable when they impugn each other?\" 16 Yet, it was the Church's insistence upon uniformity that appealed to the Roman Emperor Constantine.

In all likelihood, they compromised the truth of Jesus's political involvement, holding Jews rather than Romans accountable for his death. The canonized Gospels co nspicuously ignore the tension of increasing Jewish resistance to the Roman occupation of Judea during Jesus's lifetime. One ex ception is in the Gospel of Luke when it recounts how authorities \"found this man [Jesus] perverting our nation, and forbidding [ Jews] to give tribute to Caesar.\" 18 Less than 40 years after Jesus's death, that tension erupted into a violent war between the Roma n army and Jews. Jesus was probably engaged in the concerns of his t ime as both a political and spiritual leader. The term Christ, both in Hebrew and in Greek, was a functional title for a k ing or a leader. 19 Given the political environment, it is far more li kely that the Romans—not the Jews—killed him for his pol itical activity. Crucifixion had been the standard Roman p unishment for sedition and the cross a symbol of Jewish resis tance to Roman occupation. 20 Blaming Jews for Jesus's death was most likely a convenient means of obscuring Jesus's poli tical involve- ment and dissociating Christianity from political r ebellion. 21 Once Christianity gained prominence, the orthodox a llowed the Roman emperor to directly influence Christian d octrine.

All reference to a synerg y, an energy, a magic, that could result from two different peopl e coming together was lost. The council eliminated the image of father, mother and child, replacing the Hebrew feminine ter m for spirit, ruah, with the Greek neuter term, pneuma. 26 The trinity was now comprised of the father, the son, and a neuter, sexless spirit. Christians depicted it as three young men o f identical shape and appearance. 27 Later medieval sermons would compare the trinity \"to identical reflections in the severa l fragments of a broken mirror or to the identical composition of wa ter, snow and ice.\" 28 Two popes would ban the seventeenth century Spanis h nun Maria d'Agreda's book, The Mystical City of God, for implying a trinity between God, Mary and Jesus. 29 All allusions to the value of difference were lost; divinity was to be perceived as a singular image, either male or neuter but neve r female.

As Christianity paralleled Mithraism, so the worship o f Mary resembled the worship of faces of the Goddess, part icularly that of mother/son traditions such as Isis/Horus, Juno/M ars, Cybele/ Attis, and Neith/Ra. Mary was perceived to be a mor e accessi- ble, approachable and humane figure than the judgme ntal, almighty God.

Interestingly, the Christian version of feminine di vinity excluded any portrayal of one of the most powerful aspects of the Goddess, the face of the old, wise crone. Three faces of feminine divinity were common throughout pre-Christ ian traditions, that of the Virgin or Maiden, the Mothe r, and the Crone. Mary embodied the first two as both Virgin a nd Mother. The third face of the Crone, representing the culmi nation of feminine power and wisdom, was excluded from the Ch ristian canon of saints.

Pelagius, an Irish monk who arrived in Rome at the beginning of the fifth c entury, believed that a person had freedom of will and resp onsibility for his or her actions. He believed that a person's own efforts play a part in determining whether or not he or she will be saved. In Pelagius's eyes, reliance upon redemption by Christ should be accompanied by individual responsibility and effort s to do good. 2 In granting humans responsibility for their acts, t he Creator gave them freedom. As one historian writes: Pelagius fought for the immeasurably precious good of man's freedom. That freedom cannot be surrendered without loss of human dignity... Unless man's freedom to make his own decisions is recognized, he is reduced to a mer e marionette. According to Pelagius, the Creator conferred moral authority upon man, and to detract from that authority is to cast doubt upon man's likeness to God. 3 Pelagius' most vehement opposition came from St. Au gustine, the celebrated Doctor of the Church and Bishop of H ippo. Salvation, as Augustine saw it, is entirely in God' s hands; there is nothing an individual can do. God has chosen but a few people to whom He will give bliss and salvation. It is for these few that Christ came into the world. All others are damned f or all eternity. In Augustine's eyes, it is only God's gra ce and not any action or willingness on the part of the individual that leads to salvation.

Human sexuality, to Augustine, clearly demonstrates a human inability to choose good over evil. Augustine based this belief upon his own experience. Having himself led a promi scuous life in his youth during which he fathered and then aban doned an illegitimate child, he thought that sex was intrins ically evil. He complained of sexual desire: Who can control this when its appetite is aroused? No one! In the very movement of this appetite, then, it has no 'mode' that responds to the decisions of the will... Yet what he wishes he cannot accomplish... In the very movement of the appetite, it has no mode corresponding to the decision of the will. 6 According to Augustine, human will is powerless eit her to indulge sexual desire or to suppress it: But even those who delight in this pleasure are not moved to it at their own will, whether they confine themselves to lawful or transgress to unlawful pleasures; but sometimes this lust importunes them in spite of themselves, and sometimes fails them when they desire to feel it, so that though lust rages in the mind, it stirs not in the body. Thus, strangely enough, this emotion not only fails to obey the legitimate desire to beget offspring, but also refuses to serve lascivious lust; and though it often opposes its whole combined energy to the soul that resists it, sometimes also it is divided against itself, an d while it moves the soul, leaves the body unmoved. 7 "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"DECIDING UPON DOCTRINE 33 \"This diabolical excitement of the genitals,\" as Au gustine referred to sex, is evidence of Adam's original sin which is now transmitted \"from the mother's womb,\" tainting all human beings with sin, and leaving them incapable of choo sing good over evil or determining their own destiny. 8 Augustine's views regarding sexuality differed shar ply from pre-Christian views which often considered sex to b e an integral part of the sacredness of life. His views did, howe ver, represent those of many Christians. With the exception of min or heretical groups such as the Gnostic Carpocratians who exalte d sex \"as a bond between all created things,\" 9 nearly all Christians thought that sex should be avoided except for purposes of p rocreation.

Furthermore, if a person could choose to reunite wi th God in any one of many lifetimes, then there would be litt le fear of eternal damnation—and fear was deemed essential by the orthodox. Origen's idea that the soul is separable from the body also seemed to diminish the extraordinary nature of Christ's resurrection. The miracle of Christ's resurrection was understood to offer the possibility of overcoming physical death. If, however, each soul periodically overcomes death by separating from one body and entering into another, then Jesus 's feat would not have been unique. Origen's work also challenged the Church's control of intellectual and spiritual pursuit. Although he met iculously cited scripture to support his beliefs, Origen found that the scriptures provided limited direction in certain areas. Having received the education of a learned Greek, Origen continued to s eek answers both in Platonic philosophy and in his own imaginat ion when scripture was unavailing. 18 Augustine, too, had pondered questions to which scripture provided little guidan ce. Augustine asked, for example: ...and what before that life again, O God my joy, was I anywhere or in any body? For this I have none to tell me, neither father nor mother, nor experiences of others, nor mine own memory. 19 Whereas Origen continued to contemplate and explore such questions, Augustine retreated from inquiry outside the scripture.

(Ecclesiastes 3:22) 20 Augustine went so far as to entertain the idea that before creating the world, God had busied Himself preparing a plac e of punishment for those with the audacity to question what had preceded creation. 21 Although Origen died in 284, debate over his theori es continued until 553 when he was officially anathema tized, or cursed, by the Second Council of Constantinople. In condemning Origen, the Church indirectly dealt with the issue of reincarnation. Christians were not to believe in th e pre-existence of souls, the existence of discarnate consciousness , or that a person has any more than this one lifetime to turn to the Christian God without being subject to eternal damn ation.

Augustine contended: The wounds of a friend are better than the kisses of an enemy. To love with sternness is better than to deceive with gentleness... In Luke 14:23 it is written: 'Compel people to come in!' By threats of the wrath of God, the Father draws souls to the Son. 24 Even at the beginning of the twentieth century Pope Leo XIII still argued that the ends justified the means: The death sentence is a necessary and efficacious means for the Church to attain its end when rebels act against it and disturbers of the ecclesiastical unity, especially obstinate heretics and heresiarchs, cannot be restrained by any other penalty from continuing to derange the ecclesiastical order and impelling others to all sorts of crime...

Why does an almighty God, who cr eates everything, create human suffering? The most common answer is that there must be a conflicting force, power, o r god creating the evil; there must be a devil. A dualistic theolo gy arises which understands life to be a struggle between God and s atan, between good and evil, and between spirit and matter. The c oncept of a devil is exclusive to monotheism; evil is easier to understand and does not pose the need for a devil when there are m any faces of God. In his book Religion and the Decline of Magic, Keith Thomas writes of early, pre-monotheistic Judaism: The early Hebrews had no need to personify the principle of evil; they could attribute it to the influence of other rival deities. It was only the triumph of monotheism which made it necessary to explain why there should be evil in the world if God was good. The Devil thus helped to sustain the notion of an all-perfect divinity. 26 Mannichaeans embraced orthodox Christian ideology m ore completely than the early Catholic Church. They too k the idea seriously that spirituality and godliness are detac hed from the physical world. The belief in a singular supremacy creates a hierarchy that separates its components, creating a division between heaven and earth, between spirit and matter . The components higher up on the hierarchy are considere d good; the components lower down are considered evil. Accordingly, Mannichaeans advocated stringent asceticism and wit hdrawal from the world. Women, seen to tempt men with the e arthly pleasures of sex and family, were considered to be part of satan's forces. To be closer to God, Mannichaeans b elieved that one must avoid anything that would bind one to eart hly life.

Mannichaeanism may have been more consistent with orthodox ideology, but it was politically imprudent. Mannichaeans and all others who promoted similar ideas in the centuries that followed were labelled heretics. The tenets formulated in response to early heretics lent doctrinal validation to the Church's control of the individual and society. By opposing Pelagius, the Church adopted A ugustine's idea that people are inherently evil, incapable of choice, and thus in need of strong authority. Human sexuality is see n as evidence of their sinful nature. By castigating Origen's the ories of reincarnation, the Church upheld its belief in the unique physical resurrection of Christ as well as the belief that a person has but one life in which to obey the Church or risk eterna l damnation.

By the second centu ry B.C.E., Hipparchus had invented longitude and latitude and had deter- mined the obliquity of the ecliptic. 9 After the onset of the Dark Ages, however, it would not be until the sixteenth century C.E. that Copernicus would reintroduce the theory that t he earth revolves around the sun. And when Galileo attempted to promote the heliocentric theory in the seventeenth century, he was tried by the Inquisition in Rome. Only in 1965 did the Ro man Catholic Church revoke its condemnation of Galileo.

What was demanded was not criticism but credulity. The Church Fathers observed that in the realm of thought only heresy had a history. 12 Eusebius of Caesarea set about during the time of C onstantine to rewrite the history of the world into a history of Christianity: 'Other writers of history,' Eusebius wrote, recorded the fighting of wars waged for the sake of children and country and other posses- sions.

Perhaps most remarkable is that these cultures show no evid ence of hierarchy as we know it; they knew no war, organize d oppres- sion or slavery. 15 Rewriting history to erase awareness of such a past helped those in power deflect criticism for the current st ate of affairs. Portraying human society as having steadily evolved rather than having experienced major setbacks gives the impress ion that, however ugly and violent society may be now, it was even more savage in the past. Augustine's disciple, Orosius, for instance, in his Seven Books of Histories against the Pagans, demonstrated that the evils of the time could not be blamed on C hristianity because earlier times had experienced even worse ca lamities. 16 Distorting and rewriting history gave the impressio n that Christianity had not only lifted society from harsh er, more barbaric times, but that a social structure of hier archy and domination had always existed and was therefore ine vitable. The Christian church had similar impact upon educat ion and learning. The Church burned enormous amounts of lit erature. In 391 Christians burned down one of the world's great est libraries in Alexandria, said to have housed 700,000 rolls. 17 All the books of the Gnostic Basilides, Porphyry's 36 volumes, pa pyrus rolls of 27 schools of the Mysteries, and 270,000 ancient documents gathered by Ptolemy Philadelphus were burned. 18 Ancient academies of learning were closed.

According to orthodox Christianity, art should enha nce and promote Christian values; it should not serve simpl y as an individual's creative exploration and expression. N ew works of art which did not concur with the Church's ideology would not be created again until the Renaissance. Marble stat ues of ancient Rome were torn down, most notably by Gregory the Gr eat, and made into lime.

At least forty different Popes are known to have bough t their way into the papacy. 32 Allegations of murder and crime within the Church abounded as the papacy so frequently changed hands. In a particular one hundred year period, more than for ty Popes came to office. In the twelve year period from 891 to 903 alone, no less than ten different Popes held power. 33 The Church amassed inordinate wealth during the Dar k Ages. Patrimonial properties, the Church-held lands that were free and clear of taxes or military obligation to the king, made up between one-quarter and one-third of western Europe . 34 In addition to patrimony, bishops often held territori es in feudal tenure, obliging them like any count or baron to pr ovide the king with soldiers when called. The Church made money by collect- ing revenues from imperial rulers, by confiscating property as the result of court judgments, by selling the remis sion of sins (called \"indulgences\"), by selling ecclesiastical o ffices (called \"simony\"), and sometimes by simply taking land by f orce. 35 Alliances with the state were essential to the Chur ch's secular influence and wealth. However, unlike during the Ro man Empire, several imperial forces now held power. By the year 700, for example, the West was divided into four po litical realms. Spain was ruled by the Christian Visigoths and would fall in 711-713 to the Islamic Moors. Anglo-Saxons ruled England. The Franks ruled Gaul. Italy was held prim arily by the Lombards with a few regions still in the hands of t he Byzantine Empire. 36 The new, more complicated alliance between the Church and various imperial rulers came to be known as the Holy Roman Empire and was best symbolized by the Po pe's crowning of Charlemagne in 800 and the German king, Otto I, in 952.

They came to be as powerful and as influ ential as the greatest of feudal lords. The historian Jeffrey Bur ton Russell writes: The system was self-perpetuating: the more power and wealth the bishops had, the more the kings needed to appoint loyal men; but to secure and preserve the loyalty of such men, the kings had to bestow upon them further power and wealth. It is no wonder that the bishops kept their eyes more attentively upon the throne than upon the cross. 37 In an age when the belief in the divine right of ki ngs prevailed, the Pope's support of a king was thought to be esse ntial. The Church also brought a semblance of unity to an impe rial realm by converting its people to Christianity. These widespread conversions, however, were usually little more than a facade. Pope Gregory I in a letter to h is emissary to Britain, St. Augustine of Canterbury, illustrates h is concern with the appearance that people had converted to Christi anity: ...the people will have no need to change their place of concourse; where of old they were wont to sacrifice cattle to demons, thither let them continue to resort on the day of the Saint to whom the Church is dedicated, and slay their beasts, no longer as a sacrifice to demons, but for a social meal in honour of Him whom they now worship. 38 Although the medieval Church wrought havoc in most arenas of life, it did not effect real change in the way c ommon people perceived God.

Latin classics, largely lost under Christian rule, were translated from Arabic back into Latin. When Aristo tle's work was reintroduced to the West, its example of system atic thought spawned scholasticism, a discipline that challenged the Church's demand that one accept its assertions on blind fait h. The twelfth century Peter Abelard, for example, used the schola stic method to encourage individual decision-making, to questio n authoritar- ian assertions, and to point out contradictions in Church doctrine and scripture. The Church's confinement of all education and creat ivity to monasteries began to break down. Not only were lay schools created to provide elementary education to merchant and artisan classes, but universities were formed in urban area s such as Paris, Oxford, Toulouse, Montpellier, Cambridge, Sa lerno, Bologna and Salamanca. 3 The age saw literary epics and romances such as The Romance of the Rose, The Song of the Cid, Arthur's Knights of the Round Table, the Nibelungenlied, and Dante's Divine Comedy. 4 Court jesters or fools provided contemporary sources of vernacular poetry and liter ature. Renewed interest in architecture produced the culmi nation of the Romanesque style and the beginning of Gothic artist ic and engineering feats.

Papal prohibitions in 1210 and 1215 restrict ed the teaching of Aristotle's works in Paris.

As the twelfth century Christ ian Honorius of Autun asked: How is the soul profited by the strife of Hector, the arguments of Plato, the poems of Virgil, or the elegies of Ovid, who, with others like them, are now gnashing their teeth in the prison of the infernal Babylon, under the cruel tyranny of Pluto? 8 The Church regarded poetry with particular disfavor , sometimes classifying poets with magicians whom the Church de spised. The illustrations in the twelfth century Hortus deliciarum of Herrad of Landsberg, for example, depict four \"poets or ma gicians,\" each with an evil spirit prompting him. 9 Clerics insisted that court jesters also \"have no use or virtue\" and are \"beyond hope of salvation.\" 10 Orthodox Christians expressed disdain for the flour ishing creativity and declared supporters of the arts to b e heathens and pagans.

Books, particularly thos e of Latin and Italian poets, illuminated manuscripts, women's orn aments, musical instruments, and paintings were burned in a huge bonfire in 1497, destroying much of the work of Renaissance Florence. Yet medieval society abounded with dissent. Many be gan to seek a relationship with God outside of the Church. Common people in the Middle Ages found little in the Churc h to which they could relate. Churches had become grander and more formal, sharply emphasizing the difference between the clergy and laity. In some churches, a choir screen would e ven segregate the congregation from the altar. The language of th e Mass, which in the fourth century had been changed from G reek to Latin so as to be more easily understood, was by th e end of the seventh century totally incomprehensible to most pe ople, including many priests. As a result, services were often an unintelligible mumbling which was absolutely meanin gless to the congregation. 12 The Church, now enormously wealthy, interested itse lf more in collecting money than in relating to its members . The medieval Church's preoccupation with riches was suc h that its ten commandments were said to have been reduced to one: \"Bring hither the money.\" 13 Priests were selected more on the basis of their money than upon any other virtue.

These medieval heresies exhibited great diversity o f thought. There were apocalyptic sects that were convinced th at the world was coming to an end, such as those led by Tancheli n, Peter de Bruys, Henry of Lausanne, and Arnold of Brescia. Ot her groups such as the Waldensians and Lollards foreshadowed t he Protes- tants in their desire for a stricter adherence to C hristian scrip- ture. And yet other groups like the Brethren of the Free Spirit, the Tulupins, and the Adamites embraced pantheistic and animistic beliefs that perceived the physical world to be wholly imbued with God's presence. 17 At the turn of the fourteenth century, Meister Eckhart challenged the very need f or a Church. He wrote, \"When the Kingdom appears to the soul and it is recognized, there is no further need for preaching or instruc- tion.\" 18 Many heretics insisted upon a direct relationship w ith God. Despite the danger, they translated the Bible into common or vernacular languages which lay people could underst and. Simple possession of such a Bible was punishable by death. 19 In the spirit of providing images to which people could re late, the portrayal of Christ also became more human and acce ssible. From Romanesque depictions of Jesus as the stiff, h ieratic, and unapproachable judge of the universe, Gothic art no w portrayed him as more of a suffering, compassionate human bei ng. 20 The cult of the Virgin blossomed in the Middle Ages .

A nun who leaves her convent to plunge into vice, but keeps praying to Mary, returns at last to find that Mary has taken her place and no one has missed her. 21 Complete litanies were devoted to the Virgin Mary. The grandest of medieval cathedrals were dedicated to her: at Pa ris, Chartres, Reims, Amiens, Rouen, Bayeux, Coutances, Noyon, and Laon. 22 She developed names like \"spiritual vessel,\" \"cause of our joy,\" \"Ark of the Covenant\" and \"Seat of Wisdom.\" Chauce r refers to her as the \"almighty and all merciful Queen.\" 23 A painted wooden figure of the Madonna and child by a fourtee nth century German artist gives an indication of medieval vener ation for this female image of divinity. When her figure is opene d, the Madonna is shown to contain the whole Trinity. 24 The Church responded, not by trying to meet people' s needs, but by strengthening its own authoritarian structur e, developing its own judicial system, and more forcefully assert ing its supremacy over all.

The eleventh century Ivo of Chartres and the twelft h century Gratian reworked the bulk of uncoordinated and ofte n conflicting decrees and letters into comprehensive codes that a sserted the Pope's supremacy. Should the Pope himself find thes e laws inconvenient, however, he was allowed under these s ame canon laws to dispense with them at any time. Ecclesiasti cal tribunals claimed jurisdiction over all cases in which Church interests were at stake such as those concerning tithes, bene fices, dona- tions and wills. To protect its own, the Church cla imed the right to try all members of the clergy. 29 The Church also claimed jurisdiction over any matter pertaining to a sacram ent or an oath. As one historian points out, \"there was scarcely a limit to [the Church's] intervention; for in medieval society wel lnigh every- thing was connected with a sacrament or depended up on an oath.\" 30 Many of the Church's efforts at systematizing and a dding credence to canon law focused upon establishing the Pope's supremacy over imperial powers. The theory of the \" plentitude of power\" gave the Pope as the vicar of Christ full authority over both secular and spiritual affairs. It allowed him to prohibit the distribution of sacraments within an imperial r ealm and to both excommunicate and depose a king. 31 Dictates of canon law invalidated the ordination of imperially appointed Popes, called anti-popes, and any members of the clergy ordained as a result of such imperially appointed Popes."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"THE CHURCH FIGHTS CHANGE 63 Ancient letters were \"discovered\" and incorporated into canon law as evidence of the Pope's supremacy over imperial powers.

It reads, \"We give to... Sylvester, the Universal P ope... the city of Rome and all the provinces, districts, and citie s of Italy and the Western regions...\" 32 By the sixteenth century these letters were exposed as total forgeries. The Pope became increasingly involved in directing political conflicts and the conquering of lands.

Seeing them selves as superior to all other mortals, Popes claimed not on ly that every person was subject to papal authority, but that the Pope himself was accountable to no one but God. In 1302 Pope Bon iface issued the bull Unam Sanctam: Therefore, if the earthly power errs, it shall be judged by the spiritual power... but if the su- preme spiritual power errs it can be judged only by God, and not by man... Therefore we de- clare, state, define and pronounce that it is altogether necessary to salvation for every human creature to be subject to the Roman pontiff. 36 Understandably, arguments erupted over who would be Pope and hold such power. In what was called the Great Schis m, two separate lines of Popes, one living in Rome and one in Avignon, reigned from 1378 to 1417. They disagreed, not over matters concerning Christian ideology or religious practice s, but over politics and who should reign. Another means with which the Church responded to th e time was an attempt to focus attention away from the tum ultuous social changes and towards an outside enemy.

Crusaders, caught up in their sense of righteousnes s, brutally attacked the Church's enemies.

Numbers of the Saracens were beheaded... Others were shot with arrows, or forced to jump from the towers; others were tortured for several days, then burned with flames. In the streets were seen piles of heads and hands and feet. One rode about everywhere amid the corpses of men and horses. In the temple of Solomon, the horses waded in the blood up to their knees, nay, up to the bridle. It was a just and marvelous judgement of God, that this place should be filled with the blood of unbelievers. 39 Nicetas Choniates, a Byzantine chronicler, wrote, \" Even the Saracens (the Muslims) are merciful and kind compar ed to these men who bear the cross of Christ on their shoulders .\" 40 Another enemy targeted by the crusades was the East ern Church based in Constantinople. The cultures of the East and West had been growing apart for centuries. Having u pheld more respect for the arts, literature and education, Eas tern culture seemed more sophisticated than the West. The East h ad rever- ently preserved the writings of the ancient Greeks. Greek remained the official language of law, government, the Eastern church, and Eastern literature.

They celebrated Easter on different days. They differed in their views regarding the us e of icons, and in the ordering of the Holy Trinity in the Nice ne Creed. 43 There was little that the East and West now shared in common other than that they both considered themselves Chr istian. In 1054, after attempts at reconciling the differen ces between Rome and Constantinople failed, the two branches of Christianity formalized their separation. To a Roman Church that vigorously asserted its supremacy over all, however, such a se paration was seen as an affront to and a rejection of the Pope's authority.

Many races lived together harmoniously— Greeks, Phoenicians, Jews and Muslims. Jews were not only f ree from persecution, but held management and advisory posit ions with lords and even prelates. There was less class disti nction, a milder form of serfdom, freer towns, and a judicial system based upon Roman law. 64 Nowhere were citizens as educated. 65 Culture and commerce flourished, making it one of the most pros perous regions in Europe. Catharism incorporated diverse religious elements. There is evidence of a strong connection between Catharism, Moslem Sufi communities and the Jewish Kabbalist tradition. 66 Women served as priests and could administer even the most impor tant rite, the consolamentum. 67 Cathars were closely associated with the Troubadours, the writers of romantic poetry, and we re thought to believe that God was manifest in nature's colors and sounds. 68 They were liked and protected both by the upper cla sses and by their Catholic neighbors to such an extent that, wh en the Roman Catholic Church later attacked, many Catholics chos e to die rather than turn their Catharan neighbors over to t he Church. 69 Responding to the growing popularity of the Cathars , the Catholic Church accused them of the standard malefa ctions: desecrating the cross and the sacraments, cannibali sm, renounc- ing Christ, and sexual orgies. 70 And, yet, the Catholic St. Bernard, who was hardly a friend of the Cathars, sa id of them: If you interrogate them, nothing can be more Christian; as to their conversation, nothing can be less reprehensible, and what they speak they prove by deeds.

While this set a precedent for providing the Church with a warlike militia to fight the Church's private quarrels, 74 it failed to rally force against the popular Catha rs.

Pope Innocent III de clared \"that anyone who attempted to construe a personal view of God which conflicted with Church dogma must be burned without pity.\" 3 Before the Inquisition was fully underway, the Chur ch welcomed heretics back to its fold under terms it c onsidered reasonable. The following is an example of such ter ms: On three Sundays the penitent is to be stripped to the waist and scourged by the priest from the entrance of the town... to the church door. He is to abstain forever from meat and eggs and cheese, except on Easter, Pentecost, and Christ- mas, when he is to eat of them as sign of his abnegation of his Manichaean errors. For twoscore days, twice a year, he is to forgo the use of fish, and for three days in each week that of fish, wine, and oil, fasting, if his health and labors will permit. He is to wear monastic vestments, with a small cross sewed on each breast. If possible, he is to hear mass daily and on feast-days to attend church at vespers. Seven times a day he is to recite the canonical hours, and, in addition the Paternoster ten times each day and twenty times each night. He is to observe the strictest chastity. Every month he is to show this paper to the priest, who is to watch its observance closely, and this mode of life is to be maintained until the legate shall see fit to alter it, while for infraction of the penance he is to be held as a perjurer and a heretic, and to be segregated from the society of the faithful. 4 Few heretics returned to the Church of their own ac cord."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"78 THE DARK SIDE OF CHRISTIAN HISTORY The Church turned to its own canon law to authentic ate an agency which could enforce adherence to Church auth ority. In 1231 Pope Gregory IX established the Inquisition as a separate tribunal, independent of bishops and prelates. Its administrators, the inquisitors, were to be answerable only to the Pope. 5 Its inquisitional law replaced the common law tradition of \"innocent until proven guilty\" with \"guilty until proven inno cent.\" 6 Despite an ostensible trial, inquisitional procedur e left no possibility for the suspected to prove his or her i nnocence; the process resulted in the condemnation of anyone even suspected of heresy. 7 The accused was denied the right of counsel. 8 No particulars were given as to the time or place of t he suspected heresies, or to what kind of heresies were suspecte d. A suspected friendship with a convicted heretic was also a crim e, yet no information was given as to which heretic the accus ed was to have \"adored.\" The names of the accusing witnesses were kept secret. 9 One's only recourse was an appeal to the Pope in R ome which was so futile as to be farcical. 10 The friar Bernard Delicieux declared: .. .that if St. Peter and St. Paul were accused of 'adoring' heretics and were prosecuted after the fashion of the Inquisition, there would be no defense open for them. 11 The inquisitor presided over inquisitional procedur e as both prosecutor and judge.

Inquisitors grew very rich. They received bribes an d annual fines from the wealthy who paid to escape accusatio n. 15 The Inquisition would claim all the money and property of alleged heretics. 16 As there was little chance of the accused being pr oven innocent, there was no need to wait for conviction to confiscate his or her property. 17 Unlike Roman law that reserved a portion of property for the convicted's nearest heirs, cano n and inquisi- tional law left nothing. Pope Innocent III had expl ained that God punished children for the sins of their parents. So unless children had come forth spontaneously to denounce their pare nts, they were left penniless. Inquisitors even accused the d ead of heresy, sometimes as much as seventy years after their deat h. They exhumed and burned the alleged heretic's bones and then confiscated all property from the heirs. 18 Inquisitors rarely shared the money collected with the episcopal courts, the civil government, or spent it building churches as planned. 19 One historian writes how the inquisitor was often able to \"seize everything for himself, no t even sending a share to the officials of the Inquisition at Rome .\" 20 Inquisitors were reluctant to pay for even the cost of feeding their victims, encouraging the families or the community to pay su ch costs. It was hardly a coincidence that the eagerness of the Inquisition in any given region was proportionate to the opportuni ties for confiscation. 21 Ironically, inquisitors were most often chosen from Domini- can and Franciscan orders, both of which originally professed vows of poverty. The Church did little to encourage their ideal of poverty. Although it regarded the Franciscan fou nder, Francis of Assisi, as a saint, the Church persecuted Franci s's followers who upheld his ideas of poverty, those known as the Fraticelli, or \"Spiritual Franciscans.\" The Church denounced th e Fraticelli as \"false and pernicious\" and in 1315 excommunicate d them. 22 "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"CONTROLLING THE HUMAN SPIRIT 81 Pope Martin V ordered their village of Magnalata le veled and every resident slain. 23 The Franciscans who abandoned Francis's teachings, however, were often appointed as inquisi tors. While it did not overtly endorse the Inquisition's avaric e and corrup- tion, the Church did little to stop it. The Inquisition had devastating economic impact. As ide from directly seizing the property of successful merchan ts by accusing them of heresy, inquisitors crippled commerce by ho lding certain operations suspect. For example, maps and map-maker s, so essential to navigating traders and merchants, were held in deep suspicion. Inquisitors believed the printed word to be a channel of heresy and so hampered the communication produce d by the fifteenth century invention of the printing press. 24 The mere suspicion of heresy annulled all rights of the susp ected individ- ual. 25 When accused, all debts owed by the heretic and an y liens which secured those debts became null and void. The historian Henry Charles Lea writes: As no man could be certain of the orthodoxy of another, it will be evident how much distrust must have been thrown upon even the commonest transactions of life. The blighting influence of this upon the development of commerce and industry can readily be perceived, coming as it did at a time when the commercial and industrial movement of Europe was beginning to usher in the dawn of modern culture. 26 While inquisitors themselves prospered, their activ ity left communities impoverished.

Of the sentences, pilgrimages were considered the l ightest. Yet, undertaken on foot, such penances could take y ears, during which the penitent's family might perish. 28 Carrying a much greater stigma than pilgrimages was \"wearing the cr osses,\" also known as poena confusibilis or \"humiliating punishment.\" The penitents were required to wear large saffron-color ed crosses on the front and back, which subjected them to public ridicule and hindered every effort of earning a livelihood. 29 A more frequent sentence was perpetual imprisonment, which always e ntailed a scant diet of bread and water, sometimes meant bein g kept in chains, and occasionally entailed solitary confinem ent. The life expectancy in all the prison sentences was very sho rt. 30 The harshest sentence of burning at the stake was g iven to those who either failed in their previous penance, relapsed into heresy, or who would not confess to any crime. Alth ough the Church had begun killing heretics in the late fourt h century and again in 1022 at Orlean, papal statutes of 1231 now insisted that heretics suffer death by fire. 31 Burning people to death techni- cally avoided spilling a drop of blood. The words o f the Gospel of John were understood to sanction burning: \"If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is wit hered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.\" 32 The Church distanced itself from the killing by tur ning heretics over to secular authorities for the actual burning. Such secular authorities, however, were not allowed to d ecline. When the Senate of Venice in 1521 refused to approve suc h executions, for example, Pope Leo X wrote that secular official s were: ...to intervene no more in this kind of trial, but promptly, without changing or inspecting the sentences made by the ecclesiastical judges, to execute the sentences which they are enjoined to carry out. And if they neglect or refuse, you (the"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"CONTROLLING THE HUMAN SPIRIT 83 Papal legate) are to compel them with the Church's censure and other appropriate measures. From this order there is no appeal. 33 In practice, any secular authorities who refused to cooperate were excommunicated and subject to the same treatme nt as suspected heretics. 34 By far the cruelest aspect of the inquisitional sys tem was the means by which confessions were wrought: the tortur e chamber. Torture remained a legal option for the Church from 1252 when it was sanctioned by Pope Innocent IV until 1917 wh en the new Codex Juris Canonici was put into effect. 35 Innocent IV authorized indefinite delays to secure confessions, giving inquisitors as much time as they wanted to torture the accused. 36 Although the letter of law forbade repeating tortur e, inquisitors easily avoided this rule by simply \"continuing\" tor ture, calling any interval a suspension. 37 In 1262 inquisitors and their assistants were granted the authority to quietly ab solve each other from the crime of bloodshed. 38 They simply explained that the tortured had died because the devil broke their nec ks. Thus, with license granted by the Pope himself, inq uisitors were free to explore the depths of horror and cruel ty. Dressed as black-robed fiends with black cowls over their h eads, inquisitors extracted confessions from nearly anyon e. The Inquisition invented every conceivable devise to in flict pain by slowly dismembering and dislocating the body. Many of these devices were inscribed with the motto \"Glory be onl y to God.\" 39 The rack, the hoist and water tortures were the mos t common. Victims were rubbed with lard or grease and slowly roasted alive. 40 Ovens built to kill people, made infamous in twent ieth century Nazi Germany, were first used by the Christ ian Inquisition in Eastern Europe. 41 Victims were thrown into a pit full of snakes and buried alive.

Juan de Mariana reported in the 1490's that people ...were deprived of the liberty to hear and talk freely, since in all cities, towns and villages there were persons placed to give information of what went on. This was considered by some the most wretched slavery and equal to death. 44 A writer in 1538 described life in the Spanish city of Toledo: ...preachers do not dare to preach, and those who preach do not dare to touch on contentious matters, for their lives and honour are in the mouths of two ignoramuses, and nobody in this life is without his policeman... Bit by bit many rich people leave the country for foreign realms, in order not to live all their lives in fear and trembling every time an officer of the Inquisition enters their house; for continual fear is a worse death than a sudden demise. 45 The Inquisition often targeted members of other rel igions as severely as it did heretics. The Inquisition now le nt its authority to the long-standing Christian persecution of Jews. Particularly during the Christian Holy Week of the Passion, Chri stians frequently rioted against Jews or refused to sell t hem food in hopes of starving them. 46 At the beginning of the thirteenth century, Pope Innocent III required Jews to wear di stinctive clothing. 47 In 1391 the Archdeacon of Seville launched a \"Holy 6.2 A mass burning or auto-da-fe.

Muslims experienced little better. Not surprisingly , Islamic countries offered far safer sanctuaries to escaping Jews than Christian lands. Historians have often diminished Christian responsi bility for the Inquisition by dividing the Inquisition into th ree separate phases: the medieval, the Spanish and the Roman. Th e greater secular influence of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabe lla is thought to separate the Spanish Inquisition from th e medieval. Yet, the Spanish Inquisition's most influential lea der, the Dominican Tomas de Torquemada, was appointed Inquis itor General by Pope Sixtus IV. Jews were expelled from Spain, not from a profit motive (there was little money to be made in banishing a large community whose taxes were paid d irectly to the crown), but from the fear that Jews contaminate d Christian society. 50 The Roman Inquisition is distinct from the medieva l mainly because it was renamed. In 1542 Pope Paul II I reassigned the medieval Inquisition to the Congregation of the Inquisition, or the Holy Office. Each phase was identical, howev er, in its demand for absolute submission of the individual to authority, a demand rooted in the orthodox conviction that God s imilarly requires unquestioning obedience. The tyranny inherent in the belief in singular supr emacy accompanied explorers and missionaries throughout t he world. When Columbus landed in America in 1492, he mistook it for India and called the native inhabitants \"Indians.\" It was his avowed aim to \"convert the heathen Indians to our H oly Faith\" 51 that warranted the enslaving and exporting of thous ands of Native Americans.

In his own words, Columbus d escribed how he himself \"took [his] pleasure\" with a native woman after whipping her \"soundly\" with a piece of rope. 53 The Inquisition quickly followed in their wake. By 1570 the Inquisition had established an independent tribunal in Peru and the city of Mexico for the purpose of \"freeing the land, which has become contaminated by Jews and heretics. \" 54 Natives who did not convert to Christianity were burned like an y other heretic. 55 The Inquisition spread as far as Goa, India, where in the late 16th and early 17th centuries it took no l ess than 3,800 lives. 56 Even without the formal Inquisition present, missio nary behavior clearly illustrated the belief in the supr emacy of a single image of God, not in the supremacy of one all-encompassin g divinity. If the image of God venerated in a foreig n land was not Christian, it was simply not divine. Portuguese mis sionaries in the Far East destroyed pagodas, forced scholars to hide their religious manuscripts, and suppressed older customs . 57 Mayan scribes in Central America wrote: Before the coming of the Spaniards, there was no robbery or violence.

Many became missionaries to get r ich quickly and then return to Europe to live off their gains. In Mexico, Dominicans, Augustinians and Jesuits were known to own \"the largest flocks of sheep, the finest sugar ingenios, the best kept estates...\" 63 The Church, particularly in South America, supported the enslavement of native inhabitants and the theft of native lands. A 1493 papal Bull justified declaring war on any natives in South America who refused to adhere to C hristianity. 64 As the jurist Encisco claimed in 1509: The king has every right to send his men to the Indies to demand their territory from these idol- aters because he had received it from the pope. If the Indians refuse, he may quite legally fight them, kill them and enslave them, just as Joshua enslaved the inhabitants of the country of Ca- naan. 65 Orthodox Christians defended slavery as part of the divinely ordained hierarchical order. Passages in the Bible support the institution of slavery: Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.

Much in the way that fourth century Christians vandalized t he sacred sites and images of more ancient traditions, so now Prote stant mobs, incited by preachers and with the endorsement of pu blic author- ity, destroyed images of saints. 4 Although Protestantism vehe- mently denied the necessity of the Church as an int ermediary between the individual and God, it removed most of the means through which a direct and personal relationship mi ght develop. Catholic reformers also diminished the veneration o f saints. Saints were now to be seen as heroic figures and mo dels of virtue rather than as friends or benefactors. 5 But the Catholic Church was reluctant to part with the authority it had built over centuries. Yes, Christian faith should be sourced i n the Bible, but—as the Council of Trent declared—the Bible was best clarified by \"the testimonies of approved holy fath ers and councils, the judgement and consensus of the Church .\" 6 Catholics were also unwilling to dispense with the ritualistic and sacramental nature of church services. Some Protest ants, on the other hand, rejected rituals and sacraments entirel y, insisting that one should experience God strictly through preachin g or reading scripture. 7 Protestant leaders fervently embraced St. Augustine 's ideas about free will and predestination: that Adam's fal l from grace had left humanity inherently flawed, incapable of a cting cor- rectly, and thus entirely dependent upon God's merc y. Salvation was now possible only through the grace of God, not through individual determination. \"Free will after the Fall is nothing but a word,\" said Luther in 1518. \"Even doing what in h im lies, man sins mortally.\" 8 Most Catholics believed that while Adam's sin had inclined us towards evil and diminished our free will, his"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"THE REFORMATION 99 sin had not destroyed our free will entirely.

Martin Luther belie ved that differences in gender, class, race, and belief indi cated superior and inferior states of being. In 1533 he wrote, \"Gi rls begin to talk and to stand on their feet sooner than boys be cause weeds always grow up more quickly than good crops.\" 10 In 1525 he supported the merciless suppression of the Peasants ' War, a rebellion that his own spirit of independence from the Roman Church had helped to ignite. 11 Although Luther could find no scriptural warrant for exterminating Jews, he belie ved that they should be enslaved or thrown out of Christian lands and that their ghettos and synagogues should be burned. 12 He thought that the rebellious Anabaptists should be killed and eve n publicly affirmed a 1531 edict by Wittenberg theologians san ctioning their execution. 13 Other Protestant leaders were no more tolerant.

The Catholic Church had a lready established the means with which to control society and enforce obedience. Protestants, however, lacked the well-de veloped judicial structure and hierarchy of the Catholic Ch urch and lacked its global reach. Instead, they transferred the enforcement of personal morality to the state. Aside from its s ecular func- tions, the state should now uphold the moral purity of society; it should be \"the Godly state.\" 15 The domestic family unit, governed by the father, also took on new importance as the microcosm of the authoritarian structure. Both Protestants and Catholics diminished the impor tant role of the community, making it easier for the Church a nd state to have more direct control of the individual. The Ref ormation discouraged fraternities, which in the Middle Ages had provided for its members in times of need, organized celebra tions and plays, helped care for the poor, and set up hospita ls. 16 Commu- nity festivals, crucial to the harmony and vitality of the commu- nity, were curtailed. Catholic confessions, which h ad been a public act of forgiveness that restored a sinner ba ck into the community, became a private matter between the indi vidual and the priest with the introduction of the confession- box in 1565. 17 And the role of god-parents, which had served to ce ment social ties in ritual friendship, was diminished. 18 The Reformation eroded the community's capacity to intervene with t he authority of the Church, state, or family patriarch.

Since God was no longer to be found in the physical, the body was ungodly. Protestants and Catholics competed with each other over how little they could care for their bodies, using litt le soap and water throughout a lifetime. 26 A Jesuit in the 1700's, explaining that \"religious modesty\" is enough to prevent anyone fro m bathing, told a story of one who violated the prohibition: A youth who dared to bathe at one of our coun- try houses did drown there, perhaps by God's merciful judgement, for He may have wished this fearful example to serve as law. 27 A Catholic sermon from around 1700 advises one \"to treat one's body as a sworn enemy, and subdue it through work, fasts, hairshirts, and other mortifications.\" 28 A Sorbonne prior and doctor named Joseph Lambert warned rural folk: ...you must regard every kind of touching of your own and others' bodies, every liberty, as the most serious of sins; although these lewd acts may indeed be secret, they are loathsome in God's sight, who sees them all, is offended by them, and never fails to punish them most severely. 29 "},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"THE REFORMATION 103 While orthodox Christians had long considered sex f or any purpose other than procreation to be sinful, it was only during the Reformation that most common people learned thi s.

Whereas God imposed divine law, the devil demanded adherence to a pact. Where Christians showed reverence to God by kneeling, witches paid homage to the devil by stand ing on their heads. The sacraments in the Catholic Church became excre- ments in the devil's church. Communion was parodied by the Black Mass. 31 Christian prayers could be used to work evil by being recited backwards. 32 The eucharist bread or host was imitated in the devil's service by a turnip.

Warts, freckles, and birthmarks were considered certain tokens of amorous relations with Satan. 51 Should a woman show no sign of a witch's mark, guil t could still be established by methods such as sticking ne edles in the accused's eyes. In such a case, guilt was confirmed if the inquisitor could find an insensitive spot during th e process. 52 Confession was then extracted by the hideous method s of torture already developed during earlier phases of the Inquisition. \"Loathe they are to confess without torture,\" wrote King James I in his Daemonologie. 53 A physician serving in witch prisons spoke of women driven half mad: . ..by frequent torture... kept in prolonged squa- lor and darkness of their dungeons... and con- stantly dragged out to undergo atrocious torment until they would gladly exchange at any moment this most bitter existence for death, are willing t o confess whatever crimes are suggested to them rather than to be thrust back into their hideous dungeon amid ever recurring torture. 54 Unless the witch died during torture, she was taken to the stake.

His name, \"Pan,\" meant \"all\" and \" bread.\" But, particularly after the turn of the millennium when the Church authorized specific portrayals of the devil, the vilified Pan came to evoke terror or \"panic\" as the image of satan. The perceived separation of nature from God affecte d the treatment of animals. The canonized thirteenth cent ury scholar, Thomas Aquinas, declared that animals have no after life, have no inherent rights, and that \"by a most just ordina nce of the Creator, both their life and their death are subjec t to our use.\" 5 Animals were often thought to be agents of the devi l.

Zealous Christians most frequently targeted cats, wolves, s nakes, foxes, chickens and white cocks as animals to be eliminate d. Since many of these animals helped control the population of crop- eating and plague-carrying rodents, their eliminati on intensified outbreaks of plague. 9 To make matters worse, Church-licensed physicians ordered cats and dogs to be killed durin g times of plague thinking that this would halt infection. 10 Quite the reverse, of course, was true. The Church spent centuries prohibiting displays of reverence that involved nature. Worship should take place ind oors away from the natural elements. Christians destroyed out door temples and built churches with roofs in their stead. The C hurch condemned the veneration of trees and springs, wher e people would place candles or decorations. The sixth centu ry bishop Martin of Braga asked, \"But what is the lighting of wax lights at rocks or trees or wells or crossroads if it is n ot worship of the devil?\" 11 The General Capitularies of Charlemagne in 789 decreed: With regard to trees, and rocks and springs, wherever ignorant people put lights or make other observances, we give notice to everyone that this is a most evil practice, execrable to God, and wherever they are found, they are to be taken away and destroyed. 12 Stories attempted to illustrate that the elemental power of trees, groves and nature had submitted to Christ.

A similar s tory involves the eighth century missionary St. Boniface in Hesse . As he chopped at a sacred oak tree, the trunk of the tree is said to have burst into four equal parts and landed in the shape of a cross. And a twelfth century manuscript portrays a scene i n which a blind woman is taking an axe to a tree. Despite the presence of the tree's spirits which rise up aghast, a bishop s tands beside her blessing her action. Instead of suffering any dire consequences, the woman has her sight restored. 13 According to such stories, the supernatural power of the earth had submitted t o that of the celestial Christian God. But until the Reformation and the witch hunts, most people did not believe this.

The Church placed Christia n holidays to coincide with these older festivals in hopes of win ning easier acceptance and recognition for its new religion. Wh ile the traditional meaning of most of these holidays had n othing to do with orthodox Christianity, the Church usually tole rated the older rituals as it tried to teach a new biblical meaning . It was only during the Reformation that orthodox Christians ins isted that the older nature-oriented significance of holidays be a bolished. The cycle of the year, at both the change of the fo ur seasons as well as the height of each season, used to hold great impor- tance. The winter solstice, the darkest day of the year, was a time of new birth. Often it was symbolized by the b irth of an annual male fertility figure, a representation of t he year's new sun. The height of the winter, midway between the w inter solstice and spring equinox, was a time to nurture that new life. Spring was about encouraging fertility, when the su n and earth would unite to later bring forth the abundance of t he harvest and the bounty of the hunt. From the summer solstice th rough autumn the sun's energy transferred to the crops. T he height of summer and the fall equinox were celebrations of th e year's harvest and bounty. The end of the year when fields lay dormant and the earth seemed to die at the height of autumn was a time to honor the dead and release the past. By adopting these festivals as Christian, the early Church sought both to win the allegiance of the populace a s well as to harness the vitality of such festivals. While there is nothing to indicate the actual time of Jesus's birth, such an event most easily correlated to winter solstice festivals. The Roman celebra- 9.2 This medieval woodcut suggests the type of stor y spread by the Church in hopes of persuading people to abandon the ir veneration of nature.

In pre-Christian Eg ypt and Syria, a winter solstice ritual involved participan ts who would withdraw into the inner womb-like sanctuary of shri nes until midnight at which time they would come forth trumpe ting, \"The Virgin has brought forth! The light is waxing!\" 16 Admonitions against celebrating such a holiday by Tertullian, S t. Augustine and Pope Leo I notwithstanding, 17 the Church adopted the winter solstice as Christmas. The birth of God's sun at th e solstice easily correlated to the birth of God's son. An Egyptian winter solstice celebration of the birt h of Osiris, the divine representation of masculine fertility, o n January sixth became the Christian Epiphany. 18 The Church declared that it signified the manifestation of Jesus's divinity. Ye t, the spirit of both Christmas and the Christian Epiphany embodied the timeless celebrations of the winter solstice. The d ifference between them was due more to a difference in calend ars than a difference in meaning; the Egyptian calendar was tw elve days behind the Julian calendar. 19 The dates of many current holidays do not fall exactly on the solstice, equinox, or he ight of the season for a similar reason. Means of tracking time varied tremendously. Our present calendar was not complete ly adopted in England until 1751, in Russia until 1919, or in China until 1949. 20 Festivals to mark the height of winter also found t heir way into Christianity. Whether celebrated on the second or fourteenth of February, celebrations in honor of feminine face s of divinity such as Brigit and Venus, who encouraged art, poetr y, healing, fire and wisdom, became the Christian Candlemas. 21 Over time, however, the holiday lost the meaning of nourishing creativity and inspiration, and instead commemorated the end o f Mary's The following chart outlines the seasonal celebrati ons and the correlating Christian holiday."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"148 THE DARK SIDE OF CHRISTIAN HISTORY forty day period of purification after having given birth. The Church adopted spring equinox celebrations as E aster. As this time had already been one of celebrating the s un's resurrec- tion and return to prominence, celebrating the resu rrection of the son of God required no great change in understandin g. In fact, the Easter celebrations were so similar to earlier celebrations —particularly those which recognized the resurrecti on of the Babylonian Adonis, the Greek Apollo and the Roman A ttis—that a bitter controversy arose with pagans claiming tha t the Christian Easter celebration was a spurious imitation of the ancient traditions. 22 Vernal equinox bonfires, originally prohibited by the Church, found their way as Easter fires into the of ficial liturgy of Rome by the ninth century. 23 Fertility symbols associated with spring, such as the egg and the incredibly prolific rabbit, survived as well. Yet, as Christianity spread, festivals of spring an d summer gradually lost their original meaning. The height o f spring became Pentecost or Whitsunday, an observance not o f fertility, but of the biblical event when people spoke in tong ues, and a commemoration of the birth of the Church. The summe r solstice no longer was to recognize the culmination of the s un's light, but rather was to honor St. John who had baptized Chris t. Celebra- tions of the summer season became holidays for the Virgin Mary such as \"Our Lady's Herb Day\" and Assumption Day, t he day when Mary was \"assumed\" into heaven. 24 Fall equinox celebrations were incorporated as Mich aelmas (the feast of the archangel Michael, the conqueror of satan) and the Nativity of Mary. Gratitude for the harvest, an d the blessing of the year's medicinal herbs, of nearby mountains, or of the ocean remained a part of these autumn holidays.

Despite Church attempts to prevent the celebration of this holiday, by the ninth century the feast of All Saints Day had been moved to November first and by 1045 the monasteries of Cluny had begun to observe the time as a \"day of all the departed o nes.\" 26 The earlier nature-oriented significance of the season survived more fully, however, in the secular celebration of Hallo ween. Pagans also observed the cycles of the moon. Often these festivals involved veneration for feminine facets o f God. Christian theologians condemned celebrations observ ing the cycles of the moon, called la Luna, as madness or \"lunacy,\" while St. Augustine denounced women's dances in hon or of the new moon as \"impudent and filthy.\" 27 When the Church could not halt such celebrations, however, it again incor porated them into the Christian calendar, usually under the guis e of honoring Mary. The Church formally recognized the following: the day when St. Anne conceived Mary, December 8th; the day Mary was born, September 8th; the day Jesus's conception was announced to Mary, also called the Annunciation, Ma rch 25th; the day Mary was purified from having given birth, February 2nd or 14th; and the day Mary was assumed into heav en, or the Assumption, August 15th. Unofficial celebrations of Mary were even more numerous. CELEBRATION While adopting nature-oriented festivals helped gar ner membership for the early Church, the celebratory sp irit of these festivals conflicted with the asceticism and solemn ity of the orthodox.

Holidays were now to be strict commemorations of biblical events that had no connection to the earth 's seasons. The Church identified pagan practices as those whic h displayed either enjoyment or a connection with nat ure. Rever- ence for nature was so closely linked with expressi ons of joy that St. Augustine thought that the word \"jubilation\" de rived from jubilus, the song hummed by those tending vines and olives. 29 The ninth century Synod of Rome reported that \"Many people, mostly women, come to church on Sundays and holy da ys not to attend the Mass but to dance, sing broad songs, and do other such pagan things. \" 30 The Catechisme de Meaux describes pagan practices: Dancing round the fire, playing, holding feasts, singing vulgar songs, throwing grasses over the fire, gathering grasses before midnight or before breakfast, wearing grasses, keeping them for the whole year, keeping brands or cinders from the fire and the like... 31 Dancing was particularly offensive to orthodox Chri stians. In the sixth and seventh centuries ecclesiastical dan cing was prohibited as being too sensual and too much enjoye d by women. Inquisitors claimed that both women and devil-worsh ippers danced. 32 Dancing was a sign of spiritual decay to New Eng- land's Puritan ministers who in 1684 published a pa mphlet entitled An Arrow against Profane and Promiscuous Dancing, drawn out of the Quiver of the Scriptures. 33 An eighteenth century missionary hymn warns that satan ...slithers through the flesh Of dancing men and dames"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"1 52 THE DARK SIDE OF CHRISTIAN HISTORY To hold them in the mesh Of his hot and am'rous flames. 34 Certainly not all Christians agreed with the orthod ox. In the Acts of John, for instance, Jesus danced and said: To the Universe belongs the dancer, He who does not dance does not know what happens. Now if you follow my dance, see yourself in me. 35 To the orthodox, neither nature nor physical pleasu re were imbued with God's presence; both were of the devil. The Church had long condemned sensual pleasure as ungodly. As the twelfth century Bishop of Chartres, Sir John of Salisbury, declared: Who except one brreft of sense would approve sensual pleasure itself, which is illicit, wallows in filthiness, is something that men censure, and that God without doubt condemns? 36 Holidays had involved such gaiety and pleasure that the Bishop of Autun wrote in 1657, \"It is not appropriate to m ultiply holidays of obligation for fear of multiplying the occasions of sin...\" 37 With the Reformation came the demand to curtail or abolish the celebratory and nature-oriented character of ho lidays. Laughter and revelry were seen as inappropriate for Christians engaged in daily combat with satan. Orthodox Christ ians wanted to ban maypoles and Sunday dancing, bagpipes and fi ddlers accompanying bridal couples to Church, the throwing of corn, and the distribution of doles to the poor as \"super stitious and heathenical.\" 38 Wedding celebrations, according to New England magistrates and ministers, should not result in \"ri otous or immodest irregularities.\" 39 A law in 1639 prohibited the custom of drinking toasts or health-drinking as an \"abomin able\" pagan practice. 40 One should not adjourn to the tavern after meeting s, and nature-oriented occasions such as harvest huski ngs should not degenerate into merrymaking occasions. 41 "},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"ALIENATION FROM NATURE 153 In 1647 the English Parliament ordered that Christm as, along with other pagan holidays, should cease to be obser ved. A 1652 Parliamentary act repeated that \"no observance shal l be had on the five-and-twentieth of December, commonly called Christmas day; nor any solemnity used or exercised in churche s in respect thereof.\" 42 Market was to be kept and stores were to remain open on Christmas day. 43 In New England, where celebrating Christmas was considered a criminal offense and rem ained forbiddgn until the second half of the nineteenth c entury, a person caught celebrating Christmas was liable to e nd up at the stocks or the whipping post. 44 Factory owners changed starting hours to 5:00 a.m. on Christmas day and threatened termination for those who were tardy. As late as 1870 in Boston , students who failed to attend public schools on Christmas we re punished by public dismissal. 45 Practices involving nature at holidays were curtail ed. Orthodox Christians ceased Church processions aroun d towns and fields, which were intended to bless crops, to ask for a change in weather, or to appeal for protection agai nst insects. They suppressed the practice of collecting branches , foliage and flowers to be taken back to the church. 46 The 1683 Addendum to the constitution of the diocese of Annecy read: ...we order the people, under pain of excommu- nication, to suppress and abolish entirely the torches and fires customarily lit on the first Sunday of Lent... and the masquerades... which are merely shameful relics of Paganism. 47 Efforts to abolish paganism centered upon doing awa y with reverence and enjoyment of both nature and feminine energy. Not surprisingly, the imagery used in reference to nature often had strong sexual overtones. Francis Bacon, whose a im was \"to endeavor to establish the power and dominion of the human race itself over the universe,\" frequently used such ima gery. 48 In his book The Rebirth of Nature, Rupert Sheldrake writes,"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"ALIENATION FROM NATURE 155 Using metaphors derived from contemporary techniques of interrogation and torture of witches, [Francis Bacon] proclaimed that nature 'exhibits herself more clearly under the trials and vexations of art [mechanical devices] than when left to herself.' In the inquisition of truth, nature's secret 'holes and corners' were to be entered and penetrated. Nature was to be 'bound into service' and made a 'slave' and 'put in constraint.' She would be 'dissected,' and by the mechanical arts and the hand of man, she could be forced out of her natural state and squeezed and moulded,' so that 'human knowledge and human power meet as one.' 49 Nature was to be conquered, not enjoyed and certain ly not revered. A grim cheerlessness came to distinguish Christians . Already in the twelfth century the Abbot, Ruppert of Deutz, tried to defend the somberness of a Christian holiday: It is not a fast to make us sad or darken our hearts, but it rather brightens the solemnity of the Holy Spirit's arrival; for the sweetness of the Spirit of God makes the faithful loathe the pleasures of earthly food. 50 By the eighteenth century, \"boring\" and \"pious\" wer e thought to be synonymous. 51 In 1746 Diderot described the extremes of Christian \"unhappiness\": What cries! what shrieks! what groans!

Up until the Reformation, most people understood time to be cyclical. Reforma tional Christians, however, adopted St. Augustine's idea o f linear time. Augustine described the pagan theory of cycles, circuitus temporum, as: .. .those argumentations whereby the infidel seeks to undermine our simple faith, dragging us from the straight road and compelling us to walk with him on the wheel. 54 Like the theory of reincarnation, the idea of cycli cal time denied the uniqueness and finality of Jesus Christ. 55 If time spirals around, providing repeated opportunities to grow and change, then the spirit of Jesus's life and resurre ction could theoretically be experienced by anyone at anytime, regardless of 9.5 As people during the Reformation came to percei ve the nature of time to be linear rather than cyclical, time seemed to b ecome an unrelenting task-master, demanding that one spend every moment fulfilling one's duties and obligations. This sixteenth century allegorical representation shows time rewarding industry and punishing indolence.

Moreover , if time is cyclical, life might not consist of just one fright ening chance to repent or else to be forever damned, but rather of unlimited opportunities to develop a closer relationship with God. Control- ling people is more difficult when they believe tha t there are many means and opportunities to return to God other than simply the one that the Church offers. Reformational Christians disparaged the beliefs and practices associated with the concept of cyclical time. They opposed the belief in lucky and unlucky days, such as that it w as unlucky to marry during a waning moon or that a sin committed on a holy day was worse than one committed at another time. T ime should move evenly in a straight line without the disrupti ons and irregularity of changing seasons; six working days should always be followed by a sabbath resting day throughout the year. 56 As one Puritan character in a contemporary satire decl ares: ...it was passing folly To think one day more than another holy... 57 The pendulum clock was invented in 1657 as a testim ony to the belief that minutes were uniform in duration.

DEATH Orthodox Christians repudiated the cyclical nature of physical life as well. Passages in the New Testament exhibit disdain for the cycle of life: \"Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth f orth death.\" 59 "},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"ALIENATION FROM NATURE 159 By fostering an alienation from sex, birth, and the physical body, orthodox Christians came to focus most intently upo n death, not only as a tool to evoke fear but also as an end in itself. Christian theologians understood sex, at best, to b e permissi- ble if engaged in solely for purposes of procreatio n—at worst, to be a mortal sin. Yet, they also believed that the b irthing of a child was an ungodly act. The Church, with its lice nsed physi- cians, spurned the field of midwifery. A woman who died in labor or in child-bed was sometimes refused a Chris tian burial. 60 Purifying or \"churching\" a woman for 40 to 80 days after she gave birth was deemed essential if a she was to be readmitted into the Church and proper Christian society. Even the Virgin Mary—in some people's eyes—needed to be purified af ter having brought Jesus into the world. Orthodox Christianity encouraged an alienation from the physical body itself. God's presence, it was believ ed, was not to be found in the physical world. Paul wrote in Corin thians, \"therefore we are always confident, knowing that, w hilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord.\" 61 The Bible affirms that meaningful, spiritual life is found on ly when one is detached from the physical body: \"For if ye live af ter the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do morti fy the deeds of the body, ye shall live.\" 62 \"For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.\" 63 Physical life is equated with sin and spiritual decay, while physica l death and a repudiation of physical well-being is thought to br ing spiritual life. A disregard for the well-being of the physical body character- ized orthodox Christian behavior from the fell of t he Roman Empire when aqueduct systems, bathing houses and hy giene were held in contempt and neglected. Protestants an d reformed Catholics attempted to outdo one another in their n egligence of bodily hygiene. As the Augustinian priest and chapl ain to the King of Poland declared:"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"160 THE DARK SIDE OF CHRISTIAN HISTORY Follow Our Lord's example, and hate your body; if you love it, strive to lose it, says Holy Scrip- ture, in order to save it; if you wish to make peace with it, always go armed, always wage war against it; treat it like a slave, or soon you yourself shall be its unhappy slave. 64 In the Christian world the very word \"carnal,\" whic h means simply \"of or relating to the body,\" 65 took on the meaning of sin and immorality. Orthodox Christians also often contended that death was not a natural part of life but rather was a punishment. St. Augustine argued that death existed only as a punishment for sin: Wherefore we must say that the first men were indeed so created, that if they had not sinned, they would not have experienced any kind of death; but that, having become sinners, they were so punished with death, that whatsoever sprang from their stock should also be punished with the same death. 66 And: ...therefore it is agreed among all Christians who truthfully hold the catholic faith, that we are subject to the death of the body, not by the law of nature, by which God ordained no death for man, but by His righteous infliction on account of sin... 67 Just as Augustine had argued that sin had created s exual desire, so he also believed that sin had created death. Death, in the eyes of the orthodox, was to be conqu ered. Paul wrote in I Corinthians, \"The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.\" 68 St. Ignatius, the bishop of Antioch, describes how the Apostles \"despised death, and were found to ris e above death.\" 69 Christian faith is believed to imbue one with powe r over death. In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus says:"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"ALIENATION FROM NATURE 161 But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage: Neither can they die any more; for they are equal unto angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection. 70 Instead of accepting death as a natural part of the life cycle, orthodox Christians used death as a tool to evoke f ear in people. The fourth century St. Pachomius advised his monks: \"Above all, let us always keep our last day before our eye s and let us always fear everlasting torment.\" 71 St. Benedict's rule instructs: \"Dread the Day of Judgment, fear Hell, desire etern al life with entirely spiritual ardour, keep the possibility of death ever before your eyes.\" 72 The ancient concept of an underworld where one would go after death for rest and rejuvenation beca me the frightening Christian idea of hell, a place filled with fire and brimstone where one endures eternal pain and agony. Death, particularly in a context where there is but one li fe and one chance to do the right thing, became a terrifying p rospect. It took the Church a long time, however, to teach s uch an orthodox understanding of death. The Church initial ly made Christianity comprehensible to the populace by inco rporating pre-Christian ideas. The concept of purgatory adopt ed by the medieval Church mitigated the harshness of orthodox ideology. Instead of being sent directly to heaven or hell af ter death, one's soul could go to purgatory, an intermediate place, to do penance and be punished for sins before hopefully being all owed into heaven. 73 Such a concept also proved quite lucrative for the Church. By maintaining that it could influence the destiny of these souls, the Church collected a good deal of me dieval society's money for its services on behalf of those in purgatory. With the spread of orthodox Christianity during the Reforma- tion, however, all activities that dealt with death as a natural part of life were to be isolated and reviled. No longer should one"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"162 THE DARK SIDE OF CHRISTIAN HISTORY . think of departed ones as being in purgatory; peopl e would be judged immediately upon dying and sent directly to heaven or hell. A person's death should no longer be made int o an important occasion or seen as part of a natural cyc le. Funerals went from being large community events to small fam ily affairs. 74 Orthodox Christians tried to ban the tolling of Ch urch bells at funerals and the use of special mourning g arments. 75 Cemeteries, once busy meeting places, should be seg regated from everyday life. Dancing, games, and commercial activities in cemeteries were routinely forbidden. 76 A 1701 city ordinance in New England prohibited making coffins, digging g raves or holding funerals on the Sabbath as acts that profan ed the holy day. 77 Ironically, in attempting to conquer death and isol ate it from life, orthodox Christianity fostered a preoccupatio n with death. Augustine perceived life to be wholly overshadowed by death. \"For no sooner do we begin to live in this dying bo dy, than we begin to move ceaselessly towards death.\" 78 Death, according to the orthodox, could bring salvation. Augustine w rote: But now, by the greater and more admirable grace of the Savior the punishment of sin is turned to the service of righteousness. For then it was proclaimed to man, 'If thou sinnest, thou shalt die'; now it is said to the martyr, 'Die, that thou sin not.' Then it was said, 'If ye transgress the commandments, ye shall die'; now it is said, 'If ye decline death, ye transgress the commandment.' 79 Orthodox Christians, in their effort to conquer it, often ended up glorifying death. Jesus's most valuable act was understood to be, not his miracles of healing or his message of l ove and peace, but rather his act of dying. The Bible states that \"the day of death [is better] than the day of one's birth.\" 80 It became"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"ALIENATION FROM NATURE 163 customary to call a Martyr's day of death his or he r \"birthday.\" 81 Augustine tried to explain why death had taken on such an elevated character: Not that death, which was before an evil, has become good, but only that God has granted to faith this grace, that death, which is the admit- ted opposite to life, should become the instru- ment by which life is reached. 82 St. John Cimacus of the seventh century wrote, \"Jus t as bread is the most necessary of all foods, so meditation on d eath is the most important of all actions.\" 83 And the prominent St. John Chrysostom declared that \"the principal character [ of a Chris- tian] is to desire and love death.\" 84 Orthodox Christianity had taken on the character of a death cult. A preoccupation with death overshadowed Christian a ttitudes towards the world at large. Understanding earthly, physical life to be inimical to spirituality fostered a zealous a nticipation of the end of the world. Christians expected God to revisi t the earth in a second coming to usher in the end times. In the c anonized Gospel of Matthew, Jesus gives the impression that such an end may be short at hand: \"Truly, I say to you, there a re some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\" 85 Periodic waves of expecting the destruction of the world marked Christian history. During the Reformation in England, for example, eighty books w ere published on the subject of the world's end. 86 Orthodox Christianity changed the way people think about the earth and the natural environment. When God is beli eved to reign from above, nature is understood to be distan t from, if not devoid of, God's presence.

Soon after people accepted the belief that God no l onger wielded supernatural power in the physical world, i t became common, particularly among the educated, to believe that the devil also exercised no such power. Once the idea o f divine magic had been rejected, it was easy to accept that no magic, divine or evil, operates in the physical realm.

While most still believed that God had originally created the world, they now thought that the universe functioned according to comprehensive laws which re quired no further intervention on God's part. These new beliefs and attitudes mirrored those of o rthodox Christianity. As orthodox Christians believed there to be a division between heaven and earth, so scientists pe rceived there to be a similar division, coined by Descartes as th at between mind and matter. As Christians believed God to be d etached from the physical world, so scientists thought that consciousness and physical reality were detached from one another . Although orthodox Christianity and modern thinkers differed in their belief about the devil, both understood the physical world as a realm devoid of divinity and sanctity. The belief that the physical world functioned indep endently of consciousness found new validation in Newton's l aws. His laws of motion and of gravity depicted a universe w hich operated upon a thoroughly impartial, mechanical and determi nistic basis. Newton based all of his work upon experimental evid ence as a testimony to the belief that matter was devoid of s upernatural influence and consciousness; since the thoughts of the person conducting the experiment would have no impact upon matter, every experiment's result should be able to be dupl icated. 2 In other words, he believed that it was possible for a person to observe a physical phenomenon without influencing i t.

Hierarchica l order requires all components to be separated and ranked according to their superiority or inferiority; it focuses upon a component's difference rather than upon its supportive relation ship and connection to the whole. Scientists similarly focus ed upon the separation, isolation and analysis of increasingly smaller particles. Little attention was given to the relati onship connecting a component to its surrounding elements or environm ent. Modern philosophy echoed the same idea with the bel ief that reality emanated from and was caused by insignifica nt and random events rather than from and by larger, inten tional consciousness. Descartes coined the belief with his famous phrase Cogito ergo sum, \"I think, therefore I am.\" The smaller, less significant act of thinking leads to the large r, more signifi- cant reality of being. While many still believed th at God originally created the universe, most now thought t hat truth would be found, not by focusing upon or trying to u nderstand God's plan or intention, but by understanding the s mall, separate, mechanical parts of the universe. Belief in the necessity of domination and struggle, as well as in the absence of divine intervention, found new ju stification in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. As orthodox C hristianity, particularly during the Reformation, stressed the n obility of struggle and the sinfulness of magic and supernatur al assistance, so Darwin portrayed the natural world as a place wh ere struggle and competition characterize every aspect of \"the g reat and complex battle of life.\" Struggle, according to Dar win, was essential to maintaining the natural order and prev enting the disastrous explosion of any one population. 10.2 Sir Isaac Newton.

Otherwise he would sink into indolence, and the more gifted men would not be more successful in the battle of life than the less gifted. 3 Both orthodox Christians and modern thinkers deemed hierarchy essential, whether that hierarchy differentiated hu man beings according to their proximity to God or according to their ability to survive. Darwin's theories provided a new ration alization for subjugating people according to race or gender; the y were now believed to be \"naturally\" weaker.

Even Charles Darwin did not believe that his work o pposed the tenets of orthodox Christianity. Reformational Christians would certainly have agreed with him that physical reality functions \"not by miraculous acts of creation\" but rather through struggle and competition. 4 Darwin wrote in The Origin of Species, \"I see no good reason why the views given in this volume should shock the religious feelings of any o ne.\" He describes how a religious man: . ..learnt to see that it is just as noble a concep- tion of the Deity to believe that He created a few original forms capable of self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe that He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by the action of His laws. 5 Modern thought supported orthodox Christian concept s far more than it contradicted them.

Many though t that the judicial system depended upon fear. In his book Obstruction of Justice By Religion, Frank Swancara notes that: ...the judges who moulded the common law thought that one who does not believe in nor fear Divine punishment after death cannot be trusted as a witness in a court of law. 7 Most thinkers of the Enlightenment found atheism as threatening as did orthodox Christians. Voltaire asked, What restraint, after all, could be imposed on covetousness, on the secret transgressions com- mitted with impunity, other than the idea of an eternal master whose eye is upon us and who will judge even our most private thoughts? 8 And John Locke wrote: Those are not at all to be tolerated who deny the being of a God. Promises, covenants, and oaths, which are the bonds of human society, can have no hold upon an atheist. 9 Both orthodox Christianity and modern thinkers, whi le willing to dispense with the belief in magic and miracles, still relied upon the belief in God's fearful punishment.

Many concepts which originated in orthodox Christia n ideology and found validation among modern thinkers are now, at the end of the twentieth century, proving to be of limited scientific accuracy. Scientific discoveries, most n otably in quantum mechanics, have shown classical physics to be severely limited in its capacity to explain the workings of the universe. The principles and laws that appear to govern the m echanistic, deterministic universal machine simply do not apply to sub- atomic particles.

While Newton thought that, given enough information, one can absolutely determine the outcome of an event, quantum mechanics has shown th at at best one can know only the probability of any outcome. 13 Gary Zukav describes what became known as the Copenhagen Inter pretation: ...scientists attempting to formulate a consistent physics were forced by their own findings to acknowledge that a complete understanding of reality lies beyond the capabilities of rational thought. 14 Recent science has also challenged the belief that physical matter is completely inanimate, unresponsive, and s ubstantive."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"1 76 THE DARK SIDE OF CHRISTIAN HISTORY In their explorations of wave functions, scientists have found physical reality to be both \"idea-like\" and \"matter -like.\" 15 The division between mind and matter, which corroborate d the Christian division between heaven and earth, is not true scientifi- cally. The physical world is not composed of solid, inert, and inanimate matter as was thought in classical physic s. The physicist Henry Stapp writes: If the attitude of quantum mechanics is correct ...then there is no substantive physical world, in the usual sense of this term. The conclusion here is not the weak conclusion that there may not be a substantive physical world but rather that there definitely is not a substantive physical world. 16 Another physicist, E.H. Walker writes: Consciousness may be associated with all quan- tum mechanical processes... since everything that occurs is ultimately the result of one or more quantum mechanical events, the universe is 'inhabited' by an almost unlimited number of rather discrete conscious, usually nonthinking entities that are responsible for the detailed working of the universe. 17 Such findings contradict the belief in the separati on of mind and matter. Both the division between mind and matter and the i dea that the earth is devoid of consciousness are also calle d into question by the more recent Gaia theory.

Even the classical means of verifying truth are now consid- ered erroneous. Newton believed that since experime nts relating to physical matter involved inanimate particles whi ch lacked consciousness, all results from such experiments sh ould be repeatable; the person conducting the experiment co uld act as an objective observer without having any impact upon t he physical matter. The possibility of such an objective observ er, however, now no longer seems feasible; quantum mechanics has shown that the simple act of observation does have impact upon the matter observed. The physicist John Wheeler writes: May the universe in some strange sense be 'brought into being' by the participation of those who participate?... 'Participator' is the incon- trovertible new concept given by quantum me- chanics. It strikes down the term 'observer' of classical theory, the man who stands safely behind the thick glass wall and watches what goes on without taking part. It can't be done, quantum mechanics says. 19 Recent scientific discoveries are proving the Newto nian and Cartesian perception of a mechanistic universe, whi ch developed out of the belief that God no longer inhabited the world, to be of limited accuracy. The modern scientific method, which emphasizes diss ecting and analyzing ever smaller components and echoes th e Christian attempt to segregate hierarchical components, is al so being reconsidered. Recent science suggests that truth mi ght better be found, not just by focusing upon the separation and segregation of components, but also by understanding the interr elatedness of such components within a larger system. \"Parts,\" as the physicist David Bohm explains,"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"1 78 THE DARK SIDE OF CHRISTIAN HISTORY ...are seen to be in immediate connection, in which their dynamical relationships depend, in an irreducible way, on the state of the whole system (and, indeed, on that of broader systems in which they are contained, extending ultimately and in principle to the entire universe). Thus, one is led to a new notion of unbroken whole- ness which denies the classical idea of analyzability of the world into separately and independently existent parts... 20 Understanding the relationship of matter to the who le system might reveal more truth than analyzing the isolated components of that matter. Understanding how components work t ogether might be more productive than ordering those compon ents hierarchically. The orthodox insistence upon the inherent value of struggle, which found renewed justification in Darwin's ideas , might also warrant revaluation.

Illness was seen simply as a malfunction of mechanical parts, the cause for which lay wholly in the physical world. In the same way that orthodox Christians tried to s ubdue lower hierarchical components, Western physicians a ttempted to prevail over the body rather than to work together with it, by encouraging its ability to heal itself. An example of such a practice is the treatment of non-life-threatening i llness with antibiotics. Antibiotics subdue the body's immune s ystem, the body's own capacity to defend itself from illness.
