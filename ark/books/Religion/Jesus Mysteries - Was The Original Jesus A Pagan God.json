Here Pagan priest s observed sacred ceremonies which early Christians found so disturbing that they tried to erase all evidence of them ever having been practised. What were these shocking Pagan rites? Grueso me sacrifices or obscene orgies perhaps? This is what we have been led to believe. But the truth is far stranger than this fict ion. Where today the gathered fait hful revere thei r Lord Jesus Christ, the ancients worshipped another godman who, like Jesus, had been miraculously born on 25 December before three shepherds. I n t his ancient sanctuary Pagan congregations once glorified a Pagan redeemer who, like Jesus, was said to have ascended to heaven and to have promised to come again at the end of time to judge the quick and the dead. On the same spot where the Pope celebra tes the Catholic mass, Pagan priests also celebrated a symbo lic meal of bread and wine in memory o f their savi our who, j ust like Jesus, had declared: 'He who will not eat of my body and drink of my blood, so that he will be made one wi thme and I with him , the same shall not know salvat ion.' 2 When we began to uncover such extraordinary similarit ies between the story of Jesus and Pagan my thwe were stunned. We had been brought up in a culture which portrays Paganism and Chr istianit y as ent irely antagonist ic religious perspectives. How could such astonishing resemblances be explained? We were intrigued and began to search further. The more we looked, the mo re resemblances we found. To account for the wealt h of evidence we were unearthing we felt compelled t o completely review our understanding of the relat ionship between Paganism and Chr istianit y, to question beliefs that we previously regarded as unquest ionable and to imagine possibilit ies which at first seemed impossible. Some readers will find our conclus io ns shocking and others heretical, but for us they are merely the simplest and most obvious way o f account ing for the evidence we have amassed. We have beco me convinced that the story of Jesus is not the biography o f an historical Messiah, but a myth bas ed on perennial Pagan stories. Christ ianit y was not a new and unique revelat ion but actually a Jewish adaptation of the ancient Pagan Mystery religio n. This is what we have called 'the Jesus Mysteries Thesis'. It may sound farfetched at first, just as it d id init ially to us. There is, after all, a great deal of unsubstant iated nonsense written about the 'real' Jesus, so any revolut ionary theory shoul d be approached with a healthy dose of scept icism. But although thi s book makes extraordinary claims, it is n ot j ust entertaining fantasy or sensati onal speculat ion. It is firmly based upon the available historical sources and the latest scho lar ly research. Whilst we hope to have made it accessible to the general reader, we have also included copi ous notes giving sources, references and greater detail for those who wish to analyse our argum ents m ore thoroughly.

Vi sion ary scho lars at the turn of the nineteenth century also made comparable conjectures to our own. In recent decades, modern academics have repeatedly pointed towards the possibilit ies w e consider. Yet few have dared to boldly state the obvious conclusio ns which we have drawn. Why? Because to do so is taboo. For 2,000 y ears the West has been do minated by the idea that Christ ianit y is sacred and unique, whilst Paganism is primit ive and the work of the Devil. To even consider that they could be parts ofthe same tradition has been simply unthinkable. Therefore, although the true origins of Chr istianit y have been obvious all alo ng, few have been able to see them, because to do so requi res a r adi cal break with the condit ioning of our culture. Our contribut ion has been to dare to think the unthinkable and to present our conclusio ns in a popular book rather than so me dr y academic tome. This is certainly not the last word on this complex subject, but we hope it may be a si gnificant call for a complete reappraisal of the origins of Christ ianit y. THE PAGAN MYSTERIES In Greek tragedies the chorus reveals the fate of the protagonists before the play begins. Som etimes it is easier to understand the jour ney if one is already aware of the destinat ion and the terrain to be covered. Before diving deeper into detail, therefore, we would like to retrace our process of discovery and so provide a brief overview of the book. We had shared an obsessio n with world myst icism all our lives which recent ly had led us to explore spiritualit y in t he ancient world. Popular understanding inevitably lags a long way behind the cutting edge of scho lar lyresearch and, like most people, we init ially had an inaccurate and out -dated vi ew of Paganism. We had been taught to see it as a superstit ious cul ture whi ch indulged in ido l worship and bloody sacrifice, and dry philo sophers wearing togas stumbling blindly towards what we today call 'science'. We were familiar with various Gree k my ths which showed the partisan and capricious nature of the Olympian gods and goddesses. All in all, Paganism seemed primit ive and fundamentally alien. After many years o f st udy, however, our understanding has been transformed. Pagan spiritualit y was a ctually the sophist icated product of a highly developed culture. The state religio ns, such as the Greek worship of the Olympian gods, were litt le mo re than outer pom p and ceremony. The real spiritualit y o f the people expressed itself through the vibrant an d myst ical 'Mystery religio ns'. At first underground and heretical mo vements, these Mysteries spread and flourished throughout the ancient Mediterranean, inspiring the greatest minds of the Pagan world, who regarded them as the very source of civilizat ion. Each Mystery tradi tion had exoteric Outer Mysteries, consisting o f myt hs which were commo n knowledge and rituals which were open to anyo ne who wanted to participate. There were al so esoteri c Inner Mysteries, which were a sacred secret only known to those who had undergone a powerful process of init iat ion. Init iates of the Inner Mysteries had the myst ical meaning of the rituals and myt hs of the Outer Mysteries revealed to them, a process which brought about personal transformat ion and spiritual enlightenme nt. The philosophers of the ancient world were the spiritual masters of the Inner Mysteries. They were myst ics and miracle -workers, more comparable to Hindu gurus than dust y academics. The great Greek philosopher Pythagoras, for example, is remembered tod ay fo r his mathematical theorem , but few people picture him as he actually was –a flambo yant sage who was believed to be able to miraculously st ill the winds and raise the dead. Atthe heart of the Mysteries were myt hs concerning a dying and resurrecting godman, who was known by many different names. In Egypt he was Osiris, in Greece Dionysus, in Asia"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Minor Attis, in Syria Adonis, in Italy Bacchus, in Persia Mit hras. Fundamentally all these godm en are the same myt hical being. As was the practice fro m as early as the third century BCE. 4 in this book we will use the combined name 'Osiris -Dionysus' to denote his universal and com posi te nature, and his particular names when referring to a specific Mystery tradit ion. From the fifth century BCE philosophers suc h as Xenophanes and Empedocles had ridiculed taking the stories of the gods and goddesses literally. They viewed them as allegories of human spiritual experience. The myt hs of Osiris -Dionysus shoul d not be understood as just int riguing tal es, therefore, bu t as a symbo lic language which encodes the myst ical teachings of the Inner Mysteries. Because of this, although the details were developed and adapted over time by different cultures, the myt h of Osiris -Dionysus has rem ained essent ially the same. The vari ous my ths of the different godmen of the Mysteries share what the great my thologi st Joseph Campbell called 'the same anatomy'. Just as every human is physically unique yet it is possible to talk of the general anatomy o f the human body, so with these diffe rent my ths it is possible to see both their uniqueness and fundamental sameness. A helpful com parison may be the relat ionship between Shakespeare's Ro meo and Juliet and Bernstein's West Side Story. One is a sixteenth -century English tragedy about weal thy Italian families, whilst the other is a twentieth -century American musical about street gangs. On the face o f it theylook very different, yet they are essent ially the same story. Similarly, the tales told about the godm en of the Pagan Mysteries are essent ially the same, although they take different forms. The more we studied the various versio ns of the myt h of Osiris -Dionysus, the more it became obvious that the story of Jesus had all the characterist ics of this perennial tale. Event by event, we found we were able to construct Jesus ' supposed biography fro m myt hic motifs previously relat ing to Osiris -Dionysus: • Osi ris-Dionysus is God made flesh, the saviour and 'Son ofGod'. • His father is God and his mother is a mortal virgin. • He is born in a cave or humble cowshed on 25 December before three shepherds. • He offers his fo llowers the chance to be born again through the ri tes of bapt ism. • He miraculously turns water into wine at a marriage cerem ony . • He rides triumphant ly int o town on a donkey while peopl e wave palm leaves to honour him. • He dies at Eastertime as a sacrifice for the sins of the worl d. • After his death he descends to hell, then on the third day he rises fro m t he dead and ascends to heaven in glory . • His fo llo wers await his return as the judge during the Last Day s. • His death and resurrect ion are celebrated by a ritual meal o f bread and wine which symbo lize his body and blood. These are just some of the motifs shared between the tales of Osiris -Dionysus and the 'biography' ofJesus. Why are these remarkable similarit ies not common knowledge? Because, as we were to discover later, the early Ro ma n Church did everyt hing in its power to prevent us perceiving them . It system atically destroyed Pagan sacred literature in a brutal programme oferadi cating the Mysteri es -a task it performed so completely that today Paganism is regarded as a 'dead' religion. Alt hough surprising to us now, to writers of the first few centuries CE these similarit ies between the new Christ ian religio n and the an cient My steri es were extrem ely obvi ous. Pagan cri tics of Christ ianit y,such as the satirist Celsus, complained that this recent religio n was nothing"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"mo re than a pale reflect ion of their own ancient teachings. Early 'Church fathers', such as Just in Marty r, Tertullian and Irenaeus, were understandably disturbed and resorted to the desperate claim that these similarit ies were the result of 'diabolical mimicry'. Using one of the most absurd argum ents ever advanced, they accused the Devil of 'plagiarism by ant icipat ion', of deviously copying the true story of Jesus before it had actually happened in an attempt to mislead the gullible! These Church fathers struck us as no less devious than the Devil they hoped to incriminate. Other Christian commentators have cla imed that the myths of the Mysteries were like 'pre -echoes' of the literal co ming of Jesus, somewhat like premonit ions or prophecies. This is a mo re generous version of the 'diabo lical mimicry' theory, but seemed no less ridiculous to us. There was nothing other than cultural prejudice to make us see the Jesus story as the literal culminat ion of its many myt hical precursors. Viewed impartially, it appeared to be just another versio n of the same basic story. The obvious explanat ion is that as early Christ ianit y became the dominant power in the previously Pagan world, popular motifs from Pagan myt ho logybecame grafted onto the biography ofJesus. This is a possibilit y t hat is even put forward by many Christ ian t heologians. The virgin birth, for example, is of ten regarded as an extraneous later addit ion t hat should not be understood literally. Such motifs were 'borrowed' from Paganism in the same way that Pagan fest ivals were adopted as Christ ian saints' days. This theory is co mmo n amongst those who go looking for the 'real' Jesus hidden under the weight of accumulated myt hological debris. Attractive as it appears at first, to us this explanation seemed inadequate. We had co llated such a comprehensive body ofsimilari ties that there remained hardly any signific ant el ements in the biography of Jesus that we did not find prefigured by the Mysteries. On top of this, we discovered that even Jesus' teachings were not original, but had been ant icipated by the Pagan sages! If there was a 'real' Jesus somewhere undernea thall this, we would have to acknowledge that we could know abso lut ely nothing about him, for all that remained for us was later Pagan accreti ons! Such a posit ion seemed absurd. Surely there was a more elegant solut ion to this conundrum? THE GNOSTICS Whil st we were puzzling over these discoveries, we began to question the received picture of the early Church and have a look at the evidence for ourselves. We discovered that far from being the united congregation of saint s and martyrs that tradit ional histor y wo uld have us believe, the early Christ ian communit y was actually made up of a who le spectrum of different groups. These can be broadly categorized into two different schools. On the one hand there were those we will call 'Literalists', because what defi nes them is that they take the Jesus story as a literal account of histori cal events. It was this school of Christ ianit y t hat was adopted by the Ro ma n E mp ire in the fourth century CE, becoming Ro ma n Catho licism and all its subsequent offshoots. On the othe r hand, however, there were also radically different Christ ians known as 'Gnostics'.5 These forgotten Christ ians were later persecuted out of existence by the Literalist Roman Church wit h such thoroughness that until recent ly we knew litt le about them exc ept through the wri tings of their detractors. Only a handful o f o riginal Gnosti c texts survived, none of which were published before the nineteenth century. This situation changed dramat ically, however, witha rem arkable discovery in 1945 when an Arab peas ant stumbled upon a who le library of Gnostic gospels hidden in a cave near Nag Hammadi in Egypt. This gave scho lars access to many texts which were in wide circulat ion amongst early Christ ians, but which were deliberately"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"excluded fro m t he canon of the New Testam ent -gospels attributed to Thomas and Philip, texts recording the acts of Peter and the 12 disciples, apocalypses attributed to Paul and James, and so on. It seem ed to us extraordinary that a whole library of early Christ ian documents could be discovered, containing what purport to be the teachings of Christ and his disciples, and yet so few modern fo llo wers o f Jesus should even know of their existence. Why hasn't every Christ ian rushed out to read these newly discovered words of the Master? What k eeps them confined to the small number of gospels selected for inclusio n in t he New Testament? It seems that even though 2,000 y ears have passed since the Gnost ics were purged, during which time the Ro ma n Church has split into Protestantism and thousands o f o ther al ternat ive groups, the Gnostics are still not regarded as a legit imate voice of Christ ianit y. Those who do explore the Gnostic gospels discover a form of Christ ianit y quite alien to the religio n with which they are familiar. We found ourselves st udying strange esoteric tracts withtitles such as Hypostasis of the Archons and The Thought of Norea. It felt as if we were in an episode of Star Tiek -and in a way we were. The Gnostics truly were 'psychonauts' who bo ldlyexpl ored the final frontiers of inner space, searching for the origins and meaning of life. These people were myst ics and creative free -thinkers. It was obvious to us why they were so hated by the bishops of the Literalist Church hierarchy. To Literalists, the Gnostics were dangerous h eretics. In volumes of ant i-Gnost ic works - an unintentional testimo ny to the power and influence o f Gnosticism wit hin early Christ ianit y - theypainted them as Christ ians who had 'gone nat ive'. They claimed they had beco me contaminated by the Paganism tha t surrounded them and had abandoned the purit y o f the true fait h. The Gnostics, on the other hand, saw themselves as the authent ic Christ ian t radit ion and the orthodox bishops as an 'imitat ion church'.6 They claimed to know the secret Inner Mysteries ofCh ristianit y which the Literalists did not possess. As we explored the beliefs and practices of the Gnostics we became convinced that the Literalists had at least been right about one thing: the Gnostics were little different fro m P agans. Like the philo soph ers of the Pagan Mysteries, they believed in reincarnation, honoured the goddess Sophia and were immersed in the myst ical Greek philosophy of Plato. 'Gnostics' means 'Knowers', a name they acquired because, like the init iates of the Pagan Mysteries, they b elieved that thei r secret teachings had the power to impart 'Gnosis' -direct experi ent ial 'Knowledge of God'. Just as the goal of a Pagan init iate was to become a god, so for the Gnostics the goal of the Chr istian init iate was to become a Christ. What par ticularly struck us was that the Gnostics were not concerned wit h t he historical Jesus. They viewed the Jesus story in the same way that the Pagan philosophers viewed the my ths of Osiris -Dionysus -as an allegory which encoded secret myst ical teachings. Th is insight cry stallized for us a remarkable possibilit y.Perhaps the explanat ion fo r the similarit ies between Pagan myths and the biography of Jesus had been staring us in the face the who le t ime, but we had been so caught up with tradit ional ways o f thir tking that we had been unable to see it. THE JESUS MYSTERIES THESIS The tradit ional versio n of history bequeathed to us by the authorities of the Ro ma n Church is that Chr istianit y developed fro m t he teachings of a Jewish Messiah and that Gnosticism was a la ter deviat ion. What would happen, we wondered, if the picture were reversed and Gnosticism viewed as the authent ic Christianit y,just as the Gnostics themselves claimed? Could it be that orthodox Christ ianit y was a later deviat ion fro m Gnosticism and that Gnosticism was a"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"synthesis of Judaism and the Pagan Mystery religion? This was the beginning of the Jesus Mysteri es Thesis. Bol dly stated, the pi cture that em erged for us was as fo llo ws. We knew that most ancient Medi terranean cultures had adopted the a ncient Mysteries, adapting them to their own nat ional tastes and creating their own versio n of the myt h of the dying and resurrect ing godman. Perhaps some of the Jews had, likewise, adopted the Pagan Mysteries and created then -own versio n of the My steri es, which we now know as Gnosticism. Perhaps init iates of the Jewish Mysteries had adapted the poten t symbo lism o f the Osiris -Dionysus my ths into a myth o f their own, the hero of which was the Jewish dying and resurrecting godman Jesus. If this was so, then the Jesus story was not a biography at all but a consciously crafted vehicle for encoded spiritual teachings created by Jewish Gnostics. As in the Pagan Mysteries, init iat ion int o the Inner Mysteries would reveal the myt h's allegorical meaning. Perhaps tho se uninit iated into the Inner Mysteries had mistakenly come to regard the Jesus myt h as historical fact and in this way Literalist Christ ianit y had been created. Perhaps the Inner Mysteries of Chr istianit y, which the Gnost ics taught but which the Literalis ts denied existed, revealed that the Jesus story was not a factual account of God's one and only visit to planet Earth, but a myst ical teaching story designed to help each one of us become a Christ. The Jesus story does have all the hallmarks of a myt h, s o c oul d it be that that is exactly what it is? After all, no one has read the newly discovered Gnostic gospels and taken their fantastic stories as literally true; they are readily seen as myt hs. It is only familiarit y a nd cultural prej udice which prevent us fro m seeing the New Testament gospels in the same light. If those gospel s had also been lost to us and only recent ly discovered, who would read these tales for the first time and believe they were historical accounts of a man born of a virgin, who had w alked on water and returned from the dead? Why should we consider the stories o f Osir is, Dionysus, Adonis, Attis, Mithras and the other Pagan Mystery saviours as fables, yet come across essent ially the same story told in a Jewish context and believe it to be the biography of a carpenter fro m Bethlehem? We had both been raised as Christ ians and were surprised to find that, despite years of open -minded spiritual exploration, it still felt so me how dangerous to even dare think such thoughts. Early indoctrinati on reaches very deep. We were in effect saying that Jesus was a Pagan god and that Christianit y was a heret ical product of Paganism! It seemed outrageous. Yet thi s theory explained the similarit ies between the stories of Osiris -Dionysus and Jesus Christ in a simple and elegant way. They are parts of one developing myt hos. The Jesus Mysteries Thesis answered many puzzling quest ions, yet it also opened up new dilemmas. Isn't there indisputable historical evidence for the existence of Jesus the man? And how c oul d Gnosticism be the original Christ ianit y when St Paul, the earliest Christian we know about, is so vociferously ant i-Gnosti c? And is it really credible that such an insular and anti - Pagan people as the Jews could have adopted the Pagan Mysteries? And h ow coul d it have happened that a consciously created myt h came to be believed as history? And if Gnosticism represents genuine Christ ianit y,why was it Literalist Christ ianit y t hat came to dominate the worl d as the most influent ial religio n of all t ime? Al l o f these difficult quest ions would have to be sat isfactorily answered before we could who leheartedly accept such a radical theory as the Jesus Mysteries Thesis."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"THE GREAT COVER UP Our new account of the origins o f C hristianit y only seemed improbable beca use it contradicted the received view. As we pushed further with our research, the tradit ional picture began to com pletely unravel all around us. We found ourselves embro iled in a world of schism and power struggl es, of forged docum ents and false ident it ies, of letters that had been edited and added to, and of the who lesale destruction of historical evidence. We focused forensically on the few facts we could be confident of, as if we were detectives on the verge of cracking a sensat ional 'whodunnit ', or per haps more accurately as if we were uncovering an ancient and unacknowledged miscarriage o f just ice. For, time and again, when we crit ically examined what genuine evidence remained, we found that the history of Christianit y bequeathed to us by the Rom an Chu rch was a gross distortion of the truth. Actually the evidence completely endorsed the Jesus Mysteries Thesis! It was beco ming increasingly obvious that we had been deliberately deceived, that the Gnostics were indeed the original Christians, and that thei r anarchic myst icism had been hijacked by an authoritarian inst itution which had created from it a dogmat ic religio n - and then brutally enforced the greatest cover -up in history. One of the major players in this cover -up operati on was a character called Eusebius who, at the beginning of the fourth century, compiled from legends, fabricat ions and his own imaginat ion t he only early history of Christianit y t hat still exists today. All subsequent histories have been forced to base themselves on Eusebius' dubi ous claims, because there has been litt le other informat ion t o draw on. All those with a different perspective on Christ ianit y were branded as heret ics and eradicated. In this way falsehoods compiled in the fourth century have come down to us as establishe d facts. Eusebius was emplo yed by the Ro ma n E mperor Constantine, who made Christ ianit y t he state religio n of the Empire and gave Literalist Christ ianit y t he power it needed to begin the final eradi cat ion of Paganism and Gnost icism. Constantine wanted 'one God, one religion' to conso lid ate his claim of 'one Empire, one Emperor'. He oversaw the creation of the Nicene creed -the article of fait h repeated in churches to this day -and Christians who refused to assent to this creed were banished fro m t he Empir e or otherwise silenced. This 'Christian' Emperor then returned home fro m N icaea and had his wife suffocated and his son murdered. He deliberately remained unbaptized unt il his deathbed so that he could continue his atrocit ies and st ill receive forgivenes s of sins and a guaranteed place in heaven by being bapt ized at the last mo me nt. Al though he had his 'spin doctor' Eusebius compose a suitably obsequious biography for him, he was actually a monster -just like many Ro ma n E mperors before him. Is it really at all surpri sing that a 'history' of the origins of Christianit y created by an em ploy ee in the service of a Ro ma n t yrant shoul d turn out to be a pack of lies? Elaine Pagels, one of the foremost academic authorities on early Christianit y,wri tes: 'It i s the winners who write history -their way . No wonder, then, that the tradi tional accounts of the origins of Christ ianit y f irst defined the terms (naming them selves \"orthodox\" and their opponents \"heretics\"); then they proceeded to dem onstrate -atleast to their own satisfaction -that thei r tri umph was historically inevitable, or, in religious terms, \"guided by the Holy Spirit\". But the discoveries [of the Gnostic gospels] at Nag Hammad i reopen fundamental quest ions.’ History is indeed written by the vict ors.

History is not simply related, it is created. Ideally, the motivat ion is to explain historical evidence and co me to an accurate understanding of how the present has been created by the past. All too often, however, it is simply to glorify and justify the status quo. Such histories conceal as much as they reveal. To dare to question a received history is not easy. It is difficult to believe that something which y ou have been told is true from childhood could actually be a product of falsificat ion and fantasy .

It must have seemed ridiculous when they asserted that he had even had the images of his rivals removed from photographs and completely fabricated historical events. Yet all these things are true. It i s easy to b elieve that something must be true because everyo ne else believes it. But the truth often only co mes to light by daring to question the unquestion able, by doubt ing notions which are so commo nly believed that they are taken for granted. The Jesus Mysteries Thesis is the product of such an openness of mind. When it first occurred to us, it seemed absurd and impossible. Now it seems obvious and ordinar y.The Vat ican was constructed upon the site of an ancient Pagan sanctuary because the new is always built upon the old. In the same way Chr istianit y it self has as its foundat ions the Pagan spiritualit y t hat preceded it. What is more plausible than to posi t th e gradual evo lut ion o f sp iritual ideas, with Christ ianit y e merging from the ancient Pagan Mysteries in a seamless historical continuum? It is only because the convent ional history has been so widely believed for so long that this idea could be seen as heret ical and shocking. RECOVERING MYSTICAL CHRISTIANITY As the final pieces of the puzzle were falling into place, we came across a small picture tucked away in t he appendices of an old academic book. It was a drawing of a third -century CE am ulet. We have used it as the cover of this book. It shows a crucified figure which most people would immediately recognize as Jesus. Yet the Greek words name the figure 'Orpheus Bacchus', one of the pseudonyms o f Osir is-Dionysus. To the author of the book in which we f ound the pi cture, thi s amulet was an ano ma ly. Who could it have possibly belo nged to? Was it a crucified Pagan dei tyor s om e sort of Gnost ic synt hesis o f Paganism and Christ ianit y? E ither way it was deeply puzzling. For us, however, this amulet was perfect ly u nderstandable. It was an unexpected confirmat ion of the Jesus Mysteries Thesis. The image could be that of eit her Jesus or Osiris - Dionysus. To the init iated, these were both names for essent ially the same figure.

It did not simply fade away into oblivio n. It was actively sup pressed and annihilated, its temples and shrines desecrated and demo lished, and its great sacred books thrown onto bonfires. No living lineage has been left to explain its ancient beliefs. So, the Pagan worldview has to be reconstructed from the archaeo logical evidence and texts that have survived, like so me g iant metaphysical jigsaw puzzl e. 'Pagan' was originally a derogatory term meaning 'country -dweller', used by Christ ians to imply that the spi rituali tyofthe ancients was so me primit ive rural superst ition. But thi s is not true. Paganism was the spiritualit y which inspired the unequalled magnificence of the Giza pyramids, the exquisite architecture of the Parthenon, the legendary sculptures of Phideas, the powerful plays o f E uri pides and Sophocles, and the sublime philo sophy ofSocrates and Plato. Pagan civilizat ion built vast libraries to house hundreds of thousands of works of literary and scientific genius. Its natural philosophers speculated that human beings had evo lved fro m animals.2 Its astronomer s knew the Earth was a sphere' which, along with the planets, revo lves around the sun.4 They had even est imated its circumference to within one degree of accuracy.5 The ancient Pagan world sustained a populat ion not matched again in Europe until the eighte enth century .6 In Greece, Pagan culture gave birth to the concepts of democracy, rational philo sophy , public libraries, theatre and the Olympic Games, creating a blueprint for our modern world. What was the spiritualit y t hat inspired these mo mentous cultur alachievements? Most peopl e associ ate Paganism wit h either rustic witchcraft or the myt hs of the gods of Olympus as recorded by Hesiod and Homer. Pagan spiritualit y d id indeed embrace both. The country people practised their tradi tional shamanic nature wo rship to maintain the fertilit y o f the land and the cit y authori ties propped up formal state religio ns, such as the worship of the Olympian gods, to maintain the power of the status quo. It was, however, a third, more myst ical, expression of the Pagan spi rit which inspired the great minds of the ancient world. The thinkers, artists and innovators of ant iquit y were init iates ofvarious religio ns known as 'Mysteries'. These remarkable men and wo me n held the Mysteries to be the heart and soul of their culture . The Greek historian Zosimos writes that without the Mysteri es life for the Greeks would be unlivable' for 'the sacred Mysteries hold the whole human race together'.7 The eminent Roman statesman Cicero enthuses: ‘These Mysteries have brought us from rust ic savagery to a cult ivated and refined civilisat ion. The rites of the Mysteries are called \"init iat ions\" and in truth we have learned fro m t hem the first principles o f life. We have gained the understanding not only to live happily but also to die with be tter hope.'8"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Unlike the tradit ional r ituals of the official state religio ns, which were designed to aid social cohesio n, the Mysteries were an individualist ic fo rm ofspiri tuali tywhich offered myst ical visio ns and personal enlightenment.9 Init iates under went a secret process of init iation which prof oundly transform ed thei r state of consciousness. The poet Pindar reveals that an init iate into the My steri es 'knows the end of life and its God -given beginning'.10 Lucius Apuleius, a poet - philosopher, writes o f his experience of init iation as a spi ritual rebi rth which he celebrated as his birthday , an experi ence for which he felt a 'debt of gratitude' that he 'could never hope to repay'.11 Plato, the most influential phil osopher of all t ime, relates: 'We behe ld the beatific visio ns and were init iated into the Mystery which may be truly called blessed, celebrated by us in a state of innocence. We beheld calm, happy, simple, eternal visio ns, resplendent in pure light.'12 The great Pagan philo sophers were the en lightened masters of the Mysteries. Although they are often portray ed today as dry 'academic' intellectuals, they were actually enigmat ic 'gurus'. Em pedocl es, like his master Pythagoras, was a charismat ic mir acle -worker.13 Socrates was an eccentric myst ic prone to being suddenly overco me by states of rapture during which his friends woul d discover him staring off into space for hours.14 Heraclitus was asked by the cit izens of Ephesus to become a lawmaker, but turned the offer down so that he could cont inue playing wi th the children in the temple.15 Anaxagoras shocked ordinary cit izens by co mp letely abandoning his farm to fully devote his life to 'the higher philo sophy'.16 Diogenes owned nothing and lived in a jar at the entrance of a temple.17 The inspired p laywright Euripides wrote his greatest tragedi es during so litary retreats in an iso lated cave.18 All o f these idiosyncrat ic sages were steeped in the myst icism of the Mysteries, which theyexpressed in their philo sophy . Olympi odorus, a fo llo wer of Plato, tells us that his master paraphrased the Mysteries everywhere.19 The works of Heraclitus were renowned even in ancient times for being obscure and impenetrable, yet Diogenes explains that they are crystal clear to an init iate of the Mysteries. Of studying Heracli tus he writes: 'It i s a hard road to follow, filled with darkness and gloom; but if an init iate leads you on the way , it b eco mes br ighter than the radiance of the sun.' 20 Atthe heart of Pagan philo sophy is an understanding that all things are One. The Mysteries aimed at awakening within the init iate a sublime experience of this Oneness. Sallust ius declares: 'Every init iation aims at unit ing us with the World and wit h t he Deit y.'21 Plotinus describes the init iate transcending his limited sense o f hi mself as a separate ego and experiencing myst ical unio n with God: 'As if borne away, or possessed by a god, he attains to solitude in untroubled stillness, nowhere deflected in his being and unbusied with self, utterly at rest and beco me ver y r est. He doe s not converse wit h a statue or image but with Godhead itself. And this is no object of visio n, but another mode of seeing, a detachment fro m self, a simplificat ion and surrender of self, a yearning for contact, and a stillness and meditat ion directed towa rds transformation. Whoever sees himself in thi s way has attained likeness to God; let him abandon himself and find the end o f his journeying .’22"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"No wonder the init iate Sopatros poetically mused, 'I came out of the Mystery Hall feeling like a stranger to myself ' 23 THE SACRED SPECTACLE AT ELEUSIS What were these ancient Mysteries that could inspire such reverent awe and heartfelt appreci ation? The Mystery religio n was practised for thousands of years, during which t ime it spread throughout the ancient wor ld, taking on many different forms. Some were frenzied and others meditative. Some invo lved bloody animal sacrifice, while others were presided over by stri ct vegetarians. At certain mo me nts in history the Mysteries were openly practised by who le popul ations and were endorsed, or at least tolerated, by the state. At other times they were a small -scale and secretive affair, for fear of persecution by unsympathet ic authorit ies. Central to all o f these forms o f the Mysteries, however, was the myth o f a dying a nd resurrect ing godman. The Greek Mysteries celebrated at Eleusis in honour of the Great Mother goddess and the godm an Di onysus were the most famous of all the Mystery cults. The sanctuary of Eleusis was finally destroy ed by bands of fanatical Christian m onks in 396 CE, but up until this tragic act of vandalism the Mysteries had been celebrated there for over 11 centuries.24 At the height of their popul ari typeopl e were coming fro m a ll over the then known world to be init iated: men and wom en, ri ch and poor , slaves and emperors25 -even a Brahmin priest fro m I ndia.26 Each year some 30,000 Athenian cit izens embarked on a 30 -kilo metre barefoot pilgrimage to the sacred site of Eleusis on the coast to celebrate the autumn Mysteries of Dionysus.27 For day s they woul d have been preparing for this important religious event by fast ing, offering sacrifices and under -going ritual purificat ion. As those about to be init iated danced along the 'Sacred Way ’to El eusis, accompanied by the frenzied beat of cymbals and tambo urines, they were accosted by ma sked men who abused and insulted them, while others beat them with st icks.28 At the head of the processio n was carried the statue of Dionysus himself, leading them ever onwards. After ritual naked bathing in the sea and othe r purificat ion cerem onies the crowd reached the great doors of the Telesterion, a huge purpose -built init iat ion hall. Only the chosen few who were already init iated or about to be init iated into the secret Mysteri es coul d enter here. What aweso me ceremony was held behind these closed doors that touched the great philosophers, artists, statesmen and scient ists of the ancient world so deeply? All init iates were sworn to secrecy and held the Mysteries so sacred that they kept this oath.29 From large numbers of hints and clues, however, we know that they wit nessed a sublime theatrical spectacle. They were awed by sounds and dazzled by lights. They were bathed in the blaze of a huge fire and trembled to the nerve -shattering reverberat ions of a might y gong. The H ierophant, the high priest ofthe Mysteries, was quite literally a 'showman ’who orchestrated a terrifyingly transformative dram atic reenact me ntofsacred myt h. He himself was dressed as the central character -the godm an Di onysus.30 A mo dern scho lar write s: 'A Mystery Religi on was thus a divine drama which portrayed before the wondering eyes of the privileged observers the story o f the struggles, sufferings, and victory of a patron deit y,the travail ofnature in which life ult imately trium phs over death, and jo y is bo rn of pain. The who le r itual ofthe Mysteri es aimed especially at quickening the emotional life.

They were participants who shared in the passio n of the godman whose death and rebirth symbo lically represented the death and spiritual rebirth ofeach one of them. As a mo dern authori tyexplains: 'Dio nysus was the god of the most blessed ecstasy and the most enraptured love. But he was also the persecuted god, the suffering and dying god, and all who m he loved, all who attended him, had to share his tragic fate. ' 33 By witnessing the aweso me t ragedy of Dio nysus, the init iates at Eleusis shared in his suffering, death and resurrection, and so experienced a spirit ual purificat ion known as 'catharsis'. 34 The Mysteries did not offer religious dogma s to simply be believed, but a myt h to be entered into. Init iation was not about learning so mething, but about experiencing an altered state ofawareness. Plutarch, a Pagan high priest, confesses that those who had been init iated could produce no proof of the beliefs that they acquired. Aristotle maintains, 'It is not necessary for the init iated to l earn anyt hing, but to receive impressio ns and to be put in a certain frame of mind.35 The philosopher Proclus talks of the Mysteries as evoking a 'sympathy o f the soul with the ritual in a way that is unintelligible to us and divine, so that some of the init iates are stricken with panic, being filled wit h divine awe; others assimilate themselves to the holy symbo ls, leave their own identit y,beco me at home with t he gods, and experience divine possessio n/36 Why did the myth enacted by the Mysteries have such a profound effect? ENCODED SECRET TEACHINGS In ant iquit y t he word myt hos di d not m ean so met hing 'untrue ’, as it does for us today. Superficially a myt h was an entertaining story , but to the init iated it was a sacred code that contained profound spiritual teachings.37 Plato comments, 'It looks as if those also who established rites of init iat ion fo r us were no fools, but that there is a hidden meaning in their teachings/38 He explains that it is 'those who have given their lives to true philosophy' who will grasp the 'hidden meaning' encoded in the Mystery myt hs, and so beco me completely ident ified withthe godm an in an experience of myst ical enlightenment.39 Th e ancient philosophers were not so foolish as to believe that the Mystery myt hs were literally true, but wise enough to recognize that they were an easy introduction to the profound myst ical philosophy at the heart of the Mysteries. Sallust ius writes: 'To wish to teach all men the truth of the gods causes the foolish to despise, because they cannot lear n, and the good to be slothful, whereas to conceal the truth by myt hs prevents the former from despising philosophy and compels the latter to study it.' 40"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"It was the role of the priests and philo sophers of the Mysteries to decode the hidden depths o f spi ritual meaning contained wit hin the Mystery myt hs. Heliodorus, a priest of the Mysteries, explains: 'Philosophers and theologians do not disclose the meani ngs embedded in these stori es to l aymen but simply give them preliminary instruction in the form of a my th. But those who have reached the higher grades of the Mysteries they init iate int o clear knowledge in the privacy o f the ho ly shr ine, in the light cas t by the blazing torch of truth.' 41 The Mysteries were divided into various levels o f init iat ion, which led an init iate step by step through ever deepening levels of understanding. The number of levels o f init iat ion var ied in different My stery tradi tions , but essent ially the init iate was led fro m t he Outer Mysteries, in which the myt hs were understood superficially as religious stories, to the Inner Mysteries, in which the myt hs were revealed as spiritual allegories. First the init iate was ritually purifi ed. Then theywere taught the secret teachings on a one -to-one basis.42 The highest stage was when the init iate understood the true meaning of the teachings and finally experienced what Theon of Sm yrna calls 'friendship and interior communion with God'. TH E INTERNATIONAL MYSTERIES The Mysteries do minated the Pagan world. No other deit y is represented on the monuments of ancient Greece and Italy as much as Dionysus, godman of the Eleusinian Mysteries.43 He is a dei tywithmany names: Iacchos, Bassareus, Brom ios, Euios, Sabazius, Zagreus, Yhyo neus, Lenaios, Eleuthereus, and so the list goes on.44 But these are just some o f his Greek names! The godm an is an omnipresent mythic figure throughout the ancient Mediterranean, known in different way s by many cultures. Five centuries before the birth of Christ, the Greek historian Herodotus, known as 'the father of history', discovered this when he travelled to Egypt. On the shores of a sacred lake in the Nile delta he witnessed an enormous fest ival, held every year, i n which the Egypt ians perform ed a dram atic spectacle before 'tens of thousands of men and wo me n', represent ing the death and resurrection of Osiris. Herodotus was an init iate into the Greek Mysteries and recogni zed that what he calls 'the Passio n of Osiris ' was the very same drama that init iates saw enacted before them at Eleusis as the Passio n of Dionysus.45 The Egyptian myt h of Osiris is the primal myt h of the Mystery godman and reaches back to prehistory. His story is so ancient that it can be found in p yramid texts written over 4,500 years ago! 46 In travelling to Egy pt Herodotus was fo llo wing in the footsteps of another great Greek. Before 670 BCE Egy pt had been a closed country, in the manner of Tibet or Japan more recent ly, but in this year she opene d her borders and one of the first Greeks who travelled there in search of ancient wisdo m was Pythagoras.47 History remembers Pythagoras as the first 'scient ist' of the Western world, but although it is true that he brought back many mathemat ical theori es to Greece from Egypt, to his contemporaries he would have seemed anyt hing but 'scient ific' in the modern sense. A wandering charismat ic sage dressed in white robes and crowned with a gold coronet, Py thagoras was part scient ist, part priest and part magici an.48 He spent 22 y ears in the temples ofEgy pt, becoming an init iate of the ancient Egyptian Mysteries.49 On returning to Greece he"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"began to preach the wisdo m he had learned, performing miracles, raising the dead and giving oracl es. Inspired by Pythagora s, his disciples created a Greek Mystery religio n mo delled on the Egy pti an Mysteries. They took the indigenous wine god Dionysus, who was a minor deit y a ll but ignored by Hesiod and Homer, and transformed him into a Greek version of the might y E gyptian Osi ris, godm an o f the Mysteries. This init iated a religious and cultural revo lut ion t hat was to transform Athens into the centre of the civilized world.50 The fo llo wers of Py thagoras were m odel s o f virtue and learning, regarded as puritans by their neighbour s. Stri ct vegetarians, they preached non -vio lence towards all living things and shunned the temple cults that practised the sacrifice of animals. This made it impossible for them to participate in the tradit ional Olympian religio n of At hens. Forced to live on the fringes of acceptabilit y, they often organi zed themselves into communit ies that shared all possessio ns in commo n, leaving them free to devote themselves to their myst ical studies of mathemat ics, music, astronomy and philosophy.51 Nevertheless, the Mystery religio n spread quickly amo ngst the ordinary peopl e and within a few generat ions the Egypt ian Mysteries of Osiris, now the Mysteri es of Dio nysus, inspired the glory of Classical Athens. In the same way that Osiris was synt hesized by the Greeks wit h t heir indigenous god Dionysus to create the Greek Mysteries, other Mediterranean cultures which adopted the Mystery religio n also transformed one of their indigenous deit ies into the dying and resurrecting Mystery godm an. So, the dei tywho was known as O siris in Egypt and became Dio nysus in Greece was called Attis in Asia Minor, Adonis in Syria, Bacchus in Italy, Mit hras in Persia, and so on. Hi s fo rm s were many, but essent ially he was the same perennial figure, whose collect ive ident it y was referred to a s Osir is-Dionysus.52 Because the ancients recognized that all the various Mystery godmen were essentially the same myt hic being, elements fro m d ifferent myt hs and rites were continually co mbined and recombined to create new forms of the Mysteries. In Alex andria, for example, a charismat ic sage called Timotheus consciously fused Osiris and Dionysus to produce a new deit y fo r the ci ty called Serapis.53 He also gave an elaborate account of the myt h of the Mystery godman Attis. Lucius Apuleius received his ini tiation int o the Egypt ian Mysteries from a high priest named after the Persi an godm an Mi thras. Co ins were mint ed wi thDionysus represented on one side and Mi thras on the other.54 One modern authorit y t ells us that 'possessed by the knowledge of his own sec ret ri tes', the init iate of the Mysteries 'found no difficult y in conforming to any religio n in vogue'.55 Like the Christ ian religio n which superseded it, the Mysteries reached across nat ional boundaries, offering a spiritualit y which was relevant to all human beings, regardless of their raci alori gins or soci alstatus. Even as early as the fifth century BCE philosophers such as Diogenes and Socrates called themselves 'cosmopolitans' -'cit izens of the cosmos' -rather than ofany particular country or cul ture, whi ch is testimo ny t o th e internat ional nature of the Mysteri es.56 One modern scho lar, comment ing on the merging and co mbining of different mystery tradi tions, wri tes: 'This went a long way towards weaning the minds of men fro m t he idea of separate gods from the different nations, and towards teaching them that all nat ional and local deit ies were but different forms of one great Power. But for the rise of Christ ianit y a nd other religio ns, there can be lit tle doubt but that the whole of the Graeco -Rom an dei ties woul d continually have merged int o Di onysus.'57"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"OSIRIS -DIONYSUS AND JESUS CHRIST Osi ris-Dionysus had such universal appeal because he was seen as an 'Everyman ’figure who symbo lically represented each init iate. Through understanding the allegori cal myt h of the Mystery godm an, init iates could beco me aware that, like Osiris -Dionysus, they were also 'God made flesh'. They too were immortal Spirit trapped within a physical body. Through sharing in the death of Osiris -Dionysus init iates symbo lically ' died' to their lower earthly nature. Through sharing in his resurrect ion t hey were spiritually reborn and experienced their eternal and divine essence. This was the profound myst ical teaching that the myt h of Osiris -Dionysus encoded for those init iated int o th e Inner Mysteries, the truth of which init iates direct ly e xperienced for them selves. Wr it ing o f the Egypt ian Mystery godm an Osiris, Sir Wallis Budge, who was keeper of ant iquit ies in the Brit ish Museum, explains: ‘The Egy ptians of every period in whi ch they are known to us believed that Osiris was of divine origin, that he suffered death and mutilat ion at the hands of the power of evil, that after great struggle with these powers he rose again, that he became henceforth the king of the underworld and judge of the dead, and that because he had conquered death the righteous might also conquer death. ’58 'He represented to men the idea o f a ma n who was both God and man, and he t ypified to the Egypt ians in all ages the being who by reason o f his sufferings and death as a man could sympathise wit h t hem in their own sickness and death. The idea o f his human personalit y a lso sat isfied their cravings and yearnings for communio n with a being who, though he was partly divine, yet had much in commo n with themselve s. Ori ginally they looked upon Osiris as a man who lived on the earth as they lived, who ate and drank, who suffered a cruel death, who by help of certain gods triumphed over death, and attained unto everlast ing life. But what Osi ris di d they coul d also do .’59 These are the key motifs that characterize the myt hs of all the Mystery godmen. What Budge wri tes of Osi ris coul d equally be said of Dio nysus, Attis, Adonis, Mithras and the rest. It also describes the Jewish dying and resurrecting godman Jesus Chri st. Li ke Osiris -Dionysus, he is also God Incarnate and God of the Resurrection. He also promises his fo llo wers spiritual rebirth through sharing in his divine Passio n. CONCLUSION The Mysteries were clearly an extremely powerful force in the ancient world. Let's review what we've discovered about them: • The Pagan Mysteries inspired the greatest minds of the ancient world. • They were practised in different forms by nearly every cul ture in the Mediterranean. • They compr ised Outer Mysteries which were open to all and secret Inner Mysteries known only to th ose who had undergone a powerful process of myst ical init iat ion. • Atthe heart of the Mysteries was the myt h of a dying and resurrecting godman -Osi ris- Dionysus. • The Inner Mysteries revealed the myths ofOsiris - Dionysus to be spiritual allegories encoding spi ritual teachings."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The quest ion which intrigued us was whether the Mysteries could have somehow influenced and shaped what we have inherited as the 'biography' of Jesus?

The Pagan philosopher and sat irist Celsus crit icized Chr istians for trying to pass off the Jesus story as a new revelat ion when it was actually an inferi or imi tati on of Pagan myt hs.

The Church father Tertullian wri tes of the Devil's 'diabo lical mimicry' in creat ing the Mysteri es of Mit hras: ‘The devil, whose business is to pervert the truth, mimics the exact circumstances ofthe Divine Sacraments. He baptises his believers and promises forgiveness of sins from the Sacred Fount, and thereby init iates them into the religio n of Mit hras.

Dionysus is the 'Son of Zeus, in his full nature God, most terrible, although most gent le to mankind'.7 Jesus is 'Very God of Very God'.8 D io nysus is 'Lord God of God born!'9 Jesus is God in human form. St John writes of Jesus as 'the Word made flesh'.10 St Paul explains that 'God sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh.'11 Dionysus was also known as Bacchus, hence the tit le o f E uri pides' play Th e Bacchae, in which Dionysus is the central character. In this play, Dionysus explains that he has veiled his 'Godhead in a mortal shape' in order to make it 'manifest to mortal men'.12 He tells his disciples, 'That is why I have changed my immortal form and taken the likeness of a man.' 13 Like Jesus, in many of his myt hs the Pagan godman is born of a mortal virgin mother. In Asia Minor, Attis' mother is the virgin Cybele.14 In Syria, Adonis' virgin mother is called Myrrh. In Alexandria, Aio n is born of the virgin Kore.15 In Greece, Dionysus is born of a mortal virgin Sem ele who wishes to see Zeus in all his glory and is mysteriously impregnated by one of his bo lts of lightning.16 It was a popular tradit ion, recorded in the most quoted non -canonical text of early Chr istianit y, that Jesus spent only seven months in Mary's womb.17 The Pagan historian Diodorus rel ates that Di onysus' mother Semele likewise was said to have also had only a seven - mo nth pregnancy.18 Just in Martyr acknowledges the s imilarit ies between Jesus' virgin birth and Pagan my thology , wri ting: 'In saying that the Word was born for us without sexual union as Jesus Christ our teacher, we introduce nothing beyo nd what is said of those called the Sons of Zeus.

Even the Christ ian Lactant ius acknowledged that the legendary Egypt ian sage Herm es Tri smegistus had 'arrived in so me way at the truth, for on God the Father he ha d said everyt hing, and on the Son'.20 In Egypt, the Pharaoh had for thousands of years been regarded as an embodiment of the godman Osiris and praised in hymns as the Son of God.21 As an eminent Egy ptol ogist wri tes, 'Every Ph araoh had to be the Son of God and a human mother in order that he shoul d be the Incarnate God, the Giver of Fertilit y t o his country and people.'22 In many legends the great prophets of Osiris -Dionysus are al so portrayed as saviours and sons of God. Py thagoras was said to be the son ofApo llo and a mortal woman called Parthenis, whose name derives fro m t he word parthenos, meaning 'virgin'.23 Plato was also posthumously believed to be the son of Apo llo .24 Philostratus relates in his biography of Apo llo nius that the great Pagan sage was regarded as the 'Son of Zeus'. Empedocles was thought to be a godman and savi our who had come down to this world to help confused souls, beco ming 'like a madman, calling out to people at the top of his voice and urging them to reject this realm and what i s in it and go back to their own original, sublime, and noble world'.25"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"My thic mot ifs from the Mysteries even became associated with Roman Emperors who, for poli tical reasons, cul tivated legends about their divine nature which would link them to Osi ris-Dionysus. Julius Caesar, who did not himself even believe in personal immortalit y,26 was hailed as 'God made manifest, the commo n saviour of human life'.27 His successor, Augustus, was likewise the 'saviour of the universal human race'28 and even the tyranni cal Nero i s addressed on an altar piece as 'God the deliverer for ever'.29 In 40 BCE, drawing on Mystery my ths, the Roman poet and init iate Virgil wrote a myst ical 'prophesy' that a virgin would give birth to a divine child.30 In the fourth century CE Lite ralist Christ ians would claim that it foretol d the coming of Jesus, but at the time this myt h was interpreted as referring to Augustus, said to be the 'Son of Apo llo ', preordained to rule the Earth and bring peace and prosperit y.31 In his biography o f Augu stus, Suetonius offers a cluster of 'signs' that indicated the Emperor's divine nature. One modern authorit y wr ites: 'They include so me striking points of similarit y t o th e gospel narratives of the birth of Christ. The senate is supposed, with ludicrous i mplausibilit y,to have decreed a ban on rearing male Ro ma n babies in the year of Augustus' birth because of a portent indicat ing that a king of Ro me had been born. On top of this slaughter of the innocents, we are offered an Annunciat ion: his mother At ia dream ed during a visit to the temple of Apo llo that the god had visited his favour on her in the form of a snake; Augustus was born nine months later.'32 An inscription wri tten around the time that Jesus is supposed to have lived reads: 'This day has give n t he earth an entirely new aspect. The world would have gone to destruction had there not streamed forth from him who is now born a commo n blessing. Right ly does he judge who recognises in this birthday the beginning of life, -now is that time ended when me n pit ied themselves for being born.

The Providence which rules over all has filled thi s man with such gift s fo r the salvat ion of the worl d as designate him as saviour for us and for the coming generations; of wars he will make an end, and establish all things worthily.

The birthday o f G od has brought to the world glad ti dings that are bound up in him. Fro m his birthday a new era begins.'33 But thi s is not a Christian celebration of the birth of Jesus. I t is not even a eulogy to the Mystery godm an. It i s in honour of Augustus. These myt hic motifs were clearly so commo n by the first century BCE that they were used to fabricate legends polit ically helpful to a living Emperor. Celsus catalogues numbers o f figures to whom legend similarly attributes divine parentage and a miraculous birth, and accuses Christianit y of clearly using Pagan myt hs In fabricat ing the story of Jesus ’virgin birth'34 He is disparaging of Christ ians who interpret this my thas historic alfact and regards the notion that God could literally father a child on a mortal wom an as plainly absurd.35"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE NATIVITY Just as Christ ians celebrate the nat ivit y o f Jesus, init iates of the Mysteries celebrated the birth of Osi ris-Dionysus, who was 'The wondrous babe of God, the Mystery'36 and 'He of the miraculous birth'37 (see plates 1 and 2). The Church father Hippolytus tells about the loud voice of the Hierophant of the El eusinian Mysteries who, 'screaming ’, procl aims the divine birth.38 A mo dern Cla ssicist writes: 'The myst ic child at Eleusis was born of a maiden; these ancients made for them selves the sacred dogma \"A virgin shall conceive and bear a son\",39 by night there was declared \"Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given\".'40 On the bi rth of Osi ris a vo ice was said to have proclaimed: 'The Lord of the all the Earth is born.'41 An ancient Egyptian hymn proclaims: 'Thou divine man -child, King of the Earth, Prince ofthe Underworld.'42 Another glorious Egypt ian poem, reminiscent of many Ch ristian carols, exults: ‘He is born! He is born! O come and adore Him! Life -giving mothers, the mothers who bore Him, Stars of the heavens the daybreak adorning. Ancestors, y e, of the Star of the Morning.

In the Mysteries of Dio nysus a sacred marriage, from which will issu e the divine child, was performed in the boukolio n, or 'ox stall ’.45 However, the word usually translated as 'stable ’in t he gospels is katalemna, which literally means a temporary shel ter or cave.46 It was a widespread early Christ ian tradit ion t hat Jesus was born in a cave. This is a very ancient image. The cave is the womb of Mother Earth. There were caves sacred to the Greek god Pan, another name for Dionysus, all over the ancient world. The Persian godm an Mi thras was said to have been born in a cave. According to Orphic myt hs, Di onysus was also born in a cave, where he was immediately enthroned as 'King o f the World ’.47"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The baby Jesus is visited by the ‘Th ree Wise Men ’and three shepherds.

The name 'Bethlehem ’means ‘The House of Bread ’. St Jerom erel ates the intriguing fact that Bethlehem was shaded by a grove sacred to the My stery godman Adonis, who was regarded as a god of the corn and represented by bread!51 In the Jesus story, the Three Wise Men find Jesus in Bethlehem by fo llo wing a star. Th e Mysteri es of Adonis in ancient Ant ioch were celebrated by cries that the 'Star of Salvat ion has dawned in the East ’.52 This was the Morning Star, which is actually the planet Venus. Venus is one of the names for the goddess who in certain myt hs is the co nsort of Osiris -Dionysus. In Egy pt she was called Isis. For millennia she was associated with the bright star Sirius at the feet ofthe constellat ion of Orion, which represented Osiris. The first appearance of Sirius was a yearly om en which announced the r ising of the flo odwaters of the Nile, which was associated withthe worl d-renewing power of Osiris.53 Thus the star foretold the coming of the Lord. St Epi phanius tells us that in Alexandria the birth of Osiris -Dionysus as Aio n was cel ebrated on 6 January . The previous night the temple was alive with the sound of flutes and singing, reaching its height at cockcrow. Those taking part then went by torchlight into an underground sanctuary fro m w hich they brought an image of the god carved in wood and marked with 't he sign of a cross on hands, knees, and head ’. The highlight of this Mystery celebration was the announcement: ‘Today at thi s hour the virgin Kore has given birth to Aion. ’54 St Epi phanius must have found this a perplexing coincidence for, along wit h ma ny other early Christ ians, he celebrated the same date, 6 January, as the birthday of Jesus -as does the Ar menian Church to the present day.55 Goodness only knows what he made of the 'markings of the si gn of the cross on the hands, knees and head ’! There was quite a dispute in early Christ ianit y about whether the birth of Christ was 25 December or 6 January. Was this because no one could remember? Or could it be simply because early Christ ians were unsure whether to synchronize it with the birth of Mi thras or wi th the birth of Aio n, both of who m were different representations of the perennial Mystery godm an? These dates were not arbitrarily chosen. Both were once the dates of the winter solst ice, the shortest day , which signals the turning point of th e year and the returning of the life -giving sun.

BAPTISM Jesus' missio n begins wit h his baptism by John the Baptist.^ Mytho logists such as Joseph Cam pbell have seen ancient myt ho logical mot ifs behind this story. Campbell writes: 'The r ite of baptism was an ancient rite coming down fro m t he old Sumerian temple cit y E ridu, ofthe water god Ea, \"God of the House of Water\". In the Hellenist ic period, Ea was called Oannes, which is in Greek Ioannes, Latin Johannes,' Hebrew Yohanan, English J ohn. Several scho lars have suggested, therefore, that there was never either John or Jesus, but only a water - god and a sun -god.'59 Examining the stories of John the Baptist and Jesus, we do seem to be clearly in myt ho logical terri tory . Thei r two stori es re flect each other perfectly. They both have miraculous births. John is born to an old wo ma n. Jesus is born to a young woman. John's mother is infert ile. Jesus' mother is unfertilized. John is born at the summer solstice when the sun begins to wane. Jesus is born six mo nths later at the winter solst ice when the sun begins to wax again - hence the Bapt ist's decl arat ion about Jesus: 'He must grow greater, I must beco me less.'60 John is born in the astrol ogi cal sign of Cancer, which for the ancients represented the gate of souls into incarnat ion. Jesus is born in the astrological sign of Capricorn, which for the ancients represented the gate of souls out of incarnat ion int o immortalit y.61 John baptizes with water and Jesus wit h fir e and spi rit. The birthday ofJesus is celebrated on the Pagan fest ival o f the returning sun on 25 December. The birthday of John the Bapt istis celebrated in June, replacing a Pagan midsummer fest ival of water.62 Baptism was a central rite in the Mysteries. As lo ng ago as the Homeric h ymns we hear that ritual purit y was the condit ion of salvat ion and that people were baptized to wash away all their previous sins.63 The Pyramid Texts show that there was a ceremonial bapt ism o f the Egy pti an Pharaoh before the ceremony of his ritual birth as the embodiment of Osiris.64 In so me Mystery rites bapt ism was simply symbo lized by the sprinkling o f ho ly water. In others it invo lved co mp lete immersio n.65 Baptism tanks have been found at init iat ion halls and shrines.66 AtEleusis init iates ri tually cleansed themselves in the sea. In his init iat ion ceremony, after a confessio nal prayer, Lucius Apuleius underwent a bath of purificat ion, and later a baptism o f sprinkling.67 In the Mysteries of Mithras init iates underwent repeated baptisms to wash away their sins. Such init iat ions took place in March or April, at exactly the same t ime that in later centuri es Christ ians also baptized their new converts, called 'catechumens'.68 The similarit ies between Christ ian and Pagan rites were obvious to early Christi ans.69 The Church father Tertullian tells us: 'In certain Mysteries it is by bapt ism that members are init iated and they imagine that the result of this baptism is regenerat ion and the remissio n of the penalt ies of their sins.'70 According to St Paul, th ere are three symbo lic act ions in a bapt ism of total immersio n. Entering the water signifies death, immersio n beneath it means burial, and emergence fro m it resurrecti on.71 This allegorical interpretation of baptism is co mp letely in sympathy wit h t he Myste ryrites, whi ch also represented a myst ical death and resurrection.72 In the early Church,"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"the newly bapt ized were clothed in white robes, given a new name and offered honey to eat.73 Likewise, in the Mysteries o f M ithras, init iates who were spiritually 'r eborn' had honey poured on thei r hands and applied to their tongues, as it was customary to do with newborn children.74 Descript ions by Christ ian authors of Christian baptism are indist inguishable fro m P agan descript ions of Mystery baptism. Christ ian init iates went to baptism naked, then after they came out of the water they put on whi te garments and walked in a processio n to a basilica carrying a candle and wearing a crown. This is ident ical to the procession celebrat ing the , Mysteries of Dionysus at Ele usis, where init iates dressed in white, wearing a crown on their heads and carrying a torch in their hands, walked to the sanctuary singing hymns.75 Just in Mart yrfound the similarit ies between Christian and Pagan rites of bapt ism deeply disturbing. He res orted once again to the 'diabo lical mimicry ’argument. Evil demo ns, he claimed, had inst igated a parody of Chr istian bapt ism in Pagan rites. In the Mysteries, however, purificat ion t hrough baptism was not just by water, but also by air and fire. Lucius Ap uleius tells us that before he was deemed worthy to approach the divinit y he had to 'travel through all the elements'.76 Servius writes: 'Every purificat ion is effected either by water or by fire or by air; therefore in all Mysteri es you find these three met hods of cleansing. They either disinfect you withburning sulphur or wash you with water or vent ilate you with wind; the latter is done in the Dionysiac Mysteries.'77 The gospels also talk of a threefold elemental bapt ism. In the Gospel of Matthew, Joh n t he Baptist predicts the coming o f Jesus, saying, 'Now I bathe you in water to change hearts, but the one coming after me is stronger than me. I am not big enough to carry his shoes. He will bathe you in ho ly breath and fire. Winnowing -fan in hand, he w ill clean up his threshing floor, and co llect the grain to be put in the silo and the husks to be burned in the unquenchable fire.'78 In thi s translat ion t he familiar term 'ho ly sp irit ' is correctly translated fro m t he original Greek as 'ho ly breath', whi ch clearly brings out the idea of baptism by air. John tells us that Jesus will wield a winnowing fan, used for sieving corn. In the Mysteries of Eleusis such a fan was used in bapt ism by air. In vase paint ings and other representations, init iates are pict ured veiled and seated with a winnowing fan being waved above their heads.79 Dionysus was known as 'He of the Winnowing Fan'. At his birth he was said to have been cradled in a winnowing fan, just as, symbo lically, the init iate was at his spiritual rebirth .80 In the same way that an init iate into the Pagan Mysteries was reborn through purificat ion by air, so Jesus promises rebirth through breath. In the Gospel of John, Nicodemus asks him, 'How can a person be born in old age? Can he climb into his mother's belly a second time and be born?' Jesus answers: 'Truly, truly I tell you: anyo ne who isn't born of water and breath can never get int o th e kingdo m o f God. What's born of the flesh is flesh, and what's born of the breath is breath. Don't be amazed becaus e I tol d yo u you have to be born again.

They offered prayers at midnight on 5 January and then all rushed with pitchers to a river to obtain water which was believed now to be holy and possess purifying powers. For hundreds of years BCE Egypt ians had been doing exact ly t he same thing at exact ly t he same t ime. The night of 5 Januar y was said to be a time when the waters of the Nile gained miracle -working powers, through the grace of Osi ris. These waters were drawn in pitchers by the Egypt ians and kept in their houses as a def ence against every evil.83 The night of 5 January was als o th e time when Dionysus was believed to miraculously change water into wine.84 According to Pliny, on the island of Andros a stream o f w ine flowed in t he tem ple of Dio nysus and cont inued for seven days, but if samples of it were taken out of the sanctuary theyimmediately turned to water. We also hear that on Naxos a spring miraculously issued forth fragrant wine. During the Greek festival called Thyia, three empty basins were put into a room in the presence of cit izens and foreigners. The room was then l ocked and sealed, and anyo ne who wanted to could bring his own seal to add to the seal on the door. On the next day the seals rem ained unbroken, but those entering the room found that the three basins had miraculously been filled wit h wine. Pausanias assur es us that cit izens and foreigners alike had vouched under oathfor the reliabilit y of this report.85 According to myt h, the miracle of turning water into wine took place for the first time at the marriage of Dionysus and Ariadne.86 The same miracle is at tributed to Jesus at the wedding feast in Cana.87 In the fourth century CE St Epiphanius relates similar miracles still happening on 6 January and claims to have drunk of a spring that had issued forth wine. But he no longer attributes the miracles to Dion ysus, but to Jesus. For Epiphanius, such miracles now occurred 'at the hour when Jesus ordered the water to be taken to the master of the feast and he changed their water i nto wine ’.88 Other of Jesus ’miracles were also attributed to the Pagan godman. Asc lepius, who was follo wed by Hippocrates, the 'father of medicine ’, was said to have cured the sick and raised the dead. He was known as the 'lo ver of men ’. A comparison between the wonders of Asclepius and the miracles of Jesus was a standard feature of Pa gan ant i-Christian writ ings.89 In reply, early Chr istians described Jesus as the physician greater than great Asclepius. The Pagan Celsus and the Christ ian Origen argued with equal conviction as to the relat ive merits of Asclepius saviour or Jesus saviour. 90 Many o f the inscript ions to Asclepius were taken over by early Christ ians by simply replacing his name wit h t hat of Jesus.91 Many ofthe great prophets of Osiris -Dionysus were renowned as wandering wonder - workers who performed exact ly t he same supernat ural feats attributed to the wandering wonder - worker Jesus. Pythagoras was particularly famous for his miracles. Like Jesus, he was said to have performed many healings and as he went around fro m town to town the word got about that he was co ming 'not to t each, but to heal ’.92 In his Life of Pyt hagoras Iamblichus claims that Py thagoras ’innumerable miracles included 'tranquillisat ions o f the waves of rivers and seas in"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"order that his disciples might the more easily pass over them ’.93 According to the Gospel of Mark, Jesus performs the same miracle to benefit his disciples on the Sea of Galilee.94 This mir acle was clearly part of the legendary biographies of many Pagan wonderworkers, for Iamblichus adds: The power of effecting miracles of this kind was achi eved by Empedocles of Agrigentum , Epimenides the Cretan, and Abaris the Hyperborean, and these they perform ed in many places .95 In the Gospel of John, Jesus miraculously helps his disciples land a large catch of fish.96 This supernatural feat was also per form ed by Pyt hagoras in a legend recorded by Porphyry97 Py thagoras miraculously predicted the exact number of fish that would be caught, but the story does not record what this number was. In the gospel account Jesus makes no such predict ion, but we are to ld t hat the catch numbers exact ly 153 fish. This seems on the face of it to be an irrel evant fact that the gospel writer included just for dramat ic co lour. But scholars have concl uded that it is mentioned deliberately and is highly significant.98 It i s li kely that the number of fish that Pythagoras predicted would be caught was preci sely 153. The Py thagoreans were renowned for their knowledge of mathemat ics and regarded 153 as a sacred number.99 It is used in a mathemat ical ratio which Archimedes called 'the measure of the fish' to produce the myst ical symbo l o f the vesica piscis or 'sign of the fish' - the intersect ion of two circles which yields a fish -like shape. This was an ancient Pythagorean symbo l that was used by early Christ ians to represent'their fait h. The fact that this myst ical fish symbo l can be produced from the number of fish that were caught in the account of Jesus' mir acle strongly suggests it has been adapted from the original miracle of Pythagoras and that thi s miracle story encoded sacre d geom etrical form ulae.10 0 The sign of the fish is widely used today as a symbol of Christ ianit y,but ori ginated in Pagan sacred geometry . Two ci rcles, symbo lic o f spirit and matter, are brought together in a sacred marriage. When the circumference of one touches the centre of the other they co mbine to produce the fish shape known as the vesica piscis. The ratio of height to length of this shape is 153:265, a formula known to Archimedes in the third century BCE as the 'measure of the fish ’. It is a powerfu l mat hematical tool, being the nearest who le nu mber approximation o f the square root of three and the controlling ratio of the equilateral triangle. Py thagoras' disciple Empedocles was another wandering wonder -worker. Like Py thagoras and Jesus, he was a s elf -procl aimed godm an, announcing himself to the people o f Acragas as 'an immortal god, no longer a mortal'. People fo llo wed him in droves, adorning him withribbons and asking for miracles.101 Like Jesus, he was said to have knowledge of the future. Like Jesus, he taught spiritual truths and cured sickness. He was known as 'The Wind Stiller' and, like Jesus, had the abilit y t o c ontrol the wind and rain.102 He assured his disciples that, as a result of what he would teach them, they would be able to fetch f rom the Underworl d the life force of a man who had died.103 Empedocles himself was said to have raised back to life a wom an who had been dead for 30 days, just as Jesus was said to have raised Lazarus 500 years later.104 Apo llo nius of Tyana was another wa ndering godman who healed the sick, predicted the future and raised the dead.105 Although not physically present, he was said to have brought back to life the daughter of a Ro ma n consul in exact ly t he same way as Jesus is said to have brought back to life the daughter of Jairus, a president of the synagogue, without even visit ing her.106"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Like Jesus, Apo llo nius also exorcised evil spirits. He even describes witnessing a feeding mir acle similar to Jesus ’'feeding of the five thousand', a supernatural feat whi ch Celsus tells us is an 'illusio n' performed by many ho ly me n.107 Yet, like Jesus, who claims that a prophet is never recognized in his own country,108 the divine men of Pagan legends are commo nly represented as rejected by their ho me land. Apollo nius of T yana writes in a letter, 'What wonder is it if, while other men consider me equal to God, my native place, so far, ignores me?'109 The gospels tell us that on one occasion Jesus exorcized a man of demons who called them selves 'Legio n’, because there were 'about 2,000 of them ’. These dem ons are cast by Jesus int o a l arge herd of pigs which rush over the edge of a hillside and are drowned.110 Exactly the same motif is found in the rites of the Mysteries at Eleusis.111 As part of the purificat ion cerem ony bef ore init iation, so me 2,000 init iates all bathed in the sea with young pigs.112 This bathing ritual banished all evil into the pigs, which were then sacrificed, as a symbo l of the init iates ’own impurit ies, by being chased over a chasm.113 Even the Penteco stal mir acle of 'speaking in tongues ’is prefigured by Pagan myt h. After Jesus ’death the disciples found themselves miraculously speaking in strange tongues which others heard as their own nat ive language.114 The same pheno me non was reported centuries ear lier at Trophonius and Delos, where the oracular priestesses seemed to some to speak unintelligibly, while other witnesses heard them speaking in their own differing mother tongues.115 Burkert, one of the foremost modern classical scho lars, asserts that th ese Pagan and Chr istian miracles 'have just ly been co mpared ’.116 Chr istians asserted that Jesus ’claim to being the one and only Son of God was proven by his miracles. To Celsus this was plainly ridiculous. He tells us, 'Miracles and wonders have indeed oc curred every where and in all t imes, ’and lists a number of Pagan sages and godmen renowned as wonderworkers.117 The standard Christ ian response to such Pagan crit ics was to claim that whilst Jesus ’miracles were a sign of his divinit y, Pagan miracles were the works of the Devil. Celsus replies indignantly: 'Good l ord! Is it not a silly sort of argument to reckon by the same works that one man is a god whilst his rivals are mere \"sorcerers ”.’118 THE GODMAN AND HIS DISCIPLES Jesus surrounds himself wit h 12 disci ples. This is usually taken to be symbo lic of the 12 tribes of Israel . This notion of 12 tribes, however, is itself a symbo lic reference to the 12 signs o f the zodi ac in Babylo nian astrology, which the Jews adopted whilst in exile in Babylo n.119 The zodi ac was an extremely important symbo l in t he Pagan world. Osiris -Dionysus is symbo lically represented as the still spiritual centre of the turning wheel o f c hange represented by the 12 signs. As Mit hras, Dionysus, Aio n and Helio s, he is often depicted at the centre of the circling zodi ac.120 During the init iat ion ceremony in the Mysteries of Mit hras 12 disciples surrounded the godm an, just as the 12 disciples surrounded Jesus. The Mithraic disciples were dressed up to represent the 12 signs of the zodiac and ci rcled the init iate, who represented Mithras himself.121 The circle of 12 around a central one derives fro m sacred geometry and for the fo llo wers ofPy thagoras contained profound myst ical meaning. Pythagoreans, who were renowned in the ancient world for thei r knowl edge of mathemat ics, conceived of God as a perfect sphere.122 The ancients discovered that if a sphere is surrounded by others of exact ly t he same dimensio ns, so that all the spheres are in contact with each other, the central sphere will be surrounded by"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"exactly 12 others.123 The image of the godman and his 12 disciples encodes such teachings from sacred geometry . In the gospels Jesus is not at first recognized by his disciples as the Son of God, but later is transfigured before Peter, John and James, revealing himself in all his divine glory.124 Likewise in Euripides ’The Bacchae, Dionysus first appears to his disciples as a wandering holy man, but later is gloriously transfigured. When they perceive his true divinit y,theyexclaim: 'But l ook! Who is this, rising above the palace door? It is he Dionysus come himself, no mo re disguised As mortal, but in the glory o f his divinit y!’125 To hi s disciples, Jesus is the saviour. Dionysus is likewise 'He who came to bring salvat ion’.126 His fo llo wers call to him: 'Co me, thou saviour. ’127 In The Bacchae they rejo ice: 'We are saved! Oh, what a jo y to hear your Bacchic call ring out! We were all alone, deserted; you have co me, and we rejo ice. ’128 During his missio n Jesus is attacked for his seemin gly licenti ous behavi our. In the Gospel o f Luke he reproaches 'the people of this generat ion’for first condemning John the Baptist who cam e 'neit her eating bread nor drinking wine ’for being 'possessed ’and then also condemning the 'Son of Man ’who com es 'eat ing and drinking ’for being 'a glutton and a drinker, a friend of tax gatherers and sinners ’.129 The fo llo wers of Diony sus were likewise often accused of both possessio n and licent ious behaviour. Their 'orgies ’were infamous, although in fact these wer e no mo re sexual affairs than were the comparable 'lo ve feasts ’celebrated by early Christians. Like Jesus, Di onysus co me s 'eating and drinking ’, yet brings a profoundly spiritual message to ordinary peopl e. He was a god of divine intoxicat ion and a 'god o f the people ’who was often reviled and feared by religious and secular authorities, just as Jesus is. The Mysteries also had a mo re ascet ic side, however, comparable to the austere John the Baptist. The early Christian mo nasti c tradi tion init iated by St A ntony was modelled on ascet ic P ythagorean communit ies found throughout the Mediterranean.130 RIDING ON A DONKEY According to the gospel story, at the height of his popularit y J esus ri des into Jerusalem while crowds sing his praises and lay branches in his path.131 Tradit ionally the crowd is said to have waved palm leaves. The palm was symbo lic in the Mysteries.132 Plato writes of 'the palm o f wisdo m o f D io nysus ’.133 The great fest ival of the Mystery godman Attis began with the 'Entry ofthe Reed -Bearers ’, w hich was fo llo wed by the 'Entry of the Tree ’, an evergreen pine upon which was t ied an effigy o f the godman.134 One modern scho lar remarks: 'It i s impossible to ignore the associations with Jesus ’entry int o Jerusal em surrounded by palm -bearers, and his b earing of the cross or tree which became his chief symbo l.’135 The gospels relate that Jesus goes out of his way to make sure he is mounted on a donkey. In vase representations, Dionysus is also often pictured astride a donkey, which carries him to meet his passio n.136 The playwright Aristophanes writes of 'the ass who carried the Mysteries ’.137"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"When the crowd of pilgrims at Athens walked the Sacred Way to Eleusis to celebrate the Mysteri es, a donkey carri ed a basket containing the sacred paraphernalia whi ch woul d be used to create the ido l o f D io nysus, while the crowds shouted the praises of Dio nysus and waved bundles ofbranches.138 In this way, like Jesus entering Jerusalem, Dio nysus rode in triumph to his death. The myt hical motif o f 'r iding on a donke y’is o ften taken as a sign o f hu milit y.It al so has a mo re myst ical meaning, however. To the ancients the donkey typified lust, cruelt y a nd wickedness. It symbo lically represented the lower 'animal' self which must be overcome and subdued by an init iate o f the Mysteries. Lucius Apuleius wrote a story called The Golden Ass, which was an allegorical tale of init iation. In it Lucius is transformed into a donkey through his own foolishness and endures many adventures which represent stages of init iat ion. At hi s final init iat ion he is transformed back into a human being. This story is symbo lic of the init iate being overcom e by his lower nature and then, through initiat ion int o th e My steri es, redi scovering his true ident it y.139 The Egy ptian goddess Isis tells Lu cius that the donkey is the most hateful to her of all beasts.140 This is because it is sacred to the god Set, who in Egyptian myt ho logyis the murderer ofOsi ris.141 Pl utarch recorded an Egy ptian fest ival in which donkeys were triumphant ly pushed over cli ffs in vengeance for Osiris' murder. Set is symbo lic of the init iate's lower self, which slays the spiritual Higher Self (Osiris) and must be metaphorically put to death for the spiritual Self to be reborn. The donkey was also a common symbo l of the lower 'animal' nature in the Greek Mysteries of Dionysus. A vase paint ing represents a ridiculous donkey with an erect phallus dancing amo ng the disciples of Dionysus.142 A design on a wine pitcher shows donkeys having sex.143 In another design a pilgrim is show n stopping to pull the tail of a donkey.144 A favourite representation of afterlife sufferings in the Underworld was the figure of a man condemned to forever plait a rope which his donkey continually eats away, symbo lic of the lower self constant ly t rying to eat away the spi ritual achievements of the Higher Self.145 The figure of the godm an ri ding in triumph on a donkey symbo lized that he was master of his lower 'animal' nature. THE JUST MAN AND THE TYRANT According to the gospels, Jesus is an innocent and just man who, at the inst igat ion of the Jewish high priests, is hauled before the Roman governor Pilate and condemned to die on spurious charges. Exactly the same mytho logical mo tif is fo und five centuries earlier in Euripides' play The Bacchae, about Dion ysus. Like Jesus in Jerusalem, Dio nysus is a quiet stranger with long hair and a beard who brings a new religio n. In the gospels, the Jewish high priests don't believe in Jesus and allege that 'His teachings are causing disaffect ion amo ngst the people/146 They plot to bring about his death. In The Bacchae, King Pentheus is a tyrannical ruler who does not believe in Dio nysus. He berates him for bringing 'this new disease which fouls the land' and sends out his men to capture the innocent godman, announcing: 'And once you catch him, he shall be stoned to death. He'll wish he'd never brought his Bacchic rites to Thebes.'147 Like the Jewish high priests who are appalled at Jesus' blasphemous claim to be the Son of God,148 King Pentheus rants in anger at stories ofDionysus' divine parentage: 'Whatever the man may be, is not his arrogance An outrage? Has he not earned a rope around his neck?'149"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Like Jesus, Di onysus passively allows himself to be caught and imprisoned. The guard who apprehends him tells King Pen theus: 'We hunted him, and here he is.

Naturally I felt A bit embarrassed. \"You'll excuse me, Sir,\" I sai d, \"I don't want to arrest you; it's the king's command.\"’150 The guard relates the wondrous things he had wit nessed Dio nysus perform and warns King Pentheus: ' Master, thi s man has come here with a load of miracles.' The king, however, proceeds to interrogate Dionysus who, like Jesus before Pilate, will not bow to his authorit y.When Pilate reminds Jesus that he has the power to crucify him, Jesus replies, 'You w oul d have no authorit y at all over me, had it not been granted you fro m above.'151 Likewise Dio nysus answers the threats of Pentheus wit h: 'Nothing can touch me that is not ordained.'152 Like Jesus, who said o f his persecutors, 'They know not what they' ar e doing,'153 Dio nysus tells Pentheus, 'You know not what you are doing, nor what you are saying, nor who you are.'154 As Jesus is led away to crucifixio n, he warns the crowd not to weep for him, but for them selves and their children, who will suffer for t he crime o f his execution, saying, 'For the day s are surely co ming when they will say, \"Happy are the barren wombs that never bore a child, the breasts that never fed one.\" Then they will say to the mountains, \"Fall on us,\" and to the hills, \"Cover us up.\" '155 As he is led away, Dionysus, likewise, threatens divine vengeance, announcing: 'But I warn you: Dionysus who you say is dead, Will come in swift pursui t to avenge thi s sacrilege.'156 Many ofthe great philosophers of the Mystery tradit io n were also 'just men ’who suffered an unjust death at the hands of t yrannical authorit ies. One such is Socrates who, like Jesus, was accused of heresy. Under Athenian law the penalt y for this 'crime' was death, unless the def endant offered an alternat ive penalt y a cceptable to the j udges. Li ke Pilate, who offers to set Jesus free because it is a custom to release one prisoner at the Passover, the Athenian authorit ies hoped that Socrates would escape death on a technicalit y by paying a fine and going quietly into exile .157 Like Jesus, refusing to compromise with his persecutors and seeming to deliberately court his own death, Socrates offered to pay a single mina, an insult ingly small sum, which forced the authorit ies to impose the death sentence.158 Som e of Socrates' follo wers offered to pay 'thirt y pieces of silver' on his behalf, which was a betray alofSocrates' own desire to remain true to his principles.159 This motif appears in the gospel story as the 30 pieces of silver paid to Judas to betray Jesus. Socrates is executed by drinking a cup of poison. In the garden of Gethsemane, when he is contemplat ing his forthcoming execut ion, Jesus pray s, 'My Father, if it is possible let this cup pass me by.'160 Socrates was fearless before death for he had been told in a dre am that three day s after his death"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"he woul d be reborn.161 Jesus, likewise, goes to his death with confidence and foretells that after three day s he will be resurrected.162 Jesus' behaviour at his trial is exact ly what would be expected of a sage of the My steri es.163 He is not afraid to openly condemn those in authorit y fo r hy pocri sy. Likewise, Cynic and Stoi c phil osophers were renowned for being 'hostile to authorit y a nd resistant to disci pline, disdainful of kings, magistrates or public officials'.164 The re were numbers of such philosophers whose lack of respect for Roman authority earned them mart yrdom which, like Jesus, they willingly accepted.165 The Stoi c sage Epictetus writes: 'Take my body, or property, but do not try to rul e my moral purpose.'166 He describes a philosopher facing execution announcing to an Emperor: 'You will do your part and I mine, which is to go without com plaint.'167 As early as the fourth century BCE, Plato had laid down the expected fate of the 'just man', writ ing, 'The just man will have to endure the lash and finally, after every extremit y of suffering, he will be crucified.'168 The gospels portray the 'just man' Jesus as conforming to these expectations. The 'just man unjust ly a ccused' was so familiar a figure in the ancient wo rld that Celsus ridicules the Christians for trying to claim that Jesus was in any way unique. Wit h witv and bit ing sat ire, he suggests that if they wanted to create a new religio n t hey would have been better to have based it around one of the many famou s Pagan sages who also 'died a hero's death', wri ting: 'It would have been better had you in your zest for a new teaching formed your religion around one of the men of old who died a hero's deatn and was honoured for it -som eone who at least was already subject of a myt h. You could have chosen Heracles or Asclepius, or if these were too tame, there was always Orpheus, who as every one knows, was good and holy and yet died a vio lent death. Or had he already been taken? Well, then yo u had Anaxarchus, a man who looked death right in the eye when being beaten and said to his persecutors, \"Beat away . Beat the pouch of Anaxarchus; for it is not him you are beating.\" But I recall that some philosophers have already claimed him as their master. Well, what of Epict etus? When his leg was being twisted he smiled and said wit h com plete com posure, \"You are breaking it. ”And when it was broken, he smiled and said, \"I told you so. ”Yo ur God should have uttered such a saying when he was being punished!'169 BREAD AND WINE Before his death, Jesus celebrates a symbo lic 'Last Supper' of bread and wine. In The Bacchae, Euri pides calls bread and wine the 'two powers which are supreme in human affairs', the one substant ial and preserving the body, the other liquid and intoxicat ing the mind.170 The ancients credi ted the Mystery godm an wi thbringing to humanit y t he arts of cult ivat ing corn and the vine to produce bread and wine. In the gospels, Jesus proclaims: 'I am the bread of Life' and during the Last Supper he breaks bread and offers it to his disciples, saying, 'Take this, this is my body .”171 The Mystery godm an was, likewise, symbo lically associated with bread and wit h t he corn from which it com es.172 Osi ris was said to have met his death by being torn limb from limb, which is symbo lic of the corn being threshed to produce flo ur. The bones o f the dead Adonis were said to be ground on a mill then scattered to the wind.173"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"In the gospels Jesus also proclaims: 'I am the true vine'174 and during the Last Supper he offers his disci ples a cup of wine, saying, 'This is my blood.'175 Like Jesus, Dionysus was also associ ated wi ththe vine and with wine. He was known as the 'god of wine' and in so me myt hs he dies by being dismembered, which is symbo lic of the grapes being trodden to prod uce wine. By partaking of the bread and wine offered by Jesus, his disciples symbo lically eat his body and drink his blood, so communing with the Christ. The idea of -divine co mmunio n t hrough eating the god is a rite so ancient that it is found in the Egyp tian Book of the Dead, in which the deceased are portray ed as eat ing the gods and so imbuing their powers.176 The ritual o f eating and drinking the 'body ’and 'blood' of Jesus is celebrated by Christ ians as the Eucharist.177 Such a 'ho ly co mmunio n' was als o practi sed in the Mysteries, as a means of beco ming one with Osiris - Dionysus.178 The uninit iated who misunderstood these rites accused the Mysteries of pract ising cannibalism -exact ly t he same accusat ion t hat was later levelled at early Christ ians who celebrated the Eucharist.179 Pagan practices which parallel the Christ ian communio n appalled Just in Mart yr, who com plains that when Jesus told his disciples to drink of the cup, saying, 'This is my blood,' he gave this ritual to them alo ne, yet 'the wicked demons in imitat ion, in the Mysteries of Mit hras, also delivered the command to do so'. He relates wit h horror that in these Mysteries, as in the Chr istian Eucharist, myst ic fo rm ulas are pronounced over bread and a cup which are then given to one about to be init iated.180 As in Christ ianit y, parti cipants in the Mysteries of Mit hras had to undergo a long period of preparation before being allowed to partake in the 'ho ly communio n'.181 When they did, they were offered a sacrament of water mixed with wine and bread or consecrated wafers bearing the sign of a cross!182 No wonder poor old Just in Mart yr found thi s Pagan holy co mmunio n so disturbing. An inscription reads: 'He who will not eat of my body and drink of my blood, so that he will be made one wi thme an d I with him, the same shall not know salvat ion.'183 This may sound like a Biblical quotation from Jesus, but it is actually the Mystery godman Mi thras speaking! It is, however, uncannily similar to a passage in the Gospel of John where Jesus likewise ann ounces: 'Unless you eat of the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have not life in yourselves.184 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood will live in me and I in him.'185 The ho ly co mmunion in the Mysteries of Mit hras was developed from older ri tes which used consecrated bread and water mixed with the intoxicating juice of a psychedelic plant called Haom a.186 The Mysteries of Mit hras replaced the Haoma, a plant unknown in the Occident, withthe ju ice of the vine. Wine probably affected th e ancients far more powerfully than it does us, however, for they seldo m drank it unmixed wit h water. Plato enthuses about its revelat ionary power in the Mysteries of Dionysus,187 writing, 'Rather the madness o f the god than the sobriety ofme n/188 As one eminent Classicist writes, 'To drink wine in the rites of Dionysus is to commune withthe god and take his power and physical presence into one's body.'189 In the Christ ian r ites ofthe Eucharist Jesus is said to symbo lically become the wine drunk by the parti cipant in the ritual .

What they ate and drank from these sacred instruments is not recorded, but most likely itwas also bread and wine.194 From the time of Just in Martyr right up to the present day, Catholic Christ ians have believed that the bread and wine of the Eucharist literally become 'the fles h and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh'.195 Some init iates of the Mysteries seemed to have shared this rather strange literal interpretation of their 'ho ly co mmunio n'. The more enlightened init iate Cicero felt forced to explain to them that equating the god with corn and the vine was symbo lic only . Im patient with such foolishness, he writes, 'Is anybody so mad as to believe that the food which he eats is actually a god?\"96 DEATH OF THE GODMAN Jesus is generally believed to have been crucified on a cro ss, but the word translated by 'cross' in the New Testament has a general meaning of a 'stake'. It was the custom of the Jews to expose on a stake the bodies of those that they had stoned to death, as a warning to others.197 In the Acts of the Apostles, Pe ter does not say that Jesus was crucified, but 'hung on a tree',198 as does St Paul in his Letter to the Galat ians.1\" The Church father Firmicus Maternus tells us that in the Mysteri es of Attis a youthful image of the godman was tied to a pine tree200 Adon is was known as 'He on the tree'.201 In the Mysteries of Dio nysus, a large bearded mask represent ing the godman was hung on a wooden pole [see plates 4 and 5 ].202 Like Jesus, who at his crucifixio n is given a crown of thorns, Dionysus was given a crown of ivy. Just as Jesus is dressed up in purple robes when he is ridiculed by the Roman soldiers, so Dionysus was also dressed in purple robes and init iates at Eleusis wore a purple sash wrapped around their bodies.203 Just before he dies Jesus is given wine m ixed wi thgall to drink.204 Wine was ritually imbibed by celebrants in the Mysteries of Dionysus, and the Hierophant, who represented Dionysus himself, was given gall to drink.205 Jesus meets his death alo ngside two thieves, one of whom ascends wit h him t o heaven, whilst the other goes to hell. A co mparable myt hical mo tif is found in the Mysteries. A commo n icon pictures two torchbearers either side of Mit hras. One of these figures has his torch point ing upwards, symbo lizing the ascent to heaven, and the o ther has his torch point ing downwards, symbo lizing the descent to hell.206 In the Mysteries of Eleusis we also find two torchbearers withtheir torches point ing upwards and downwards respectively, standing either side of Dionysus, but thi s time they are wo men.207 The torchbearers in the Mysteries of Mit hras are thought to have developed fro m t he earlier Greek myt hical brothers Castor and Pollux. On alternate day s, one of the brothers would be alive and the other dead. They represented the Higher Self and lo wer self, which cannot both be 'alive' at the same time. Castor and Pollux were known as The Sons of Thunder' -a ti tle which, in the Gospel of Mark, Jesus inexplicably gives to two of his disciples, the brothers James and John!208 In some myt hs it is Dio nysus' adversary, represent ing the init iate's lower self, who dies the godm an's death in his stead. In The Bacchae, King Pentheus sets out to .kill Dio nysus, but is"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"himself lifted up on a tree.209 In a similar Sicilian myt h, Di onysus' adversary King Lycurg us is crucified.210 This suggests that whilst in so me Mystery traditions Dionysus was hung on a tree, in others his fate was crucifixion. Perhaps init iates of the Mysteries of Dionysus built on the image of'the just man crucified' suggested by Plato in o rder to bring about this development of the my th?211 Or perhaps Plato was referring to an already exist ing secret myth o f init iat ion in which the godm an was crucified?212 In a chapter of one of his books actually ent itled 'Plato's Doctrine ofthe Cross', J ustin Mart yracknowledges that the Pagan philo sopher had centuries earlier taught the doctrine that the 'Son of God' was 'placed crosswise in the universe'.213 The cross was a sacred symbo l to th e ancients. Its four arms represented the four elements of t he physical world -earth, water, air and fire. The fift h element, spirit, was bound to materi alityby these four elements. The figure of a man nailed to a four -armed cross would, therefore, naturally have signified the predicament of the init iate as a soul bound to a physical body . Pl ato refers to the desires of the body as nails that one by one fasten the soul to the body .214 The four nails used to crucify a man through the hands and feet would have been symbo lic of our sensual desires which attach the sou l to the world of the four elements. It seem s incredible that Osiris -Dionysus coul d have been portrayed as meet ing exact ly the same death as Jesus, but this is what the evidence suggests. The Church father Arnobius is scandalized that in the Mysteries of Dionysus init iates passed around a holy cross.215 On some vase representations the ido l o f D ionysus is shown hanging from a cross.216 A sarcophagus of the second or third centuries CE from Ro me p ictures an aged disciple bringing the divine child Dionysus a large cross.217 One modern scho lar describes this cross as 'an int imat ion of the child's ult imately tragi c fate'218 (see plate 3). From the same period comes the remarkable talisman which shows a crucified figure immediately recognizable as Jesus but who is actually Osiris -Dionysus (see front cover and plate 6). The inscript ion under this figure reads 'Orpheus -Bakki kos', which means 'Orpheus beco mes a Baccho i'. Orpheus was a great legendary prophet of Dio nysus who was so respected that he was often regard ed as the godmai \\himself. A Baccho i was an enlightened disciple of Dio nysus who had beco me co mp letely ident ified with the god. The talisman, therefore, represents Dionysus dying by crucifixio n, symbo lizing the init iate's mystical death to his lower nature and rebirth as a god. We also have a seemingly strange piece of ancient graffit i carved behind a pillar in Ro me sometime between 193 and 235 CE (see plate 7). It sketches a man with a'donkey's head crucified on a cross, with the caption 'Alexmenos worshi ps his god'. This has been interpreted as a Pagan insult towards Christ ianit y,but it is far more likely that it is a Dionysian representation ofthe crucifixio n of the lower 'animal' nature, which, as we have already discussed, was symbo lized by a donkey. 219 It i s a rem arkable fact that we have no representations of the crucified Jesus before the fift h century CE. If this piece of graffit i and the talisman o f Orpheus are taken as references to Chr istianit y, we are in the bizarre posit ion of saying that th e first portrayals o f the crucifixio n of Chr ist are a Pagan joke and a talisman in which Jesus is called Orpheus –both ofwhich date to centuri es before any genuine Christ ian portray als! This does not seem very credible. The simple and obvious so lut ion to these puzzles is that in certain myt hs of Osiris -Dionysus, the godm an was portray ed as meeting his death by crucifixio n."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"THE SACRED SCAPEGOAT Chr istians believe that Jesus died for the sins of the world. In ancient Greece there was a tradi tion of mak ing a parti cular individual into a 'scapegoat', who symbo lically took on the sins ofthe peopl e and was expelled from the cit y o r put to death. Such an individual was called a pharmakos, which simply means 'magic man'.220 His persecution was clearly a religious event, since before his death he was fed at public expense on especially pure foods and was clad in ho ly garm ents and wreathed with sacred plants.221 Through his sacred sacrifice the sins of the cit y were banished. Osi ris-Dionysus was a sacred pharmakos, who, like Jesus, died to atone for the sins of the worl d.222 The fate of a pharmakos was to be insulted, beaten and put to death,223 and those who wal ked the Sacred Way towards Eleusis to share in Dio nysus' sacrificial death were likewise beaten, insulted and terrorized by masked men.224 In the Gospel of Mark, Jesus predi cts a similar fate for the Son of Man: 'They will make fun of him and spit at him and whip him and kill him.'225 St Paul writes: 'Wit hout the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness o f sins.'226 Jesus is portrayed as the sacrificial 'Lamb o f God'. Christ ians tal k of being 'born again' through being 'washed in the blood of the lamb'. Such metaphors echo the ancient Mysteries o f At tis. These were bloody rites in which an animal was the sac rificial vict im. I n t he mo dern world we do not see our own animals butchered for food, so this can seem a very primit ive ritual. To those who regul arly killed animals in order to eat, it would have seemed much less distasteful. In the rites of the Taurobol ium, or bull -sacrifice, a bull was slaughtered on a perforated platform, through which the blood poured down to bathe the init iate standing in a pit beneath. Afterwards the init iate was considered 'born again ’. Poorer people made do with a Criobo liu m, in w hich a sheep was sacrificed, and were literally 'washed in the blood of the lamb'!227 The Mysteries o f M ithras, like Christ ianit y, celebrated these sacrificial rites symbo lically rather than literally. An icon of Mit hras slaying a bull was used as an alta r-piece, rather than enacting the actual sacrifice. This may seem a rather gruesome icon but, upon consideration, is less vio lent than the Christ ian altar -piece of a man being tortured to death on a cross. 'Thou hast saved us by shedding the eternal blood ' reads an inscription -not to Jesus, but to Mi thras,228 al though centuries later Christ ians would express grat itude to their saviour god - man in exactly the same language. An anonymous Egyptian poet also adores his sacrificed and resurrecting saviour Osir is wit h words that could equally well be addressed to Jesus: 'Have they sacrificed thee? Do they say that thou hast died for them? He is not dead! He lives for ever! He is alive more than they, for he is the myst ic o ne of sacrifice. He is their Lord, livi ng and young for ever!'229 Like Christ ianit y, the Mysteries had a doctrine of 'original sin'. Plato teaches that the soul is banished into the body as a punishment for some unnamed ancient crime.230 According to Em pedocl es, we are wandering through the fo ur elem ents to atone for guilt incurred in the divine worl d.231 The Mysteries taught that the original sin was separation fro m God.232 The sacrificial death of the godman, or the sacrificial animal he kills, represents the init iate's own symbo lic 'death' t o thei r lower 'animal' nature and rebirth into their divine nature, which unites them wit h God and so atones for this original crime."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"EASTER In the fourth century an anonymous author tells us that Christ ians and fo llo wers of the Mystery godm an Attis were b oth struck by the remarkable coincidence between the death and resurrecti on of their respect ive deit ies. This gave rise to bitter controversy between the adherents ofthe rival religio ns.233 The Pagans contended that the resurrection of Christ was a spurio us imitat ion of the resurrection of Attis and the Christians that the resurrection of Attis was a diabo lical counterfeit of the resurrection of Christ.234 The Megalensia was a spring fest ival in the Mysteries of Attis which, like Easter, lasted for three days.235 During this time the myt h o f At tis was performed as a passio n play, just as the story ofJesus was performed as a passion play in the Middle Ages. An effigy of the corpse of Attis was t ied to a sacred pine -tree and decorated with flowers sacred to both Attis and his Syrian counterpart Adonis.236 It was then buried in a sepulchre.237 But like Jesus, on the third day Attis rose again.238 In the darkness o f the night a light was brought to his open grave, while the presi ding pri est anointed the lips o f the init iates with holy o il, co mfo rting them with the words: 'To y ou likewise there shall co me salvat ion fro m yo ur troubl e.'239 The myt ho logist Sir James Frazer writes: 'But when night had fallen, the sorrow of the worshippers was turned to joy. For sud denly a light shone in the darkness: the tomb was opened; the god had risen fro m t he dead; and as the priest touched the lips of the weeping mourners wit h balm, he so ftly w hispered in their ears the glad tidings o f salvat ion. The resurrecti on of the god wa s hailed by his disciples as a promise that they too woul d issue triumphant ly fro m t he corruption of the grave. On the morrow, the twenty -fift h day o f March, which was reckoned the vernal equino x, the divine resurrecti on was celebrated with a wild outburst of glee. At Rome, and probably elsewhere, the cel ebrati on took the form of a carnival. It was the fest ival of Jo y {Hilaria).' 240 According to an ancient and widespread Christian tradition Jesus died on 25 March, the same day that the resurrecti on of Atti s was officially celebrated at Rome.241 However, another ancient Chr istian t radit ion, reported by the Church father Lactant ius, places the death of Christ on 23 March and his resurrection on 25 March, which coincides exactly wit h t he death and resurrection ofAttis.242 The Anthesteria, the spring fest ival o f the Mysteries of Dionysus, was another three -day fest ival, of which one modern authorit y co mments, 'A certain similarit y w it h t he sequence of Good Friday and Easter cannot be overlooked .’243 Easter ri tes observed in Greece, Sicily and southern Italy st ill bear a striking resemblance to the Mystery rites of Adonis.244 At the festival of Adonis the air was infused wit h t he sweet arom as o f incense and filled with loud lamentation at the death of the godma n. The embalmed image of Adonis was then laid in a coffin and borne to his grave,245 but the faithful afterwards conso led themselves wit h t he assurance that the godman was alive.246 The Pagan writer Lucian records: They make o ffer ings to Adonis as to one dead, and the day after the morrow they tell the story that he lives.'247"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"In the gospels we are told that Jesus' corpse was 'wrapped in a linen sheet' and ano int ed wi th 'more than half a hundred weight of a mixture of myrrh and aloes'.248 According to Plu tarch, a representation of Osiris was also wrapped with linen and anointed with myrrh.249 Likewise, in the My steri es of Adonis an image of the corpse of the godman was washed, ano int ed wi thspices and wrapped around with linen or wool.250 After his death J esus descends to hell, then resurrects on the third day . Pl utarch tells us that Osiris, likewise, is said to have descended to hell and then arisen from the dead on the third day.251 An ancient Egypt ian inscript ion promises an init iate that he will also be resurrected with his Lord: 'As truly as Osiris lives shall he live, -as truly as Osi ris is not dead shall he not die.'252 Having resurrected, Jesus ascends to heaven. The Church father Origen refers to Osiris as a yo ung god, who was 'restored to life, an d went up to heaven'.253 In the Mysteries of Adonis, init iates annually mourned the death of the godman with the shrill notes of the flute, weeping and beat ing of breasts, but on the third day he was believed to be resurrected and to ascend up to heaven in the presence of his worshippers.254 According to some myt hs acted out as part of the Mysteri es of Dio nysus, shortly after his death Dio nysus also rose from the grave and ascended to heaven.255 In the Mysteries of Mit hras init iates enacted a similar resur recti on scene.256 Having accomplished his missio n on Earth, Mithras was said to have ascended to heaven in a sun - chariot.257 Like Jesus, who sits at the right hand of the Father after his ascensio n, Mithras was believed to have been enthroned by the God of Light as ruler of the world. Also like Jesus, Mi thras was said to be waiting in heaven for the End of Time, when he would return to Earth to awaken the dead and pass judgement.258 Echoes of these myt ho logical motifs are, once again, found in the legends ofthe sages of the My steri es. Seneca tells us that, like Jesus, the philosopher Canus foretold that he would reappear three days after his death and did indeed return from the grave to one of his friends to 'discourse on the survival o f the spirit'.259 He raclides tells us that after a banquet to celebrate one of Empedocles' miracles, the great sage suddenly ascended to heaven acco mpanied by glori ous celest ial lights.260 It was said that Pythagoras descended to Hades in search of wisdo m,261 and after his de ath reappeared to his disciples and ascended into heaven.262 The ritual sequence of death, descent into the Underworld and regenerat ion is k nown to have been an important analogy of init iation in the Pythagorean Mysteries fro m t he earliest times. Given al l these dying, resurrecting and ascending Pagan godmen and sages, it is not surpri sing to find Celsus indignant at Christ ian claims that Jesus is unique. He is amazed at the Chr istians' literal interpretation of what to him are obviously myths, writing, Isyour belief based on the \"fact\" that this Jesus told in advance that he would rise again after his death? That your story includes his predictions of triumphing over the grave? Well, let it be so. Let's assume for the present that he foretold his resurrec tion. Are you ignorant of the mult itudes who have invented similar tales to lead simple -minded hearers astray? It is said that Zamolix, Py thagoras' servant, convinced the Scythians that he had risen from the dead, having hidden himself away in a cave for s everal years, and what about Pythagoras himself in Italy -or Phampsinitus in Egypt? Now then, who else: What about Orpheus among the Odrysians, Protesilaus in Thessaly and above all Heracles and Theseus? But quite apart from all these risings fro m t he dea d, we must look carefully at the question of the resurrection of the body as a possibilit y given to mortals. Doubtless you will freely admit that these other stories are legends, even as they appear to me; but you will go on to say that your resurrection s tory , this climax to your tragedy , is believable and noble.'263"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"MOTHER OF GOD Like her divine son, Jesus' mother Mary is also said to have ascended bodily to heaven and is honoured as the 'Mother of God'. In the same way Semele, the mortal mother of Dionys us, i s later raised up to heaven and honoured as an immo rtal alongside her illustrious son.264 In Christ ianit y, Mary takes on many o f the roles of the Great Mother goddess of the Pagan Mysteries. Indeed, the Christ ian fest ival of the Assumption of the Vir gin in August has ousted an ancient Pagan festival of the goddess.265 Statues of the Egyptian goddess Isis ho lding the divine child have been the models for many Christ ian representations of Mary and the baby Jesus (see plates 1 and 2). They are so like th ose of the Madonna and child that they have sometimes received the adoration of ignorant Christians. Statues of the black virgin, so highly venerated in certain French cathedrals during the Middles Ages, have proved upon examinat ion to be basalt statues of Isis!266 Tal king o f the influence of the cult of the Egyptian goddess Isis on Christ ianit y,one authori tywri tes: 'Her stately ritual, wit h it s shaven and tonsured priests, its mat ins and vespers, its tinkling music, its bapt ism and aspersions of holy w ater, i ts sol emn processions, its jewelled images of the mother god, presented many po int s of similarit y t o the pom ps and ceremo nies of Catho licism. And to Isis in her later character of patroness of Mariners the Virgin Mary perhaps owes her beaut ifu l epit het of Stella Maris, \"Star of the Sea\", under which she is adored by tempest -tossed sailors.'267 It was a very early tradit ion in Christ ianit y t hat Jesus' wo me n fo llo wers, rather than the male disci ples, were the first witnesses of the empt y tomb and the resurrected Christ. In the original ending of Mark's gospel it is only Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salo me who see the risen Jesus -a tradi tion which the Pagan critic Celsus acknowledges.268 According to another early Christ ian t radit ionall three wo me n are called Mary -Mary Magdalene, Jesus' companio n, Mary his mother, and Mary her sister.269 In the Gospel o f Jo hn the same three Marys are pictured at the foot of the cross.270 The fact that we are given three Marys is a clear indication that we are in ancient myt ho logical terri tory -the tri ple goddess was a familiar figure in the Pagan world. At Eleusis she appears as Demeter, Persephone and Hecate. We find her appearing as the three fates, three charit ies and three graces. Like Jesus, Dionysus is o ften associated with three women fo llo wers. When a new sanctuary ofDionysus was founded three priestesses called maenads would go there to establish the cul t. Each one of them would assemble one of the three women cho irs that helped celebrate the My steri es.271 The Oinotropio were three women disciples of Dionysus said to have the abilit y t o miraculously turn water into wine at the festivals of the godman.272 Amo ngst the most commo n of ancient sacred sculptures are representations o f the cave o f Pan, in which three wom en are being led into an empt y cave by Hermes the messenger of the gods, like the three Marys being led by the angel into the empt y cave which was Jesus' tomb.273 SPIRITUAL REBIRTH Jesus is born to Mary in a cave and resurrects fro m a cave before three Marys. Such 'circular7 my thic motifs were important in the Mysteries. In some myt hs of Osiris -Dionysus, his mir acul ous resurrecti on and miraculous birth were one and the same event. Having died his"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"sacrificial death, he would immediat ely be born once again as the divine child. So, the cave in which he was born and laid out is symbo lic o f bo thwom b and tom b.274 Minucius Felix, a Chr istian writer, tells us that in the Mysteries o f Osir is priests acted out the sorrowful search of Isis fo rthe dead Osiris, which afterwards turned to celebrat ion upon the emergence of a small bo y,represent ing the godman reborn,275 thus he says, 'They never cease year by year to lose what they find and to find what they lose .’276 The key to understanding the myt h of the resurrectio n, both in the Mysteries and the story ofJesus, is that myst ically death is rebirth. Plutarch tells us that sharing in the passio n of Dionysus was intended to bring about a palingenesis, or 'rebirth ’.277 Init iates of the Mysteries underwent what Lucius Apuleius calls a 'voluntary death' from which they emerged spiritually reborn.278 Just as Jesus offers his fo llo wers the opportunit y t o be 'born again7, Osiris is 'He who giveth birth unto men and women a second time ’279 and 'He who m aketh mortals to be born again ’.280 When he 'dies ’to his lower self, the init iate of the Mysteries is also in labour giving birth to his Higher Self. Perhaps this is why gall, which was given to women in labour, was drunk by the Hi erophant in the Eleusin ian Mysteries and offered to Jesus on the cross. Jesus myst ically equates death and birth in the Gospel of John when he predicts: 'A lit tle while and you will not see me, and again a litt le while and you will see me. In very truth I tell you, you will we ep and mourn, but the world will be glad. But though y ou are pl unged into grief, your grief will be turned to joy. A woman in labour is in pain because her time has co me ; but when the child is born she forgets the anguish in her jo y t hat a man has been bor n int o the worl d.’281 To di e to the l ower self is to be spiritually reborn -thi s is the central secret teaching encoded by the myt hs of Osiris -Dionysus. Coul d the Jesus story also be a myt h which encodes the same perennial spiritual teaching? CONCLUSION Either the Devil really has perfected the art of diabolical mimicry or there is a mystery to solve here. Let's review the evidence: • Jesus is the saviour of mankind, God made man, the Son ofGod equal with the Father; so is Osi ris-Dionysus. • Jesus is b orn of a mortal virgin who after her death ascends to heaven and is honoured as a divine being; so is Osiris -Dionysus. • Jesus is born in a cave on 25 December or 6 January, as is Osiris -Dionysus. • The birth of Jesus is prophesied by a star, -so is the bi rth ofOsiris -Dionysus. • Jesus is born in Bethlehem, which was shaded by a grove sacred to Osiris -Dionysus. • Jesus is visited by the Magi, who are followers of Osiris -Dionysus. • The Magi bring Jesus gift s of gold, frankincense and my rrh, which a sixth -century BCE Pagan tells us is the way to worshi p God. • Jesus is baptized, a ritual practised for centuries in t he Mysteri es. • The ho ly ma n who baptizes Jesus with water has the sam e name as a Pagan god of water and is born on the summer solstice celebrate d as a Pagan water fest ival. • Jesus offers his fo llo wers elemental bapt isms of water, air and fire, as did the Pagan Mysteries."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"• Jesus is portrayed as a quiet man with lo ng hair and a beard; so is Osiris -Dionysus. • Jesus turns water into wine at a marri age on the same day that Osi ris-Dionysus was previously believed to have turned water into wine at a marriage. • Jesus heals the sick, exorcises demons, provides mir acul ous meals, helps fishermen make mir acul ous catches of fish and calms the water for his disciples; all ofthese marvels had previously been performed by Pagan sages. • Like the sages o f the Mysteries, Jesus is a wandering wonder -worker who is not honoured in his ho me town. • Jesus is accused of licent ious behaviour, as were the follo wers o f Osi ris-Dionysus. • Jesus is not at first recognized as a divinit y by his disciples, but then is transfigured before them in all his glory , -the same is true of Osiris -Diony sus. • Jesus is surrounded by 12 disciples; so is Osiris -Dionysus. • Jesus rides tr iumphantly into town on a donkey while crowds wave branches, as does Osiris - Dionysus. • Jesus is a just man unjustly accused of heresy and bringing a new religio n, as is Osiris - Dionysus. • Jesus attacks hypocrites, stands up to tyranny and willingly goes t o his death predicting he will rise again in three days, as do Pagan sages. • Jesus is betrayed for 30 pieces of silver, a motif found in the story ofSocrates. • Jesus is equated with bread and wine, as is Osiris -Dionysus. • Jesus1 disciples symbo lically eat bread and drink wine to commune with him, as do the follo wers of Osiris -Dionysus. • Jesus is hung on a tree or crucified, as is Osiris -Dionysus. • Jesus dies as a sacrifice to redeem the sins of the world; so does Osiris -Dionysus. • Jesus' corpse is wr apped in linen and ano int ed with myrrh, as is the corpse of Osiris -Dionysus. • After his death Jesus descends to hell, then on the third day resurrects before his disciples and ascends into heaven, where he is enthroned by God and waits to reappear at the end of time as a divine judge, as does Osir is-Dionysus. • Jesus was said to have died and resurrected on exactly the same dates that the death and resurrecti on of Osiris - Dionysus were cel ebrated. • Jesus' empt y tomb is visited by three wo me n fo llowers; Os iris-Dionysus also has three women follo wers who visit an empt y cave. • Through sharing in his passio n Jesus offers his disciples the chance to be born again, as does Osi ris-Dionysus. • Discount ing the 'diabo lical mimicry' argument, as all sane people must , how are we to explain these extraordinary similarit ies between Pagan myt h and the story of Jesus? The first possibilit y we considered was that the true biography o f Jesus had been overlaid withPagan myt ho logyat a later date. This is a commo n idea oft en advanced to account for those aspects of the Jesus story which seem obviously myt hical, such as the virgin birth. But we had found so many resemblances between the myt hs of Osiris -Dionysus and the supposed 'biography' ofJesus that this theory seemed in adequate. If all the elements of the Jesus story that had been prefigured by Pagan myt hs were later accretions, what would be left of the 'real' Jesus?

No one believes the myt hs of Osi ris-Dionysus are literally true, so why should we take as historical fact the same events rel ated in a Jewish setting?

Celsus writes of the Christ ians dismissively: 'Let's speak about their systematic corruption of the truth, their misunderstanding ofsome fairly simple philo sophical principl es -which of course they completely botch .’3 Most early Christ ian int ellectual s had been educated in Pagan philo sophy and were well aware of its profound similarit ies wi ththeir own doctrines. Clement of Alexandria regarded the gospels as 'perfected Plat onism'.4 Just in Mart yrcalls Heraclit us, Socrates and other Greek philosophers Chr istians before Christ.5 Yet he stops short of acknowledging a commo n spiritual heritage. To Just in t he similarit ies are, once again, the results of 'diabolical mimicry' which blinds the foolish to the essent ial differences between Christianit y and Paganism. He writes: For I myself, when I discovered the wicked disguises which the evil spirits had thrown around the divine doctrines of the Christ ians, to turn aside others fro m jo ining them, laughed both at those who framed these falsehoods, and at the disguise itself, and at popular opinio n; not because the teachings of Plato are different fro m t hose of Christ, but because they are not in all respects similar, as neit her are tho se of the Stoics, poets, and historians.'6 The Pagans were so persistent in accusing Christ ianit y o f bo rrowing from Plato, however, that St Ambrose wrote a treatise to confute them. He did not deny the resemblances, but explained them by claiming that Pla to pl agiarized Moses!7 Building on a fake chrono logyestablished in the fourth century by Bishop Eusebius, August ine developed the equally ludicrous idea that Plato copi ed the Jewish prophet Jeremiah. He explains: 'Did not the illustrious bishop show that Plato m ade a journey into Egypt at the time when Jeremiah the prophet was there, and show that it is much more likely that Plato was through Jeremiah's means init iated into our literature. And thus, when we reflect on the dates, it beco me s much mo re proba ble that those philosophers learnt whatever they said that was good and true fro m o ur literature, than that the lord Jesus Christ learnt fro m t he writings o f P lato -a thing which it is the height of fo lly t o believe.'8 Just in Martyr went so far as to den y t hat Pagans had any right to their own prophets and claimed the wi sdo m o f the ancient sages for Christ ianit y!

Are the teachings of Jesus and the wisdo m o f the Mysteri es really so similar? Let's see. MORAL PURITY Ch ristians were very proud of their high moral doctrines. In contrast, they o ften sought to portray the My steri es as morally degenerate. But this is absolute nonsense. The init iate Di odorus of Sicily wri tes, 'Those who have taken part in the Mysteries are sa id t o become more pious, more upri ght, and in every way better than their former selves.'11 A fo llo wer of Sabazius announces after hi s init iation: 'I escaped evil, I found the good.'12 Sopatros tells us, 'On account of init iat ion I shall be quite prepared for every mo ral demand.'13 Iamblichus, talking o f the Mystery pageant, wri tes: 'Exhibit io ns of this kind in the Mysteries were designed to free us from licent ious passio ns, by grat ifying the sight, and at the same time vanquishing all evil thought, throug h t he awful sanct it y w it h which these rites were accompanied.'14 Ini tiation into the Mysteries was seen as a source of moral purification and preparation for death. Ar istophanes declares: 'All those who participated in the Mysteries led an innocent, calm and ho ly life; they died looking for the light of the Elysian fields.'15 Porphyry adds, 'At the mo me nt ofdeath the soul must be as it is in the Mysteries; free fro m any blemish, passio n, envy or anger.'16 Celsus tells us that it was announced that init iat ion was only open to 'whoever is ho ly fro m e very defilement and whose soul is conscious of no evil' and that 'No one should approach unless he was conscious of his innocence.'17 Jesus taught his fo llo wers to strive for moral purit y, not only in deed, but even in thought. The Church father Clement of Alexandria writes: 'He who would enter the shrine must be pure, and purit y is to think ho ly t hings.'18 But Clement is merely echo ing the ancient inscript ion over the Pagan shrine o f Asclepius, which also read: 'Puri tyis thinking only ho ly t houghts.\"9 Likewise, in the sayings of the Pagan sage Sextus, we read: 'Do not even think of that which you are unwilling God should know.'20 Celsus writes: 'What ought really to occupy our minds, day and night, is the Good: publicly and privately , in every word and deed and in the silence of reflection\".'21 The Stoic philo sophers developed the idea of the 'conscience' which Christianit y inherited.22 'Conscience' means 'wit h knowl edge'. For the Pagan sages, to listen to one' s conscience was to follo w the inner spiritual Knowledge, or Gnosis, possessed by the Higher Self. The fo llo wers of Py thagoras were required every night to remember all the events of the day and judge themselves"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"mo rally fro m t he standpo int oftheir Hi gher Self. The init iate Seneca describes his constant striving for moral perfect ion in simple ho mely language that could be that of a modern Christ ian: 'Every day I pl ead my case before myself. When the light is ext inguished, and my wife, who knows my habit, k eeps silence, I examine the past day, go over and wei gh all my deeds and words. I hide nothing, I omit nothing: why should I hesi tate to f ace my shortcomings when I can say, \"Take care not to repeat them , and also I forgive you today.\"23 The need to confe ss one's sins was taught by Jesus and is st ill an essent ial element of Chr istianit y. This idea was far fro m new, however. Init iates into the Mysteries were required to purify themselves by making a public confessio n of all their failings and misdeeds. In t he Mysteri es of Eleusis, the priest asked the init iate to confess the worst deed that he had ever committed in his life.24 This was not an empt y fo rmalit y,but a truly pious act. The despotic Rom an Em peror Nero turned back fro m seeking init iat ion int o the Mysteries when he realized he woul d have to openly admi t murdering his mother. Even a tyrant accepted this loss of face, rather than lie before the most sacred inst ituti on of the ancient world.25 A modern classical scholar wri tes that the Mysteries 'antici pated Catholicism in the establishment of a Confessio nal -but less rigid -withthe el ements of a penitential system and abso lut ion fo r uneasy devotees. The pri ests acted as representatives of the Mystery -god, exacting auricular confessio n.'26 A 'Negat ive Confessio n' of the evils one had avo ided committ ing is found in the Egypt ian Book of the Dead as long ago as 1500 BCE.27 Co ntrary to Chri stian claims that the Mysteries were morally degenerate, the evidence clearly shows that init iation was designed to br ing about moral regenerat ion. Despite this, of course, the Pagan Mysteries were no less open to hypocrisy and abuse than any other religio n. The Jewish Pythagorean Philo complains: 'It often happens that good men are not init iated, but that robbers and mu rderers, and lewd women are, if they pay mo ney to the init iators and hierophants.'28 But as a modern scho lar remarks, 'Such passages show that abuses existed, but also that it was felt to be a scandal if the init iated person failed to exhibit any moral i mprovem ent .’29 LOVE In contrast to the tradit ional Jewish God of just ice, Jesus preaches a revo lut ionary new conception of a God of love. Jesus ’first and central commandment is that his fo llo wers shoul d lo ve God, and to this day having a personal lo ving r elationship with God is at the heart of Chr istianit y. This was also at the heart of the Mysteries. A modern scho lar writes: If one had to single out one paramount feature that dist inguished all the Mystery cults fro m ot her religions of their period, it wou ld be that they sought a personal relat ionship with their gods. Consequent ly t he atti tude of their devotees to the gods was one of love rather than fear or indifferent manipulat ion. The motive of much primit ive religio n seems to be to get rid of the gods, and by fair means or foul to prevent them from troubling mankind. For the Mystery religions the motive is quite the contrary: it is to get closer to* them, recognising them as man's best friends.'30 The Christian sentiment of 'brotherly lo ve' was also a f eature of the Mysteries six centuri es before there were any Christ ians. Init iates at El eusis were called adelpho i,meaning"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"'brothers'. A philadelphian was so meo ne who practised 'brotherly lo ve'. The fo llo wers of Mit hras were al so called 'brothers'. Adheren ts of the Mysteri es of Jupiter Dolichenus were fiat ies caiissimi, or 'most loving brothers'.31 However, Jesus taught his fo llo wers not only to love their fello w Christ ians, but also to lo ve all their neighbours. In the Gospel of Matthew he instructs his f ollowers: 'Treat others as you wish to be treated.'32 But this teaching was nothing new either. It is a perennial and ubiquitous precept found in nearly all religious tradit ions.33 Amo ngst the sayings o f the Pagan philosopher Sextus, we find: 'Such as you wish yo ur neighbour to be to y ou, such also be to your neighbour.'34 But Jesus goes further than this. He teaches that we should even love our enemies. We shoul d forgive those who wrong us and 'turn the other cheek'.35 These beaut iful and profound teachi ngs are usually seen as a revo lut ion in spir ituali ty, replacing the old Jewish Law of 'an eye for an eye'. They were indeed a radical departure from such Jewish sent iments, but they were perfect ly familiar to init iates -ofthe ancient Pagan Mysteries! In T he Sayings of Sextus the Py thagorean we find the same teachings: 'Wish that you may be able to benefit your enemies.'36 Py thagoras himself had taught that even if abused, one should not defend oneself.37 Epictetus similarly writes: 'This is the philosophe r's way, -to be flogged like an ass and to love those who beat him, to be father and brother of all humanit y.'38 But m ost famously in t he ancient world, these teachings had been expressed by Socrates and recorded by his disciple Plato. Celsus writes: 'Yo u Christ ians have a saying that goes something like this: \"Don't resist a man who insults you, -even if he strikes you, offer him the other cheek as well.\" This is nothing new, and it's been better said by others, especially by Plato.'39 In one of Plato's dialogues, Socrates leads Crito, step by step, to exactly the same profound understanding that 500 years later appears in the gospels. We pick up the argument as Socrates is reaching his conclusio n: 'Socrates: \"Then we should never do wrong?\" Cri to: \"Nev er.” Socrates: \"And should we not even try to avenge a wrong if we are wronged ourselves, as most would do, on the premise that we should never do wrong?\" Cri to: \"So i t seem s/' Socrates: \"So, should we do harm, Crito, or not?\" Cri to: \"I should say not, So crates.\" Socrates: \"Well then, is it just or unjust to repay injury wit h injury?\" Cri to: \"Unj ust, I woul d think.\" Socrates: \"Because doing harm to men is no different fro m doing wrong?\" Cri to: \"Exact ly so.\" Socrates: \"So, we should never take revenge and n ever hurt anyone, even if we have been hurt.\" '"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Socrates concludes: 'It i s never right to do wrong and never right to take revenge; nor is it right to give evil, or in the case of one who has suffered so me injury, to attempt to get even .’40 Celsus co mme nts caustically: 'This was Plato's opinio n, and as he says, it was not new to him but was pronounced by inspired men long before him. What I have said about it may serve, part for whole, as an example of the sort of ideas the Christ ians mut ilate.'41 The great sages of the Mysteries even expanded their ethic o f universal lo ve to include animals. Alt hough so me Mystery religio ns pract ised animal sacrifice, Pythagoras was a vegetarian and Em pedocl es looked back to a golden age 'when no altar was wet with the unho ly slaughter of bulls ’.42 The enlightened Pagan sages, like the enlightened masters of any religious tradit ion, tried constant ly t o lead init iates away fro m o ut-of-date practices towards understanding the spi ritual meaning o f their rites .43 A modern cl assical scho lar writes of the Mysteries of Orpheus as 'imposing -perhaps for the first time in the Western world -a lo fty et hic of purit y a nd non - injury'. He continues: 'The Orphics and Pythagoreans were truly the first Christ ians in the ethical sense, and a few Christ ians like St Francis have extended their compassio n in Py thagorean fashio n to the animal kingdo m.’44 HUMILITY AND POVERTY Jesus teaches his fo llo wers to emulate his own humilit y a nd poverty . He sends out his disciples, saying, 'Go and an nounce that the kingdo m o f heaven is approaching. Cure the sick, raise the dead, wash lepers, throw out demons. Accept free gifts, and give for free. Don't have gold, silver or brass in your belts. Don't take a knapsack on the road, or a second tunic or sh oes, or a cane .’45 In doing so, his fo llo wers became indist inguishable fro m t he Pagan Cynic philo sophers, who travelled fro m p lace to place giving spiritual teachings.46 A modern scho lar writes: 'Amo ng the familiar sights during the first century of the Rom an Em pire were the Cynics wearing rough cloaks, carrying begging bags and thorn -sticks. They used to wander from town to town preaching to the people, and hammering in their platitudes. When the apostles went preaching the gospel, they travelled about i n a similarly unencumbered manner.'47"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Both Cynics and early Christians wore the same rough garments and both called their religio n 'the Way ’.48 Describing a Cynic, Epictetus writes in words that could equally describe Jesus and his disciples: 'He is a he ral d fro m God to men, declaring to them the truth about good and evil things; that they have erred, and are seeking the realit y o f good and evil where it is not; and where it is they do not consider. He must then be able, if so it chance, to go up impassio ned, as on the tragic stage, and speak that word of Socrates, \"O men, whit her are ye borne away? What do ye? Miserable as ye are! Like blind men ye wander up and down. Ye have left the true road, and are going by a false; ye are seeking peace and happiness where they are not, and if another shall show where t hey are, ye believe him not.”' 49 Celsus sees Christ ian humilit y as an enforced copy of the vo luntary humilit y o f the Pagan sages. He rants indignant ly: 'Not surprisingly, they emphasise the virtue of humilit y,which in their case is to make a virtue of necessit y! Here again prostituting the noble ideas of Plato. Not only do they misunderstand the words of the philo sophers; they even stoop to assigning words of the philosophers to their Jesus. For examp le, we are told that Jesus judged the rich with the saying \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye ofa needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom o f God.\" Yet we know that Plato expressed this very idea in a purer form when he said, \"It is im possible for an except ionally good m an to be except ionally rich.”Is one utterance more inspired than the other?'50 Celsus is right to be crit icalofChr istian claims that Jesus' teachings are original and dist inct ive. Jesus teaches, 'Lay up your treasure in heaven where no thief can get near it, no moth destroy it.'51 Sextus likewise exhorts, 'Possess those things that no one can take away fro m yo u.'52 Jesus is the king of the world because he is wise, not because he is powerful. A popular Stoi c maxim wa s 'The only true king is the wise man'.53 Jesus teaches, 'Keep awake, for you do not know when the master of the house will co me. If he co mes suddenly, do not let him find you asleep.'54 Epictetus writes, 'Go not far fro m t he ship at any t ime, lest the ma ster shoul d call and thou not be ready.'55 Jesus teaches, 'I assure you, anyo ne who doesn't receive the Kingdom o f God like a little child, will never get into it.'56 Heraclitus writes, 'The Kingdo m be lo ngs to the child.'57 Jesus teaches, 'Why do you cal l me good? No one is good, only God.'58 Four centuries previously Plato had defined God as 'the Good', a qualit y w hich, by definit ion, only God could fully manifest. In similar fashio n to Jesus, Pythagoras had refused to be called wise, explaining that no one is wise except God; Pythagoras preferred to call himself a 'lo ver of wisdo m' or 'philosopher' -a term he was the first person to use. HEAVEN AND HELL When the Mysteries were first introduced to Greece fro m E gypt, the noti on of an afterlife was a new a nd heretical doctrine to the Greeks. Likewise, the concept of heaven and hell is not found"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"in t he Old Testament, y et is a central idea in the gospels.59 Where did these notions co me fro m? Just as in ancient Greece, these new ideas were introduced by the My steri es. Chr istianit y offers its adherents the conso lation o f a heavenly afterlife, whilst threatening the wi cked and non -believers wit h t he torments of hell. Sophocles writes: 'How thrice blessed are they of mortals who, having beheld these Mysteries, depart to the house of Death. For to such alo ne is life bestowed there: to others fall all ills .’60 On the death of his belo ved litt le daughter Timoxena, Plutarch wrote a beautiful letter of conso lation t o his wife in which he urged her to remember 'the my stic symbo ls of the rites of Dionysus' which will prevent her from thinking that 'the soul experiences nothing after death and ceases to be ’.61 Pl utarch is confident that through 'the experience which we share together of the revelat ions of Dio nysus', he a nd his wife 'know that the soul is indestructible' and in the afterlife is like a bird set free from its cage.62 An inscription claims that init iates of the Mysteries, like the Christ ian fa it hful , are 'reborn in eternit y'.63 A hierophant's funeral inscrip tion tells us that he now knows 'death is not an evil but som ething good'.64 Glaucus writes: 'Beaut ifu l indeed is the Mystery given us by the blessed gods: death is for mortals no longer an evil but a blessing.'65 A priest of the Mysteries of Orpheus named Philip 'preached so enthusiast ically about the bliss that awaited the init iated in heaven, that one wit asked him why he did not hurry up and die to enjo y it himself!66 St August ine complains that the Mysteries 'promise eternal life to anybody!'67 Yet th e Mysteri es only promised eternal salvat ion to the init iated, just as Christ ianit y o nly promises eternal life to Christ ians. A hymn warns: 'Blessed is he who has seen this among earthly men; but he who is uninit iated in the sacred rites and who has no por tion, never has the same lot once dead down in the murky dark.'68 The Mysteries o f Orpheus were renowned in the ancient world for their vivid descript ions of the torm ents awai ting evil -doers in the afterlife. As one modern authority tells us, 'Orphics cre ated the Christ ian idea of purgatory.'69 Indeed, the scholar Franz Cumo nthas shown that the vivid descript ions of the happiness of the blessed and sufferings o f sinners found in Orphic books were taken over by the Jewish Books of Esdras, which were writte n in t he first century CE and included amo ngst the apocry phal scriptures in so me versio ns of the New Testament; these Pagan conceptions of the afterlife were then developed by St Ambrose and so became the standard imagery ofCatho licism.70 No wonder, then , that when early Christians came across passages in Plato concerning the punishment of souls in Tartarus, the Greek hell, they found it difficult to explain how Pagans coul d have anticipated their own doctrine of hellfire.71 In Phaedo, for example, Plato describes a 'huge lake blazing with much fire ... and boiling with water and mud'. In the non -canonical Chr istian scripture The Apocalypse o f Peter we find the same fate await ing sinners in the Underworl d, who will be trapped in 'a huge lake filled with bl azing mud'.72 Celsus is clear that Christ ian concept ions of heaven and hell borrow heavily fro m t he Mysteri es. He writes:"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"'Now the Christians pray that after their toil and strife here below they shall enter the kingdo m o f heaven, and they agree with the anci ent system s that there are seven heavens and that the way of the soul is through the planets. That their system is based on very o ld t eachings may be seen fro m s imilar beliefs in the old Persi an Mysteri es associated with the cult of Mithras .’73 The My steri es o f M ithras di d indeed, like Christ ianit y,teach of the terrors that awaited the damned in the bowels of the Earth and of the pleasures for the blessed in a celest ial paradise.74 The belief in seven heavens has not come down to us in modern Christ ianit y,but was prevalent am ongst early Christians and is referred to by St Paul, who describes himself being 'caught up as far as the third heaven'.75 Chr istian enthusiasm for the sufferings of the damned in hell reminds Celsus o f the mo re superst itious in it iates of the Mysteries of Bacchus: 'Christ ians babble about God day and night in their impious and sulhed way; they arouse the awe of the illiterate with their false descriptions of the punishments awai ting those who have sinned. Thus they behave like g uardians of the Bacchic Mysteri es.'76 The more enlightened sages o f the Mysteries viewed such horrors as merely stories to encourage better moral behaviour. Plutarch calls the terrors of the Underworld an 'improving myt h'.77 The Chr istian philosopher Orig en likewise argued that the literal terrors of hell were false, but they ought to be publicized in order to scare simpler believers.78 Both the Pagan sages and Origen believed in reincarnat ion. Heaven and hell were seen as tem porary states of reward and p unishment fo llo wed by another human incarnat ion. Life and death were viewed as p arts of a recurring 'circular' process, not once -only events leading to eternal reward or damnat ion. Hell was a purgatorial experience leading to further human experience, thro ugh which every soul could make its return journey to God. Ori gen, however, was posthumously condemned by the Roman Catholic Church as a heret ic fo r his compassio nate belief that all souls would eventually be redeemed.79 The Ro ma n Church required all Chri stians to believe that some souls would suffer in hell forever, while the fait hful would enjo y eternal salvat ion. This is the one doctrine on the afterlife which Celsus regards as dist inct ively Christ ian. He writes: 'Now it will be wondered how men so des perate in their beliefs can persuade others to jo in t heir ranks. The Christ ians use sundry methods of persuasio n, and invent a number of terrifying incent ives. Above all, they have concocted an abso lut ely o ffensive doctrine of everlast ing punishment and re wards, exceeding anyt hing the philosophers (who have never denied the punishment of the unrighteous or the reward of the blessed) could have imagined.'80 The Roman Church also taught that at the Last Judgement there would be an apocalypse of fire at the e nd of tirne in which all non -Christians would be consumed and the fait hful physically resurrected. Celsus is appalled, writing,"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"'It i s equally silly ofthese Christ ians to suppose that when their god applies the fire (like a co mmo n cook!) all the rest of ma nkind will be thoroughly roasted, and that they alon e will escape unscorched -not just those alive at the time, mind you, but they say those l ong since dead will rise up from the earth possessing the same bodi es as they did before. I ask you: Is this no t the hope of worms? For what sort ofhuman soul is it that has any use for a rotted corpse of a body? The very fact that som e Jews and even so me Christ ians rej ect this teaching about rising corpses shows just how repulsive it is; it is nothing less than n auseating and impossible. I mean, what sort of body is it that could return to its original nature or beco me t he same as it was before it rotted away? And of course they have no reply for this one, and as in most cases where there is no reply they take cov er by saying \"Nothing is impossible wit h God.\" '81 Yet even this rather bizarre Christ ian doctrine of apocalypse and physical resurrect ion is prefigured by the Mysteries of Mi thras. This particular Mystery tradi tion taught that at the end of the present a ge God would send destruction upon the world. Then, like the 'Second Co ming' of Jesus, Mithras would descend to Earth again and raise the dead fro m t heir tombs. According to the Gospel of Matthew, during the last days the Son of Man will separate the good fro m t he bad, like a shepherd separat ing sheep fro m goats, saving the one and condemning the other.82 Likewise the fo llo wers of Mit hras expected that in the last days humanit y wo uld form one grand assembly and the good be separated from the bad. Finally, acquiescing to the pray ers ofthe 'beaut iful ones', they believed God would cause a devouring fire to fall fro m t he heavens which would annihilate all the wicked. Just as the Christ ian apocalypse signals the final defeat of the Devil by Christ, so in Mithr aism the Spirit of Darkness and his impure demons will perish in the great conflagrat ion and the rejuvenated universe enjo y happiness wit hout end for all eterni ty.83 THE NEW AGE In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus predicts the coming apocalypse and birth of a New Age, saying, 'For nation will make war upon nation, kingdo m u pon kingdo m; there will be famines and' earthquakes in many places. With all these things the birth -pangs of the New Age begin.'84 Based on their understanding of astronomy, Pagans also exp ected a New Age. The ancients believed that approximately every 2,000 years we enter a ne w astrol ogi cal 'Great Mon th'.83 They them selves were living in the Great Month of Aries, which began in about 2,000 BCE. The Age ofAr ies was symbo lized by the ram, he nce Dio nysus was often depicted with ram's horns. The New Age of Pisces began around 145 BCE and is currently changing into another New Age, the Great Month of Aquarius. Pisces is symbo lized by the fish and Christ ians obviously viewed their faith as a new religion for this New Age. The most commo n symbo l used to represent Christ ianit y was the symbo l of the fish -the Pythagorean vesica piscis, which we have discussed previously (see pp.48 -9). The apostles were known as 'fishers of men'. Early Christ ians ca lled themselves 'litt le fishes'. The Greek word ICTHYS, which means 'fish', was used by early Christ ians as a code"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"word for 'Jesus'. This was regarded as an acronym for 'Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour'. The great mouthpiece of Christian orthodoxy, Tertu llia n, wri tes: 'But we, the Christ ians, are little fishes after the type of our great Fish (ICTHYS) Jesus Christ, born in the water.'86 However, Icthy s had for centuries been the Greek name for Adonis the godman in the Syrian Mysteri es!87 As the Age of Pisces began, its opposite sign in the zodiac, Virgo the Virgin, was on the western horizon. Pagan myt ho logy, therefore, expected the saviour of the Piscean Age to be born ofa virgin. In the first century BCE the Roman poet and init iate Vi rgil , reputedly repeat ing a prophecy ofa Pagan oracular priestess known as the Sibyl, predicted such a miraculous birth: 'We have reached the last era in Sibylline song. Time has conceived and the great Sequence of the Ages starts afresh. Just ice, the Virgin, comes back to dwell with us. The first -born of the New Age is already on his way from high heaven down to earth. With him the iron race shall end and golden man inherit all the world. Sm ile on the baby's birth. This glorious Age will dawn. The ox will not be frighte ned o f the lion. Your very cradle will adorn itself with blosso ms to caress you. Enter, for the hour is close at hand. See how the who le creation rej oices in the age that is to be! Begin, then, little bo y,to greet your mother with a smile .’88 This prophe cy, so reminiscent of the story ofthe birth of Jesus and the Christ ian promise that the lamb and lio n will lie down together, was interpreted by Christians as ant icipat ing the coming of Jesus. Actually, Virgil was referring to the widely held Pagan belief that the coming age of Pisces would herald a new beginning for humankind, and the divine child was Osiris - Dionysus.89 The ancients believed that the beginning of a New Age was marked by the destruction of the ol d. The Great Month of Taurus is symbo lized by a bull. Scho lars now understand that altar - pieces representing Mit hras slaying a bull are actually star maps depict ing the ending of the Age ofTaurus.90 The fo llo wing Great Month of Aries is symbo lized by a ram. Is it a coincidence that the end of this Great Age is similarly marked by representations of the slaying o f Jesus, the 'Lamb o f God ’.91 The Persian Mysteries of Mit hras taught that the Great Months were each bounded by an apocalypse -at one end by a flood and at the other by fire.92 The Greeks also held that there had been a dreadful but purifying flood, related in the myt h of Deucalio n. In the same way, early Chr istians looked back to a purging by water, the flood of Noah, and looked forward to a purging by fire, the coming apocalypse. No wond er, then, that Celsus sees in this Christian visio n mo re plagiarism of ancient Pagan teachings: They postulate, for example, that their Messiah will return as a conqueror on the clouds, and that he will rain fire upon the earth in his battle with the prin ces of the air, and that the whole world, with the except ion of believing Christ ians, will be consumed in fire. An interest ing idea -and hardly an original one. The idea came fro m t he Greeks and others -namely, that after cycles of years and because of t he fortui tous conj unct ions o f certain stars there are conflagrations and floods, and"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"that after the last flood, in the time of Deucalio n, the cycle demands a conflagrat ion in accordance wit h t he alternating successio n o f the universe.

Christ ianit y,by contrast, is classed as a 'm onothei stic’religio n because Christians believe in only one God. In their relentless campaign to rubbish Paganism, Christians have portrayed its so-called 'po lyt heism1 as primit ive ido latry. But this is a complete distortion of the sublime philosophical u nderstanding of God held by the sages of the ancient Mysteries. Five hundred years before Christ, Xenophanes had already written: 'There is one God, always st ill and at rest, who moves all things with the thoughts of his mind/94 The legendary Egy pti an sag e Herm es Trismegistus is credited with teaching: 'Do you think there are many Gods? That's absurd -God is one/95 Writ ing at around the time that Christ ians were just beginning to preach their supposedly ant i-Pagan doctrine of one God, the Pagan sage Maxim us ofTy re decl ared: 'The one doctrine upon which all the world is united is that one God is king of all and father.'96 Even Just in Mart yrcoul d not deny that Py thagoras had preached the doctrine o f o ne God. He quotes Py thagoras' own words: 'God is one; and he himself does not, as some suppose, exist outside the world, but in it, he being who lly present in the ent ire ci rcle, and beho lding all generat ions, being the regulat ing ingredient of all the ages, and the administrator ofhis own powers and works, t he fir st pri nciple of all things, the light of heaven, and father of all, the intelligence and animat ing soul of the universe, the mo vement of all orbits.197 This idea was not even new in the time of Pyt hagoras, but had existed for thousands of years am ongst the ancient Egy ptians, who talked of an ineffable one God who could not be represented in stone. In the Egypt ian Mysteries, Osiris represents this supreme Being and was proclaimed 'Heir of the world and the One God'.98 Egypt ian inscript ions reveal just how similar the Pagan and Christ ian concept ions of God in fact are: 'God is One alone, and none other existeth with Him. God i s the One who hath made all things. God i s fro m t he beginning, and He hath been fro m t he beginning. He existed when nothing else existed, and what existeth He created after He had come into being. He is the father of beginnings.'99 The Egy ptian god Amun was called 'the One of One'."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"The great Egy ptol ogi st Wallis Budge remarks: 'It i s also said that he is \"wit hout a second\" and th us there is no doubt whatever that when the Egypt ians declared their God to be One, and wit hout a second, they meant precisely what the Hebrews and Arabs meant when they declared their God to be One. Such a God was an ent irely different Being fro m t he pers onification o f the powers of nature and the existences which, for want of a better name, have been called \"gods\".'100 Like every religio n, Paganism had its superst it ious and primit ive side, and there certainly were many Pagan cults of different gods. But, as Budge explains, these so -called 'gods' represented aspects of nature. The ancient Egypt ian word which we translate as 'god' is netei. Neter refers to a spi ritual essence or principle. The many neters of the Egyptians represented the many natures oftheone all -embracing Being -the gods were different aspects or faces of the one supreme God.101 In the ancient world, a particular god was often chosen to represent the one ineffable God, and the epithet pantheus, meaning 'all -god', was added to his name. Thus we find Latin inscri ptions to Osiris -Dionysus, in his forms as Serapis and Liber, which address the godman as 'Serapis Pantheus' and 'Liber Pantheus'.102 Pagans could all worship the same one God via any particular god or goddess that appealed to the m w it hout being in contradict ion with their neighbours who chose a different divine face. Celsus writes: 'It m atters not a bit what one calls the supreme God -or whether one uses Greek names or Indian names or the names used formerly by the Egypt ians.'10 3 By denying the validit y o f a ll other faces of the divine except Jehovah, the god of the Jews, Chr istians stepped outside this commo n understanding. Pagans found this inexplicably small -minded. Such exclusivit y w as alien to the Pagan spi rit of religious tol erance, beaut ifully captured by Maximus of Tyre: ‘Let all the nat ions know the divine, that it is one, - and if the art of Phideas arouses the Greeks to the remembrance of God, the worship of animals the Egy pti ans and a river others, and fire others a gain, do not find fault with their differences. Let them only know, let them only lo ve, let them remember.'104 This open -minded tolerance did not stop init iates of the Mysteries trying to free their fellow Pagans from po int less superst ition, however.105 W hen Christ ians cri ticized the Pagans for worshi pping ido ls they were actually echo ing the sages of the Mysteries, who had been gently mo cking more primit ive Pagan practices for centuries. Celsus complains indignant ly of the Chr istians: ‘There is nothing n ew or impressive about their ethical teaching; indeed when one com pares it to other philosophies, their simple -mindedness beco me s apparent.

Indeed it is preposterous that the work of a craftsman (of ten the worst sort of person!) should be considered a god. The wise Heraclitus says that \" those who worship images as gods are as fo olish as men who talk to walls.\" '106 Diagoras was renowned for mocking the gods, 107 as was Diogenes of Pontus, who, when asked why he was begging from a statue, answered sardonically, 'To get practice in being refused.'108 Xenophanes had attacked t he immoral behaviour of the gods as portrayed by Ho mer and Hesiod, comment ing sarcast ically, 'Human beings think o f the gods as having been born, wearing clothes, speaking, and having bodies like their own. Ethiopians say the gods are black wit h snub nose s. Thracians say they have blue eyes and red hair. If cows and horses had hands they woul d draw pictures of the gods looking like cows and horses .’500 The sat irist Lucian has his fict ional character Momus complain to Zeus about all the bizarre representat ions of the gods with animal heads. In reply Zeus acknowledges, 'These things are unseemly ,'but explains that 'Most of them are a matter of symbo lism and someone who is not an init iate into the My steri es really shoul d not laugh at them.'110 Celsus likewis e explains that the Pagan representation of the gods are understood by the init iated as having symbo lic meaning and shoul d not be taken literally, since they are 'symbo ls of invisible ideas and not obje cts of worshi p in t hemselves'.111 Ironi cally , many Pag an philosophers thought it was the Christ ian concept ion ofGod whi ch was primit ive. Whilst it was all right to personify aspects of God as the 'gods', they regarded it as impossible to portray the ineffable nature of the supreme God in human terms as the C hristians did. Celsus, finding such anthropomorphism ridiculous, writes: 'The Christians say that God has hands, a mouth, and a vo ice, -theyare al ways procl aiming that \"God said this\" or \"God spoke\". \"The heavens declare the work ofhis hands,\" they say. I can only co mment that such a God is no God at all, for God has neit her hands, mouth nor voice, nor any characterist ics of which we know. Their absurd doctrines even contain reference to God walking about in the garden he created for man; and they speak ofhim being angry, jealous, moved to repentance, sorry , sleepy -in short as being in every respect more a man than a God.112 Further, for all their exclusiveness about the highest God, do not the Jews also worship angels?'113 Not only did the Jews and C hristians worship angels, which Pagans saw as direct ly equivalent to their m any gods and goddesses, they even talked about 'the gods' in exact ly t he same way that Pagans did! The Church father Clement of Alexandria writes of spiritual illuminat ion 't eachin g us beforehand the future life that we shall lead according to God and with the gods'. The illuminated, he explains, are called gods because they are 'dest ined to sit on thrones with the other gods that have been first put in their places by the Saviour'. 114 The Pagan init iate Cicero wri tes, 'Know then, that thou art a god.'115 In the same way, in the Gospel of John we read that Jesus answers the Pharisees' accusation o f blasphemy for having claimed to be the Son of God:"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"'Is it not written in your own law \"I said: You are gods?\" These are called gods to who m t he word of God was delivered -and Scripture cannot be set aside. Then why do you charge me wit h blasphemy because I, consecrated and sent into the worl d by the Father, said, \"I am God's Son?\" ‘116 The early Christ ian philo sopher Ori gen used phrases such as 'two Gods' in discussing the creed.117 Justin Mart yrspeaks of 'a second God'.118 And then, of course, there is the decidedly 'po lyt heist ic' Christ ian doctrine o f the Holy Trinit y.119 The idea that God can manifest in 'three persons' is ident ical wit h t he Pagan concept of the many natures or faces of the one supreme ineffable God. The notion of a divine trinit y is no t found in Judaism, but it is prefigured by Paganism.120 Aristotle writes of the Py thagorean doctrine that 'the whole and everyt hing in it is com prehended by the number three, for end, middle and beginning have the number of the who le, that is the trinit y'.121 Hundreds of years earlier, an ancient Egypt ian t ext has God procl aim: 'Being O ne I became Three.'122 Another reads: 'Three are all the gods, Amon, Ra, Ptah; there are none like them. Hidden in his name as Amo n, he is Ra, his body is Ptah. He is manifested in Amo n, wi thRa and Ptah, the three united.'123 On close examinat ion t he li ne between so -called 'mo nothei sm' and 'po lyt heism' is not as hard and fast as some would have us believe. In fact it is so fluid as to be of no real consequence at all. THE LOGOS The King James translation o f the Gospel of John opens with the famous and po etic passage: 'In t he beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning wit h God. All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life and the life was the li ght of me n.'124 Many readers o f this text find it strangely mo ving, but would confess to not really understanding what it means. This is not surprising, because wit hout some knowledge of Pagan philosophy it really does make litt le sense. In the original G reek, the term here translated as 'Word' is 'Logos'. The concept of the Logos is completely foreign to Judaism and is ent irely derived fro m t he Pagan Mysteries. As lo ng ago as the sixth century BCE Heraclitus set out on a journey of self -discovery and discovered the 'Logos shared by all'.125 He writes: 'Having hearkened not unto to me, but unto the Logos, it is wise to confess that all things are One.'126 The Pagan sage Epictetus preaches: 'The Logos of the philo sophers doth promise us peace which God pro claimed through his Logos.'127 The Roman Vitruvius writes: 'Let no one think I have erred if I believe in the Logos.'128 Clement of Alexandria acknowledges that: ‘It m ay be freely granted that the Greeks received so me g limmers of the divine Logos' and quot es the legendary Pagan sage Orpheus, who proclaims: 'Beho ld t he Logos divine. Tread well the narrow path of life and gaze on Him, the world's great ruler, our immortal king.'129 But this Pagan concept is"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"much older than the Greeks. It can be found in the a ncient Egy ptian P yramid Texts of the Third Dynast y which were written more than 2,500 years before the Christian era!130 How should we understand this ancient concept of the Logos? In ancient Greek, Logos has many levels of meaning which our term 'Word' d oes not begin to capture.131 One of these is expressed by the Church fathers Clement and Origen, who describe the Logos as 'the Idea of Ideas'. It is God's primal thought.132 The legendary Pagan sage Hermes Trismegistus expresses exactly the same concept. He describes the Logos -the Idea of Ideas -emerging from the Oneness o f God like a word or thought.133 For Hermes, as for Clement and Origen, the Logos is the first thought of the great Mind of God, through which he creates the universe. Chr istians pers onify the relat ionship between God and the Logos as that between a father and a son. The Logos is the 'Son of God'. Yet they also teach that the Father and the Son are aspects of each other. St John expresses this paradox: 'The Logos was with God, and the Logos was God.' These are actually ancient Pagan doctrines, propounded by sages such as Hermes Trismegistus, who also calls the Logos 'the Son of God'.134 He explains that, like mind and thought, the Father and the Son are really One, but when separated f rom each other they appear as two. Likewise, in the sixt h century BCE Heraclitus had written: 'The Father and the Son are the same.'135 Clement acknowledges that Euripides had 'divined as in a riddle that the Father and the Son are one God'.136 How should we understand this mysterious relationship between the Logos and God, the Father and the Son?137 Clement writes: 'The Son is the Consciousness of God. The Father only sees the world as reflected in the Son. ’138 The Logos is God conscious of Himself. It is the One Soul ofthe Universe which is conscious through all beings. This is why Heraclitus sets out to find himself, but discovers a 'Logos shared by all', because the Logos is our essent ial co mmo n ident it y.The Christ ian philosopher Origen writes: 'As o ur body, while consist ing o f ma ny members, is yet held together by one soul, so the universe is to be thought of as an immense living being, which is held together by One Soul -the power and the Logos of God.'139 Just as St John tells us that Jesus is an embodiment of the Logos, so the Pagan init iate Plutarch teaches that Osiris is 'the Logos in itself, transcendent and impassible'.140 By equat ing Jesus Chr ist wi ththe Logos, St John is making it clear that he is a personificat ion of this One Soul o f the Universe, as Osiris -Dionysus is for Pagans. Christ is in us all, because he is the essential divine nature we all share. From this perspect ive, the Son of God is not an historical figure who lives in t ime, but an eternal philo sophical principle, for, as Or igen writes, 'The Father did not beget the Son, but ever is begetting him.'141 So, i s there any real difference between Christian and Pagan understanding o f the Logos? Once again, it is only found in the Christ ian id ea that, unlike the Pagan god -ma n who m yt hically embodi ed the Logos, Jesus literally embodied this philosophical principle. St Augustine writes of his studies of Pagan philosophy: 'I read there that God the Word was born not of flesh and blood, nor of the will of man, nor the will ofthe flesh , but of God. But that the Word was made flesh and dwel t am ongst us, I read not there .’142"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The essential idea which divided the Pagans and Christ ians o f the ancient world was the Chr istian belief that one man, and one man only, had literally been the Log os m ade flesh. To the Pagans the notion that the Logos we all share could in so me way be manifest in a single human being was impossible. The extraordinary claim that a carpenter from Nazareth actually was the one and only Son of God and incarnation of the Logos was the only thing that Christ ians could latch onto that definit ively differentiated them from their Pagan neighbours. They would, however, spend centuries arguing over what it could possibly mean. LANGUAGE OF THE MYSTERIES Professor Max Miiller tel ls us emphat ically that anyo ne who uses terms such as 'logos' or 'the word', 'monogenes' or 'the only -begotten', 'protokos' or 'the first -born', 'hyio s tou theou' or 'the Son of God' has 'borrowed the very germs of his religious thought from Greek philosop hy'.143 The writ ings of early Christ ians, including the New Testament, are rife with such Pagan concepts, which go unnoticed because they are disguised by poor English translat ions o f the ori ginal Greek.144 The language used by early Christ ianit y is in fac t so similar to that of the Mysteri es that we often cannot tell from burial inscript ions whether the deceased was a Christian or a Pagan!145 St Paul, for example, describes God speaking 'divine Mysteries in the Spirit'.146 Bapt ism and the Eucharist are re ferred to as 'Mysteries'.147 The bishop who leads the ceremony is called a 'Mystagogue'. The mass is called a 'Mystagogia', a word which is st ill used by Greek Orthodox Chr istians to describe the passio n of Jesus. As a modern authorit y co mments, this is 't he language o f the Mysteries'.148 The Christ ian philo sopher Origen calls Christianit y 't he telete', meaning 'the init iat ion'. Likewise, the Pagan crit ic Lucian views early Christ ianit y a s another versio n of the Mysteries and calls it simply a 'new telete' -a new init iat ion.149 St Paul is usually translated as writing of 'mature' or 'perfected' Christ ians, but again the Greek would be mo re accurately translated as 'init iated'. When dealing with certain doctrines, it was commo n fo r early Christ ians, such as Ori gen, to simply announce: 'The init iates know what I mean!'150 This is exact ly t he same formula used by the Pagan philosophers Pausanias, Plutarch and Apuleius when they touch upon secrets of the Pagan Mysteries.151 The writ ings of the Church father Cl ement of Alexandria are full of termino logytaken direct ly fro m t he language of the Pagan Mysteries. He writes of the Christ ian revelat ion as 'the ho ly Mysteries', 'the divine secrets', 'the secret Logos', 'the Mysteries of the Logos'. For Clement, Jesus C hrist is the 'teacher of the divine Mysteries', just as Osiris -Dionysus is. 'The Lord is my hierophant,' Clement wri tes. 'I am beco me ho ly while I am being init iated.'152 In language no different fro m t hat of a Pagan init iate, he enthuses: 'O truly sacred Mysteri es! O pure light! In the blaze of the torches I have a visio n ofheaven and o f God. I beco me ho ly by init iat ion. The Lord reveals the Mysteri es. He marks the worshipper with His seal. If thou wilt, be thyself also init iated, and thou shalt dance wi thangels around the unbegotten and imperishable and only true God.'153 Chr istianit y even inherited its forms of organization fro m t he Mysteries.154 A modern Christ ian scho lar acknowledges:"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"'The Mysteries had brought men together in those religious assoc iations which were the harbingers of the house -churches of primitive Christ ianit y,and had ready to hand for the new religio n an organisat ion and system o f administration. The Mysteri es, both Greek and Oriental, had created a favourable milieu for Chr istianit y by making religio n a matter of personal convict ion; t hey had made familiar the consciousness of and the need of a redempt ion; and by their Salvat ionist propaganda they disposed men to lend a ready ear to the Christian procl amat ion of Jesus as saviour; theyhad denat ionalised gods and men in aiming at the brotherhood of mankind; they had st imulated cravings for immortalit y; they had made men zealous propagandists by laying upon them the duty o f the diffusio n of their fait h; they had fostered monotheism by making their patron dei tythe representative o f the Divine Unit y.'155 CONCLUSION So was the 'New Testament' really new? It was certainly new and heret ical to tradit ional Jews. Through the figure of Jesus their doctrine of 'an eye for an eye' was challe nged by Socrates' doctrine of 'Love your enemies'. Their notions of the afterlife were revo lut ionized by Mystery teachings on the nature of heaven and hell. The New Testament was, therefore, new to the Jews - but not to Pagans. They had held such doctrines for hundreds o f year s. That the teachings of Jesus were ant icipated by Pagan teachings would not have surprised the ancients, however. They woul d have expected the Truth, by its very nature, to be perennial, not original. Let's review some of the evidence we have unearthed: • Jesus taught his fo llo wers to be pure in thought and word and deed; so did the sages of the Mysteri es. • Chr istians have a personal lo ving relat ionshi p with Go d; so did the init iates of the Mysteries. • Jesus taught his fo llo wers to love their neighbours; so did the sages of the Mysteries. • Jesus taught his fo llo wers to l ove thei r enemies; so did the sages of the Mysteries. • Chr istians lo ve each other as 'brothers'; so did initiates ofthe Mysteries. • Chr istians embrace humilit y a nd vo luntary poverty , as did Pagans sages. • Chr istians have a concept ion of heaven and hell not found in Judaism, but taken direct ly fro m the My steri es. • Chr istians await an apocalypse of fire and the birth of a New Age; so did init iates of the Mysteri es. • Early Christian imagery o f the fish is taken from Pagan astrol ogy . • Chr istians believe in one God; so did the sages of the Mysteri es. • Chr istians, like Pagans, talked o f the 'gods'. • Chr istians attack i dolatry , as did the sages ofthe Mysteri es. • Ch ristians conceive o f God as a Holy Trinit y,a concept which is also found in the Pagan Mysteri es. • Chr istians see Jesus as an embodiment of the Logos, which is a Pagan concept not found in Judaism. • Early Christian writings, including the New Testament, are full of the language of the Mysteri es."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"• The organizat ion of the early Christian Church was an adaptati on of the practices of init iates of the Pagan Mysteri es. It was now obvious to us that the teachings of the Mysteries ant icipated the doctrines of Christianit y and that the Pagan myt hs of Osiris -Diony sus prefigured the story ofJesus. For 2,000 years our culture has believed that Christ ianit y was a unique and revo lut ionary revelat ion, but that is clearly not true! So what is the truth? This was the q uesti on we were determined to answer. The tradi tional history ofChrist ianit y bequeathed to us by the Roman Church had failed to account for the historical evidence, so we decided to look elsewhere. In the first few centuries CE the Christ ian co mmunit y w as divided into many different sects. As well as the Literalist Christians who eventually became the Roman Church there were other Christian groups collect ively known as the 'Gnostics'. The Gnost ics had a radically different perspective on Christianit y w hic h t he Literalists regarded as dangerously misguided. When Literalist Christ ianit y became the religio n of the Roman Empire it enforced its own parti cular view and brutally eradicated the 'heret ics'. So, the tradit ional history of Christ ianit y is merely the perspective o f the winners in the sectarian battle between Literalists and Gnost ics. As thi s account had proved inadequate to the facts, we decided to listen to what the losers had to say . The Gnosti cs m ay have lost the battle for survival, but that does n ot mean we should assume that thei r perspect ive on Christianit y was any less valid. What was it the Gnostics knew, we wondered, that made the Roman Church consider them so dangerous?"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The Gnostics 'Recent invest igat ions have challenged the traditional ou tlook and the tradi tional concl usi on s and the tradit ional \"facts\". Wit h so me today, and wit h ma ny tom orrow, the burning quest ion is, or will be, not how did a particularly silly and licent ious heresy rise within the church, but how did the church rise out ofthe great Gnostic movement, how did the dynamic ideas of the Gnosis beco me cry stallised into dogma?'1 Rev. Lamplugh The Gnost ics’ view of Christ ianit y was in many ways the mirror image of that of the Literalist Chr istians who eventually became the Roma n Catho lic Church. Literal -ists were rigidly authori tari an. Gnost ics were myst ic individualists. Literalists wanted to enforce a commo n creed on all Christ ians. Gnostics tolerated various different beliefs and pract ices. Literalists selected four gospels a s ho ly scripture and had the rest consigned to the flames as heretical works of the Devil. Gnostics wrote hundreds of different Christian gospels. Literalists taught that the true Chr istian believed in Jesus as preached to them by the bishops. Gnostics tau ght that the true Chr istian experienced 'Gnosis' or myst ical 'Knowledge ’for themselves and became a Christ! The Gnost ics were so effect ively suppressed that unt il recent ly almost all we knew about them came fro m t he writ ings of their detractors and oppre ssors.2 Literalist Christians bequeathed us the idea that Gnosticism was a perversio n of Christ ian t hought which confused the original teachings of Jesus with alien Pagan doctrines. For 2,000 years this has been the party line o f orthodox Christ ianit y, and as it successfully eliminated the opposition and destroyed all the evidence, it has been generally accepted as the truth. In 1945, however, a library of Gnostic scri ptures was discovered in a cave near Nag Hammadi in Egypt. This has revolut ionized our und erstanding of Gnosticism and early Christianit y. Now we are in a posit ion t o let the Gnostics speak for themselves. Alt hough remembered today as heretics, the Gnostics , saw themselves as the genuine Chr istians. In a Gnostic gospel called The Apocalypse o f Peter, the risen Jesus calls Literalist Chr istianit y an 'imitat ion church' in place of the true Christ ian brotherhood of the Gnostics. From the Gnostics' point of view, it was the Literalists who had distorted true Christ ianit y.They had created a religi on that requi red blind fait h in historical events from what was originally a spi ritual path through which each init iate could personally experience 'Gnosis'. To the Gnostics, Literalist Christ ianit y preached only the Outer Mysteries of Christianit y,which theycalled a 'worl dly Christ ianit y' suitable for 'people in a hurry'.3 Gnosticism, by contrast, was a truly 'spiritual Christianit y', which revealed the secret Inner Mysteries o f Chr istianit y t o the chosen few.4 Remarkably enough, these particular quotat ions are not from so me lit tle known Gnostic heret ic, but fro m t he writ ings o f two ofthe mo st eminent Christians of the early Church - Clement, the head of the first Christ ian philo sophical school in Alexandria, and his successor Ori gen.5 These men were hig hly respected during their lifet imes and are still regarded as two of the greatest early Christ ian philo sophers, yet both preached a form of Christ ianit y mo re akin to Gnosticism than to modern mainstream Christ ianit y.Clement is even honoured as a saint by the Catholic Church, yet he wrote volumes on the 'Gnostic' who m he called the 'true Christ ian’.6"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"The Gnost ic beliefs o f such influent ial and respected Christ ian int ellectual s as Clement and Origen show that the Gnostics were not strange and insignificant heret ics on the fringes of Chr istianit y, as the tradit ional picture would have us believe. On the contrary, Gnosticism was a broad, vibrant and sophist icated spiritualit y w hich was attractive to the greatest Christ ian int ellectuals of the first few centur ies CE -not only great sages such as Valent inus and Basilides, who have been all but forgotten because they were branded heret ics by t he Rom an Church, but also m en such as Clement and Origen, whose reputations have been less maligned. PAGAN PHILOSOPHY The central and most repeated accusation levelled at the Gnostic Christ ians by Literalist Chr istians was that they were essent ially litt le d ifferent from Pagans. Irenaeus, the great heresy - hunter of early Literalism, condemns the Gnostics for patching togethe r a new garment out of the useless old rags of Greek philosophy.7 He calls the fo llo wers of the Gnostic sage Simo n Magus 'Mystery priests' and accuses them o f worshipping 'an image of Simo n made in the form o f Zeus'.8 Tertullian, another author of fanat ica lly anti -Gnosti c works, compares the Christian init iat ions offered by the Gnost ics to the Pagan init iat ions pract ised at Eleusis.9 Hippo lyt us, a disci ple o f Irenaeus, tells us of a Gnostic group called the 'Sethians', of who m he asserts: 'They took the who le content of their teaching from the ancient [Pagan] theologians Musaeus, Linus, and Orpheus, who especially made known the rites and Mysteries.'10 Irenaeus is outraged that Gnostics venerated pictures of Christ alongside 'images of worldly philosophers s uch as Py thagoras, Pl ato, Ari stotl e and the others'.11 Gnostics attended Pagan fest ivals and welco med Pagans to their own Christ ian meet ings ,2 leading Tertullian to comment reproachfully: It has been observed that heretics have connect ions with very many magicians, it inerant charlatans, astrologers, and philo sophers. ’13 Alt hough such Literalist Christ ians grotesquely misrepresented the Gnostics, this was one thing about whi ch they were undoubtedly right: Gnosticism did indeed resemble the Pagan Mysteri es.14 Unlike Literalists, however, Gnostics did not see Paganism as the enemy and so openly acknowledged this debt and encouraged the study of the great philo sophers of ant iquit y.15 Indeed, Pagan works were discovered alongside Christ ian t exts in the Gnostic library in Nag Hammadi.16 Clement of Alexandria was steeped in Pagan philo sophy , which he regarded as a divine gift to lead men to Christ.17 He explains: 'Greek philo sophy purges the soul, and prepares it beforehand for the reception of fait h, on which the Truth builds up the edifice of Gnosis. ’18 Ori gen, likewise, instructed his pupils that perfect piet y r equi red a knowledge of Pagan philosophy,19 which he calls a fine meal prepared for sophisticated palates. In comparison he claims that Christ ians 'co ok for the masses'.20 Origen had been instructed in philosophy by the Pagan sage Ammo nius.21 The Pagan philosopher Porphyry relates that he 'visited for a long time' with Ammo nius and Origen, both of whom he calls 'Platonists' and 'men who mu ch surpassed their contemporaries in insight'.22"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"As well as being the teacher of the great Christ ian philosopher Origen, Ammo nius was also the teacher of Plotinus, one of the greatest of all Pagan philosophers. Plotinus refers to Gnostic Christ ians wi thin his own philo sophical school and clearly regards Gnosticism as an overly comp lex and inferior versio n of the Pagan Mysteries: 'All their termino logyis piled up to conceal their debt to ancient Greek philosophy.23 We feel a certain regard for some of our friends who h appened upon, thi s way ofthinking before they became our friends, and, though I do not know how they manage it, continue in it.'24 PAGAN MYTHOLOGY Gnostic writings are full of figures from Greek mythology and concepts fro m P agan philo sophy , astrol ogy and mag ic.25 The Books of the Saviour, for example, states that Ieou (the Supreme God) has the assistance of five other Great Rulers -the Pagan deit ies Kronos, Ares, Hermes, Ap hrodi te and Zeus.26 Gnostic texts also mix together Pagan and Jewish myt ho logical moti fs. A Gnostic text called Baruch presents a synthesis o f Pagan astrology and the Jewish concept of angels. God the Father creates 12 angels who circle and govern the universe, as do the signs of the Pagan zodiac.27 The text uses the Jewish name for God, 'Elohim', but equates Elohim wit h the Greek Zeus. It describes Elohim choosing as a prophet the Pagan hero Heracles28 and even calls God 'Priapus', another name for Dionysus, claiming, 'The Good is Priapus who was created before there was anyt hing; he is called Priapus because he prefabricated everyt hing. For this reason he is erected in every tem ple, is honoured by all creat ion.'29 Hippoly tus tells us of a group of Gnostic Christ ians called the Naassenes who claimed to teach a philosophy that underlies allmy thologi es -Pagan, Jewish and Christian.30 The Naassenes saw Jesus as ident ical to the myt hical figure of the young dying son of the Great Mother they called 'the many shaped Attis'.31 This figure was also known in their hymns as Adonis, Osiris, Pan, Bacchus and Shepherd of White Stars -all of which are names for Osiris -Dionysus!32 Not only did these Gnostic Christ ians see Jesus as ident icalto Osi ris-Dionysus, but Hi ppoly tus also cl aims theywere actually init iates in the Pagan Mysteries. He writes: ‘It i s said, they were all init iated into the Mysteries of the Great Mother, because theyfound that the who le Mystery of rebirth was taught in these rites .’33 The Great Mother goddess was a towering figure who dominated the ancient world. In Egypt she was known as Isis and in Greece as Demeter. She was the mother or sister or spouse of Osiris - Dionysus or often, in that magical way that only myt h allows, all three. When we explored the Pagan Mysteries we did not invest igate the nature of the goddess ver y d eeply , because we were looking for parallels between Paganism and Christ ianit y, and orthodox Christ ianit y does ndt have a goddess. It has only God the Father, God the Son and a rather vague androgynous God the Holy Spirit. Gnostic myt ho logyincluded a m ore natural and balanced Holy Trinit y o f God the Father, God the Son and the Mother goddess Sophia.34"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"In Gnostic texts the goddess is called by many names, including 'All -Mother ’, 'Mother of the Living', 'Shining Mother', 'the Power Above', 'the Ho ly Spir it'35 and 'She o f the Left -hand', as the com plement of Christ who is 'Him o f the Right -hand'.36 Like the Pagan goddess, as well as being a divine heavenly being, Sophia is portrayed in Gnostic myt h as a tragic figure. She searches desperately for her rede emer/brother/l over Jesus in the same way that the Egypt ian goddess Isis searches the world for her redeemer/brother/lover Osi ris. The Gnostics poetically imagined that 'all watery substances' were tears shed by Sophia. In so doing they were echo ing the Pag an sage Empedocles, who five centuries previously had described all water as the tears of the goddess Persephone.37 Sophia was so important to some Gnostics that they taught that it was only in the Outer Mysteries that the Eucharist celebrated the passio n ofJesus. For the 'spiritual' Christ ians init iated i nto th e Inner Mysteries, the Eucharist recalled the passio n and suffering of the goddess Sophia! 38 THE GOD OF PLATO As we have already discussed, although the Pagan sages talked of gods and goddesses the y maintained a completely myst ical and transcendent understanding of the supreme God. Since the time of Plato, they had crit icized viewing God as a divine 'personalit y'. The supreme God of the Pagan Mysteries was an ineffable Oneness beyo nd all qualit ies, which could not be described in words.39 This abstract and myst icalconcepti on of God was also adopted by the Gnostics. God was not seen as some sort of big person in the sky, but was understood as the Mind of the Universe which expresses itself through al l beings.40 This was not the picture of God held by Literalist Christ ians. Their God was Jehovah, the god of the Jews, who the Old Testament reveals as a partisan, capricious and sometimes tyrannical tribal deit y. In the same way that Plato had attacked the tradit ional Greek picture of God as the domineering Zeus, so the Gnostics attacked this tradit ional Jewish picture of God,41 teaching that Jehovah was in realit y only't he image of the true God. The Gnostic sage Valentinus used Plato's term 'demiurge'42 to describe Jehovah, signifying him to be a subordinate divine being who serves as the instrument of the true God.43 Jehovah was pictured as a presumptuous lesser dei tywho i gnorant ly be lieves himself to be the one true God. In the Old Testament Jehovah procl aims: 'I am a jealous God, and there is no other God besides me.'44 However, the Gnostic Secret Book offo hn calls this 'madness' and comments: 'By announcing this he indicated to the angels that another God does exist; for if there were no other one, ofwho m would he be jealous? ’45 In some Gnostic texts, when Jehovah pronounces himself the one and only God he is castigated for his arrogance, like a presumptuous child, by his mother the goddess Sophia!46 The Gnost ic Jesus was not a prophet of Jehovah , the lesser god of the Jews, but of the true ineffable God of Plato and the Pagan Mysteries. The Gnostic teacher Cerdo explains: The God proclaimed by the law and the prophets is not the Father of Our Lord Jesus Christ. The God of the Old Testament is kno wn, but the Father of Jesus Christ is unknown .’47 Incom plete contrast to the crass anthropomorphism o f the traditional Jewish view, the Gnostic sage BasiliSes taught the Pagan doctrine that: 'We must not even call God ineffable, since this is to make an assert ion about Him; He is above every name that is named.'48"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"HIEROPHANT OF THE MYSTERIES The Literalists' Jesus is portrayed as Jehovah's promised Messiah, but the Gnostics' Jesus resembles a Hierophant of the Pagan Mysteries (see plate 8). In a Gnostic go spel called The Wisdom o f Jesus Christ, the resurrected Jesus appears to his disciples as a great angel of light and, smiling at their amazement and terror, offers to teach them 'the Mysteries'.49 In a Gnostic text called Pist is Sophia, he teaches his fo llowers: 'Cease not seeking day and night, until ye have found the purifying Mysteries ’50 and Mary Magdalene praises him, saying: 'Now we know, O Master, freely, surely, plainly that Thou hast brought the keys ofthe Mysteries of the Kingdo m o f L ight. ’51 The Gnost ic Jesus leads his disciples in Mystery init iat ions, including one recorded in a text called The Acts of John, using a 'round dance'. Such init iat ion dances were extremely co mmo n in the Pagan Mysteries. As one modern authorit y puts it, 'Not a singl e ancient init iation fest ival can be found that is without dancing.'52 In the Mysteries at Eleusis the candidate for init iat ion was seated while others danced around him in a circle, mimicking the orbits of the planets and the stars.53 In the My steri es of Mi thras, as al ready ment ioned, the init iate represent ing Mit hras stood in t he middle of a circle of 12 dancers represent ing the si gns of the zodi ac.54 The Acts of John describes the disciples ho lding hands in a circle around Jesus in similar fashio n. Jesu s sings and in response the disciples intone the sacred word: 'Amen.' Jesus teaches that in this 'round dance' he reveals 'the passio n' and desires that it is 'called a Mystery'.55 As one scho lar notes, the round dance 'is evident ly so me echo of the Myster ies, and the ceremony is that ofa sacred dance init iat ion'.56 In the hymn acco mpanying the dance init iat ion t hree voices can clearly be distinguished: Christ, who is the init iator or hierophant, his assistants and the candidate for init iation. In the fo llowing extract the voices have been allocated to one of these three figures to clearly demo nstrate the init iatory nature of the text:57 Ini tiate : 'I would be saved.' Chr ist: 'And I would save.' Assistants : 'Amen.' Ini tiate : 'I would be freed .’ Chr ist: 'And I would free .’ Assistants : 'Amen .’ Ini tiate : 'I would be pierced .’ Chr ist: 'And I would pierce .’ Assistants : 'Amen .’ Ini tiate 'I would be born .’ Chr ist: 'And I would bring to birth .’ Assistants : 'Amen .’ Ini tiate 'I would eat .’ Chr ist: 'And I would be eate n.’ Assistants : 'Amen .’ Ini tiate : 'I would hear .’ Chr ist: 'And I would be heard .’ Assistants : 'Amen .’ Chr ist: 'I am a lamp to thee who beho ldst Me .’"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Assistants : 'Amen .’ Chr ist 'I am a mirror to thee who perceivest Me .’ Assistants : 'Amen .’ Chr ist: 'I am a d oor to thee who knockest at Me .’ Assistants : 'Amen .’ Chr ist: 'I am a way to thee, a wayfarer .’ Assistants : 'Amen .’ Chr ist: 'Now respond thou to my dancing. See thy self in Me who speaks, -and when thou hast seen what I do, keep silence on My Mysteri es.’58 SECRET MYSTERIES The Pagan Mysteries contained both 'exoteric/ or 'outer' Mysteries which were open to all, and 'esoteric ’or 'inner ’Mysteri es which were revealed only to the chosen few who had undergone a lengthy peri od of purificat ion and spiritual prep arati on. Cl ement tells us that in early Christ ianit y there were likewise 'Lesser Mysteries' for beginners on the spiritual path and 'Greater Mysteries' which were a secret higher knowledge which led to full 'init iat ion'.59 'The secret tradit ions of true Gn osi s/ he explains, had been transmitted 'to a small number, by a successio n of masters, and not in writ ing'.60 Ori gen recognizes that in having Outer Mysteries and Inner Mysteries Christ ianit y was follo wing the example of Paganism. He writes: “'The exist ence o f certain doctrines which are beyond those which are openly taught and do not reach the mult itude is not a peculiarit y o f Chr istianit y only, but is shared by the philosophers. For they had so me d octrines which were exoteric and so me esoteric .’61 Like Pagan init iates, Gnostic init iates were required to keep the Inner Mysteries a profound secret. The heresy -hunter Hippo lyt us tells us that the fo llo wers o f the Gnostic sage Basilides 'may not speak of their Mysteries aloud, but must preserve them in sile nce'.62 Indeed, they were requi red to undergo an init ial five -year period of silence, just as were init iates in the Pythagorean school s of the Pagan Mysteries.63 The Book of the Great Logos instructs: 'These Mysteries are to be guarded with utmost secrecy , and revealed to none who are unworthy , - neither to father or mother, to sister nor brother, nor to any rel ative; neit her for meat nor drink, neit her for woman nor gold nor silver nor anyt hing in this world .’64 Clement wri tes: 'It i s not wished that al l things should be exposed indiscriminately to all and sundry, or the benefits of wisdo m co mmu nicated to those who have not even in a dream been purified in soul. Nor are the Mysteries of the Logos to be expounded to the profane .’65"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Another Gnostic sage d emands: 'If yo u wish to know what eye has not seen or ear heard, and what has not entered the heart of man, the One who is high above all good things, swear to keep secret the My steri es of the teaching. This is the oath: \"I swear by the One above all, the Good, to keep these Mysteries and to tell them to no one and not to return fro m the Good to the creation .’66 According to Clement, Mark did not preach only the familiar gospel in the New Testament, but three different gospels suitable for different level s of init iat ion. The New Testament Gospel of Mark contains thoughts suitable for beginners in the faith. But Mark also wrote a Secret Gospel to be used by those who were being 'perfected ’or 'init iated'.67 Clement records that Mark had wri tten both of thes e gospels in Alexandria, where they were still kept. The teachings of The Secret Gospel of Mark were regarded as so secret that Clement advises one of his students that its existence should be denied, 'even under oath', for 'not all true things are to be s aid to all men' and 'the light of the truth should be hidden from those who are mentally blind'. According to Clement, the Secret Gospel recorded 'things suitable to whatever makes for progress towards Gnosis'. Even in this 'more spiritual gospel', however , Mark still did not 'divulge the things not to be uttered, nor did he write down the esoteric teaching of the Lord, but to the stories already wri tten he added yet others and, moreover, brought in certain sayings, the interpretation of which he knew would lead the hearers into the innermost sanctuary of that truth'.68 Only to his closest students did Mark convey further oral teachings which imparted Gnosis. This final gospel was so myst ical that it could not be written down at all. The fragments that rema in o f T he Secret Gospel of Mark illuminate the meaning of so me otherwi se bizarre passages in the New Testament. They include an account of Jesus raising a young man from the dead. Scho lars have speculated that this is an early versio n of the story of Jesus rai sing Lazarus from the dead in the Gospel of John.69 In the Secret Gospel this story is immediately followed by the init iat ion of the risen young man. For the Gnostics being raised fro m t he dead is clearly an allegory for spiritual rebirth through init iation. This suggests that the tale of Lazarus being raised fro m t he dead in the Gospel of John was also originally an allegory for init iation.70 This would explain the curious passage in the Gospel o f Jo hn in which Thomas, rather than offering to go and he lp Jesus raise Lazarus fro m t he dead as one might expect, instead suggests to the disciples, 'Let us also go and die with him'!71 If the Lazarus story were originally an init iat ion allegory , like the story in The Secret Gospel of Mark, Thomas' otherwise inexplicable words would beco me meaningful. Thomas is in fact exhorting the other disciples to go and be init iated -to 'di e and resurrect' like Lazarus. In The Secret Gospel o f Mark, the youth about to be init iated com es to Jesus wearing only a linen cloth over his naked body. That night, we are told, 'Jesus taught him the Mystery of the Kingdom o f God/ This illuminates another bizarre incident in the Gospel of Mark. After the betray aland arrest of Jesus at night in the garden of Gethsemane Mark records: 'Amo ng those who fo llo wed Jesus was a young man with nothing on but a linen cloth . They tried to seize him, but he slipped out of the linen cloth and ran away naked.'72"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"This strange character appears nowhere else in the New Testament. Many readers down the centuri es must have wondered about the ident it y o f this naked young man and what he was doing withJesus and the disciples. The Secret Gospel suggests that he was a candidate for init iat ion. KNOWLEDGE BEYOND BELIEF The Greek philosopher Heraclitus writes, 'Human opinio ns are toys for children .’73 The sages of the Pagan Mysteries were disparaging about mere beliefs or opinio ns; they were interested in knowl edge. Pl ato argued that belief is concerned only wit h t he appearances of things, while knowl edge penet rates to the underlying realit y.74 The highest level of understanding, he procl aimed, is that knowledge through which the mind beco mes unified wit h t he object of knowl edge.75 The Gnostics inherited these Pagan teachings and were also disparaging of pist is (fait h)in co mpar ison with Gnosis (knowledge). Gnosis is not an idea that is open to doubt, but a myst icalexperience o f the Truth which is immediate, certain and completely non -conceptual . Whilst Literalist Christ ians extolled the spi ritual val ue of blin d fait h and commanded the faithful not to question what they were told by the bishops, the Gnostic masters, like the Pagan sages before them, taught that through init iat ion int o th e Inner Mysteries init iates could direct ly e xperi ence Gnosis and know the Tr uth fo r them selves. For the Gnostics, fait h was only a stepping -stone leading to Gnosis. The Gnost ic t eacher Heracl eon explains that at first people believe through fait h in t he testimo ny o f others, but they need to go on to experience the Truth directly. 76 Clement taught: 'Fait h is the foundation; Gnosis the superstructure.77 By Gnosis faith is perfected78 for to know is more than to believe.79 Gnosis is proof of what has been received through faith .’80 Like the Pagan sages, the Gnostics taught that all doc trines were merely approaches to the Truth, which was itself beyo nd words and concepts, and could only be found through experiencing Gnosis for oneself.81 The Gospel o f Philip explains: 'Names can be very decept ive, for they divert our thoughts fro m w hat is accurate to what is inaccurate. Thus one who hears the word \"God\" does not perceive what is accurate, but does perceive what is inaccurate. So also with \"the Father\" and \"the Son\", and \"the Holy Spirit\", and \"life\" and \"light\", and \"resurrection\", a nd \"the church\", and all the rest -peopl e do not perceive what is accurate, but they perceive what is inaccurate .’82 SELF -KNOWLEDGE The most important injunct ion on the spiritual path of the Pagan Mysteries was inscribed over the sanctuary ofApo llo at Del phi: Gnothi Seauton -'Know Thy Self ’. The Gnosis or Knowledge which init iates of the Pagan Mysteries sought was Self -knowl edge.83 The Gnost ic Book of Tho mas the Contender likewise teaches: 'Whoever has not known himself has known nothing, but he who has known himself has at the sam e t ime already achieved Gnosis about the depth of all things.'84"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"In The Testimo ny of Truth Jesus advises a disciple to become 'a disciple of his own mind ’which is 'the father of Truth'.85 The Gnostic sage Silvanus encourages: 'Knock on yourself as upon a door and walk upon yourself as on a straight road. For if you walk on the road, it is impossible for you to go astray. Open the door for y ourself so that y ou m ay know what is.'86 But what is the self? The Pagan sages taught that every human being has a mortal lower self called the 'eido lon’and an immortal Higher Self called the 'Daemon ’.87 The eido lon is the embodi ed self, the physical body and personalit y.88 The Daemon is the Spirit, the true Self which is each person's spi ritual connecti on to God. The Mysteries were designed to help init iates realize that the eido lon is a false self and that their true ident it y is t he immortal Daemo n.89 From the ei dol on's point of view the Daemon appears to be an independent Guardian Angel .90 Ini tiates who still ident ify wit h t he eido lon, therefore, do not experience the Daemon as their own true Self, but as a spirit guide whose job it is to lead them to their spiritual dest inat ion. Plato teaches, 'We should think of the most authoritative part of the soul as a Guardian Spirit given by God which lifts us to our heavenly ho me. '91 The Gnost ic sages taught exact ly t he same Mystery doctrine.92 Valentinus explains that a person receives Gnosis fro m t heir Guardian Angel, but that this angelic bei ng is actually the seeker's own Higher Self.93 In ancient Egypt the Daemon had for millennia been pictured as a Heavenly Twin o f the eido lon.94 This image is also found in Gnosticism. The Gnostic sage Mani was said to have been conscious of having a protec ting angel fro m t he age of four and, aged 12, to have realized it was his Heavenly Twin, who m he called the 'most beaut iful and largest mirror image of my own person'.95 In The Acts of John, John observes that Jesus sometimes held converse wit h a Heavenly Twin who descended to join him: 'When all o f us, his disciples, were sleeping in one house at Gennesaret, I alone, having wrapped myself up, watched fro m under my garment what he did; and first I heard him say, \"John, go thou to sleep\", and thereupon I f eigned to be asleep; and I saw another like unto him co me down, whom I also heard saying to my Lord, \"Jesus, do they who m t hou hast chosen st ill not believe in thee?\" And my Lord said, \"Thou s ayest well, for they are men.\"’ 96 The Pi stis Sophia relates a c harming myt h of the child Jesus meeting his own Heavenly Twin for the first time. His mother Mary recalls: 'When thou wert a child, before the Spirit had descended upon thee, when thou wert in the vineyard wit h Joseph, the Spirit came down fro m t he height , and came unto me in the house, like unto thee, and I knew Him not, but thought that he was thou. And he said unto me, \"Where is Jesus, my brother, that I may go to meet him?\"'97 Mary relates to Jesus that when his Twin finally fo und him, 'He embraced th ee and kissed thee, and thee also didst kiss him; ye became one and the same being.'98"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The goal of Gnostic init iation was, likewise, to bring the lower self into union wit h t he Higher Self, for it is when they are made one that enlightenment occurs.99 Ire naeus relates that the Gnostic 'believes himself to be neither in heaven nor on earth, but to have embraced his Guardi an Angel'.100 The great Gnostic master Valent inus writes: 'When the human self and the divine \"I\" are interconnected they can achieve per fect ion and eternit y.’101 THE UNIVERSAL DAEMON The quest for Self -knowl edge l eads the Pagan or Gnostic init iate on a remarkable journey o f discovery . At first the init iate experiences themselves as the eido lon, the embodied personalit y, and sees the Daemon as a Guardi an Angel or Heavenly Twin. The more mature init iate experiences the Daemon as their own Higher Self. To those blessed wit h t he final visio n of com plete Self -knowl edge or Gnosis, the Daemon is found to be more awesome st ill. It truly is the 'div ine \"I\" ', as Valent inus puts it. Alt hough it appears as if each person has their own Daemon or Higher Self, the enlightened init iate di scovers that actually there is one Daemon shared by all -a universal Self which inhabits every being. Each soul is a pa rt of the one Soul of God.102 To know oneself therefore is to know God. These myst ical teachings are found both in the Pagan Mysteries and Gnostic Chr istianit y.103 The ancient Pagan teaching 'I am Thou, and Thou art I' is found in the Gnostic text Pistis Sophi a and beco mes in the New Testament Gospel of John 'I in Thou, and Thou in me'.104 The Pagan sage Sextus writes: ‘Ifyou woul d know Him by who m yo u were made, you woul d know yourself ’’105 Similarly , the Christian philo sopher Clement writes: It is the greatest ofall disciplines to know oneself; for when a man knows himself, he knows God .’106 Cl ement taught his Christian init iates to 'practise being God'107 and that the true Gnostic had 'already beco me God ’.108 In a beaut iful statement of the perennial myst ical teachings inherited by Gnostic Chr istianit y fro m t he Pagan Mysteries, the Gnostic sage Monoimos advises: 'Seek Him fro m o ut thy self, and learn who it is that taketh possessio n of everyt hing in thee, saying: \"My God, my spirit, my understanding, my so ul, and my body” and learn whence is sorrow and jo y,and love and hate, and waking though one would not, and sleeping though one would not, and getting angry though one would not, and falling in love though one would not. And if thou shoul dst cl osely invest igate these things , thou wilt find Him in thyself.’ 109 'Gnostic ’means 'Knower', but it is not some piece of spiritual informat ion t hat a Gnostic knows. They know that by which all else is known -the knower, the experiencer, the Higher Self, the divine T, the Daemon. The true Gnostic, like the enlightened init iate of the Pagan Mysteries, discovers that the Daemon is actually the one Soul of the Universe -the Consciousness which inhabits each one of us.110 According to the Pagan and Gnost ic sages wh o have traversed the path of Self -knowl edge to i ts paradoxi cal conclusion, when we finally discover who we are, we discover that there is only God."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"REINCARNATION In the Pagan Mysteries it was believed that a soul progresses towards the realizat ion of Gnos is over many lifet imes.111 The Pagan init iate Pl utarch explains that the unenlightened soul is attracted back into physical incarnat ion over and over again by force of habit: 'We know that the soul is indestructible and should think of its experience as l ike that of a bird in a cage. If it has been kept in the body for a long time and beco me tam ed to thi s life as a result of all sorts of invo lvements and long habituat ion, it will alight again back to a body again birth after birth and will never stop or gi ve up beco ming entangled in the passio ns and chances of this world .’112 Alt hough it was eventually exorcised fro m ma instream Christ ianit y,this Pagan idea was embraced by the early Gnost ic Christians. The Gnostic sage Basilides taught that Gnosis was the consummat ion o f ma ny lives of effort.113 The Secret Book of John teaches that a soul will continue to reincarnate until it is eventually 'saved fro m it s lack of perception, attains Gnosis, and so is perfected ’, af ter whi ch 'it no longer goes into another f lesh'.114 The Pist is Sophia teaches that a soul cannot be brought into the Light until, through many lifet imes of experience, ithas understood all of the Mysteries. Having progressed on the spiritual journey during this life, however, its next incarnation will be into a 'righteous body which shall find the God of Truth and the Hi gher Mysteries'. 115 Plato tells us that the dead have the choice of drinking fro m t he 'Spring of Memory' and wal king the ri ght -hand path towards heaven or drinking fro m t he 'Cup o f Fo rgetting' and walking the left -hand path towards reincarnat ion.116 The Gnostic Book of the Saviour teaches the same doctrine, explaining that a righteous man will be born into his next life wit hout forgetting the wisdo m he has lear ned in this life beca use he will not be given the 'Draught of Oblivio n' before his next birth. Rather he will receive 'a cup full of intuit ion and wisdo m' which will cause the soul not to fall asleep and forget, but to 'seek after the Mysteries of Light, until it hath found them'.117 Plato saw being incarnated in a human body as comparable to being incarcerated in a sort ofpri son.118 The Gnost ic Secret Book of John likewise describes incarnat ion as being 'cast into fetters'.119 Plato explains, 'The soul is suffering the punis hment of sin unt il the penalt y is pai d.'120 Ori gen similarly teaches that incarnat ion is a sort of punishment for having sinned and that in proportion to the sin, souls are put into particular types of bodies. He tells us that souls are 'enveloped in diffe rent bodi es for punishment' many t imes over, until they are purified, when theywill 'rise again to the state in which they formerly were, completely putting away their evil and their bodies'.121 Like the Pagan sages, Origen could not believe that a just a nd com passi on ate God woul d condemn any soul to eternit y in hell, but thought that all souls would be saved through experiencing repeated human incarnat ions.122 He writes: 'Every soul has existed from the beginning; it has therefore passed through some wor lds alr eady , and will pass through others before it reaches the final consummat ion. It com es into this world strengthened by the victories or weakened by t he defeats of its previous life.'123 Despite his great prestige amongst early Christ ians, thi s br illiant Christ ian philo sopher was posthumously condemned by the Catholic Church as a heret ic fo r teaching this ancient"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"doctrine.124 Yet the teachings of reincarnat ion are alluded to in the New Testament.125 In the Gospel ofJohn the high priests of Jerusalem ask John the Baptist if he is a reincarnat ion of Elijah,126 while in the Gospel o f Mark the disciples discuss the possibilit y o f Jesus being the reincarnat ion of John the Baptist, the prophet Elijah or one of the other prophets!127 SEXUAL EQUALITY In the P agan Mysteries init iat ion was open to all, regardless of sex. Dionysus' most int imate disci ples were ecstatic women fo llo wers called the maenads and in Italy the Mysteries of Dionysus were ent irely run by wo me n.128 Under the o ld Greek Olympian religio n wom en were condemned to live wit hin four walls carrying out househo ld chores, but with the coming of the rites of Dionysus, 'they ran wild in the woods!129 There were many famous priestesses and prophetesses of the Pagan Mysteries: the great myst ical poet Sa ppho and her sisters on Lesbos, who were priestess in the Mysteries of Adonis; Diotima, the priestess who taught Socrates; and the Pythoness, the oracular priestess at Delphi whose advice was sought by the powerful statesmen and famous philosophers of the ancient worl d. The Christ ian Clement of Alexandria compiled a list of Pagan wo me n whose achievements he admired.130 As well as famous women poets and painters, he ment ions philosophers such as Arignote, Themisto and others, including two who studied wit h P lato and one trained by Socrates.131 The Py thagoreans were famous for giving freedo m and respect to women.132 Ancient Py thagorean texts often stress the equal status of women and men.133 According to Aristoxenus, Py thagoras got most of his ethical lore fr om a pri estess of Delphi called Themistoclea. In his letter to the women of Croton, Py thagoras says expressly that 'Wo me n as a sex are more naturally akin to pi ety.’134 It was to a woman, his daughter Damo, that he entrusted his writ ings. A wo ma n disciple ofPy thagoras called Arignote was the author of a book called The Rites of Dionysus and other philo sophical works.135 Like thei r Pagan predecessors, the Gnostics also honoured women and considered them equal to m en. After all, in the gospels Jesus is port ray ed as vio lating Jewish convent ion by talking openly wit h women, whom he included amongst his close co mpanio ns, and it is* women who first discover the risen Christ.136 Clement teaches: In Christ there is neither male nor female/ explaining that the term 'humanit y' is co mmo n to both men and women. In Gnostic gospels female figures, particularly Mary Magdalene, play central roles. In the Dialogue of the Saviour Mary is portrayed as 'a woman who had understood completely' and withwho m Jesus had a particul arly close rel ationship.137 A wise Mary Magdalene is often portrayed in conflict with a foolish and misogynous Peter.138 In the Pistis Sophia Peter com plains that Mary is dominat ing the conversation with Jesus and displacing his own rightful pri ori tyand t hat of the other male apostles. He urges Jesus to silence her, but Jesus rebukes him. Later Mary admi ts to Jesus that she hardly dares speak freely because 'Peter makes me hesitate; I am afraid of him, because he hates the female race'. Jesus replies that whoever the Spirit inspires is divinely ordained to speak, whether man or woman.139 Irenaeus records with irritat ion t hat women were particularly attracted to Gnostic Chr istianit y.140 This is not surprising since amongst Gnostics women enjo yed posit ions o f leadership and spiritual authority, unlike in the Lit eralist Church, where they were regarded as second -class human beings. 141 Irenaeus is appalled that the Gnostic sage Marcus encouraged wom en to act as priests in celebrating the Eucharist 142 whilst Ter tullian co mp lains bitterly about 'those women amo ng the heret ics' who hold posit ions o f authorit y and is enraged that 'they teach,"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"theyengage in discussio n,-theyexorcise, -theycure'.

The ultimate aim of the Mysteries was spiritual liberation, not moral servitude. Irenaeus co mp lains that the Gnostics likewi se claimed that 'Act ions are not good or bad in t hemselves, but only in accordance wit h human convent ions' and implies that the Gnostics' spi ritual freedo m was actually just an excuse for licent iousness.145 He writes: 'They maintain that they have attaine d to a height beyo nd every power, and that therefore they are free in every respect to act as they please, having no one to fear in anything. For they claim that because of the redempt ion t hey cannot be apprehended, or even perceived, by the judge/146 Thro ugh myst ically experiencing the true God of Jesus, the Gnostics claimed that theywere 'redeemed' or 'released' fro m t he power of the tyrannical Jehovah and all the rules and regulat ions he had imposed on the Jews. In the Gnostic init iat ion process the ini tiate ri tually declared his independence fro m t he false god.147 According to the Gnostic sage Simo n Magus, init iates who had escaped from Jehovah's power and come to know the true Father were 'free to live as they please'.148 As one modern authority puts it: 'Basilides and his successor Valent inus, the great Gnostic masters of Alexandria, favoured a strict amoralit y: the only rule was that there are no rules. If, as many init iates preferred, one's bent was ascet ic, that was fine; if one was completely pro miscuous, that was also fine.'149 Nei ther the sages of the Pagan Mysteries nor the Cnrist ian Gnostics were actually preaching immoralit y, however. They were both simply acknowledging that there was a spiritual understanding deeper than an externally impos ed set of ethical rules, and that human beings who were in touch with their divine nature would act intuit ively and spontaneously in harmony wit h the who le o f life. The Gnost ic sage Basilides explains that 'spiritual' Christ ians are moral simply 'by nature '.150 Obeying moral codes may be a part of the journey o f purificat ion t hat leads to Gnosis, but having arrived, all ethical rules can be abandoned as the init iate will naturally act well -although not necessarily convent ionally!151 Clement wri tes: 'De fini te outward observances cease to have any value for one whose whole being is brought into an abiding harmo ny with that which is eternal; he has no wants, no"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"passio n; he rests in the contemplat ion of God, which is and will be his unfailing blessedness.15 2 All the action, then, ofa man possessed of Gnosis is right action, -and that done by a man not possessed of Gnosis is wrong action, though he observe a plan. ’153 CONCLUSION The Gnost ics present a picture of early Christ ianit y startlingly different fro m t hat bequeathed to us by the Roman Church. We have already seen that the story of Jesus and the teachings he gives in t he New Testament are prefigured by the myt hs and teachings o f the ancient Pagan Mysteries. In Gnosticism we find many other elements wh ich were central to the Mysteries but are missing in Christianit y a s we know it today -the quest for Gnosis, the role of the goddess, the importance ofwom en, the Daemon/eido lon doctrine, and so on. Let's review some of these remarkable similarit ies betwe en Gnostic Christ ianit y a nd the Pagan Mysteries: • Literalists accused the Gnost ics of preaching Pagan doctrines. • Gnostics taught Pagan philosophy, venerated pictures of the Pagan philosophers alongsi de pictures ofJesus, invited Pagans to Gnostic gathe rings and were even init iated into the Pagan Mysteri es. • Gnostic texts contain Pagan myt hical mot ifs which theyclaimed taught a universal philosophy. • Gnostics equated Jesus wit h 'many shaped Attis' and oth er pseudonyms for Osiris -Dionysus. • As in the Pagan Mysteries, the Gnostic Christ ians honoured the Divine Feminine in the form ofthe goddess Sophia. • Like the sages o f the Pagan Mysteries, the Gnostics were crit ical of the orthodox Chr istians' anthropom orphi c picture of God. They called the Jewish g od Jehovah a false god and taught that Jesus was the Son ofthe true ineffable God. This indescribable ult imate Oneness was identical withthe supreme God of Plato and the Pagan Myst eri es. • The Gnostic Jesus is like a Pagan hierophant who init iates his di sciples into the My steri es though dance and song. • Gnostics taught that Chr istianit y, like the Pagan Mysteri es, had Outer My steri es for beginners in t he fait h and Inner Mysteries for the init iated. • Just as in the Pagan Mysteries, Christ ian init iates of the Inner Mysteries were sworn to secrecy. • Clement tells us that Mark preached three different gospels for three different levels of init iat ion. Hi s gospel in t he New Testament was designed 'for beginners'. The Secret Gospel was for those being 'perfecte d'. A further oral gospel revealed Gnosis. • As in the Pagan Mysteries, the goal of Gnosticism was the experi ence of Gnosis, or 'Knowl edge', which was contrasted with mere fait h or belief. • Like the Pagan sages, the Gnostics taught 'Know Thy elf as the me ans of coming to know God. • As in the Pagan Mysteries, the Gnostics taught the doctrine o f the Daemon (Heavenly Twin or Higher Self) and the eido lon ( lower self). • As in the Pagan Mysteries, the Gnostics taught that the Daem on at first appears to be a Gu ardi an Angel, then is experienced as the init iate's own Higher Self and finally is realized to be the Mind o f God in all things. • As in the Pagan Mysteries, the Gnostics taught the doctrine o f reincarnat ion. • As in the Pagan Mysteries, in Gnosticism wo me n played a prominent role."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"• Both Pagan and Gnosti c sages were accused of condoning immoralit y w hen actually they were both preaching the same myst ical doctrine of natural mo ralit y.

It seem ed too incredible to be true, but we did not feel it could be rul ed out. We therefore decided to take a closer look at exactly how the Gnostics saw the Jesus story .

The Gnostic Christ ians, likewise, did not regard their gospels as historical records, but works of allegorical literature encoding eternal truths that could be creat ively developed and refined. Indeed, Gnostic init iate s were expected to interpret the myt hs and teachings they received in their own unique way to show that they had personally experienced Gnosis and were not simply repeat ing, parrot -fashio n, what they had been told by someone else. Tertullian com plains: 'Every one of them, just as it suits his own temperament, modifies the traditions he has received, just as the one who handed them down modified them, when he shaped them according to his own will.'2 Irenaeus is likewise appalled, fuming: They all generate som ething new each day; for no one is considered init iated or mature among them unless he develops so me enormous fict ion!'3 The Gnost ics explained that their spiritual creativit y came fro m d irect personal contact with the 'Living One'. They argued that i t is ul timately only through one's own experience that one can judge what is true and that therefore, personal experience must take precedence over all second - hand testimo ny and tradition. MYTHICAL ALLEGORIES In the Pagan Mysteries the secret Inner Mysteri es revealed the allegorical meaning of the myt hs ofthe Outer Mysteries. Likewise, the Gnostics claimed that they taught secret Inner Mysteries which revealed Gnosis, for which the Outer Mysteries of Christ ianit y w ere only a preparati on. When Literalist C hristians poured scorn on the very idea that there were secret Christ ian teachings, Gnostics pointed to the example of Jesus, who in public spoke in parables and in private revealed the meaning of these allegories to his closest disciples.4 In Mark, for ex ample, we read: 'And he said to them, \"Things are hidden only to be revealed, and made secret only to b e brought to light. If any have ears to hear, let them hear.\" And he kept speaking to them in allegories, according as they could hear, and he said noth ing to them without allegori es, but privately to his own students he always gave the key .'5"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"The idea that myst ical teachings could be encoded in myt hical stories was at the heart of the Pagan Mysteries. Philo, a Jewish Pythagorean, calls allegory 'the met hod of the Greek Mysteri es'.6 The Pagan philosopher Demetrius writes: 'What is clear and manifest is easily despised like naked men. Therefore the Mysteri es too are ex pressed in the form of allegory.’ 7 Macrobius, likewise, explains: 'Plain and naked ex posi tion of herself is repugnant to Nature. She wishes her secrets to be treated by myt h. Thus the Mysteries themselves are hidden in the tunnels o f figurative expressio n, so that not even to init iates the nature of such realit ies may present herself naked , but only an elit e may know about the real secret, through the interpretation furnished by wisdom, while the rest may be content to venerate the My stery , def ended by those figurat ive expressio ns against banalit y.’8 This Pagan allegorical approach towards sacred scripture was enthusiast ically embraced by Gnostic Christ ians. The Gnostic Gospel of Philip teaches the same doctrine as Macrobius: 'Truth did not com e into the world naked, but in images. One will not receive truth in any other way/9 Literalist Ch ristians, on the other hand, took scripture as historical fact. The Pagan sat irist Celsus is astonished at such naivete and demo lishes a literal interpretation of the Biblical story of creati on wi thcharacteri stic wit: 'God banishes man fro m t he garden ma de specifically to c ontain him. Silly as that may be, sillier still is the way the world is supposed to have co me about. They allot certain days to creation, before days existed. For when heaven had not been made, or the earth fixed or the sun set in the h eavens, how could days exist? Isn't itabsurd to think that the greatest God pieced out his work like a bricklayer, saying, \"Today I shall do this, tomorrow that,\" and so on, so that he did this on the thi rd, that on the fourth, and something else on the f ifth and sixth days! We are thus not surprised to find that, like a co mmo n workm an, thi s God wears himself down and so needs a ho liday after six days. Need I comment that a God who gets tired, works with his hands, and gives orders like a foreman is not ac ting very much like a God?'10 Like Celsus, Gnostic Christ ians viewed such lit eralism as superficial and simple -minded.

He wri tes: 'What man of sense will agree with the statement that the first, second and third days, in which the evening is named and the morning, were without Sun, Moon and Stars, and the first day wi thout a heaven?

He quotes as an example the story o f Jesus being tempted by the Devil. Jesus is taken up a high mountain where he is shown all the kingdo ms of the world, which the Devil o ffers him if he will only fall down and worship him. Origen pours scorn on the idea that anyo ne coul dactually see all the kingdo ms ofthe world fro m t he top of a mountain and affirms that this is meant to be understood allegori cally . He tells us: ‘The careful reader will detect thousands of other pa ssages like this in the gospels.’ 14 Clement al so regard ed the true Christ ian as 'the Gnostic ’who can penetrate to the allegori cal meaning of scripture by understanding 'the invo lut ions of words and the solut ions of enigmas'.15 He teaches that the init iate who has experienced Gnosis grasps the complete truth, piercing to the depths of scripture of which the 'believer' tastes only the surface.16 In thi s spirit, Gnostics did not interpret the Jesus story literally as an historical account, but as a spiritual allegory encoding profound myst ical teachings. In a te xtcalled The Travels o f Peter Jesus himself is made to decode some of the allegorical teachings hidden in the accounts of his crucifixio n. He explains: 'The Logos is symbo lised by that straight stem on which I hang. The cross -piece ofthe cross represent s that human nature which suffered the fault of change in the first m an, but by the help of God -and -ma n, received again its real mind. Right in the centre, joining twain in one, is set the nail of discipline, conversio n and repentance.'17 SACRED MATHEMATIC S The immense challenge we face today in attempting to decode both the myt hs of the Pagan Mysteri es and the Jesus story can only be understood when the complexit y a nd subt lety o f the code i s appreciated. The Gnostics, like their predecessors the Py thagorea ns, not only used symbo ls and images, but also numbers and mathemat ical formulae to encode their myst ical teachings. Mathematics and geometry were regarded by the Pagan sages as sacred sciences that reveal the workings of the Mind of God. Pythagoras called numbers 'immortal gods'.18 Over Plato's Academy were written the words 'Let no man who knows no mathemat ics enter here'.19 The Literalist Christian Hippo lyt us calls the Gnostics 'disciples of Pythagoras and Plato' and accuses them o f likewise taking 'ari thmetical science' as 'the fundamental principle of their doctrine'.20 Clement was fascinated by Pythagorean mathematics and even applied the ratios revealed in the mathemat ical laws underlying harmo ny in music to the interpretation of scri pture.21 The Gno stic sage Mono imo s instructed his students in the sacred mathemat ics o f"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Plato and Py thagoras.22 Gnostics used the image of the heavens divided into seven spheres, form ing a sort of myst ic ladder composed of an octave o f e ightgates which the init iate could ascend, which is identical to teachings found in the Pagan Mysteries.23 Scho lars have concluded that Gnostic gospels such as the Pist is Sophia and the Book of Ieou, rather than being compendiums o f myst ifying nonsense, are actually based on a sophist icat ed form of number symbo lism.24 One central element in this symbo lism is gematria - the expression o f nu mbers and mathematical relat ionships through words. In the ancient Greek alphabet, each letter also signified a number. Thus any word also had a numeric al value and could be used to convey mathemat ical information. The Greek names ofthe gods were more than just words, their numerical values were also significant. For example, in it s mo st commo n Greek spelling, the name of the Pagan godman Mit hras express es '360', which in some places was regarded as the number of days in a year. Several ancient writers deliberately add an extra letter, however, to make the name's numerical value equal 365, the mo re accurate reckoning of the so lar year.25 Thus, as St Jerom e po int s out, Mi thras is numerically revealed as a solar deit y. Gem atri a was also adopted by the Gnostic Christ ians. Gnostic myt h even represents the youthful Jesus instructing scho lars at the Jerusalem Temple in the myst ical meaning of the Greek alphabet !26 Like the Pagan Mit hras, the name of Abraxas, the Gnostic so lar divinit y, also expresses the number 365. The most striking example of Christ ian gematria, however, is the name 'Jesus' itself. ’ The early Christ ians maintained that 'Iesous', the original Greek name we translate as 'Jesus', was 'a name above all names'.27 Origen boasted that it possesses more magical efficacy than the names of the Pagan divinit ies.28 It is well known that according to the Revelat ion of John the number of the 'Beast' is 666. 29 What is less well known is that according to gematria, the Greek name 'Iesous' (J esus) expresses the number 888: I E S O U S 10+8+ 200+ 70+400+200 = 888 This number was regarded as sacred and magical by the ancients for a number of reasons, including th e fact that if all the numbers associated with each o f the 24 letters in the Greek alphabet are added together they come t o 888. It is surely also significant that in musical harmo ny, which for the Pythagoreans was a sacred science, 666 is the string ratio ofthe perfect fift h and 888 is the string ratio of the whole tone .31 The fact that Jesus' name equals 888 is no lucky accident. The Greek name 'Iesous' is an artificial and forced transliteration of the Hebrew name 'Joshua' which has been deliberately constructed by the gospel wri ters to m ake sure that it expresses this symbo lically significant number.32 Even Literalists are aware of the number symbo lism o f Jesus' name. Irenaeus states: ‘Iesous is a name arithmet ically symbo lical, consisting of six let ters, as is known by all those that belo ng to the called.'33 Other names in the Jesus story also have significance when translated into numbers using gem atri a. Jesus gives his disciple Simo n t he name 'Cephas', meaning 'Rock ’, of ten translated as 'Peter'. In the original Greek Cephas expresses 729, which was an important number to Pagans."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Plutarch, a priest of Apo llo at Del phi , notes that 729 is a number of the sun, being the number of days and nights in a year.

Both these stories encode sacred mathemat icalformu lae understood by the init iated as revealing esoteric teachings. The New Testament stories of the feeding o f the 5,000 and the 4,000 have also been shown to yield myst ical geo met rical diagrams. This is clearly hinted at in Mark's gospels, where an impat ient Jesus leads his disciples through what he clearly intends to be some myst ical mathemat ical puzzle that, alas, his disciples do not understand: 'Jesus said, \"Though you have eyes, you do not see, and though you have ears, you do not hear! Don't you re me mber, when I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basket fuls o f scraps you cleared away?\" They said unto him, \"Twelve.\" \"And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls ofscraps did you clear away?\" And they said, \"Seven.\" And he said to them, \"And you still don't understand?!\" 36 It would seem that, like his confused disciples in the story, the Christian Church has failed to understand for 2,000 years that what it has taken as literal events are in fact car efully constructed myst ical allegories. Wit h t he destruction o f the Inner Mysteries o f the Gnostics, the keys to decode the allegories have been lost and we can only guess at much of the profound metaphor at work in the Jesus story. JESUS THE DAEMON For Gn ostics, the godman Jesus symbo lized the Daemon, the immortal Self. Often the eido lon, the incarnate self, is represented in Gnostic myt hs by Jesus' 'twin brother' Tho ma s. In The Book ofTho mas the Contender Jesus (the Daemon) teaches his disciple and twin brother Thomas (the eidol on): 'Brother Thomas, while you have time in the world, listen to me, and I will reveal to y ou the things y ou have pondered in your mind. Now since it has been said that you are my twin and true companio n, examine yourself and lea rnwho y ou are, i n what way you exist, and how you will come to be. Since you will be called my brother, it is not fitting that you be ignorant of yourself. And I know that you have understood, because you have already understood that I am the knowledge of the truth. So while you accompany me, although you are uncomprehending, you have in fact already come to know, and you will be called \"the one who knows himself\". 37 It was a widespread tradit ion amongst early Christians that Jesus had a twin brother who resembled him in every detail. This caused Literalists a great many problems, as the obvious"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"obj ect ion to thei r cl aims that Jesus had literally resurrected from the dead was that his twin brother had been crucified in his place. This has led some scho lars to concl ude that this legend must be based on historical fact, for 'what Christ ian would have been foolish enough to invent such a legend, seeing that it is most apt to undermine the very basis o f the orthodox tradit ion concerning the resuscitat ion of Jesu s?'38 The answer is that the Gnostics invented the tradition of Jesus' twin brother as an allegory for the ancient Daemon/eido lon doctrine. The authorship of The Gospel of Tho mas is attributed to Didymos Judas Tho mas. The Aramaic name Tho mas and the Greek name Didymos both mean 'twin'. The author's name is thus 'Judas the twin'.3 9This suggests that in the original Jesus story, Judas the betrayer of Jesus symbo lized the eido lon which betrays the Daemon. Another encoded reference to the Daemon/eido lon doct rine in the New Testament is during Matthew's account of Jesus' trial, when Pontius Pilate offers to spare one of two Jesuses - either Jesus Messiah or Jesus Barabbas.40 One Jesus is an innocent man who is murdered and the other a murderer who goes free. Th ese two Jesuses symbo lize the Higher Self and lower self in each human being. ILLUSIONISM The Pagan Daemo n/eido lon doctrine casts light on the otherwise baffling Gnost ic t eaching known as 'Docetism' or 'Illusio nism'.41 The opponents of Gnosticism have port ray ed this as a rather strange belief that Jesus did not actually have a flesh and blood body, but only seemed to'exist physically, and that he magically made it appear as if he was dying on the cross although in realit y he was not. As usual, however, by t aking the Gnostics literally, the Literalists com pletely miss the point. The Gnost ic I llusio nist' view of the crucifixio n was not meant to be taken as an historical account of events. It is a myt h which encodes the perennial myst ical teachings that a huma n being is made up of two parts: an earthly part which suffers and dies (the eido lon), and an eternal spi ritual witness (the Daemon) which is untouched by suffering and experiences this world as a passing illusion. A Letter of Peter to Philip explains tha t al though from the time of his incarnat ion Jesus suffered, yet he suffered as one who was 'a stranger to this suffering'.42 This teaches that the incarnate Higher Self (represented by Jesus) seems to suffer when the eido lon suffers, but in realit y is alwa ys the untouched witness. In The Acts of John Jesus explains: 'You heard that I suffered, but I suffered not. An unsuffering one was I, yet suffered. One pierced was I, yet I was not abused. One hanged was I, and yet not hanged. Blood flowed fro m me, yet did not flow .’43 How i s it that Jesus can both suffer and not suffer? Because, as he explains, 'I dist inguish the man fro m myself.’ 44 He ident ifies with his transcendent Higher Self, the Daemon, not his suffering lower self, the eido lon. The purpose of G nostic init iat ion was to free init iates from all suffering through the realizat ion t hat thei r true i dent it y is no t th e eido lon bound to the cross of matter, but the Daemon which wit nesses life as a passing illusio n.45 Thus the Gnostic Jesus teaches: 'Had you known how to suffer, you would have been able not to suffer. See through suffering, and you will have non -suffering.’ 46"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"So, the eido lon of Jesus seems to suffer and die, but the real Jesus -the Daemon -cannot suffer or di e.47 Five hundred years prev iously Euri pides portrayed King Pentheus as binding Dio nysus, while actually he was not. As Dionysus says: 'There I made a mockery o f him. He thought he was binding me; But he neit her held nor touched me, save in his deluded mind .’48 In The Apocalypse o fPeter, Peter sees Jesus 'glad and laughing' on the cross while the nails are bring driven into his hands and feet, and Jesus explains: 'He who m yo u see on the tree, glad and laughing, this is the living Jesus. But this one into whose hands and feet they drive nails is his fleshy part, which is the subst itute being put to shame, the one who came into being in his likeness. But look at him and me .’49 In some Pagan myt hs it is no t the godm an who suffers and dies, but a substitute figure who represents the e ido lon. In The Bacchae, King Pentheus, whose name means 'Man o f Suffering', is rai sed up on a tree and torn to shreds in the place of Dio nysus.50 Similarly, in certain Gnostic my ths it is S imo n o f C yrene who dies on the cross, while Jesus watches laughing from a distance.5 1In The Second Treatise of the Great Seth, Jesus explains: 'It was another, Simo n, who bore the cross on his shoulder. It was another upon who m t hey placed the crown of thorns. But I was rejo icing in the height and laughing at their igno rance .’52 Simo n of Cyrene, like King Pentheus in the Pagan versio n of the myt h, represents the eido lon which suffers and dies. The laughing figure of Jesus, like the triumphant Dionysus, represents the Daemon, the witnessing Spirit. The Gnost ic sage Basil ides teaches that 'because he was Mind, Jesus did not suffer' but Simo n of Cyrene suffered in his stead, while Jesus laughed 'because he could not be held and was invisible to air.53 The Gnost ics did not believe that Jesus only seemed to exist, or that he magically avo ided suffering on the cross, or, more sinisterly, that he had himself replaced by Simo n of Cyrene, who was crucified instead while Jesus stood safely at a distance laughing. Such doctrines would, as the Li teralists cl aimed, be distasteful and ridicul ous. But thi s is a misunderstanding (or more likely a conscious distortion!) of Gnost ic t eachings. In fact, 'Illusio nism' is simply part of understanding the crucifixio n story as an init iat ion allegory which encodes the ancient Pagan Daem on/eidol ondoctrine. A fragment of these teachings has survived in the New Testament Gospel of Mark in which Simo n of Cyrene is inexplicably dragooned into carrying Jesus ’cross for him.54 The name Simo n here links this figure symbo lically to th e disciple called Si mo n 'Peter' or 'Rock', who also symbo lizes the eido lon in many Gnostic myt hs. An echo of this Gnost ic doctrine also survives in the Muslim Qur'an which, when dealing withthe supposed death of Jesus, declares:"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"'But they did not kill him, neit her did they crucify him, but a similitude was made for them .'55 THE SPIRITUAL RESURRECTION According to the Pagan sages, we are each made up of a mortal eido lon and the immortal Daem on. If we are alive to our personal identit y as the eido lon, we are dead to our etern al ident it y as the Daemon.56 Init iat ion in t he Mysteries was a way o f br inging the soul back to life. By undergoing the myst ical death of the eido lon t he init iate coul d arise reborn as the Daemon.57 The Gnost ics taught the same Mystery doctrine. The anonym ous teacher of the Gnost ic sage Rheginos explains that ordinary human existence is spiritual death and, therefore, we all need to be 'resurrected from the dead'.58 Just as Pagan init iates who witnessed the grand Mystery pageant at Eleusis metaphorically su ffered with Dionysus and were spiritually reborn, likewise, init iates in the Gnostic Mysteries metaphorically shared in the suffering and triumph o f their godm an Jesus. Rheginos' teacher explains: 'We suffered with him, and we arose with him, and we went to heaven with him. '59 Ini tiates who shared in Jesus' passio n as an allegory for their own myst ical death and resurrection coul d say alo ng with Jesus in the Gospel of John: 'That's why my Father loves me, because I lay down my life to get it back again.' 60 Literalist Christ ians rested their fait h ent irely on the supposed miracle that an historical Jesus had physically co me back fro m t he dead and that this was so me sort of proof that those who believed that Jesus was the Son of God would also be resurrect ed physically at the 'Day o f Judgement'. The Gnost ics, in contrast, called taking the resurrection literally the 'fait h of fools'!61 The resurrecti on, they insisted, was neither an historical event that happened once only to someone else, nor a promise tha t corpses would rise from the dead after some future apocalypse. The Gnostics understood the resurrection as a myst ical experience that could happen to any one of us right here and now through the recognit ion of our true ident it y as the Daemo n.62 For Lite ralists any personal experience o f the resurrection was a distant hope of bodily immortalit y after the Second Coming. The Gnostic Gospel of Philip, however, ridicules such Chr istians, explaining, 'Those who say they will die first and then rise are in erro r' since we shoul d 'receive the resurrection whilst alive'.63 For the Gnostics the resurrection was simply 'the revealing of what truly exists'.64 For init iates with 'eyes to see', therefore, this myst ical resurrection had 'already taken place ’.65 It coul d not possibly be a future event, because it was an awareness of what was real in the present mo ment. An init iate's true identit y d id not beco me t he Daemon through the process of init iat ion. It had always been the Daemo n. The resurrection was actually only a change in awareness. The teacher of Rhegino s procl aims: 'Already you have the resurrection. Consider yourself as risen already.66 Are you -the real you -mere corruption? Why do you not examine your own Self, and see that you have arisen?'67"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The Treat ise of the Resurrect ion t eaches: 'Every thing is prone to change. The world is an illusion! The resurrection is the revelat ion of what is, and the transformat ion of things, and a transit io n int o newness. Flee fro m t he divisio ns and the fetters, and already you have the resurrecti on.'68 Alt hough the Gnostics saw the resurrection as an allegory, they did not see it as unreal. On the contrary , to the init iated the myst ical experience of spiritual resurrect ion was more real than the so-called realit y o f no rm alconsciousness. The teacher of Rheginos explains: 'Do not suppose that resurrection is an illusio n. It is not an illusio n,-rather it is something real. Instead, one ought to maintain that the world is an illusio n, rather than the resurrection.'69 THE SAC RED MARRIAGE An important myt hical mo tif in t he Pagan Mysteries was the sacred marriage between the godm an and the goddess, symbo lizing the myst ical uni on of opposites.70 In Crete they cel ebrated the marriage of the goddess Demeter and the godman Iasio n.71 Upon his yearly 'arrival' in Athens, Dionysus was hailed as 'Bridal One'72 and his marriage to the queen of the city, who represented the goddess, was ritually celebrated.73 In Mystery init iat ions, the init iate was often portrayed as the bride of Osiris -Dionysus. Ini tiations were carried out in special 'bridal chambers' which have been found at Pagan sanctuaries.74 An ancient fresco shows scenes of those preparing for init iation being dressed in the atti re of brides.75 After their init iat ion t hey were hai led as 'brides'.76 The bride represented the incarnate self or eido lon and Osiris -Dionysus represented the disincarnate Self or Daemon. The sacred marriage ritually united these two opposing parts of the init iate. Epi phanius tells us: 'So me prepare a bri dal chamber and perform a mystic rite accompanied by certain words used to the init iated, and they allege that it is a spiritual marriage.'77 The Pagan Mystery mot if o f the sacred marriage is missing fro m o rthodox Christianit y,78 but was important in Gnos tic Christ ianit y,which celebrated the sacred marriage between Jesus and Sophi a. In Gnostic myt h, Sophia is portrayed in a 'fallen' state as represent ing the incarnate self. She is pictured as lost in the world searching for the ineffable Source. Looking f or l ove in all the wrong places, she beco mes a prostitute. Finally she begs God the Father for help and He sends her as a bridegroom the Firstborn Son of God, her brother Jesus.79 When the bridegroom arrives theymake love passio nately to become One.80 Th is is an allegory of the Daemon or Spirit coming to the rescue of the incarnate self or psyche. According to The Gospel of Philip, only the person who has 'remarried7 the psyche wit h the Spirit becomes capable of wit hstanding physical and emotional impulse s that, unchecked, coul d drive them towards self -destructi on and evil.81 The sacred marriage is a symbo l of myst ical unit y,which was the goal of Gnosticism. In The Gospel of Tho ma s Jesus teaches his disciples:"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"'When you make the two one, and when you mak e the outside like the inside, and the above like the below, and when you make the male and the female one and the same, so that the male be not male nor the female female then will you enter the kingdo m.’82 Som e Gnost ics groups ritually celebrated the sa cred marriage as part of their rites of init iation. Irenaeus tells us: They prepare a bridal chamber and celebrate Mysteries/83 The fo llo wers of the Gnostic sage Marcus performed an init iatory rite 'wi thcertain formulae, and they term this a spi ritual mar riage'.84 We are told that the fo llo wers of the Gnostic poet Valentinus practised the rite of a spi ritual marriage with angels in a nupt ial chamber.85 The Naassenes taught that the init iated 'must cast off their garments and all become brides pregnant by t he Virgin Spirit ’.86 The Gospel of Philip explains that the process of init iat ion climaxed in the 'bridal chamber' of myst ical unio n, for 'The ho ly o f the ho lies is the bridal chamber. The redemption takes place in the bridal chamber .’87 In the Jesus story , the fallen Sophia (the psyche) is represented by the figure of Mary Magdalene, who m Jesus (the Daemon) redeems from prostitution.88 According to the Gnostic sage Heracleon, this motif o f a sacred marriage also appears in the Jesus story as the marriage f east in Cana where Jesus, like Dio nysus before him, changes water into int oxicat ing wine. This miracle, Heracleon tells us, symbo lizes that 'divine marriage' which transforms what is merely human into the divine.89 The motif also occurs in a passage fro m t he Gospel ofMatthew in which Jesus explains that reaching the kingdo m o f Heaven will be like a maiden go ing to meet 'the Bridegroom'.90 In The Gospel of Tho ma s Jesus teaches that to experience this final level o f init iat ion int o myst ical unio n, each init iate must enter the bridal chamber alone: 'Many are standing at the door, but it is the so litary who will enter the bridal chamber.'91 BECOMING CHRIST The Pagan sages taught that in the Inner Mysteries an init iate di scovered that what appeared to be their individual Daemo n was actually the Universal Daemo n, which they pictured as having been torn into fragments and distributed amongst all conscious beings. Epictetus teaches: 'You are a fragment torn from God. You have a portion of him within you.'92 Osiris -Dionysus represents this Universal Daemo n, the Mind of God conscious in all living things. In many myths Osiris -Dionysus meets his death by dismemberment.93 This is often taken to mean the threshing of the corn to produce bread and the trampling of grape s to produce wine. Init iates of the Inner Mysteries, however, understood this motif on a more myst ical level, as encoding teachings about the dismemberment of the Universal Daemo n by the power of evil. In the myth o f Osir is, for example, the godman is murd ered and dismembered by his evil brother Set, and then the goddess Isis collects together all of Osiris' limbs and reconst itutes him. This my thencodes the My stery teaching that God needs to be 're -me mbered', that the spiritual path is the process of the r eunit ing the fragments of the Universal Daemo n, of perceiving One in all. Describing Osiris' death, Plutarch writes: 'Set scatters and destroys the sacred Logos which the goddess Isis collects and puts together and delivers to those undergoing init iati on. '94"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"This Pagan motif of dismemberment is completely foreign to Christ ianit y as we now know it, but was fundamental to Gnosticism. Like their Pagan predecessors, Gnostic Christ ians believed each individual human self to be a fragment of one single heavenly being which had been dismembered by evil forces, robbed of all memory of its heavenly origins and forced into individual physical bodies.95 Like the Pagan godman Osiris -Dionysus, the Christ ian godm an Jesus symbo lically represents the Universal Daemon or L ogos which has been dismembered. In the Pistis Sophia, Jesus declares: 'I have torn myself asunder and co me int o th e world .’96 In The Acts of John, he teaches that 'the mult itude that i s about the cross1 represents the 'Limbs o f H im ’ that have yet to be 'g athered together'.97 In The Book of the Logos Jesus says: 'Save all my Limbs, which since the foundation of the world have been scattered abroad, and gather them all together and receive them into the Light.'98 A Gnostic hymn to be sung on the 'great day ofsuprem e init iat ion’, beseeches Jesus: 'Co me u nto us, for we are Thy fello w-me mbers, Thy limbs. We are all one with Thee. We are one and the same, and Thou art one and the same.'99 The Pagan sage Proclus explains that the 'most secret of all init iatio ns’reveals 'the Spirit in us ’as 'a veritable image of Dio nysus ’.100 A Pagan init iate who achieved Gnosis or Self -knowl edge, realized their ident it y as an expressio n of Osiris -Diony sus, the Universal Daemo n. Such an init iate was known in the Mysteries as an 'Osiris ’ or a 'Dionysus’ .101 In the same way, the Gnostic Gospel of Philip teaches that a true Gnostic is 'no l onger a Christ ian, but a Christ’ .102 Ori gen also teaches that a fo llo wer of Jesus could beco me 'a Christ ’.103 In an unt it led Gnostic apocaly pse Jesus calls out to his 'children’ wit h who m he is working unt il 't he Christ’ is form ed wi thin t hem.104 In the Pist is Sophia he teaches that only so meo ne who has beco me a Chr ist will know the supreme Gnosis of the Who le.105 hi a collect ion of Gnostic sa yings, he explains, 'As ye see yourself in water or a mirr or, so see ye Me in yourselves.’ 106 In The Gospel ofPhilip he proclaims: 'You saw the Spirit, you became Spirit. You saw Christ, you became Christ. You saw the Father, you shall beco me t he Father. ’107 This teaching is even found in the New Testament Gospel of Luke, where Jesus promises that 'the init iated student will beco me like his teacher ’.108 A co mmo n phrase in the Pagan Mysteries, often quoted by Plato, was Soma sema, 'The body is a tomb. ’109 Gnosti c init iates also understood that those who identified wit h t he incarnate physical self were spiritually dead and needed to be reborn into eternal Life. Init iates who experienced myst ical resurrect ion realized their true ident ity a s the Christ and d iscovered, like the wom en in the Jesus story, that 'the tomb is empty ’. The body is not their identit y.They are not the ei dol on that lives and dies, but the eternal witness that is forever unborn and undying. LEVELS OF INITIATION Both Pagan and Gnostic ph ilosophical systems described four levels o f hu man ident it y:physical, psycho logical, spiritual and myst ical. Gnostics called these four levels of our being the body, the counterfeit -spi rit, the Spi rit and the Light -power. The body and the counterfeit -spir it(our"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"physical and psycho logical ident it ies) make up the two aspects of the eido lon or l ower self. The Spi rit and Light -power (our spiritual and myst ical ident it ies) make up the two aspects of the immortal Daemo n -the individual Higher Self and the shar ed Universal Self. The Gnost ics called those who ident ified with their body 'Hylics', because they were so utterly dead to spi ritual things that they were like unconscious matter, or hyle. Those who ident ified with their personalit y,or psy che, were known as 'Psychics'. Those who ident ified with their Spi rit were known as 'Pneumat ics', which means 'Spirituals'.110 Those who completely ceased to ident ify wit h any level of their separate ident it y a nd realized their true ident it y as the Chr ist or Universal Da em on experienced Gnosis.111 This myst ical enlightenment transformed the init iate into a true 'Gnostic' or 'Knower'.112 In both Paganism and Christ ianit y t hese levels o f awareness were symbo lically linked withthe four elements: earth, water, air and fire. 113 The init iations leading fro m o ne level to the next were symbo lized by elemental baptisms.114 In The Book of the Great Logos Jesus offers his disciples 'the Mysteries of the three bapt isms' by water, air and fire.115 Baptism by water symbo lizes the tran sformati on of the Hylic person, who ident ifies so lely with the body, into a Psy chic init iate who ident ifies with the personalit y or psy che. Bapt ism by air symbo lizes the transformation of the Psychic init iate into a Pneumatic init iate who identifies with t heir Higher Self. Bapt ism by fir e represents the final init iation which reveals to Pneumat ic init iates their true ident it y as the Universal Daemo n, the Logos, the Christ within, the 'Light -power' -'the true Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world', as John's gospel puts it.116 Such an init iate had realized Gnosis. These, then are the levels o f init iat ion in Gnostic Christ ianit y. LITERAL, MYTHICAL AND MYSTICAL A Pagan init iate of the Outer Mysteries viewed the myt h of Osiris -Dionysus en acted in the Mystery pageant as a marvellous and emotionally compelling spectacle. An init iate of the Inner Mysteri es was instructed in the allegorical meaning encoded in the myt h. A master of the Mysteri es embodied these teachings in their own being. Like wise, a Gnostic init iate's rel ationship with the Jesus story changed as they progressed towards Gnosis. These three levels ofunderstanding can be characterized as literal, myt hical and myst ical: • Literal : Psychic Christ ians had experienced the first bap tism by water and been init iated into the Outer Mysteries of Christ ianit y.They understood the story of Jesus as an historical account ofa person who literally returned from the dead. • My thical: Pneumat ic Christ ians had experienced the second bapt ism of air (ho ly breath or holy spi rit) and been init iated int o the secret Inner Mysteries of Chr istianit y. They understood the Jesus story as an allegori cal myt h encoding teachings about the spiritual path travelled by each init iate. • My stical: Gnosti cs had exp erienced the final baptism of fire and realized their ident it y as the Chr ist (the Logos or Universal Daemo n). They transcended the need for any teachings, including the Jesus story . As Ori gen wri tes:"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"'Very many mistakes have been made, because the right met hod of examining the ho ly t exts has not been discovered by the greater number of readers.'117 The ri ght m ethod, according to Origen, is to understand the three levels on which scripture works. The lowest level is the obvious literal interpretation. The next level, for 'one who has advanced so me what ’, is an allegorical level which edifies the soul. The final level, which reveals Gnosis, is for 'one who is perfected by the spiritual law ’. Ori gen taught that through fo llo wing this threefo ld path, the Chri stian init iate progresses fro m fa it h to Gnosis.118 The pseudo -history ofJesus' life was an essent ial part of the Outer My steri es o f Chr istianit y, which were designed to attract new would -be init iates, so the Gnostics did not necessarily deny the historic it y o f the gospels. But any lit eral int erpretati on of the Jesus story was only the first step presented to spiritual beginners. The true meaning of this myt h was revealed to init iates in the secret Inner Mysteries. Ori gen is dismissive of Literalist Chris tiani tywhich does not progress beyo nd viewing the Jesus story as historical fact, calling it a 'popular, irrational fait h' which leads to 'somat ic Chr istianit y'. As one scho lar remarks: 'He makes it only too clear that by \"so matic Christ ianit y\" he means that f aith which is based on the gospel history. Of teachings founded upon the historical narrative, he says \"What better method could be devised to assist the masses?\" The Gnost ic o r sage no longer needs the crucified Christ. The \"eternal\" or \"spiritual\" Gospel , which is in his possession, \"shows clearly all things concerning the Son of God Himself, both the Mysteries shown by His words, and the things of which His acts were the symbo ls\".'119 The Naassene Gnostics taught that Literalist Christians who und erstood only the Outer My steri es were 'bewitched' by Jehovah the false God, whose spell has the opposite effect of the 'divine enchantment' of the Logos.120 Basilides, likewise, teaches: 'Those who confess Jesus as the crucified one are still enslaved to the God of the Jews. He who denies it has been freed and knows the plan of the unbegotten Father.'121 As Ori gen puts it with startling bluntness: 'Christ crucified is teaching for babes.'122 CONCLUSION For the Gnostics Jesus is a figure who must be under stood on many levels. Since the destruction ofGnosticism we have only been taught the lowest level o f understanding and have been denied access to the secret Inner Mysteries of the Gnostics which reveal the true allegorical nature of the Jesus story . Has this led us to mistake Jesus for an historical figure? Let's examine so me of the evidence again: • As in the Pagan Mysteries, Gnost ics init iated into the Inner Mysteri es understood scri pture as my thical allegory , which coul d be al tered and improved upon, not literal history , which must be preserved intact."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"• Like the Pagan philosophers, the Gnostics used gematria and number symbo lism to encode com plex sacred mathemat ical teachings.

Thi s remarkable fact was even acknowl edged by Literalists. • Like Osiris -Dionysus, Jesus symbo lizes the Daemo n of the init iate. As in Pagan my th, sometimes another figure represent ing the eidol on is symbo lically portray ed as dying the godm an's death as a substitute. • In the same way that the Pagan sages understood the myt hs of Osiris -Dionysus as allegorical teaching stories, so the Gnostics un derstood the Jesus story to be a myst ical init iat ion myt h leading to spiritual resurrection. • As in the Pagan Mysteries, the Gnostics practised a ritual sacred marriage of the Daemo n and eidol on as part of their init iat ions. • Like Osiris -Dionysus, the Gn ostic Jesus represents the universal Daemo n which has been dismembered and needs to be re -me mbered. • Ini tiates in the Pagan Mysteries who realized their true nature as the Universal Daemo n became an 'Osiris1 or a 'Dionysus'.

Seeing the Jesus story as a myt h developed fro m P agan myt ho logyexplained its uncanny resemblances to the myths ofOsiris -Dionysus.

Irenaeus tells us: 'The falsely so -called Gnosis took its beginnings, as one may learn fro m t heir own assert ions, from the fo llo wers of Simo n.’123 Yet Simo n Magus is meant to have been a contemporary o f Jesus and is ment ioned in the Acts of the Apostles.124 More reliable sources suggest that Simo n was a Samaritan who received his"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"education in Alexandria where, according to some scho lars, he was directly influenced by the Jewish Py thagorean Philo.125 Could the original teachings of an historical Jesus really have been so quickly perverted by his contemporary Simo n, as the tradit ional picture requires?

Moreover, the heresy -hunters tell us of a Gnostic sage called Dositheus who was the precursor of Simo n and lived around 100 BCE or earlier!126 If by the evidence of the L iteralists them selves, Gnosticism predates when Jesus is supposed to have lived, how can it have been a later perversion of his teachings? Not only this, but we know that even the name 'Jesus' has been deliberately constructed to equal in gematria the myst icalnumber 888, which strongly suggests it was invented by Gnost ics. Faced with all o f this evidence it seemed to us that we had no choice but to com pletely reverse the tradit ional picture and see Literalism as a degenerate form of the ori ginal 'Jesus Mys teri es' of the Gnostics. A radically new picture of the origins o f C hristianity was emerging, which we called 'the Jesus Mysteries Thesis'. In essence it is this. Nearly all the peopl es around the Medi terranean had at some point adopted the Pagan Mysterie s and adapted them to their own nat ional taste. At some point in the first few centuries BCE a group of Jews had done likewise and produced a Jewish versio n of the Mysteries. Jewish init iates adapted the myt hs of Osiris -Dionysus to produce the story ofa J ewish dying and resurrecting godman, Jesus the Messiah. In time this my thcame to be interpreted as historical fact and Literalist Christ ianit y was the product. These ideas seemed revo lut ionary , but nothing else explained the facts. But before adopting a t heory as radi cal as the Jesus Mysteries Thesis we knew there was more important research to be done. Wasn't there incontrovertible proof that there had been a Jewish teacher called Jesus? If there was then the Jesus story obviously could not be a Jewish ad aptati on of the myt h of Osiris - Dionysus. We therefore began looking for evidence for the existence of Jesus the man. This was someone who had supposedly thrown money -lenders out of the temple in Jerusalem, mir acul ously fed thousands of people and raised th e dead; at his death the who le Earth was said to have quaked and split open, the dead had risen from their graves and a great unnatural darkness had covered the land.127 If he really was more than myt hical, surely so meo ne somewhere would have mentioned it in t he records of the times?"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The Missing Man 'There is nothing more negat ive than the result of the crit icalstudy ofthe life of Jesus.

This image has not been destroyed from without, it has fallen to pieces, cleft and disintegrated by the concrete historical problems which cam e to the surface one after another.'1 Albert Schw eitzer We began our quest for the historical Jesus wit h t he Romans. Jesus is said to have been crucified by t he Rom ans and they were renowned for keeping careful records of all their activit ies, especially their legal proceedings, so we felt we could be optimist ic t hat they woul d ment ion such a celebrated case as that of Jesus. Unfortunately, however, there is no record of Jesus being tried by Pontius Pilate or executed. This was an extremely lit erate peri od in human history. Here is a list of Pagan writers who wrote at or within a century o f the time that Jesus is said to have lived: Arri an Plutarch Silius Italicus Petronius Apo llo nius Au lus Gellius Seneca Pausanias Stati us Dion Pruseus Val erius Flaccus Co lumella Pliny the El der Florus Lucius Ptol emy Appian Quint ilian Dio Chrysostom Juvenal Favorinus Herm ogeones Theon of Smyrna Lucanus Lysias Marti alDamis Val erius Maximus The works of these writers would be enough to fill a library, but not one of them r efers to Jesus. The only Ro ma n writers to ment ion anyt hing o f int erest are Pliny, Suetonius and Tacitus, who were writ ing at the beginning of the second century.2 Pliny , the governor of Bithynia in Asia Minor, wrote a very short passage to the Emperor Tra jan in 112 CE requesting clarification on how to deal with troubleso me Christians.3 The Rom an histori an Suetoni us, in a list of miscellaneous notes on legislat ive matters (between considering the sale of food in taverns and briefly discussing the behaviour ofcharioteers), rel ates that in 64 CE, 'Punishment was inflicted on the Christ ians, a class of men given to a new and wicked superst it ion/4 But all these sources really tell us is that a few Christ ians existed in the Rom an worl d -which is not in doubt -and that they were not considered of any particular importance. They tell us nothing about Jesus himself. Suetoni us also relates that between 41 and 54 CE, the Emperor Claudius expelled the Jews fro m Ro me, 'since the Jews constant ly made disturbances at the inst igat ion of Crestus'.5"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Alt hough Crestus was a popular name, this is often taken as a corruption of 'Christ ’. Even if this were true, however, Christ is simply a Greek translation of 'Messiah' and there were at the time any number of would -be Messiah s rousing the Jews to rebellio n, so the supposit ion t hat any reference to 'Christ' necessarily refers to the Jesus Christ of the gospels is co mp letely unfounded. Anyway, Jesus is not believed to have ever visit ed Rom e. Again, all we are really being told i s that Cl audius had to deal with troubleso me Jews, which was a regular occurrence in Ro ma n history . The Roman historian Tacitus does give us a litt le mo re. Wri ting about the great fire of Rom e in 64 CE, he states that nothing could eliminate the rumour th at Em peror Nero had himself started the blaze, so Nero blamed the Christians: 'Nero fabricated as scapegoats, and punished with every refinement, the notori ously depraved Christ ians (as they were popularly called). Their originator, Chr ist, had been execu ted in Tiberius' reign by the procurator of Judea, Pontius Pilate. But in spite o f this temporary setback the deadly superst it ion had broken out afresh, not only in Judea (where the mischief started) but even in Ro me. All degraded and shameful pract ices co llect and flourish in the capital.'6 The evidence of Tacitus is not contemporary, however, but dates fro m abo ut 50 years after the event. As governor of Asia c.l 12 CE, he must have been familiar with Christ ian 't roubl emakers', as his friend Pliny obvious ly was. The only thing that would make Tacitus' writ ings an independent testimo ny to the existence o f Jesus and not merely the repet ition of Christ ian beliefs woul d be if he had gained his informat ion about Christ being crucified under Pontius Pilate from the copi ous records that the Romans kept of their legal dealings. But this does not seem to be the case, for Tacitus calls Pilate the 'procurator' of Judea when he was in fact a 'prefect', ’so Taci tus is clearly not returning to the records of the time but quoting hearsay informat ion from his own day . Despite their obsessio n with records and histories, that concludes our survey of relevant Rom an texts. However, it could be argued that other Roman literature which may well have ment ioned Jesus has been lost over time. But surely any such texts would have been carefully preserved by the Ro ma n Church once it held power in the Empire. Not only this, but it is safe to assume that well -educated early Christians, such as Just in Martyr, would have quoted these text s in support of Literalist Christ ianit y, but they do not. There are only two credible explanat ions for Jesus' conspicuous absence fro m Ro ma n t exts. Either there simply was no historical Jesus or Jesus seemed of so litt le importance to the Romans that he wa s deemed not worthy of mention. Let us turn, therefore, to Jewish historians. To the Jews Jesus would either have been the long - awai ted Messiah or a blaspheming impostor who stirred up the masses. Either way, so meo ne somewhere should refer to him. JEWISH H ISTORIANS Philo was an eminent Jewish author who lived at the same t ime that Jesus is supposed to have lived and wrote around 50 works that still survive. They deal wit h history , phil osophy and religion, and tell us much about Pontius Pilate -yet make no me ntion at all o f the coming of the Messiah Jesus.8"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Philo 's contemporary, Justus of Tiberias, was a Jew who lived near Capernaum, where Jesus was often said to have stayed. He wrote a history that began with Moses and extended to his own times, but again gave no ment ion of Jesus.9 There is st ill Josephus, however, a younger contemporary o f the apostle Paul. He wrote two famous history books, The Jewish Wars and the monumental Ant iquit ies of the Jews. These two works are our most important sources of infor mat ion on the history of the Jewish people during the first century of the Christ ian era. And here at last, as one might expect, we seem to find the evidence we are looking for. Josephus writes: 'At about this t ime lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one m igh t call him a man. For he was one who accomplished surprising feats and was a teacher of such peopl e as are eager for novelt ies. He won over many o f the Jews and many o f the Greeks. He was the Messiah. When Pilate, upon an indict me ntbrought by the princ ipal men amo ng us, condemned him to the cross, those who had loved him fro m t he very first did not cease to be attached to him. On the third day he appeared to them restored to life, for the holy prophets had foretold this and myriads of other marvels conc erning him. And the tribe of the Christ ians, so called after him, has to this day st ill not disappeared .’10 Josephus also tells us that when the 'miracle worker' was brought before Pilate, he concluded that Jesus was 'a benefactor, not a criminal, or agit ator, or a would -be king'. Josephus relates that as Jesus had miraculously cured Pilate's wife o f a sickness, Pilate let him go. However, the Jewish pri ests later bribed Pilate to allow them to crucify Jesus 'in defiance of all Jewish tradition'.11 As for the resurrection, he tells us that Jesus' dead body could not have been stolen by his disciples, which was a co mmo n argument advanced against Christ ian claims that Jesus miraculously resurrected, since 'guards were posted around his tomb, 30 Romans and 1,0 00 Jews'!12 For hundreds of years these passages in Josephus were seized on by Christ ian historians as conclusive proof that Jesus existed. That is, unt il scho lars began to examine the text a little mo re cri tically . No seri ous scho lar now believes that th ese passages were actually written by Josephus.13 They have been clearly ident ified as much later addit ions. They are not of the same wri ting st yle as Josephus and if they are remo ved from the text, Josephus' original argument runs on in proper sequence. W riting at the beginning of the third century, Origen, who m mo dern authori ties regard as one of the most conscient ious scho lars of the ancient Church, tells us that Josephus did not believe that Jesus was the Christ since he did not believe in any Jewish Me ssiah figure.14 Josephus was in fact a pro -Ro ma n Jew. He was hated by his fellow countrymen as a collaborator, which led him to flee Judea and live in Ro me unt il his death.15 Here he received patronage fro m t wo Em perors and a wealthy Ro ma n aristocrat.16 Josephus does ment ion var ious would -be Jewish Messiah figures -about whom he is ent irely unco mp hmentary . At the time he was writ ing, the long -held belief amo ngst Jews that their God woul d send them the Messiah to free his people fro m o ppression had become an obsession. But Josephus had his own interpretation of what he calls this 'ancient oracle'.17 He did not deny that i t was a divine prophecy, but believed that his fellow Jews had misunderstood it com pletely. According to him, the prophesied ruler of the worl d had co me in t he person of the Rom an Em peror Vespasian, who had happened to be proclaimed Emperor whilst in Judea!18 It is abso lut ely inconceivable that Josephus could have, quite suddenly, broken with his st yle of"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"wri ting, all his philo sophical beli efs and his characterist ic polit ical pragmat ism t o wri te reverent ially about Jesus! Early Christ ians who, like us, searched for historical evidence of Jesus' existence, would have seized on anyt hing written by Josephus as conclusive proof. Yet early Chris tians do not ment ion Josephus. It is not until the beginning of the fourth century that Bishop Eusebius, the propagandist of the Roman Church, suddenly produced a versio n of Josephus which contained these passages.19 From that point onwards, Josephus becam e the foundat ion fo r the histori cityof Jesus. Unable to provide any historical evidence for Jesus, later Christians forged the proof that theyso badly needed to shore up their Literalist interpretation of the gospels. This, as we would see repeatedly, w as a commo n pract ice. THE TALMUD Alt hough there is no evidence for the historical Jesus in the writings of Jewish historians, there are a handful o f passages in the Jewish Talmud that are somet imes wheeled out to provide so me evidence for Jesus the man. T hese are clearly not Christ ian fo rgeri es. Here is what they say: • It has been taught: On the eve o f Passover they hanged Yeshu ... because he practised sorcery and ent iced Israel astray . • 'Our rabbis taught: Yeshu had five disciples -Mattai, Nakki a, Ne tzer, Buni, and Todah .’ • It happened with Rabbi Elazar ben Damah, whom a serpent bit, that Jacob, a man of Kefar Som a, cam e to help him in the name of Yeshu ben Pantera. ’ • 'Once I was walking on the upper street of Sepphoris, and found one of the discipl es of Yeshu the Nazarene. ’20 'Yeshu ’is a shortened form o f 'Yehoshua ;or 'Joshua ’, which in Greek beco mes 'Jesus ’, so perhaps these passages are about the Jesus of the gospels? However, di smissing the fact that we have ment ion of only five disciples with comp letely unrecognizable names, there are other reasons why these passages are not the proof we are seeking. The fact that we have a mention of 'Yeshu the Nazarene ’is not extraordinary. The Nazarenes were a Jewish religious sect and the use of the word does not imply 'fro m Nazareth ’. Yeshu was an extremely co mmo n name that could refer to any number of people.21 Josephus ment ions at least 10 Jesuses, although it is revealing to note that some translat ions o f Jo sephus only translate the passages that they want the reader to i dentify with Jesus Christ using the Greek versio n of the name that we all recognize, whilst leaving the names of all the other Jesuses in the untranslated Hebrew!22 As the scho lar who unearthed these passages in the Talmud admit s, eve n if they do refer to Jesus and not some other Yeshu, they cannot be taken as proof of }esus; existence, because theyare wri tten so late. Although based on older writings, the Talmud was not written unt il 200 CE, and we do not know whether these were earl y passages. Anyway, the rabbis are so vague in their chrono logythat they differ by as much as 200 years in the dates they assign to the figure that may or may not be Jesus!23 There does not seem to be anyt hing substant ial here. Where else can we look? Re markably enough, that's it! We've reviewed all the potential historical evidence for the existence of Jesus.

There were actually hundreds of different Christ ian gospels, not just the familiar four of the New Testam ent. However, since no one seriously claims that the apocryphal and Gnost ic gospels are other than myt hological, we need only c oncern ourselves here with Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. These books are tradit ionally said to be eyewit ness accounts of the life of Jesus written by his disciples. The fact that there are four of them adds weight to the claim that they genuinely record hi stori cal events. Yet actually these gospels often do not agree at all on what happened. The most startling contradict ion is between the genealogies presented in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke. Both authors go to great lengths to show that Je sus is descended fro m t he line of David, as the promised Messiah must be according to Jewish beliefs. Both authors see Jesus as fathered by Joseph. So far, so good. But is Joseph fathered by Jacob, as Matthew claims, or Heli, as Luke claims?

But all o f this seems a little unnecessary, since both gospel writers are al so at great pains to make clear that Joseph isn't Jesus' father at all! Jesus' mother Mary is a virgin and God is the father directly, not via the line of the 77 men that Luke lists for us. Matthew tells us clearly: 'It i s by the Ho ly Spirit that she has conceived this child. All this happened in order to fulfil what the Lord declared through the prophet \"The Virgin will conceive and bear a son\".'27 Surely this is too much of a contradict ion fo r the wri ters of the gospels of Matthew and Luke simply not to have noticed? Mark, on the other hand, doesn't ment ion Bethlehem, the virgin birth or Jesus' family desc ent fro m David at all. Why does he leave out these extremely pertinent facts? So met hing fishy is go ing on here! The gospels are littered with such inconsistencies. Luke offers us what looks like a convincing piece of historical detail when he tells us tha t Jesus was born at the time of the census ofQui rinius. This took place in 6 CE. Yet Matthew tells us that Jesus was born during the reign ofKing Herod, who died in 4 BCE.28 Luke even contradicts himself, stating that John and Jesus were miraculously con ceived six mo nths apart in the reign o f Herod, but still portrays Mary wit h child at the time o f the census of 6 CE, creating one of the rarely ment ioned miracles of the New Testam ent -a 10 -year pregnancy! John places the cleansing of the temple at the b eginning of his narrative, Matthew at the end.29 Mark has Jesus teaching only in the area of Galilee, and not in Judea, and only travelling the 70 miles to Jerusalem once, at the end of his life. Luke, however, portrays Jesus as teaching equally in Galilee and Judea. John's Jesus, on the other hand, preaches mainly in Jerusalem and makes only occasional visit s to Galilee.30 Amazingly, since Literalist Christianit y is bu iltupon the histori cityofJesus' death and resurrecti on, even the events surrounding h is crucifixio n are not uniformly recorded by the gospel s. According to Matthew and Mark, Jesus was both tried and sentenced by the Jewish pri ests of the Sanhedrin. Luke has it that Jesus was tried by the Sanhedrin, but not sentenced by them . Yet according to J ohn, Jesus does not appear before the Sanhedrin at all.31 Jesus then goes"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"to his death by crucifixio n. Or is it, as Paul says, to be 'hanged on a gibbet'?32 Or, as Peter has it in t he Acts of the Apostles, that he was 'hung on a tree'?33 The same conf usi on exists about the death of Jesus' betrayer, Judas Iscariot. In Matthew, Judas 'went and hanged himself'.34 But the Acts of the Apostles tells us he died fro m an acci dental fall after betraying Jesus.35 The gospel writers, who we are supposed to believ e were Jesus' close disciples, cannot even remember their master's last words correctly! According to Matthew36 and Mark37 Jesus quotes psalm 22 as his parting words, asking, 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?' But Luke has Jesus quote psalm 31: 'F ather, into y our hands I commend my spirit.'38 For those who don't like either of these, there is always John's account,39 in which Jesus says simply, 'I am thirst y,' and then, 'It is finished.'40 According to Mark, when Joseph of Arimathea goes to Pilate to ask if he can have Jesus' body for buri al, the governor is shocked to learn that Jesus has died so quickly.41 One wonders why he was surprised, however, since John tells us that Pilate had himself already agreed to qui cken Jesus' death by breaking his legs and stabbing him wit h a spear.42 According to Matthew, Jesus had predicted that: 'Just as Jonah was in the ho llo w of the whale for three days and three nights, so the Son of Humanit y w ill be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.' 43 Alas, it seems his calculat ions were inaccurate, for according to the gospels, Jesus died on Friday and rose on the fo llo wing Sunday, thus spending only two nights 'in the heart of the earth'. The Gospel of Mark tells us that when so me o f Jesus' wo me ndisciples found his empt y tomb they merely 'saw a young man in a white robe' inside.44 Luke, however, relates that 'two men in br illiant clothes suddenly appeared by their side'.45 Matthew paints a far more dramat ic picture, cl aiming: 'All at once there was a vio lentearthquake, for the angel of the Lord, descending fro m heaven, came and rolled away the stone and sat on it. His face was like lightning, his robe white as snow.'46 In Mark47 and Matthew,48 the resurrected Jesus appears to his other disciple s in Galilee, where theyhave been specifically sent by divine decree. Yet this stupendous supernatural event does not seem to have impressed itself very clearly on the other disciples, since Luke and the author of the Acts of the Apostles have the risen J esus appearing in and around Jerusalem.49 Indeed, according to Acts, not only did they not receive any divine co mmandment to go to Galilee, but were expressly forbidden to leave Jerusalem.50 Even Jesus himself is not consistent. In Mark he charitably expl ains: 'Who isn't against us is for us.'51 But in Matthew he is more dogmat ic, warning, 'Whoever isn't with me is against me. '52 Even in one and the same gospel Jesus is profoundly inconsistent. According to Matthew, Peter asks his master, 'Lord, how many t imes shall my brother wrong me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?' Jesus replies by giving his beaut iful teachings of co mp lete forgiveness, advising him: 'I'm not telling you up to seven times, I'm telling you up to sevent y se ven times!'53 Why Peter nee ded to ask is unclear, however, since merely one paragraph previously in the same gospel Jesus had already given the much less forgiving and more pragmat ic advice:"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"'If yo ur brother wrongs you, go have it out with him, just you and him.

If he won't listen to them, speak up at a meet ing. If he won't listen to the assembly, let him b e the same to you as the foreigner and the tax -collector.'54 So which did the master teach? Should we forgive 77 times or only three times? If the gospels are an historical record of the teachings o f Jesus, then we can at least concl ude that 'he is not t he Son of God. Either that or the Son of God is as fallible as any mortal. For he repeatedly predicts that the coming apocalypse will be witnessed by those still living at the time. In Luke we read: 'I tell you truly, that there are some of those standing right here who will never taste death before they see the kingdo m o f God. And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and on earth an anxious mass of people in confusion over the roar of the sea and the tides, with people dying of fear and appr ehensio n about what's coming over the world. Yes, the powers of heaven will be shaken. And then they will see the Son of Man co ming on a cloud with power and great glory. When these things start to happen, look up and raise your heads, because your redem ption is approaching. When you see these things happening, you know the kingdo m o f God is close. I assure you that this generation will not pass away till it all happens .’55 Likewise in Matthew, Jesus asserts: 'I assure you there are some among those stand ing here who will never taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his mo narchy.561 assure you that this generat ion will not go by before all this happens.'57 Yet, 2,000 years later, when all his disciples are well and truly dead and buried, non e o f these things have co me to pass and Jesus has not returned. The most telling mo me ntin t he gospels, however, is when Mark has Jesus quote from the Old Testam ent in his arguments against the Pharisees. Nothing surprising about this -except that Jesus quotes from the mistranslated Greek version of the Old Testament, which suits his purpose preci sely, not from the original Hebrew, which says something quite different and unhelpful to his argument. That Jesus the Jew should quote a Greek mistranslat ion of Jewish Ho ly Scr ipture to impress orthodox Jewish Pharisees is simply unthinkable. It does make sense, however, if the who le incident were made up by one of the hundreds of thousands of Greek -speaking Jews who no longer spoke their native tongue and could not read their scriptures untranslated, hence attributing to Jesus their own misunderstandings.58 NEW TESTAMENT SCHOLARSHIP One thing is surely indisputable fro m a ll of this: the gospels are not, as some Christ ians claim, the divine words of God.59 For if theyare, God is extremely confused. As, by his very nature, God i s unlikely to be confused, it seems safe to conclude that we are dealing with the words of"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"fallible men. So, can the gospels be relied on to tell us anything about an historical Jesus? What light can scho larship shed on Matthew, Mark, Luke and John? Well, first of all, the gospels were not originally even known by these names. They were not attributed to any parti cular author, each gospel being regarded as 'the gospel' of a particular Chr istian sect. Only later did they acquire the names of their supposed authors.60 The gospels are actually anonymous works, in which everything, without except ion, is written in capital letters, with no headings, chapter or verse divisio ns, and practically no punctuation or spaces between words.61 They were not even written in the Aramaic of the Jews but in Greek.62 The gospels have also been added to and altered over time. The Pagan crit ic Celsus com plains that Christ ians 'altered the original text of the gos pels three or four times, or even mo re, wi ththe intention o f thus being able to destroy the arguments of their crit ics'.63 Modern scho lars have found that he was right. A careful study of over 3,000 early manuscripts has shown how scribes made many change s.64 The Christ ian philosopher Origen, writ ing in the third century , acknowl edges that m anuscri pts have been edited and interpolated to suit the needs of the changing theo logical climate: 'It i s an obvious fact today that there is much diversit y a mo ng the ma nuscri pts, due ei ther to the carelessness of the scribes, or the perverse audacit y of so me peopl e in correcting the text, or again to the fact that there are those who add or del ete as they please, setting themselves up as correctors .’65 To convey the enormit y o f the problem, one scho lar describes selecting a place in the gospels com pletely at random (in this case he chose Mark 10 -11) and checking to see how many differences were recorded between various early manuscripts for these passages. He discover ed 'no fewer that 48 places where the manuscripts differ, somet imes there are only two possibilit ies, often there are three or more, and in one case there are six1!66 Scho lars also know that whole sect ions o f the gospels were added later. For example, ori ginally Mark did not contain any words beyo nd Chapter 16 verse 8 -the fear of the women at their di scovery ofthe em pty tomb. The so -called long ending', in which the risen Jesus appears to his disciples, is not found in any early manuscripts and yet now appears in nearly all New Testam ents.67 Despite all of this edit ing and amending, the gospels remain contradictory and inconsistent, as we have seen. For centuries, the Catholic Church prevented anyo ne'other than pri ests reading the New Testament for them selves, so few had the chance to discover just how confused the gospels are. That all changed wit h t he Protestant Reformat ion.68 Eager to distance themselves fro m Ro me, German Protestant scho lars began to search the gospel s fo r the real Jesus. Even up to the present day the majorit y o f such scho lars have them selves been Christ ians, since a theological career at a German universit y is closed to those who have not been bapt ized.69 Yet despite this, rather than giving Christ ianit y a fir m historical foundat ion, as they hoped, Protestant scholars' three centuries of intense scholarship have undermined the literal figure of Jesus comp letely.70 From detailed research they concluded that the Gospel o f Jo hn was written so late that it coul d not have been an eyewit ness account.71 In Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus teaches in pithy parables, but John contains lengthy, apparently verbat im speeches in fluent Greek which were cl early not the words of a Jewish carpenter's son.72 John also describes quite different incidents from the other gospels."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"The work of the Berlin philo logist Karl Lachmann and other eminent scho lars also revealed that, despite their differences, Matthew, Mark and Luke shared a great deal in co mmo n. These similarit ies are due to the fact that Matthew an d Luke are actually reworkings of Mark,\"which is the simplest and earliest gospel. If John is written too late and Matthew and Luke are based on Mark, this leaves us only the Gospel of Mark as a possible eyewitness account of the life of Jesus. Scho lars b elieve that Mark was written sometime between 70 CE and the early second century .74 If we accept the earliest possible date, it is just feasible that Mark was an eyewitness. Yet i roni cally, Mark does not claim to have known Jesus. Many in the early Church obj ected to his gospel being treated as canonical for this very reason.75 Mark is claimed to have been at best some sort of secretary or interpreter for Peter. Even this is impossible, however, since Mark's gospel exhibits what one modern scho lar calls 'a lamentable ignorance of Palest inian geography':76 'In t he seventh chapter, for instance, Jesus is reported as going through Sidon on his way fro m T yre to the Sea of Galilee. Not only is Si don in the opposite direct ion, but there was in fact no road fro m S idon to the Sea of Galilee in the first century CE, only one fro m T yre. Similarly the fift h chapter refers to the Sea of Galilee's eastern shore as the country of the Gerasenes, yet Gerasa, today Jerash, is mo re than thirt y miles to the south -east, too far away for a story whose setting requi res a nearby cit y w it h a steep slope down to the sea. Aside fro m geography, Mark represented Jesus as saying \"If a wo ma n divorces her husband and marries another she is guilt y of adultery\" (Mark 10 v 12), a precept whic h woul d have been meaningless in the Jewish world, where women had no rights of divorce .’77 In the late nineteenth century, William Wrede, Professor of New Testament Studies at Breslau Universit y, argued that even the Gospel of Mark, the earliest and most primit ive gospel, was mo re concerned with theological dogma than historical accuracy.78 In 1919 another German scho lar, Karl Ludwig Schmidt, published a careful study of the way in which Mark's gospel had been created. He was able to show that the author ofMark had created his gospel by linking together exist ing smaller stories. The Jesus story had been constructed fro m pre -exist ing fragments.79 The way that Matthew and Luke had added to Mark the nat ivit y st ory and genealogies showed how the Jesus story h ad evo lved over time. It could no longer be assumed by scho lars that these narratives were in any way factual accounts.80 This effect ively brought to an end any hope of finding an historical Jesus within the gospels. Germ an theol ogians began increasingly to date the ori ginat ion of Mark, Matthew and Luke to well into the second century CE.81 Rudolf Bult ma nn (1884 -1976), Professor of New Testam ent Studi es at Marburg Universit y,spent his life studying the gospels and was one of the greatest authorities on th e New Testament. He pioneered the influent ial met hod of analysing the gospel s called 'form -cri ticism ’.82 Eventually he concluded: 'I do indeed think that we can now know almost nothing concerning the life and personalit y of Jesus, since the early Christ ian sources show no interest in e it her and are, moreover, fragmentary and often legendary.'83"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES? If the gospels cannot help us in our quest to find the historical Jesus, what about the rest of the New Testament? Amazingly, the Acts of the Apostles, the letters of Paul, James, Peter, John and Jude, and the Revelation o f Jo hn barely ment ion t he histori cal Jesus. But they do tal k about the apostl es. If we can substant iate thei r existence, perhaps we can, by implication, prove the existence of Jesus. The gospels tell us little of most of the 12 apostles apart fro m t heir names. Yet even here, there are serious discrepancies. In the gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke, the disciples Peter, James and John are Jesus' closest fo llo wers. In John's gosp els, however, Peter plays only a minor rol e and James and John are not even ment ioned.84 John's gospel, on the other hand, presents us withthe apostles Nathenael and Nicodemus, who make no appearance in the other three gospel s.85 On top of this, the list ofnames o f the disciples is very clumsily worked into the text ofMark and Matthew, which has led scho lar s to conclude that the number of the disciples was what was originally important, and the names were a later considerat ion.86 John's gospel doesn't even list the names. In Chapter 6 we are told that the disciples were 'many', and a few verses later Jesus is suddenly and inexplicably addressing 'the twelve'.87 The tradit ional view of Church history is that after the resurrection the 12 apostles played adeci sive ro le in establishing the Church. Their deeds are recorded in the Acts of the Apostles. Yet, although the -author of Acts ascribes the greatest importance to the 12, he tells us nothing about nine of them apart from their names.88 Of the 12, Acts concerns itself only wit h Peter. But even Peter is not ment ioned after Chapter 15, and we hear only of Paul, who was not one of the 12 and was never supposed to have met Jesus.89 Acts does not inspire confidence as a reliable record of events. As one Chri stian transl ator of the New Testament admits, it is more like a 'drugstore paperback'.90 It is full of little adventure fantasies. For example we are told of a Christ ian called Anasias who had so ld a property and only o ffered so me o f the proceeds to the ap ostles, pocketing the rest. When Peter confronts him with the truth, he simply drops down dead! Peter does not seem to be particularly upset by this and three hours later performs exact ly t he same trick on the poor man's wife! When he asked her, 'Do you he ar the feet of those who buried your husband co ming to carry you out too?', she 'fell down suddenly at his feet and expired'. Not surprisingly, 'a great fear came over all the assembly and all those who heard about these things'.91 Peter may be able to ca use dishonest property speculators to drop dead on the spot, but thi s is nothing. According to Acts, Philip can 'teleport' himself fro m o ne place to another! He appears suddenly to baptize a eunuch in one place and then is snatched away to instant ly reappe ar in distant Azotum.92 Acts also wildly exaggerates. Paul is meant to have preached for two years 't ill all the inhabitants of Asia had heard the word, Jews and Greeks alike'.93 Surely an impossible achievement, even for a saint! And then there is the biz arre case of 'Peter and the giant tablecl oth': 'Peter went upon the roof to pray around the hour of noon. And he got hungry and wanted to taste some food. While they were preparing so met hing, a rapture came over him: and he saw the sky opening and a sort of table -setting coming down, like a giant tablecloth being draped over the four corners of the earth, containing all the quadrupeds and serpents of the land and birds of the air. And a vo ice came to him: Get up Peter, slaughter and eat.'94"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"It seem s safe to assum e we are not dealing with factual accounts here. Moreover, Acts is clearly not written by a single author, as is claimed. At Chapter 16 the narrative suddenly jo lts from the thi rd person into the first person, something which continues sporadically through the book.95 So, like the gospels, Acts of the Apostles is a 'cut and paste' creat ion. This explains why it is not even internally consistent. For example, in Chapter 9 we are tol d that when Paul received his visio n of light and heard a divine vo ice on the road to Dam ascus, his co mp ani ons 'heard the voice but could see no one'.96 Yet in Chapter 21 Paul is made to relate of the same experience: 'My companio ns saw the light, but did not hear the voice that spoke to me.'97 Acts also contradicts the t estimo ny o f Paul in his Letter to the Galatians. According to Acts, after his visio nary experience on the road to Damascus, Paul is told to seek out a disciple called Ananias in Damascus, who will tell him what to do.98 He then goes to Jerusalem, where Bar nabas introduces him to the apostles.99 In the Temple at Jerusalem he experiences a second visio n of Jesus and receives his vocation to preach to the Gent iles.100 Yet this is quite different fro m P aul's own account, in which he makes no ment ion of Ananias and claims he went to Arabia and had nothing to do with Christians in Jerusalem for three years after his conversio n experience.101 He states emphat ically: 'What I write is plain truth; before God I am not lying.' So who is lying? Like the Gospel of Mark, the Acts of the Apostles also misquotes the Hebrew Old Testam ent, It portray s Peter as proving his po int to the Jews of Jerusalem using a badly transl ated passage fro m t he Greek versio n of the Old Testament, which in the original Hebrew means so met hing el se altogether. Acts also portrays James as likewise appealing to the Jews of Jerusalem by quoting a passage fro m t he Greek Old Testament which distorts the Hebrew ori ginal .102 The Jerusalem Jews cannot have been very impressed! Fro m t his evidence alone, scho lars have concluded that Acts cannot be taken as an historical record of the Jerusalem Church.103 This is also borne out by the evidence of when Acts was written. It was regarded as holy scri pture by Irenaeus and Tertullian, who lived at the end of the second century . But Justin Marty r, living a generat ion earlier, displays no knowledge o f it .104 It i s not quoted before 177 CE, so it is definitely not a contemporary account, as it claims to be, and was probably written somewhere between 150 and 177 CE.10 5 There were actually many different scriptures relating the deeds of the disciples in circulat ion amongst early Christ ians, but no one considers the 12022 -canonical tales of the apostl es as historical documents.106 Why should we treat the canonical Acts ofthe Apostles withany less scept icism,just because the Ro ma n Church authorit ies decided to include it in the New Testament? The scriptures dealing with the myt hical explo its of John, Peter, Paul, Andrew and Tho ma s were banned and consigned to the bonfi re in the fift h century by Pope Leo the Great as dangerous heretical lies.107 The canonical Acts of the Apost les was spared such a fate simply because, unlike these other gospels, it endorsed the 'party line ’ofthe Ro ma n Church. THE EARLIEST EVIDENCE So m uch for the Acts of the Apostles. What of the New Testament letters ascribed to the apostles Peter, James and John? Can these help us at all? Unfortunately, modern scho lars have shown that these letters are forgeries written much later to combat heretical ideas within the early Church. They are not even very good forgeries. As one translator writes of the Second Letter of Peter, 'It refers to the apostles as \"our ancestors\" as if they were dead and buried.'108 So it is clearly not"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"by Peter, but uses his nam e so that the apostle is seen as endorsing its ant i-heresy message.109 These letters were widely seen as fakes and took a lo ng time to become an established part of the canon o f the New Testament.110 What about Paul's letters? Here at last we have someone who is universally agreed to have been an historical person. However, scho lars believe his later letters, known as 'the Pastorals', are forgeries which contradict his earlier letters.111 Like the letters attributed to the other disciples, they were writte n in t he second century CE to combat internal divisio ns in the Church.112 But some o f the earlier letters, whilst suffering fro m ed it ing, addit ions and the usual 'cut and paste ’treatm ent, are widely believed to have been written by Paul. Paul wrote his le tters before 70 CE. SO, they actually predate all of the gospels. They are the earliest existing Christ ian docum ents and so me o f them are basically genuine. At last we have something substant ial! It i s a co mp letely remarkable fact, however, that Paul says nothing at all about the histori cal Jesus! He is concerned only wit h t he crucified and resurrected Christ, whose importance is ent irely myst ical. Paul makes it clear that he never met an historical Jesus. He wri tes: 'Neit her did I receive the Gospel fro mma n, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelat ion of Jesus Christ .’113 Paul doesn't ment ion Jerusalem or Pilate. Indeed, as we shall explore in more detail later, he decl ares that Jesus was crucified at the instigation of the 'Archons' or 'r uler s of the age'114 - dem onic powers that are tal ked of by the Gnost ics! In fact Paul does not link Jesus with any histori cal time and place, including the recent past.115 Paul's Christ, like the Pagan's Osiris - Dionysus, is a timeless myt hical figure. Paulsays nothing about Nazareth and -never calls Jesus a Nazarene.116 Alt hough he portrays Christianit y a s a bapt istsect, he never ment ions John the Bapt ist.117 He tells us nothing about Jesus eating and drinking wit h t ax collectors and sinners, his Sermon on the Mount, his parables, his argum ents wi thPharisees or his clashes with the Roman authorities.118 Paul doesn't even know the Lord's Prayer which, according to the gospels, Jesus gave to his disciples, saying, 'Pray then like this,' for Paul writes, 'W e do not even know how we ought to pray.'119 If Paul were actually fo llo wing a recent ly deceased Messiah, it is astonishing that he did not feel it necessary to go and see the apostles who knew Jesus personally before starting off on his own teaching miss io n. Yet he says he does not gain his authorit y fr om anyo ne. It would also seem reasonable to assume that, if Jesus were a literal figure not a myt ho logical Christ, Paul woul d have quoted from his master's teachings and the example o f his life on a regular basis. In fact he never mentions Jesus' life and only quotes Jesus once -and when he does, it is the universal Mystery form ula of the Eucharist: ‘'This is my body which is broken for you: this do in remembrance o f me. This cup is the new covenant in my blood: thi s do, as oft as ye drink it, in rem embrance of me.'120 When Paul quotes this passage, he tells us that Jesus spoke it 'on the night when he was betrayed' or in so me t ranslat ions 'on the night of his arrest'. Both of these translat ions, however, embellish the original Greek to give the idea of historicit y.The Greek actually states that Jesus spoke these words on the night he was 'delivered up',121 a phrase reminiscent of that used to describe the"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"fate of the Greek sacrificial pharmakos, who also meets his death to atone for the 'sins of the worl d'. Paul gives his ethical teachings on his own authority, without ment ioning Jesus. When he wishes to support them he draws on the Old Testament, even when quoting Jesus would have served him just as well , or even better. He teaches that Christ's death puts an end to Jewish Law, but doesn't draw on Jesus' claim that he has come to do exactly that. He doesn't back up his call for celibacy wit h Jesus' prai se of those who renounce marriage for the sake of the kingdo m o f heaven.122 When he argues that at the resurrection a person's body will be changed fro m flesh and blood, he doesn't quote Jesus' teachings that 'when they rise fro m t he dead, they neit her marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven'.123 If he had known the master's words, are we really to believe he would have made abso lut ely no reference to them? Alt hough Paul doesn't ment ion an historical Jesus, he does ment ion a John and a James, who are often presumed to be two of the dis ciples ment ioned in the gospels. Paul tells us nothing about John, but he does call James 'the brother of the Lord', which is so met imes seized upon to prove that Paul acknowledged an historical Christ, because he had met his brother. It was a commo n Christ ian practice, however, to call each other 'brother'. In both the Gospel of Matthew124 and the Gospel of John,125 Jesus calls his fo llo wers his 'brothers' without inferring that they are his blood family, and in a Gnostic gospel called The Apocalypse of Jam es we read specifically that James was 'said to be the Lord's brother only in a purely spiritual sense'.126 Paul also m ent ions a certain 'Cephas'. This is traditio nally taken to be the apostle Peter. Peter was originally called Simo n but, in different cir cumstances in each gospel, was given the name 'Rock' by Jesus. This is 'Cephas' in Aramaic and 'Peter' in Greek. Is Cephas the same person as Peter? Paul also ment ions a 'Peter' once in his letters, but does not equate Cephas and Peter as one and the same person. An early Christ ian scripture called The Letter of the Apostles opens with a list of 11 apostles, the third of who m is called Peter and the last of who m is called Cephas, so there certainly was a Christ ian t radit ion that Cephas and Peter were not id entical. The mo dern tendency to assum e that they are necessarily the same person is mistaken.127 Even if Cephas is taken to be another name for Peter, is this the Peter who supposedly knew Jesus? It is easy to assume so, because we are all so familiar wit h t he gospel stori es. However, there is nothing in PauPs letters to suggest that the Cephas he meets in Jerusalem and Ant ioch is the Peter of the gospels who personally knew Jesus. In fact quite the opposite. Paul's rel ationship with the Cephas of his lett ers would certainly not suggest that Cephas was the right - hand man of an historical Messiah. Paul is extremely host ile to Cephas and opposes him wit h strong language: 'When Cephas came to Ant ioch I challenged him face to face, because he was acting inexcu sably .’128 He takes issue with Cephas for conforming to Jewish Law and refusing to eat with Gent ile Chr istians.129 Yet Paul does not bring up the fact that, if Cephas is the Peter of the gospels, he must have known that Jesus ate and drank with sinners an d prosti tutes and defended himself against crit icism that he was vio lat ing Jewish Laws.130 Paul calls Cephas a hypocrite.131 Yet, if he is the Peter of the gospels, why doesn't Paul throw in his face the fact that he had fallen asleep in t he garden of Geth semane, and denied the Lord three times with curses,132 and had even been com pared to Satan by Jesus himself?133"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"There is only one short passage in Paul which could just ify the belief that the Cephas of his letters is the Peter of the gospels. Writ ing of the resurrected Jesus, Paul says, 'He appeared to Cephas and then the Twelve. Next he appeared to hundreds of the fait hful at once.'134 This is curious, because according to the gospels, Judas Iscariot was dead by this t ime, so Jesus coul d only have appe ared to the 11. And none o f the gospels speak of Jesus appearing to 'hundreds' of people. Once again we have to acknowledge we are at a loss to know what to believe. This passage could well be a later addit ion to Paul's letter. But even if it is not, all itreally tells us is that a Cephas, along with hundreds of others, had the myst ical experience ofseeing the risen Christ, just as Paul himself had done. Is Paul describing an historical event or myst ical rites? Thousands o f init iates in the Pagan Mysteri es of Eleusis could have made essent ially the same claim of experiencing the resurrected godman without inferring that any of them had met an historical Osiris -Dionysus. This may sound like a radical interpretation, but it does make sense of a passage in P aul's Letter to the Galat ians which is otherwise inco mprehensible. Paul cri ticizes the 'stupid Galatians', 'before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly displayed on the cross!' for looking to a 'material' rather than 'spiritual' understanding of salvat ion.13 5 Are we really to b elieve that this Christ ian co mmu nit y in Asia Minor had witnessed the crucifixio n in Jerusalem and that Paul, who never claimed to have known Jesus, felt just ified in calling such witnesses 'stupid'? Paul's co mment would make sense, howe ver, if the Galat ian Christians had rather witnessed a dramat ic representation of Christ's passio n. It is this, Paul states, that will make them 'perfect' -or to use the more accurate translation, 'init iated'! So what can we actually say about Paul's Cep has? Only that he is a leader of Jewish Chr istians in Jerusalem and a theological rival to Paul. It would seem that Paul's letters, the earliest Christ ian docum ents, cannot help us in our search for an historical Jesus. All he can tell us is that the Chris tian co mmunit y was already internally divided by the middle of the first century between pro -Jewish Christians in Jerusalem and those, like Paul, who saw Jesus as coming to repl ace the old Jewish Law. It is only because of the gospels and Acts of the Apost les, both written much later, that the figures of Cephas, John and James in Paul's letters have beco me associ ated wi ththe gospel figures who bear their names. There is actually nothing in Paul to make us believe that the Christ ians he is talking about per sonally knew an historical Jesus. The gospel s were written after Paul's letters and have been revealed as theo logical rather than histori cal docum ents. It is more likely, therefore, that the gospel wri ters picked up on the names ofCephas, James and John m enti oned earlier by Paul and developed them into the characters we find in the Jesus story. THE HISTORY OF A DEVELOPING MYTH The evidence suggests that the New Testament is not a history of actual events, but a history of the evo lut ion o f Chr istian myt holo gy. The earliest gospel is Mark, itself created fro m pre - exist ing fragments. The authors of Matthew and Luke added to and modified this gospel to create their own versio ns of the life of Jesus. Fro m t his we can conclude that they did not see Mark's gospel as a valuable historical record that must be preserved intact. Neither did they see it as the invio lable 'Word of God' which must never be altered. They evident ly believed it to be a story"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"which could be embellished and adjusted to their own needs -in exa ctly t he same way that Pagan philosophers had been developing and elaborating the myt hs of Osiris -Dionysus for centuries. But Mark is not our earliest evidence of the Jesus story. This is found in the letters of Paul . Despi te the fact that these letters w ere written before any o f the gospels, and by as many as 100 years before the Acts of the Apostles, they are placed in the New Testament after these books. This gives the false impressio n t hat Paul follo ws on fro m t he gospels and Acts, rather than the othe r way around.136 Hence, it is easy not to even notice that Paul's Christ is not an histori cal figure. However, if we put the elements that make up the New Testament in their correct chronological order, we see the Jesus story developing before our eyes. The myt ho logical dying and resurrecting Christ of Paul is developed by the primit ive Jesus story ofMark. This is significant ly added to by Matthew and Luke. We then have the more philosophically developed Gospel of John, with its 'Logos' doctrine and lo ng Greek speeches by Jesus. Finally we have a collect ion of legends about the apostles, fo llo wed by a number of forged letters which presuppose a literal Jesus and adopt the authori tyofthe apostl es to attack heretical Chr istians. Looked at in this way, the New Testament itself tells the story o f ho w Christ ianit y developed: The Letters of Paul c.50 The Gospel of Mark 70-110 The Gospels of Matthew and Luke 90 -135 The Gospel of John c. 120 Acts of the Apostles 150 -177 Letters of the Apostles 177 -220 Jesus is a myst ical dying and resurrecting godm an. The myt h of Jesus is given an historical and geographi cal setting. Details o f Jesus' birth and resurrect ion are added and the story embellished. Chr istian t heo logyis developed. Having now created the illusio n of an historical Jesus, Acts is created to account for his disci ples. Letters attributed to Paul and the apostles are forged by Literalists in their battles with Gnosticism, attacking 'many deceivers' who 'do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as comi ng in the flesh'.137 The ori ginal versio n o f the Gospel of Mark, the earliest account of the Jesus story, did not include the resurrected Jesus at all. This has been added later. Before these addit ions, Mark's gospel ended wit h t he women finding the empt y tomb and only the int imat ion t hat Jesus had resurrected as promised. Characterist ically, the Gnostic gospels start where Mark's original gospel ends. They do not relate the events of Jesus' life, but the secret teachings of the risen Chr ist after the res urrection. This suggests that the original quasi -histori cal Jesus story rel ated in the Gospel of Mark was, as the Gnostics claimed, the Outer Mysteries designed to appeal to"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"spi ritual beginners. These Outer Mysteries could take an init iate as far as the em pty tomb and the int imat ion of eternal Life, but only the secret teachings of the Gnostics revealed the sayings of the risen Christ.

CONCLUSION Like countl ess scho lars who have made this quest before us, we have found that looking for an histori cal Jesus is fut ile. It is astonishing tha t we have no substant ial evidence for the historical existence of a man who is said to have been the one and only incarnat ion of God throughout all ofhistory . But the fact is we do not. So, what have we got? • A few mentions of 'Christ ians' and follo wers of someo ne called Crestus am ongst all the extensive histori es of the Rom ans • Some fake passages in Josephus am ongst all the substant ial histories of the Jews • A handful o f passages fro m a mo ngst the vast literature ofthe Talmud, which tell us that a man called Yeshu existed and had five disciples called 'Mattai, Nakkia, Netzer, Buni, and Todah' • Four anonymous gospels that do not even agree on the facts of Jesus ’birth and death • A gospel attributed to Mark written som ewhere between 70 and 135 CE, whic h is not even meant to be an eyewit ness account and certainly isn't fro m it s ignorance of Palest inian geography and the fact that it misquotes Hebrew scripture • Gospels attributed to Matthew and Luke which are independent ly ba sed on Mark and give us ent irely contradi ctory genealogies • A gospel attributed to John which was written some time after the other three and certainly not by t he di sci ple John • The names o f12 disciples for whom there is no histori cal evidence • The Acts of the Apostles, which read s like a fantasy novel, misquotes the Hebrew Old Testam ent, contradi cts Paul's letters and was not written unt il t he second half ofthe second century • A select ion of forged letters attributed to Peter, James, John and Paul • A few genuine letters by Paul which do not speak of an histori cal Jesus at all, but only o f a myst ical dying and resurrect ing Christ • A lo t of evidence which suggests that the New Testament is not a history of actual events, but a history ofthe evo lut ion of Christ ian myt ho logy Mayb e (if we really want to believe it), something of this could (perhaps) be evidence of an histori cal Jesus. This cannot be ruled out. But the evidence that suggests that Jesus is a myt hical figure is so compelling that we will need so met hing far more substa ntial than any o f this to undermine it. The lack o f any evidence for an historical Jesus finally made us completely abandon the idea that the true biography o f Jesus had been distorted and overlaid with Pagan myt ho logyto create the gospel stories. It als o m ade us dismiss an extraordinary idea developed in the 1920s by a group of monks in Germany called the 'Mystery Theory'. 1 This explains the resemblances between the 'biography' of Jesus and the myt ho logy o f the Mysteries by claiming that, as the climax o f a divine plan, the life of Jesus finally fulfilled in history what had previously been only my thical.

There are 13 letters attributed to him in the New Testament, making up a quarter of the whole of canonical Christ ian scri pture. On top of that, m ost of the Acts of the Apostles is devoted to tales of Paul. But who is Paul? Tradi tionally Paul is viewed as a bast ion of orthodoxy and a crusader against the heretical Gnostics. Yet it is a remarkable fact that the Gnostics themselves never saw him in this light. Qui te the opposi te -the great Gnostic sages o f the early second century CE called Paul 'the Great Apostle’ 2 and honoured him as the primary inspiration for Gnostic Christ ianit y. Valentinus explains that Paul init iated the chosen few into the 'Deeper Mysteries' of Christ ianit y w hich revealed a secret doctrine of God. These in it iates had included Valentinus’ teacher Theudas, who had in turn init iated Valent inus himself.3 Many Gnostic groups claimed Paul as their founding father and Gnost ics calling them selves 'Paulicians' cont inued to flourish, despite persistent persecution fro m t he Rom an Church, unt il t he end of the tenth century.4 Paul wrote his letters to churches in seven cit ies which are known to have been centres of Gnostic Christ ianit y during the second century. These Chr istian co mmunit ies were led by the Gnostic sage Marcion, for whom Paul was the only true apostl e.5 One thing is for sure: if Paul really were as ant i-Gnosti c as the Literalists claim, then it is astounding how many Gnostic texts quote him or are actually attributed to him. The fo llo wers ofMarci on even had a gospel which they claimed was written by Paul.6 The texts found at Nag Hammadi include The Prayer of the Apost le Paul and The Apocalypse of Paul.7 A scripture called The Ascent of Paul records the 'ineffable words, which it is not permissible for a man to speak' which Paul heard during his famous ascent to the third heaven alluded to by the apostle ur his Letter to the Corinthians.8 Another text, called The Acts of Paul, describes Paul travelling witha com pani on called Thecla -a wom an who conducted bapt isms!9 THE GENUINE PAUL? Who is the genuine Paul? Could he have been a Gnostic, as the Gnostics claimed? As we have already discussed, modern scho lars now regard many o f the letters attributed to Paul as forgeri es.10 Of the 13 New Testament letters, only seven are now accepted as largely authent ic.11 As already ment ioned, the so -called 'Pastoral' letters to Timothy and Titus are regarded as fakes by all but the most conservat ive of theologians. Computer studies have confirmed that the author of the Pastorals is def init ely not the author of the letters to the Gal atians, Rom ans and Corinthians, which are accepted as genuinely by Paul.12 The earliest collect ion of letters attributed to Paul does not contain the Pastorals.13 In fact, we do not even hear of the Pastorals at all unt il Irenaeus (c. 190). They appear as a part of the Christ ian canon only after this time, al ways as a set, and are regularly dismissed by Christians of all persuasio ns"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"as forgeries.14 Even the great orthodox propagandist Eusebius does not include them in his Bible (c.325).15 This is important, as it is only in the Pastorals that Paul is ant i-Gnosti c.16 Unlike the genuine Pauline letters, the Pastorals present him as an organizer of the Church, a mainstay of Church discipline and the unswerving an tagoni st of all heretics.17 He is made to condemn Gnostic myt hs as 'unhallowed o ld wives' tales'18 and to recommend his fo llowers 'not to meddle withthe teachings and not to waste time on endless myt ho logies and genealogies, which lead to em pty speculat ions'.19 Obviously by the end of the second century the view of Paul as a Gnostic teacher was a sufficient threat to motivate someone to create an indisputably Literalist Paul in response. This Paul is made to specifically advise: 'Guard what has been hande d down to y ou by fending off all the Godless prattle and contradictions of false \"Gnosis\", which so me have adhered to, losing the way ofthe faith.'20 He is also made to be authoritarian in enforcing the power of the Church hierarchy, writ ing, 'Those who do go wrong should be publicly reproved, to give the others a scare.'21 He parti cularly attacks 'Hymenaeus and Philetus', two Gnostic teachers who have 'wandered afield fro m t he truth' and are teaching the Gnostic doctrine that 'our resurrection has alread y occurred’ 22 although in his genuine letters Paul claims to be already 'resurrected' himself! And despite the fact that there was a widespread tradition that Paul travelled wit h a woman who bapt ized,23 he is also made to attack the Gnostic practice of tre ating women as equal to men: 'A wo ma n should quiet ly receive instruction in complete obedience. I will not allow a woman to be a teacher nor act superior to a man .’24 Atthe end of the second century, then, Paul is portrayed by Literalist Christ ians as a nti-Gnosti c and authoritarian. This has been assumed to be historically accurate, but is actually only the perspective of these Literalist Christ ians.25 Just a few decades earlier, however, their view was the com plete opposi te -in t he fir st half of the se cond century letters attributed to Clement, the Bishop of Ro me, vigorously attack Paul as a misguided heretic!26 These letters describe Peter as vehement ly denying Paul's status as an apostle since only an eyewit ness of the resurrection shoul d be regarded as an apostle and Paul did not actually see the risen Christ. Paul's visio n o f Jesus on the road to Damascus is apparent ly no t only invalid, it is a revelat ion fro m an evil dem on or lying spirit!27 Jesus is claimed to be 'angry' with Paul who is his 'adver sary', because what Paul preaches is 'contradictory ’to Jesus' teachings.28 Peter writes of Paul as his 'enemy' who has convinced so me o f the Gentiles to reject the Jewish Law and to embrace 'foo lish teachings' which are 'outside the Law'. Paul is accused ofcreating a heretical gospel and Jesus' genuine apostles have to secretly send out 'a true gospel' to correct these heresies.29 Like his contem porary the arch -hereti c Simo n Magus, Paul is a satanically inspired divider of the Chr istian co mmunit y.30 He is a dangerous man who should be expelled fro m t he Church!31 PAUL AND THE PAGAN MYSTERIES If we can throw off the traditional picture of Paul and look at the evidence with an open mind thi s ant i-Paul rhetori c is understandable, since his letters show dist inc t Gnosti c and Pagan"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"influences. Paul is a Jew who had embraced the ubiquitous Greek culture of the times. He writes in Greek, his first language. He quotes only fro m t he Greek version o f the Old Testament. His ministry is t o Pagan cit ies dominated by Greek culture.32 Of these, Ant ioch was a centre for the Mysteri es of Adonis, Ephesus was a centre for the Mysteries of Attis and Corinth was a centre for the My steri es of Dionysus.33 Paul was a native of Tarsus in Asia Minor, which by his t ime had surpassed eve n At hens and Alexandria to become the major centre of Pagan philo sophy .34 It was in Tarsus that the Mysteries of Mithras had originated, so it would have been unthinkable that Paul would have been unaware of the remarkable similarit ies we have already expl ored between Christ ian doctri nes and the teachings of Mithraism.35 Paul frequent ly u ses term s and phrases fro m t he Pagan Mysteries, such as pneuma (spi rit), gnosis (divine knowledge), doxa (glory), sophia (wisdo m) , tel eioi(the init iated), and so on.36 He advises his fo llowers to 'earnestly seek the greater charismata'.37 The word 'charismata' derives fro m t he Mystery term mak ahsm os, ref erring to the blessed nature of one who has seen the My steri es.38 He even calls himself a 'Steward of the Mysteries of Go d’,39 which is the technical name for a priest in the Mysteries of Serapis.40 Paul quotes the Pagan sage Aratus, who had lived in Tarsus several centuries earlier, describing God 'in who m we live, and mo ve and have our being ’.41 He al so teaches Mystery do ctrines.42 Like the Pagan sage Socrates, who was deemed wise because he knew he kriew nothing,43 Paul teaches: 'If so meo ne thinks he knows so met hing, he st ill doesn't know the way he ought to know.’ 44 Just as Plato had written that we now only see realit y 't hrough a glass dimly’4 5 so Paul writes, ‘For now we see through a glass , darkly; but then face to face. '46 This famous passage fro m P aul has also been translated: 'At present all we see is the baffling reflect ion of realit y; we are like men looking ata la ndscape in a small mirror. The time will co me when we shall see realit y who le and face to face .’47 This translation clearly brings out the Platonic nature of Paul's teachings. Plato had used the image of prisoners trapped in a cave who are only able to see the shadows of the outside world cast on the cave walls as an allegory for our present condit ion of mistaking for real what is in fact only a reflect ion of ult imate realit y.48 For Pl ato, as for Paul, 'At present all we see is the baffling reflection ofreali ty.’ Plato teaches that philo sophers are those who are released fro m t he cave to go outside and see the realit y of the dazzling light of day for themselves -'face to face'. This phrase is a ritual form ula of the Pagan Mysteries. In The Bacchae w e read: 'He gave these Mysteries to me face to face.'49 Lucius Apuleius writes of his init iati on: 'I penetrated into the very presence of the gods below and the gods above, wh ere I worshipped face to face'. 50 Justin Marty r acknowl edges that: 'The aim o f P laton ism is to see God face to face.5 1 Plato describes how in the temple of the 'true earth' which exists in the realm o f ideas of which this Earth is a mere image, 'Co mmunio n withthe gods occurs face to face.'52"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"THE GNOSTIC PAUL Paul's Jesus is the myst icaldying and resurrecting godman of the Gnost ics, not the historical figure of the Literalists. The only place where Paul seems to treat Jesus as an historical figure is in t he Letter to Timothy , where he writes of 'Jesus Chr ist who swore out so noble a de posi tion before Pontius Pilate' -but this letter is a forgery.53 The genuine Paul preaches the Gnostic doctrine of Illusio nism, claiming that Jesus came not as a person but in the 'likeness' o f hu man flesh.54 Paul's letters are full o f such distinctively Gnosti c doctrines. How many modern Chr istians have wondered what Paul's famous claim to have ascended as far as the third heaven coul d possibly mean? This would not be puzzling for a Gnostic or an init iate of the Pagan Mysteri es, for both would have been taught that there are seven heavens linked to the seven heavenly bodies -the five visible planets and the moon and sun.55 Like the Gnosti cs, Paul is extremely disparaging of the externals of religio n -cerem onies, ho ly d ays, rul es and regulat ions.56 Like the Gnostics, he claims that true Christ ians beco me like Chr ist: having 'no veil over the face' they 'reflect as in a mirror the splendour of the Lord' and are thus 'transfigured into his likene ss, from splendour to splendour’ .57 The Gnost ics saw Paul as a teacher of secret 'Pneumat ic' init iat ions. In his Letter to the Rom ans Paul wri tes: 'I long to see you, so that I may share wit h yo u a certain Pneumat ic charisma’ 58 of which he says, 'I would not have you remain ignorant.'59 If Paul wants to urgent ly sh are something wit h his correspondents, why doesn't he write it in his letter? The answer for the Gnostics is that the 'Pneumat ic charisma' is an init iat ion which he can only transmit in person and 'in secret'.60 Paul writes: 'As it is written, \"Eye has no t seen, nor has ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man, what God has p repared for those who love him.\"’ 61 Ini tiated readers would undoubtedly recognize these words as a Mystery formula pronounced at the time o f init iat ion. The vow of secrecy undertaken by the fo llo wers of the Gnostic sage Just inus incorporated these words and, amongst other places, they also occur in the Gnost ic Gospel ofTho mas, where Jesus o ffer s: ‘1 will give you what eye has not seen, and what ear has not heard, what has not been touched, and what has not arisen in the heart of man.’ 62 It i s only inadequate translation that conceals the fact that Paul's letters are full o f characterist ically Gnostic phrases and teachings. For example, the Valent inians claim that Paul init iated Christians into the 'Mystery of Sophia', which probably included the myt h of the goddess' fall and redempt ion, and quote as proof his First Letter to the Corinthians, in which Paul wri tes: 'We speak of Sophia among the init iated.'63 If you are wonder ing why you have never com e across this decidedly Gnostic line of Paul's before, it is because it is usually translated as 'We speak wisdo m a mo ng the perfected', which doesn't make a lot of sense but at least sounds orthodox! The tradit ional translat ion co ntinues: 'Howbeit we speak wisdo m a mo ng the perfect: yet a wisdo m not ofthi s worl d, nor of the rulers of this world, which are coming to nought: but we speak God's wisdo m in a mystery, even the wisdo m t hat hath been hidden, which God"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"foreordained before the worlds unto our glory: which none of the rulers of this worl d knoweth: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory .'64 This translation, if intelligible at all, distorts Paul's actual meaning considerably. One modern scho lar explains: 'The proper meaning of this passage is obscured at two crucial po int s. The Greek word transl ated \"worl d\" here, severally in it s singular or plural form s, is aio n, which does not mean this physical world or earth, but \"time\" or \"age\". Paul's use ofaion here accordingly shows that he was thinking in terms of an e soteri c system of\"worl d-ages\". Next, the words translated as \"rulers of this world\" (archontes tou aionos toutou) do not refer, as is popularly supposed, to the Roman and Jewish authori ties who were responsible for condemning Jesus to death; they denote demonic beings, who were associated with the planets and were believed to govern the lives of men on earth. In thi s passage, then, Paul is found explaining that, before the beginning of a series of worl d-ages, God determined to send into the world, for the good of mankind, a preexistent divine being, who m t he demonic rulers of the world, not perceiving his real nature, put to death and thereby in so me way confounded themselves. In brief, Paul envisaged mankind as enslaved by dem onic beings, connected with astral phenomena, whom he describes by a variet y o f terms such as archontes tou aionos toutou and stoicheia tou kosmou (\"The elemental powers of the universe\"). From this mortal slavery m ankind had, accordingly, been rescued by the divine being, who, incarnated in the person of Jesus, had been crucified mistakenly by these archontes who, presumably, by thus unwittingly exceeding their rights, forfeited their control over men.'65 This is n ot Ch rist ianit y a s we know it today! Paul is preaching Gnosticism. Paul wri tes of a 'Gnosis' which can be taught only to the 'fully init iated'.66 He offers a pray er 'that y our l ove may more and more be bursting with Gnosis'.67 He writes of 'Christ in who mare hid all the treasures of Sophia and Gnosis' and of 'the Gnosis of God's Mystery'.68 Like a Gnosti c init iate Paul claims: 'By revelat ion the Mystery was made known to me.'6\" Like a Gnostic defending the secrecy o f the Inner Mysteries he asserts that he has heard 'ineffable words which it i s not lawful for a man to utter’ .70 Like a Gnostic he puts the emphasis on understanding, not on dogma, writ ing, ‘The letter kil ls, while the spirit gives life.’ 71 And like a Gnostic, he describes stories in the script ures as 'allegories'72 and wr ites of 'events' as 'symbo lic'.73 APOSTLE OF THE RESURRECTION Literalist Christ ians tri ed to quote Paul to endorse their bizarre belief that at the Second Coming the dead would actually rise fro m t heir graves in their physical bodi es.74 It i s clear, however, that Paul had a very different perspective. In commo n with the Gnost ics, he sees the resurrection as a spiritual event. He writes categorically: 'Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdo m o f God. '75 The Gnost ic sage Theodo tus calls Paul 'the apostle of the resurrection' .76 Li ke the Gnostics, Paul does not see the resurrection as a promised future event, but as a spiritual experience that can happen right now. He writes, 'This is it: the duly appointed time! This is it:"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"the day ofsalvat ion.'77 His message is clearly mystical and allegorical -he writes of being 'raised up to heaven' and 'enthroned with Jesus' not as some hoped -for afterlife reward, but as something which he and other Christ ian init iates have already experien ced.78 Like the Gnosti cs, Paul preaches that Jesus' passio n is not an event in the past, but a perennial myst ical realit y. Through sharing in Jesus' death and resurrection each Christ ian init iate can themselves die to their lower self and be resurrected a s the Christ or Logos.79 In his Letter to the Philippians Paul writes of 'participat ing in his suffering' and 'sharing in the form of his death', and so being 'resurrected from the dead'.80 In his Letter to the Galatians he writes: 'I have been crucified w it h Christ: from now on I live no more, instead Christ lives in me.'81 In his Letter to the Romans he interprets Jesus' passio n allegori cally , wri ting: 'All o f us who were init iated into Jesus Christ were init iated into his death as well. By being init iated into his death, we were buried wit h him, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of his Father, so we might walk in the freshness of a new life. Because if we have grown into the likeness of his death, we shall do the same wit hhis resurrect ion. This much we know: that the old was crucified with him, that sin's body was destroyed to keep us from being the slaves ofsin any more.'82 In his Letter to the Colossians Paul describes himself as having been assigned by God the task of delivering his message 'in full'; o f announcing 'the secret hidden for long ages and through many generat ions' which is now being disclosed to those chosen by God. And what is this great secret? Is it, as we might expect fro m an o rthodox apostle, the 'goo d news' that Jesus had literally co me and walked the Earth, worked miracles, died for our sins and returned from the dead? No! It is the perennial myst icism o f Gnost icism and the Pagan Mysteries -that wi thin each one of us is the one Soul of the Universe, the Logos, the Universal Daemo n, the Mind of God. Paul writes: 'The secret is this: Christ in you!'83 When Paul describes his famous visio n o f Jesus on the road to Damascus it is significant that he doesn't say 'God revealed his Son to me', as we would ex pect fro m a Literalist Christ ian. Rather, he writes, 'God revealed his Son in me.'84 Paul's Jesus is not an historical figure, but a symbo l o f the Universal Daemo n of who m we are all limbs. For Paul, 'Christ is like a single body with its many limbs and o rgans, which, many as they are together make up one body.'85 In his Letter to the Ephesians he teaches: 'Let each of you speak the truth with your neighbour because we are parts of each other.'86 The Gnost ics claimed that Paul taught that seeing Jesus as a flesh and blood man was only a transi tory stage for beginners -the Outer Mysteries for Psychic Christians. Those Pneumat ic Chr istians init iated into the Inner Mysteries understood the Jesus story's allegorical meaning. The Gnostics claimed that this ch ange of perspect ive through init iat ion int o the Inner Mysteries is what Paul was referring to when he wrote: 'Even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know Him so no more.’ 87 Since Paul never claimed to have known an historical Jesus In the flesh', it is indeed difficult to see what else he could have meant!"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"PSYCHIC AND PNEUMATIC TEACHINGS So how could Paul have co me to be both the hero of the Gnostics and the Literalists? As we have already explored, the Gnostics taught that the Jesus s tory works on two levels at once: as an int roductory story for Psy chic Christ ians init iated into the Outer Mysteries and as a myst ical allegory for Pneumat ic Christ ians init iated into the Inner Mysteries. Alt hough it was understood in t wo com pletely' diffe rent ways, the story remained the same. According to the Gnostics, Paul's letters were likewise designed to work on two levels. As the Gnostic sage Theodotus puts it, Paul 'taught in two ways at once'.8S Theodotus claims that Paul recognized that 'each on e knows the Lord in his own way: and not all know him alike'.89 So on the one hand he preached the saviour 'according to the flesh' as one 'who was born and suffered'. This 'kerygmat ic gospel' of 'Christ crucified' he taught to Psy chic Christ ians 'because this they were capable of knowing'.911 But to Pneumat ic Chr istians he proclaimed Christ 'pneumat ically' or 'according to the spirit'.91 Each level o f init iate would take fro m t hese teachings whatever they were wise enough to be able to hear. Paul himself w rites: 'The Psychic does not receive the things of the spirit of God; they are foolishness to him, -he cannot recogni se them, because they are Pneumatically discerned, but the Pneumat ic d iscerns all things.'92 The Gnost ics claimed that like the gospel par ables, Paul's letters encoded secret teachings so that uninit iated readers would hear one thing and the init iated another. Only those who had been init iated into the secret oral teachings of the Inner Mysteries were capable of understanding Paul's deeper m eaning. As Elaine Pagels writes, ‘'The Valent inians claim that most Christ ians make the mistake of reading the scri ptures only literally . They themselves, through their init iat ion int o Gnosis, learned to read Paul's letters (as they read all the scripture s) on the symbo lic level, as they say Paul intended. Only this pneumat ic reading yields \"the truth\" instead ofits mere outward \"image\".'93 The fo llo wers of Valent inus systemat ically decoded the allegorical meaning of Paul's letters to show their hidden m eaning. For example, in his letters to the Romans Paul uses a simple everyday situat ion -the rel ationship between Jews and Gent iles -as a parable for the relation between Psy chic and Pneumat ic Christians. An init iate of the Inner Mysteries would understa nd that where Paul writes 'Jews' he means 'Psychic Christ ians' and where he writes 'Gent iles', he means 'Pneumat ic Christ ians'.94 As well as 'Gentiles', the other code words used by Paul to signify 'Pneumat ic Christ ian' include 'the uncircumcised', 'the Gr eeks', 'Jews inwardly', 'Jews in secret' and 'the true Israel'.95 In a striking passage in his First Letter to the Corinthians Paul writes wit h disappo int me nt ofwant ing to give his follo wers Pneumat ic t eachings, but finding them only to be on a 'Sarkic' level of awareness (a term syno nymous with 'Hylic', meaning the lowest level o f hu man awareness). So he is forced to teach his students only the most basic o f Chr istian doctri nes: 'And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to Pneumat ics, but as to Sarkics, as to th ose uninit iated in Christ. I fed you milk, not meat, for you were not yet able to take it. Nor are you now -you are still Sarkic. For where there is strife and envy amo ng you, are you not Sarkic?'96"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Paul is impat ientthat hi s fo llo wers ar e still not ready to move on from elementary teachings. In his Letter to the Hebrews he writes: 'Therefore let us leave behind the elementary doctrine of Christ and progress to another level o f init iat ion [ten teleioteta), not laying again a foundat ion of repentance fro m dead works and of fait h towards God, with teachings of bapt ism, laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. For it is impossible for those who have been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have b eco me partakers of the holy breath [ho ly sp irit], and have tasted the goodness of God's Logos, and the powers of the age to come, to have fallen back to renew repentance again. They re -crucify for themselves the Son of God.97 The 'elementary doctri ne' whi ch Paul wants his disciples to leave behind, as a Gnostic would expect, includes repentance, fait h, bapt ism,the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgement -all t he rituals and dogmas so precious to the Literalist Church. To th e Gnostics these were only the Psychic Outer Mysteries of Christi ani ty. Paul wants his disciples, having tasted the holy breath of Pneumat ic init iat ion, to progress to the Pneumat ic level o f understanding co mp letely and leave behind such Psychic concerns. PAUL AND JEHOVAH Like the Gnosti cs, Paul teaches that the Mysteries of Jesus supersede the Law of the Jewish god Jehovah.98 Jesus has given Jews a New Covenant or agreement with God and Paul does not hide his low opinio n of the redundant old agreement that is t radi tional Judaism!99 He wri tes: 'Calling this the \"new\" agreement already makes the first one the \"old\" one, and something so ant iquated and creaky won't be around much longer .’100 Like the Gnosti cs, Paul does not preach moral servitude to the Law, but spiritual freedo m through Gnosis. He declares: 'Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedo m”.101 For Paul, 'Nothing is unclean i n it self .’102 Later Gnostics, such as Carpocrates, quote Paul to defend their own doctrines of natural moralit y again st those who accused them of immoralit y.After all, it was Paul , not som e 'loony' Gnostic heretic, who had famously proclaimed: 'All things are authorised for m e'!’103 Paul even goes so far as to declare Jehovah's traditio nally sacred Law, the very basis of the Jewish religio n, to be a curse, writing, 'All who depend upon works of the Law are under a curse ’104 and 'Christ redeemed us fro m t he curse of the Law.'105 For Paul, as for the Gnostics, through sharing in Christ's suffering and resurrect ion the Chr istian init iate can be redeemed fro m the Law and set free: 'Now, having died, we are out of the purview of the Law that kept us down.'106 Paul claims the Law is the product of the 'mediator'. What does he mean by calling Jehovah, supposedly the one God an d lord of all, a 'mediator ’? I f so , a mediator between what and what? The Gnostics claimed that Paul is teaching the Gnostic doctrine that Jehovah is the 'demiurge', a lesser god who mediates between the ineffable supreme God and creation. Paul"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"certainly does not regard Jehovah as the true God, for he continues: 'The mediator is not one, - God i s one.'107 According to Paul, people who do not understand the gospel he is preaching have had their 'unbelieving minds blinded by the god of this passing age'.108 I n ma ny translat ions of his letters, the editor adds a helpful little note here to explain the mysterious phrase 'the god of this passing age'. The general orthodox gloss on this line is that Paul is referring to the Devil, but why he should re fer to a wick ed angel as a 'god’ is left unexplained! To the Gnostics it was obvious what Paul meant. He was referring to Jehovah, the lesser god of the Jews, whose years ofruling the Jewish people were co ming to an end and who was to be abandoned in favour of the tru e ineffable God of Jesus and Plato. AXE -WIELDING CIRCUMCISIONARIES! The ant i-Gnosti c letters of Paul have been found to be forgeries, but his authent ic letters do oppose others within the early Christ ian Church who preach 'another Jesus ’.109 These are not Gnostic heret ics, however, but pro -Jewish Christ ians who believe that the Church should maintain the o ld Jewish custom o f c ircumcisio n and honour the Law of Jehovah. Paul attacks them with passion. In his Letter to the Philippians he warns: 'Watch out for those dogs, those evil operators, those axe -wielding ci rcum cisi on aries! ’110 In his Letter to the Gal atians he proclaims: 'Mark my words: I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcisio n Chr ist will do you no good at all .’111 and quips, 'As for these a gitators, they had better go the who le way and make eunuchs of themselves!’ 112 It i s not such outer Psychic observances of religious rituals, but inner Pneumat ic qualit ies which mark the Mysteries Paul is preaching. He claims: 'We are the circumcised, we whose worship is Pneumat ic [spiritual], whose pride is in Jesus Christ, and who put no c onfidence in anyt hing external.’ 113 Paul's teachings here are completely in line with those of the Gnostic Jesus. In The Gospel o f Thomas, for example, when the discip les ask Jesus about the benefits of circumcisio n, he explains: 'If it were beneficial, their father would beget them already circumcised from their mo ther. Rather the true circumcisio n in spir ithas become co mp letely profi table. ’114 What characterizes Pa ul's rival Christ ians is not th eir Gnost icism as opposed to Paul's Literalism, or thei r Li teralism as opposed to Paul's Gnosticism. This is not the issue at all. Their disagreement i s over the relationship between Christians and old Jewish traditions, and whether Chr istianit y should be open to non -Jews, and if so in what way. The battles in the Church of Paul's t ime were not between Literalists and Gnostics, but between Christ ians wi thdifferent views on the relat ionship between Christ ianit y a nd Judaism. Paul's letters suggest that these more tradit ional Jewish -Christ ians live in Jerusalem. They are usually assumed to be Peter and others of Jesus ’disciples who are ment ioned in the New Testam ent.

Actually the evidence suggests that the Jerusalem Christians had always been Gnostics, because in the first century the Christ ian commun it y w as made up ent irely o f d ifferent types of Gnosticism! CONCLUSION So was Paul a Gnostic? Let's review a litt le o f w hat we have discovered: • The Gnostics claimed that their spiritual lineage stemmed fro m P aul and that they were privy to secret oral teachings taught by Paul to select disciples. • Gnostics had many gospels which they attributed to Paul, their 'Great Apostle ’. • Many Gnostic groups claimed Paul as their founding fat her. • By the middle of the second century the communit ies to whi ch Paul had written his letters are known to have been centres of Marcionite Gnosticism. • Paul's anti -Gnosti c Pastoral letters are fakes, forged in the late second century. In the genuine letters Paul is no t anti -Gnosti c and never ment ions an historical Jesus. • Literalist Christ ians of the early second century attack Paul , who they claim 'contradi cts' the true teaching and is the 'adversary' o f Jesus. • Paul was born in Tarsus, a major centre for the Pagan Mysteries, and often uses terms from the Mysteri es in his letters. He even calls himself a 'Steward of the My steri es o f God', the term for a pri est in the Pagan Mysteri es of Serapis. Paul quotes Pagan sages and teaches Pagan doctrines. • When properly translated, Paul's letters reveal a powerful Gnostic content. Paul regul arly uses Gnostic term s. He is a teacher of a Pneumat ic init iati on. He journeyed myst ically to the third heaven. He teaches that Jesus came only in the 'likeness' of flesh. He is disparaging of external religion. He describes the scriptures as ' allegori es' and 'symbo lic'. He rejects the Law of Jehovah, who he calls 'the mediator' and 'the god ofthi s passing age'. • Whilst the Literalists saw the resurrection as the promise that they woul d ri se fro m t heir graves and experience bodily immortalit y after the Second Coming, Paul teaches the Gnostic doctrine that the resurrection is a myst ical experience that can be had here and now. • The great secret that Paul claims to be able to reveal is not that Jesus literally walked theEarth, but the myst ical revelat ion of 'Christ in you'. • The Gnostics claimed that, like the gospels, Paul's letters encoded secret teachings. Paul taught in 't wo ways at once': the Outer Mysteries to Psychic init iates and the Inner Mysteries to"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Pneumat ic init iates. Paul's letter s can be understood in different ways because they were designed to speak on different levels simultaneously. • Paul is frustrated with his disciples because they are not ready to abandon 'elementary' Chr istianit y and move on to the deeper level. All o f the evidence strongly suggests that Paul was indeed a Gnostic -just as the Gnostics them selves had claimed all alo ng. Yet, upon reflection we felt that to call Paul a Gnostic was, in a sense, misleading. The more we looked at the evidence we had uncovered , the more it seemed that to apply the terms 'Gnostic ’and 'Literalist' to the Christ ianit y o f the fir st century was actually meaningless. From Paul's letters it is clear that the Christ ian communit y of this period was deeply divided, yet this schism was n ot between Gnostics and Literalists, as was the case by the end of the second century. Paul is neither ant i-Gnostic nor pro -Gnostic, because in his day the great schism between Gnost ics and Literalists had yet to occur. Atthe time of Paul, the strands of thought that would beco me Gnost icism and Literalism were harmoniously coexist ing as the Inner and Outer teachings of the Jesus Mysteries. The theol ogi cal battle that Paul is engaged in is between those init iates of the Jesus Mysteries who want to maintain a tradi tional and dist inct ively Jewish ident it y and those, like himself, who wish to make their new Mysteries co mp letely 'modern' and cosmopolitan. Paul has all the characterist ics we would expect to find in an init iator of the Jesus Mysteri es. This was powerful confirmat ion of the Jesus Mysteries Thesis. When a theory is true, everyt hing starts to fall into place. Our new visio n of the origins o f C hristianit y e xplained the evidence, was internally consistent, beautifully simple and wonderfully ironic. Th ere was still something that worried us, however. The Jesus Mysteries Thesis proposed that the Jews had created their own versio n of the ancient Mysteries with Jesus as their Osiris -Dionysus. How coul d thi s have happened? The tradi tional history paints a picture of the Jews as an insular people, separate and distinct from the other Mediterranean cultures, staunchly nationalist ic and fanat ically devoted to their religion, fiercely lo yal to thei r one god Jehovah and ent irely hostile to the Paganism o f their nei ghbours.

Actually by the t ime that Jesus is supposed to have lived, Judea, like so many other countries o f the time, had adopted much of Greek culture and beco me 'Hellenized'.2 An hour's walk fro m Nazareth in Galilee, where Jesus is supposed to have grown up, was the Hellenized cit y o f Sepphoris, which contained a theatre with a beaut iful mosaic of Dionysus.3 Gadara, a day's walk fro m Nazareth, contained an important school of Pagan philosophy.4 Scy thopolis, on the southern border of Galilee, was a centre for the My steri es of Dionysus5 and was even said to have been founded by the godman himself.6 Jerusalem was surrounded by thoroughly Hellenized cit ies, such as Larissa and Ascalo n, which produced a stream ofeminent Pagan philosopher s whose renown spread as far as Ro me.7 A Jewish scripture called 2 Maccabees records that the Temple of Jerusalem itself was transformed into a Greek temple to Zeus and fest ivals of Dionysus were celebrated.8 The high pri est Jason built a Greek -style gymna sium -a Pagan 'universit y' fo r physical, intellectual and spi ritual educat ion -alo ngside the Temple which clearly appealed to Jewish clergy more than their tradi tional ways. According to 2 Maccabees: 'The priests no longer showed any enthusiasm for thei r duti es at the al tar, they treated the Temple with disdain, they neglected the sacrifices and whenever the opening gong called them they hurried to jo in in t he sports at the wrestling school in defiance of the Law.'9 This process of integration between J ewish and Pagan culture had been going on for centuries. The history ofthe ancient Jews is one of repeated conquest by other nations: in 922 BCE by the Egy pti ans; in 700 BCE by the Assyrians; in 586 BCE by the Babylo nians; in 332 BCE by the Greeks under A lexander the Great; in 198 BCE by the Syrians; and finally in 63 BCE by the Rom ans, who com pletely destroy ed the state of Judea in 112 CE.° These conquests inevitably led to the Jewish people co ming under the cultural influence of their conquerors as well as Jews beco ming dispersed throughout the Mediterranean as slaves, forming the so -called 'Diaspora'. Those who regained their freedo m became integrated with Pagan civilizat ion and even when theyhad the chance to return from exile to their homeland, the ma joritychose not to.11 Jews of the Diaspora integrated Pagan spiritualit y with their own religious tradit ions. In Babylo n, for example, Jews became famous for their practice o f Babylo nian astrology . The great patri arch Abraham himself was a Babylo nian Jew who was said to have been well -versed in astrol ogi cal doctrines.12 Indeed, eminent Jews such as the historian Josephus and the philosophers Aristobulus and Philo make the outrageous claim that Abraham invented astrol ogy .13 Jews even adopted the Pagan Mys teri es.

The truth i s that different Jews adopted different posit ions towar ds Pagan culture. Some were tradi tional fundamentalists. Others enthusiast ically adopted Pagan ways. Many sought to synthesize their own tradit ions wit h Paganism and have the best of both worlds. COSMOPOLITAN ALEXANDRIA The greatest integration of Jewish and Pagan cultures occurred in Alexandria in Egypt. When Alexander the Great conquered Egypt at the end of the fourth century BCE, the Jews helped him by act ing as spies and mercenaries. They were rewarded by being allowed to inhabit their own quarter of t he new cit y o f Alexandria which Alexander founded. This init iated a mass vo luntary migration o f Jews into the cit y,where they enjo yed all the benefit s of sophist icated Pagan cul ture.24 It i s thought that up to half o f the original population o f Alexandria were Jews.2S From the very start Al exandri a was a cosmo -polis -a 'universal cit y'. Alexander had created a vast empire wit hin which Greek became the commo n la nguage and people fro m ever y race journeyed to Alexandria to beco me cit izens of this new mult i-racial ci ty. Ptol emy I, the first rul er of Alexandria, decided to create a small Greece in Egypt.26 Under his enlightened rulership a library and museum were founded which systematically co llected together the knowledge of the ancient world. At its height, the library housed hundreds of thousands of scro lls -som e say perhaps more than half a millio n scro lls and papyri.27 Alexandria became the greatest centre of learning in the ancient world, replacing even Athens. In Alexandria the Mysteries o f Osir is-Dionysus reached new heights. The myst ical pageant of El eusis was developed into an even grander dramat ic spectacle, performed in many acts on mult i-level stages.28 Unlike in Athens, the Mysteries practised in Alexandria were not even protected by a rule of s ecrecy , so any on e could attend these great myst ical rites.29 Such a cosm opoli tan and tolerant environment naturally encouraged the merging and combining of different spiritual traditions.30"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"The Jewish populat ion could not help but come under the spell of the sophist icated Pagan cul ture they encountered in Alexandria. The religious taboos of tradi tional Jews prevented them attending public banquets, fest ivals and the theatre, because of their associat ions wi th Paganism.31 This cut them off fro m t he immense advantages of being a part of the great civilizat ion t hat surrounded them. Not surprisingly, therefore, large numbers of Jews chose to break with their traditions and attempted to integrate themselves into Pagan societ y.In a rem arkably short period, Jews abandoned their own tongue and adopted the universal Greek language.32 Aramaic and Hebrew continued to be spoken, because of constant immigrat ion of Jews fro m Judea into Egypt, but Greek became the dominant language, not only in dealings with other nationa l groups in the cit y,but wi thin the Jewish co mmunit y it self. It was even used in the services of the synagogue and in family worship.33 By the second century BCE, this process of cultural assimilat ion had gone so far that a Jewish playwright, Ezekiel, re wrote the Jewish scripture of the Exodus as a Greek tragedy in the language and st yle of Euripides!34 The Jewish intelligentsia wanted to reconcile their ancestral fait h with the wisdom o f other peoples. They questio ned the fundamentalist view of their scr ipt ures as literal history and began to interpret them as myst ical allegories.35 Using this technique borrowed from the Pagan sages, Jewish philosophers were able to interpret their scri ptures in line wit h Greek thought.36 Under their influence Jewish phil osophy blosso med and the Alexandrian rabbis, beco ming known as the 'Light of Israel', were highly esteemed by Jews everywhere.37 Jewish fundamentalists saw their god Jehovah as a tribal deit y w ho had helped them throughout thei r history to achi eve victory over their oppressors and who was in complete opposit ion to Paganism. The Hellenized Jews of Alexandria, however, portrayed Jehovah as a universal God, ident ical with Plato's' visio n of the supreme Oneness.38 To avoid accusat ions fro m fe llow Jews that th eywere abandoning their own traditions, Hellenized Jews began to claim that Pagan philo sophy was ori ginally Jewish! Hermippus asserted that Py thagoras had received his wisdo m from the Jews.39 Aristobulus developed this ludicrous idea, announcing that Plat o and Aristotle had borrowed from Moses.40 Artapanus wrote an historical fantasy in which he equated Moses with Hermes Trismegistus, the myt hical founder of the Egypt ian Mysteries, and with Musaeus, the myt hical founder of the Greek Mysteri es.41 Alt hough a bsurd, such ideas made it easier for Jews to retain their national dignit y whilst at the same time adopting the philo sophy oftheir Pagan neighbours and participat ing in cosm opoli tan society . HELLENIZED JEWISH SCRIPTURES In claiming a Jewish ancestry for t he wisdo m o f the Pagan Mysteries, Hellenized Jews portrayed Paganism and Judaism as essent ially parts of the same religious tradit ion. This just ified them int roducing Pagan concepts and philo sophy int o Judaism . In the second century, the Hebrew scri ptures were translated into Greek under the influence of Platonic philo sophy .42 Hellenized Jews also wrote a number of new spiritual texts which demo nstrate the interpenetration of Jewish and Pagan ideas.43 Written between the Jewish Old Testament and the Christ ian New Testam ent, they are known as 'inter -testam ental' works. The Letter of Ahsteas, for example, equates Jehovah and Zeus, and argues for harmony between Jews and Greeks, who are portrayed as sharing one culture and one visio n o f the Good Life.44 A mo dern scho lar writes of another such text, called 4 Maccabees:"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"'This text is a wonder of contradict ions, or should we say, reso lut ion o f contradi ctions. It is ostensibly directed against a Greek tyrant, Ant iochus IV, by a devout orthodox Jew, yet it is writ ten in exquisite Greek by a philosopher trained in Greek thought, and its methods of argument are those of Socrates .’45 The Books of Enoch also draws on Pagan motifs. These scriptures were attributed to the ancient Jewish Patriarch Enoch, but in the hands ofHellenized Jews he becomes a grand myt ho logical figure, equated with the legendary Egypt ian sage Hermes Trismegistus.46 One scho lar notes: 'In t heir wondrous and transcendent poetic visio n, these documents contain universal stories and preoccupations w hich relate them to other great myt hs of the ancient world/47 This inter -testamental 'Wisdo m L iterature' no longer divides humanit y int o Jews and Gentiles, but rather into the 'wise and foolish'. It stresses spiritual piet y r ather than obedience to the Law s ofMoses and portrays Jehovah not as a Jewish god, but as Lord of the who le Earth.48 Jews even created their own versio n of the Pagan Sibylline Oracles. The original Pagan oracl es were attributed to the Sibyl, a prophetess believed to be centuries o ld w ho, in a state of ecstasy , spoke the words of God. Somet ime in the second century BCE, an Alexandrian Jew invented a Jewish Sibyl and co mposed her sayings in perfect Greek hexameters.49 Jewish inter -testamental literature often personifies wisdo m as 'Soph ia', as did the ancient Pagans. As a modern scho lar notes, this 'is entirely Greek and has no counterpart in orthodox Jewish theo logy'.50 The Jewish Sophia appears from as early as the third century BCE, when she is described as Jehovah's consort in the Bo ok of Proverbs.51 Three centuries later, echoing Pagan Mystery doctri nes, the Jewish philosopher Philo wrote of Moses as 'the child o f parents incorruptible and who lly free fro m st ain, his father being God, who is likewise Father of all, and his mother Sop hia, through who m t he universe came into existence'. For Philo, as for the Gnostics, Sophia is the 'Mother of the Logos'.52 The central role given to the Divine Feminine by t he Pagan philosophers, the Hellenized Jews of the inter -testamental peri od and lat er by the Gnostics, is strong evidence for a direct line of evolut ion linking these three traditions together. THE MYSTERIES OF MOSES Clearly then, Hellenized Jews wanted to integrate the wisdo m o f the Pagan Mysteries with their own spiritual traditions. B ut did they create a specifically Jewish versio n of the Mysteries as the Jesus Mysteries Thesis predicts? The clues we need to answer this quest ion are found in the works of Philo of Alexandria (20 BCE -40 CE), a well respected Jewish leader and famous Jew ish philosopher.53 Philo was devoted to his nat ive Judaism, but was also thoroughly Hellenized and obsessed with Pagan philosophy. He writes of philosophers as an international brotherhood of world cit izens who 'dwell in the cosmos as their cit y', looking after all alike, and eulogizes: 'Such men, though comparat ively few in number, keep alive the covered spark of Wisdom secretly, throughout the cit ies of the world, in order that Virtue may not be abso lut ely quenched and vanish fro m o ur human kind.'54 Amo ngst the ancients, Philo particularly revered Pyt hagoras and his fo llo wer Pl ato, whom he called 'the great' and 'the most sacred'.55 The Christian philo sopher Clement of Alexandria refers to Philo as 'the Pythagorean'.56 Like all fo llo wers of Py thagoras, P hilo was well versed in music,"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"geom etry and astrology , as well as Greek literature fro m every age.57 Also, like other Py thagoreans, he was immersed in the myst icism of the Pagan Mysteries.58 Philo uses what he calls 'the method of the Mysteries' to reveal Jewish scriptures as allegori es encoding secret spiritual teachings.59 He interprets the 'historical' story of Moses and the Exodus as a myst ical metaphor for the path that leads through this world to God. The guide on this journey is the familiar Pagan f igure of the 'Logos'. For Philo, as for the sages of the Mysteri es, the Logos is 'the only and belo ved Son of God'.60 Like the sages of the Mysteries, he teaches that the wonders of the visible world are designed to lead humans to the experience of myst ica l unio n with God.61 Philo did not only adopt the philo sophy ofthe Mysteri es, but claimed to be an init iate himself62 -but not of the Pagan Mysteries, however. He encouraged Jews not to participate in Pagan init iat ions, as they had thei r own specifically Jewish Mysteries: the Mysteries o f Mo ses!63 According to Philo, Moses was the great init iator, 'a hierophant of the ritual and teacher of divine things'. Philo also calls himself a hierophant and init iator in the Jewish Mysteries.64 He writes of 'teaching init iation to those init iates worthy ofthe mo st sacred init iations'.65 As in the Pagan Mysteri es, his init iates formed a secret myst ical sect and were required to be morally pure. As in the Pagan Mysteries, they were sworn to never reveal the 'veritably sacred Mysteries' to the uninit iated, lest the ignorant should misrepresent what they did not understand and in so doing expose the Mysteries to the ridicule of the vulgar. For Philo, init iat ion was the entrance to a new world, an invisible country, the w orl d of ideas where 'the purified mind could contemplate the pure and untainted* nature of those things which are invisible and only discernible by the intellect'.66 As in the Pagan Mysteries, the purpose was for the init iate to become transformed into a d ivine being through the experience of religious ecstasy. In the manner of the Mysteries, Philo writes of enthousiazein (being divinely inspired), korubantian (being myst ically frenzied), bakeuein (being seized by divine madness), katechesthai (being posses sed by the deit y)and ekstasis (ecstasy).67 He compares the ecstasy of the init iates of the Jewish Mysteries to both prophetic inspiration and the divine frenzy of init iates of the Mysteries of Dionysus. He writes: 'Go out from yourself filled wit h divine frenzy like those possessed in the myst ical rites of Dio nysus, and possessed by the deit y a fter the manner of propheti c inspirat ion. For when the mind is no longer self -contained but rapt and frenzied with a heavenly passio n t his is your inheritance.'68 THE FIRST CHRISTIANS? Philo 's works survived the mass destruction of ancient texts by the Ro ma n Church because of a strange quirk of history. Bishop Eusebius, the fourth -century Church propagandist, could find little evidence from which to construct a histo ryof Christ ianit y,so he eagerly seized upon a descript ion in one of Philo 's books, of a group of Jews called the Therapeutae.69 Philo 's descript ion of their spring festival is reminiscent of the Christ ian celebrat ion of Easter70 and Eusebius, therefore, claimed that he had discovered the earliest Christ ians in Alexandria.71 He asserted that the officials of the Therapeutae were the first bishops, priests and deacons, and that no one can fail to see in these men the first Christ ians.72 The spring, of cour se, was also the time when Pagans celebrated their fest ival of the dying and resurrecting godman, so Eusebius is unjustified in his assumption. Philo wrote about the Therapeutae in 10 CE, which would be 20 years before the supposed date of the crucifixio n,"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"so we can safely conclude that the Therapeutae are not the early Literalist Christ ians that Eusebius would have us believe.73 Yet, ironically, Eusebius might well have been right in a way which he would never have intended.74 For the Therapeutae are a gro up of Jews clearly practi sing a Jewish versio n of the Pagan Mysteries -exactly the sort -ofgroup the Jesus Mysteri es Thesis proposes synthesized the Jesus story from the myt hs of Osiris -Dionysus. We can tell that the Therapeutae were Jews because they c elebrated the Jewish festival o f the Pentecost and kept sacred the Sabbath.75 Yet in every other way, they resembled a Py thagorean communit y. As in Pythagorean co mmunit ies, the Therapeutae dressed in white, shared all their goods in co mmo n76 and admitted w om en as equals because they 'possessed the same eager desire and had made the same deliberate cho ice as the men ’.77 Phil o tells us about the Therapeutae in a book called On the Contemplative Life. The contemplat ive life' was a phrase used by Pythagoreans t hroughout the ancient world to describe the way o f life in their mo nasti c co mmunit ies.78 Indeed, Philo tells us that the Therapeutae were a 'race of men found in many parts of the inhabited world, in both the Greek and non -Greek worl d, sharing in the perfe ct Good ’.79 As already discussed, Philo was himself k nown as 'the Pythagorean’ and he writes of the Therapeutae in the language of myst ical mathematics characteristic o f the fo llo wers o f Py thagoras: 'In t he first place they all co me together at the end o f every seventh week, for they reverence not only the simple period of seven days, but also the period of the square of seven, since they know that the seven is pure and ever -virgin. ’80 ‘Th eir seventh day fest ival then is only a prelude to their greatest f east, which is assigned to the fift ieth, the most holy and natural of numbers, the sum o f the powers of the perfect right -angled triangle, which has been appointed as the origin o f the generat ion of the cosmic elements. ’81 Like the ancient Pagan sages, Ph ilo contrasts the unintelligent worship of externals by the misinstructed in all religio ns wi ththe worship of the true God by those, like the Therapeutae, who fo llo w the contemplat ive life.82 Like Pagan init iates, the Therapeutae saw the literal int erpret ation of their scriptures as only an outer covering, concealing secret myst ical meaning. They believed that: 'The exegesis of the sacred writings treats the inner meaning conveyed in allegory .783 Philo writes: 'The who le int erval fro m dawn to sunset they devote to thei r exercise. Taking the sacred writ ings they spend their time in philosophising and interpreting their ancestral code allegorically, for they think that the words of the literal meaning are symbo ls of a hidden nature which is made plain only b y t he under - meaning.'84 Philo even specifically co mpares the divine calling received by members of the Therapeutae to the myst ical enthusiasm experienced by init iates of the Mysteries of Dio nysus: 'They who betake themselves to the divine service do so n ot because of any custom or on someone's advice or appeal, but carried away wit h heavenly lo ve, like those init iated into the Mysteri es of Dio nysus, -theyare afire with God until they beho ld t he object of their love. ’85"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Describing the coming together of separate groups of men and women in the rites of the Therapeutae, Philo writes: 'When each band has feasted apart by itself, drinking of God -pleasing nectar, just as in the rites ofDionysus men drink the wine unmixed, then they jo in together, and one cho rus is formed of the two bands, in imitat ion of the jo ined chorus on the banks of the Red Sea because of the wonderful works that had been there wrought. ’86 That Philo can, in one sentence, compare the Therapeutae to both init iates of the Mysteries of Dionysus and the fo llo wers o f Mo ses on the banks of the Red Sea shows just how integrated Pagan and Jewish traditions had beco me. Such passages can leave us in no doubt that certain Jews had indeed embraced Paganism and co mbined it with Judaism to produce a s pecifically Jewish versio n of the ancient Mysteries. Here, then, we have found exactly the sort of communit y w hich could have produced the Mysteri es of Jesus. And they live exactly where we would expect them to -near that great melt ing -pot of Pagan and J ewish cultures, Alexandria. Philo tells us: 'In Egy pt there are crowds of them in every province and especially round Alexandria. For they who are in every way the mo st hi ghly advanced come as col onists, as it were, to the Therapeutic fatherland, to a sp ot exceedingly well adapted for the purpose, perched on a fairly high terrace overlooking Lake Mareotis, immediately south of Alexandria .’87 Lake Mareotis is a few miles fro m where Herodotus witnessed the celebration of the Mysteries ofOsi ris before tens ofthousands o f people 500 years previously.88 Here, Philo tells us, the Therapeutae were also 'init iated into the My steri es of the sanctified life'89 and, just like the sages ofthe Pagan Mysteries before them and the Gnostic Christ ians after them, sough t to di rect ly experience 'that which is better than the Good and purer and more ancient than the One'. 90 CONCLUSION Alt hough it may at first have seemed unlikely that Jews could have adopted the Pagan Mysteries, thi s is clearly exactly what happened. If i t were not for our Christ ian culture, which portrays the Jews as dist inct fro m and in opposition to the Pagan civilizations all around them, this would not seem so extraordinary. Every other culture in the Mediterranean had embraced the Mysteries. It was i nevitable that, sooner or later, Hellenized Jews would also integrate this universal myst icism w it h Judaism. Let's review so me o f the evidence: • Pagan and Jewish cultures have met and integrated throughout history. • By the time that Jesus is supposed to have lived, Galilee was surrounded by Hellenized ci ties, which were the ho me o f e minent Pagan philosophers and centres for the Mysteries of Dionysus. • In Babylo n Jews were renowned for their knowledge of Pagan astrol ogy and pract iced the Mysteri es of Tam muz. These Mysteries are recorded in the OldTestament as having been practi sed by Jews in Jerusalem itself. Jews associated Jehovah with Osiris -Dionysus and were expelled fro m Ro me fo r introducing the Mysteries of Sabazius."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"• Jews adopted the Greek languag e, jo ined Greek gymnasia, rewrote the Exodus as a Greek -style play, transl ated Jewish scripture under the influence of Pagan philo sophy and wrote new scri ptures combining Jewish and Pagan motifs. • Jewish philosophers claimed that Greek philosophers had re ceived their wisdo m fr om the Ol d Testam ent prophet Moses, thus portraying Paganism and Judaism as essent ially parts of the same religious tradit ion. • Philo the Pythagorean claimed to be a hierophant in the Mysteri es of Moses, which resemble the Pagan Myst eri es. • The Therapeutae are Jewish Pythagoreans. • Like init iates of the Pagan Mysteries, the Therapeutae believed that their myt hs encoded secret myst ical truths. • Philo co mpares the Therapeutae to the fo llo wers of Dionysus. • The Therapeutae lived by a lake near Alexandria where the Mysteries of Osiris had been cel ebrated for hundreds ofyears. Were the Therapeutae of Alexandria proto -Chr istians? Alexandria was the centre of Pagan myst icism in lat e ant iquit y,had the largest Jewish populat ion outsi de J udea and was the ho me o f the greatest masters of the Christ ian Gnosis during the first few centuries CE. Clement tells us that it was here that the Gospel of Mark, the earliest New Testament gospel, was written. It is the mo st obvi ous place for the Jesus M ysteries to have been created. Did the Therapeutae, having developed their own versio n of the ancient Mysteries, take the lo gical next step? Did they also adopt the Mystery myt h of Osiris -Dionysus and rework it as the story ofa Jewish dying and resurrect ing godman called Jesus? The answer is we simply do not know. However, that the Mysteries were being practised by Jews strongly supports the idea that som e such group of Jewish init iates, quite possibly the Therapeutae themselves; were responsible for crea ting the Jesus story. The myst ical wisdom o f the Mysteries was encoded in the myt h of Osiris -Dionysus. Surely itwoul d have been irresist ible, having created a specifically Jewish form of the Mysteries, not to al so adapt this great ancient myt h? Hellenize d Jews had rewritten the Exodus as a Greek play in the st yle of Euripides. Why not knew that the Jesus story was a myt h, but how had it com e to be interpreted as history? How had Paul's myt hical Christ become the man from Nazareth that is portrayed in the gospel s? Pagan stories of the dying and resurrecting godman did not claim to relate actual events, so why was the Jesus story presented as a literal biography? To answer these quest ions we decided to deconstruct the Jesus myt h it self, to discover how it had been created and how it had co me to be historicized. The key to understanding its construction, we realized, is to recognize something so obvious it is staggering that it is has been so easily missed. The hero of the Jewish Mystery myt h is a composite character. Jesus is a synthesis of two pre -exist ing mythical figures: the Pagan godman and the Jewish Messiah."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The Jesus M yth 'My favourite definit io n of religion is \"a misinterpretation of mytho logy.\" And the misinterpretation consists precisely in att ributing historical references to symbo ls which properly are spiritual in their reference.\" Joseph Campbell When Pyt hagoras and his fo llo wers introduced the Egy pti an Mysteries into Greece they did not simply set up a cult of Osiris. The Mysteries of Osiri s contained doctrines that were deeply heret ical in fift h-century BCE Athens, especially the idea that a god could die.2 So, to avoid simply being shunned and persecuted for introducing a foreign superst ition, the Py thagoreans transformed a minor Greek dei ty, Di onysus, into a Greek versio n of the might y figure of Osiris. In thi s way, the Greeks were introduced to the Egyptian Mysteries in a form which seemed indigenous to themselves.3 This approach was adopted by all other Mediterranean cultures which embra ced the Mysteries. They also transformed an indigenous deit y int o th e dying and resurrecting godman. A Jewish Py thagorean communit y such as Philo 's Therapeutae wishing to introduce the ancient Mysteries to the Jews would have faced very similar problems t o those encountered by the Pythagoreans five centuries previously. In order to make the Mysteries easily accessible to Jews they needed an indigenous myt ho logical figure they could transform into a Jewish Osiris - Dionysus. The Jews had dispensed with all g ods and goddesses, and worshipped only their one God, Jehovah. But whilst Jehovah could be equated with Plato's supreme Oneness, he did not have a my thologi cal biography like the Pagan gods which could be adapted to become the Osiris - Dionysus myt h. Unlike oth er cultures the Jews had no minor deit ies, so there was only one Jewish myt ho logical figure who could possibly be transformed into Osiris -Dionysus: the Messiah. The Hebrew word 'Messiah’ means 'Ano int ed’ , which in Greek is 'Christ'. The term was ori gin ally used to designate kings and high priests, who were ritually ano int ed with o il. In the Old Testam ent i t is frequent ly u sed to refer to the reigning king.4 In later years, when the Jews were a conquered and defeated people, it came to signify a future r edeemer who would come to free them fro m t heir oppressors and restore the Jewish state under a king of the line of their great King David.5 After the Roman occupation of Judea in 63 BCE the situation for the Jews became increasingly desperate and it seemed that only a cosmic act of God could break the vast Empire which persecuted them, so the Messiah came to be seen as a supernatural figure whose arrival woul d heral d the end of time.6 The construction of the Jesus story suggests that the creators of the Je wish Mysteries took the only option available to them and synt hesized the dying and resurrecting godman of the Mysteri es wit h t he Jewish Messiah. The gospels clearly state that Jesus is the Messiah. He is claimed to be born in Bethlehem fro m t he line of Da vid -just as the Messiah must be. He is called the Messiah by Peter.7 He is even named Joshua (Jesus in Greek), which was the expected name of the Messiah.8 Yet Jesus the Messiah is actually only a thin veil concealing the quite different figure of Jesus the dying and resurrecting godman. This is particularly clear fro m t he accounts of his birth. Both Matthew and Luke give us lo ng and detailed genealogies to show that Joseph is of the line o f David (see pp. 170 -1), yet both"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"ofthem also tell us that Jesus is not Joseph's son at all, but God's son. It is remarkable that so many co mmentators pass over the extraordinary contradict ion within these two gospels without offering any convincing explanat ion. Di d Matthew and Luke not realize the absurdit y o f w hat theywere saying? Even if it is a result of later additions and bad edit ing, surely such a paradox coul d not have been unintentionally allowed to remain in the gospels! The Jesus Mysteries Thesis, however, solves this otherwise strange enigma by suggest ing that the gospel wri ters were well aware of the contradict ion t hey were setting up. They knew that what they were wri ting was a myth encoding secret teachings. So, they each presented a genealogy to m ake i t appear that Jesus was the Jewish Messiah, son of D avid, whilst at the same time telling those 'with ears to hear' that Jesus was actually Osiris -Dionysus, the Son of God and a virgin mother. The genealogies given by Luke and Matthew are ent irely different because they are literary constructs and really have no importance. What matters is that through the vehicle o f the Messiah the Jews are given access to the Mystery teachings encoded in the myt h of Osiris - Dionysus. As Origen explains, 'breaks in the narrative structure, irrat ional and impossible situati ons' were all placed in the scriptures deliberately to make sure that readers did not get caught in the lowest literal interpretation for too long, for 'if the sequence and elegance of the narrative were obvious throughout, we would not believe that anythin g other than the obvious meaning could be meant in the scriptures'. 'Certain snares' and 'obstacles and impossibilit ies' are int erwoven into scripture to prevent the reader 'sticking to the letter, and not learning its more divine meaning'.9 In thi s manner , whilst conforming as much as possible to Jewish expectations about the Messiah, the Jesus story makes it plain that this is not his true identit y.10 For example, the Jewish Messiah was expected to be a warrior king come to liberate Judea from her enemies and reestablish the line o f David. Yet at his trial Jesus clearly announces: 'My kingdo m does not belong to this world. If it did, my fo llowers would be fighting to save me from arrest by the Jews. My kingly authorit y co mes fro m elsewhere.'11 When Peter tells Jesus he believes him to be the Messiah, Jesus neit her affirms nor denies it, but simply predicts that the Son of Man must die and resurrect. When Peter rebukes him because the Jewish Messiah cannot die in this way, Jesus rebukes him back, calling h im Satan! Peter is condemned for being unable to make the transit io n fro m t he Jewish idea of the saviour as victori ous Messiah to the Pagan concept ion of the saviour as sacrificed godman.12 For tradi tional Jews it was unthinkable that the Messiah, who was expected to ride in trium ph over all of Judea's enemies, could possibly die as a commo n criminal. Indeed, the Old Testam ent Book of Deuteronomy specifically says that 'Anyo ne hanged on a tree is accursed'13 - the very descript ion given by Peter as the fat e of Jesus.14 In Judaism the Messiah was not thought of as so meo ne who would save by his own sacrificial death. This is the role of Osiris - Dionysus. In his death and resurrection, therefore, Jesus is revealed not as the Jewish Messiah destined to bring mil itary victory and nat ional salvation, but as the godman of the Mysteries who brings spiritual victory and myst ical salvat ion. To help Jews over the major hurdle of Jesus' ignominious death and obvious lack of military triumph against their oppressors, Jes us is portrayed as claiming that he will return"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"again. Having acco mp lished the death and resurrection of Osiris -Dionysus, he promises an imminent Second Coming when he will return in glory to smite his enemies and fulfil the expectati ons of the Jewish Mes siah. JEWISH MYTHICAL MOTIFS Studying the Jesus story it is obvious that the creators of the Jesus Mysteries adapted pre -exist ing Jewish myt ho logyto m arry their myt h of the dying and resurrecting godman wit h Judaism. The Jewish meal o f Passover, for examp le, was transformed into the sacramental meal o f the Mysteri es simply by having Jesus offer bread and wine as symbo ls o f his body and blood. The Passover occurs in the Old Testament myt h of the Exodus in which Moses leads his peopl e fro m capt ivit y in Egyp t across the desert to the promised land. This was a favourite tale of Hellenized Jews, especially Philo, and forms the basis for a number pf elements in the Jesus story . Myst ical Jews understood the Exodus as an allegory of spiritual init iation. The Jewis h peopl e start off as 'captives' in Egypt, are 'called out of Egypt' by Moses and are finally led as the 'chosen people' to the promised land by the prophet Joshua. Here then are the three stages of init iat ion we have already found in both Gnosticism and t he Pagan Mysteries: the init iate is first a 'capt ive' (a Hylic), then is bapt ized to become one of the 'called' (a Psychic) and fina lly is init iated to become one of the 'chosen' (a Pneumat ic).15 Someone was regarded as 'capt ive' whilst ident ified wit h his body and blind to his true spiritual ident it y.Egy pt was seen as a metaphor for the body and to 'come forth out of Egypt' was seen as symbo lizing transcending ident ificat ion with the body. The miraculous crossing of the Red Sea was understood as a metapho r for baptism by water. A bapt ized init iate was regarded as one of those 'called' to make the spi ritual journey . The afflict ions experienced by the Jews during their 40 years wandering in the wilderness were seen as a metaphor for the init iate's experience ofbeing afflicted by doubts and uncertainties. The 'chosen’ were those who reached the promised land, symbo lizing the promise of Gnosis at the end of the spiritual journey. The motif o f be ing 'called out of Egypt' appears in Matthew's gospel, where the pregnant Mary is portray ed as an exile in Egypt before she returns to Judea to give birth to Jesus. God then decl ares: 'Out of Egy pt I have called my Son.'16 In an age obsessed by hidden meanings, the doubl e resonance in this mot if must have delighted the creators of the Jesus myt h. Here they were able to echo the init iat ion allegory ofthe Exodus story in which the Jews are called put of Egy pt and at the same t ime tell the init iated reader the place fro m which the Jesus Mysteries truly ori ginated -ancient Egy pt.17 Moses’ 40 years wandering in the wilderness, plagued by serpents and so forth, beco me Jesus' 40 day s and 40 nights in the wilderness, in which he is plagued by doubts and temptations in t he form of the Devil. Moses does not himself make it to the promised land, but appoints the prophet Joshua to lead the chosen people to their final dest inat ion in his place.18 Hence Joshua (Greek: Jesus) was the name selected for the Jewish Osiris -Dionysus who leads his chosen peopl e to the promised land of myst ical rebi rth.19 Joshua represents the New Covenant of the Jewish Mysteries which replaces the old laws and tradit ions represented by Moses. His first task is to appoint 12 fo llo wers.20 Likewise in the Jesus myt h one of Jesus' first acts is to select the 12 disciples. Vari ous other elements in the Jesus story were obviously suggested by Jewish my thology . Jesus' entry int o Jerusal em on an ass, for example, draws on Pagan myt h, but also echoes the Old Testament Book of Zechar -iah which reads: 'Beho ld t he king i s coming riding on an ass, rejoice daughters of Jerusalem.'21 Such passages are often referred to by the gospel"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"wri ters and other early Christ ians as prophecies which prove the truth of Jesus' divine nature. In the light of the Jesus Mysteries Thesis, howe ver, they can be seen as the myt ho logical motifs fro m w hich the story was constructed. Hellenized Jews in Alexandria had for centuries been searching the Jewish scriptures to find resemblances wit h Pagan philosophy and the myt hs of Osiris -Dionysus. Many o f the Old Testam ent books, particularly Psalms, have their origins in Egypt ian poetry and wisdo m literature, so veiled references to the myt hs of Osiris were easy to find.22 These could then beco me t he basis upon which to build a Jewish myth of Osiris whic h was also rooted in Judaism. This process is particularly clear in The Gospel o f Peter, which didn't make it into the New Testam ent. Almo st every sentence in the passio n narrative of this gospel is based on scriptural refere nces in the Old Testament.23 In t he third and second centuries BCE Jewish scriptures were translated into Greek by Hellenized Jews in Alexandria. This gave them the opportunit y to create similarit ies between Jewish myt ho logyand Pagan myt ho logywhich were not there beforehand. The Book ofIsaiah, for example, prophesies that 'a young woman will conceive and give birth to a son', but this is mistranslated in the Greek versio n as 'a virgin will conceive and give birth to a son', bringing it int o line wit h t he Pagan idea of the virgin birt h.24 This then became a key 'proof text' in Jewish scri pture used by early Christ ians to support the claim that Jesus was the long -awai ted Jewish Messiah! In the Gospel of Mark Jesus is made to quote fro m Psalm 22 on the cross: 'My God, why hast thou fors aken me?'25 This psalm also contains the lines: 'The assembly o f the wicked have enclo sed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.'26 Hence in the gospels Jesus is crucified by having his hands and feet pierced with nails. The psalm goes on: 'They part my ga rm ents am ong them , and cast lots upon my vesture.'27 Hence in the gospels Jesus' garments are divided by lot am ongst the Rom an centurions overseeing his crucifixio n. ADAPTING THE PAST To create the Jesus myt h t he init iates of the Jewish Mysteries also drew on the inter -testamental literature which had already synt hesized Pagan and Jewish myt ho logical mo tifs. These inter - testamental texts not only echo the Pagan Mysteries but also prefigure Christ ianit y, forming a bridge between the two.28 The Jewish Sibylli ne Oracl es, for example, talk of a coming apocalypse of cosmic fire on the day of judgement and peace on Earth for the fait hful . They are full o f missio nary zeal , which is rare in Jewish literature but found both in the Mysteries and in Chr istianit y. They also l ook f orward to the coming of a Christ -a hope which Christianit y c laims to fulfil.29 Motifs which echo the Mysteries and prefigure Christ ianit y are also found in The Books ofEnoch.30 Like Jesus, Enoch is said to have been physically raised up to h eaven.31 On his arrival he is greeted as 'the Son of Man'32 -a ti tle which Jesus will inherit. This tit le conveys the idea that Enoch and Jesus are both to be understood as 'Everyman' characters who mythically represent all o f ma nkind. The Hebrew express io n 'son of ’means 'the embodiment of'.33 The Son of Man is an embodiment of the idea of the primal Man. This is another way ofconveying the same idea that St John expresses when he says that Jesus is the Logos made flesh. Jesus and Enoch are to be unders tood as embodiments of the Universal Daem on, the One Consciousness which animates all beings. Just like Jesus, the embodiment of the Logos, the Son of Man in The Books of Enoch is a divine being who has existed with God"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"fro m t he beginning. Also like Jesus, the Enochian Son of Man is called 'a messenger fro m God', 'the Christ of the invisible God' and 'a light to the Gent iles'.34 The inter -testam ental Wisdo m L iterature tells of the 'righteous man' who is a divine emissary sent to bring wisdo m int o th e world . This figure, who echoes the earlier Pagan 'just man', beco mes the Christ ian 'r ighteous man' Jesus. Like Jesus, he is rejected by humanit y,35 makes claims that evoke hostilit y,36 is maltreated, comes into conflict with the authorit ies, dies,37 and is fina lly recognized by his enemies as the 'Son of God'.38 The Nag Hammadi library o f ear ly Gnostic gospels has given us two manuscripts which, if read together, show just how easily a pre -exist ing text could be Christianized.39 A non - Chr istian t reati se called The Init iated Good Gnostic40 has been so mewhat arbitrarily cut up into separate speeches, which have then been put into Jesus' mouth in answer to his disciples' questions. The result is a Christian text called The Wisdom o f Jesus Christ.41 The Christ ian an d non -Christ ian t exts are almost ident ical apart from the addition o f Jesus and his disciples. The follo wing are so me short examples: THE INITIATED GOOD GNOSTIC 'He Who Is' is ineffable.

MYTH BECOMES HISTORY The Pagan Mystery godm en were clearly mytho logical fig ures whose biographies existed ‘ out of time' in the world of dreams and images. If they were regarded as having literally lived at all, it was in ancient times indist inguishable fro m myt h. So why does the Jesus story pr esent the myt h ofthe Jewish godman as if it were history? The genuine letters of Paul, as we have seen, show no sign of the Jesus story having assumed an historical setting in the first half o f the first century. Paul preaches a myst ical Messiah who, thr ough his death and resurrection, brings rebirth to his fo llo wers. Such a primit ive"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"form ofthe Jesus myt h coul d well have been around for hundreds of years.42 It would have init ially been a secret myth o f the Jewish Mysteries, so we would not expect any ev idence of its existence to have survived. Sooner or later, however, it was inevitable that the Jesus myt h would beco me historicized. Jews expected the Messiah to be a historical figure who literally came to rescue his peopl e. So, if the Jewish Osiris -Dion ysus was to be convincingly portrayed as the Messiah, the my thwoul d have to be recast as an historical drama. Yet Jesus could not be said to have existed in t he distant past like the Pagan Mystery godman, because such a Messiah could not bring polit ical s alvat ion to his people now. He would have to be portrayed as co ming in the recent past, as thi s al on e woul d make him relevant. To explain why no one had heard of the coming of the Messiah, Jesus is made to deliberately keep his Messiahship a secret. Indeed , Mark portrays even Jesus' closest disciples as failing to recognize him as the Messiah unt il a fter his death.43 The Old Testament, although interpreted as myst ical allegory by Hellenized Jews such as Philo, appears on the surface to be an historical rec ord. Portraying the Jesus story as a record of actual events would, therefore, have fitted it into the general st yle of Jewish scriptures; and the time and place chosen as the setting for Jesus’ life and death could be used by Jewish init iates, skilled in allegory , to encode symbo lic messages. The Jewish godman was given the name Joshua/Jesus after the prophet of Exodus Joshua ben Nun, whose name means 'Jesus son of the Fish'. This is perfect for a saviour figure designed for the new astrological Age of Pi sces, symbo lized by the Fish. The t ime chosen for Jesus’ birth links him to an important astrological conjunct ion in 7 BCE which ushered in the New Age o f Pisces.44 This stellar conjunct ion also beco mes the star which prefigures the birth of the godman in Pagan myt h. Thus Jesus symbo lically beco mes the new saviour for a New Age. The time of Jesus' birth also enabled the creators of the Jesus Mysteries to symbo lically convey other informat ion. According to Matthew, Jesus is born in the reign of Herod, who t ries to have him killed as a baby to prevent him beco ming king of the Jews. Herod, who died in 4 BCE, was a puppet of the Romans and co mp letely loathed by the Jews.45 Bringing the infant Jesus into immediate conflict with the hated king already fits Jesus int o th e mo del ofthe 'just man unjust ly a ccused' and portray s him as the Messiah come to defend the Jews. Luke makes a similar point by having his Jesus born 10 years later at the time of the census of 6 CE. By then the Romans had finally annexed Judea a nd the census was to enable them to direct ly t ax the Jews. Judea no longer even had its own puppet administration, but was now ruled by a Roman governor. This led to desperate hopes that the Messiah would arise to protect his people and by placing Jesus' b irthat thi s time, Luke implies that this hope has been fulfilled. The only other event that places Jesus in an historical context is his death under the Rom an governor of Judea, Pontius Pilate. According to Josephus and Philo, Pilate was parti cularly det ested by the Jews.46 He had vio lated Jewish religious taboos many t imes, including being the first Roman to defile the Jerusalem Temple.47 Pilate was, therefore, the perfect choice for the role of the evil t yrant who executes the godman. It i s also rel eva ntthat the Jesus story is set in Galilee. Galilee was so thoroughly Hellenized that it was known anrongst the Jews as 'the land of the Gent iles'.48 Josephus records that Galilee refused to defend Jerusalem against the Romans.49 Galilee was not lo yal to th e Tem ple cul t of Jerusalem and had close relations with Pagan cultures. So it was an ideal setting for the home o f the Jewish Osiris -Dionysus. The process through which the original t imeless and locat ionless Jesus story became set in a particular time and place can be seen in the Gospel o f Mark. Scholars have noticed that all"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"the passages that mention Galilee are later additions.50 For example, in the line 'And passing along by the sea o f Galilee he saw Simo n and Andrew'51, the words 'by the sea of Galilee ' are placed quite ungrammat ically in the Greek syntax.52 This has led most New Testament scholars to believe that they were added to give a geographical locat ion to a story which previously lacked -it. AN ALTERNATIVE MESSIAH In 66 CE Jews in Judea revo ltedagainst their Roman oppressors, leading to horrendous reprisals. Josephus claims that out of a populat ion of 3,000,000 Jews 1,000,000 died and a further 100,000 were sold into slavery.54 When Jerusalem finally fell it was left nothing more than smoulderin g ruins. Josephus writes: 'All the rest of the fortificat ions encircling the cit y were so completely levelled withthe ground that no one visit ing the spot would believe it had once been inhabited. This then was the end to which the mad fo lly o f revo lut ionaries brought Jerusalem, a magnificent cit y r enowned to the ends of the earth.'55 Tradi tional Judaism had been in its death throes since 63 BCE when the corrupt Temple priests had themselves invited in the Ro ma ns to settle their internal disputes and in so doing put their country on the road to Roman do minat ion. By 70 CE, when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem, many Jews felt completely betrayed by their god Jehovah, who had clearly failed to protect them fro m t heir enemies. Such sentiments were expressed in the Jewish literature of the time . In t he Apocalypse of Baruch, for example, the prophet Baruch insistent ly int errogates Jehovah as if he were a defendant on trial: why has God allowed Jerusalem to be captured, its Temple destroyed, its peopl e dispersed? Baruch tells the Jewish priests to 'take the keys of the sanctuary and hurl them at the heavens', commanding Jehovah to guard his own house!56 The only hope that is offered in this bleak work is that the Messiah will finally come. It was at some po int aft er these disastrous events that the Jesus myt h was first put into an histori cal context by the Gospel ofMark. This suggests that it was this crisis that forced the creators of the Jesus Mysteries to transform their my thofthe dying and resurrecting godma n int o pseudo -history . In the face of co mp lete national catastrophe Jews needed more than Paul's myst ical Christ. They needed a Messiah who had actually co me to save them as promised. The cri sis in Judaism did throw up many would -be Messiahs, all o f who m f ailed. These men, known derogatorily as 'zealots' or 'bandits,' co mbined the role of po liticalrevol utionary and religious fanat ic in a way comparable to modern Muslim fundamentalists. The pro -Rom an Josephus wri tes: 'These cheats and deceivers who claimed to be inspired schemed to bring about revo lut ionary changes by inducing the mob to act as if possessed, and by leading them out into the wild country on the pretence that there God would show them signs of approaching freedo m.'57 Many ofthese would -be M essiahs took the name of Joshua/Jesus. Josephus describes Judea as being full o f such 'brigands', 'impostors' and 'miracle -workers' who 'deceive the people' and 'pro mise deliverance'. Some tried to repeat the miracle o f the Exodus by leading their fo llo wer s out into the desert where Jehovah would deliver them. One assembled a great company on the"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Mount of Olives, promising, like a second Joshua, that the cit y's walls would fall at his co mmand and that he would lead his fo llo wers to sl aughter the Rom an garri son.58 In contrast, the Jesus myt h presents a quite different Messiah. Jesus is not a polit ical revo lut ionary . When quest ioned about taxes, he tells his fo llo wers to give to Gaesar what is Caesar's.59 His message is of myst ical salvat ion, not national lib erati on. It i s interesting to note that his betrayer, Judas, is given the same name as Judas of Galilee, the most infamous o f a ll the zeal ot l eaders, cast ing the fundamentalist zealots in a negative light.60 The Jesus story would seem to be consciously cre ated to give disillusio ned Jews an alternat ive to the disastrous revo lut ionary 'Messiahs' who were merely making matters worse. Hellenized Jews, whilst lo yal to thei r nati onal tradi tions and having nat ionalist ic aspirat ions, regarded the zealots with the same horror that modern Westernized Muslims regard fanat icalMuslim fundamentalists. They realized that the zealots were in the process of bringing disaster upon their country and the events of70 CE confirmed all their worst fears. Hellenized Jews living i n Alexandria looked for some way ofhelping their co mpatriots streaming out of Judea as refugees. The desperat ion of the times cannot be exaggerated.61 In the face of the failure of the nat ionalist Messiah to arrive in their hour of need, the Jesus Myster ies presented to Jews a myst ical alternat ive, a way of restoring meaning to their shattered lives, rekindling so me pr ide in their nat ional identit y a nd integrating themselves into wider Pagan societ y.New init iates were attracted to the Jesus Mysteries by being told the quasi -histori cal story ofJesus, but later, when their understanding had increased, they were init iated into the Inner Mysteries which revealed the Jesus story as a myst ical analogy. Thus, dispossessed and disaffected Jewish refugees were offered hope. The expected polit ical saviour who would set the Jewish people free was transformed into a spiritual saviour who could set each individual free through myst ical Gnosis. Ironi cally, however, the Jesus Mysteries did not really take off wit hin th e Jewish communit y.The fate of this new fait h was to be far stranger than anyo ne coul d possibly have imagined at the time. Within 100 years the Pagan godman disguised as the Jewish Messiah, who was designed to introduce the Pagan Mysteries to the Jews, wa s actually bringing Jewish tradi tions to Pagans! A UNIVERSAL SAVIOUR Jesus was dest ined not to remain a Jewish Messiah but to beco me a universal saviour. This process of internat ionalizat ion had already begun by the time of Paul's heated debates with the Ebionite Christ ians. Paul was fight ing to free the Jesus Mysteries from unnecessary t ies to Judaism and to make them attractive to more Hellenized Jews like himself. For him, the tradi tional Jewish Law was only relevant, if at all, to Psychic Christ ians. Th e new (essent ially Pagan) teachings of the Jesus Mysteries had rendered the old Jewish ways redundant. The 'circumcisio naries' against whom Paul argued, by contrast, wished to keep the Jesus Mysteries distinct ively Jewish. These more tradit ional Jewish -Chr istians were found in Jerusalem, the heart ofJudaism, whereas Paul was a highly Hellenized Jew travelling from one Pagan cit y t o another. For all his zeal, Paul failed in his missio n of winning Jewish converts to the Jesus Mysteri es. At Ephesus he is sai d to have preached for three months in the synagogue without any resul ts. At Ant ioch the Jews even attacked him. Disguising Osiris -Dionysus as the Jewish Messiah in order to smuggle the Pagan godman into Judaism was a cunning idea, but most Jews saw throug h t his plo y ver y easily. A Messiah who was crucified as a criminal was not the saviour theywere wait ing for. Christ ianit y appeared to them as a confusing and heretical doctrine of a failed Messiah."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"But when Paul turned to the Greeks he at once achieved e xtraordinary successes.62 As one modern scholar remarks: 'We are compelled to admit there was something which on the one hand o ffended Jewish ideas, and on the other, conformed to Greek ideas. I hope I shall not be misunderstood if I say that Christ must have appeared to the Greeks as a hero. Chr istianit y is, from a merely historical viewpo int , an enormous Greek hero cult devoted to a Jewish Messiah.'63 To Pagans this was a new exotic Mystery cult which incorporated elements of the intriguing Jewish tradi tion wi ththe perennial wisdo m o f the Pagan Mysteries. As the unattractive baggage ofthe ol d Jewish Laws had been dumped by Paul, there was nothing to stop Gentiles from embracing the Jesus Mysteries. Moreover, once the myth had beco me historicized, the n ew cul t ofChr istianit y had the added appeal that it made a genuinely revo lut ionary claim -that the godm an had actually walked the Earth in the recent past. By the middle of the second century the Jesus Mysteries had been largely rejected by the Jewish c om munit y but embraced by Gent iles. Jesus was no longer portrayed as coming to save the Jews, but as coming to save the who le o f hu manit y.Gent ile Christ ians rejected the old Jewish tradi tions, as Paul had desired, so this was no longer an issue. But by thi s time, however, the Chr istianit y co mmunit y had begun to split again into two dist inct and antagonist ic fact ions - Literalism and Gnosticism. THE BIRTH OF LITERALISM After 70 CE when the Romans laid waste Jerusalem, Jews were spread throughout the Roman Em pire as slaves and refugees. Jews who had been init iated in only the Outer Mysteries, with limited half -baked ideas of what Christ ianit y was all about, would have been flung far and wide around the ancient world, taking what they believed to be the 'biogra phy' o f Jesus the Messiah withthem . Those in the western areas of the Empire became cut off fro m t he established centres ofthe Jesus Mysteries in Alexandria and the eastern areas of the Empire, and so were prevented fro m co mp let ing the process of init iat ion. Wit h no masters of the Gnosis within hundreds of miles, it is easy to imagine how a confused form of the Jesus Mysteries would quickly develop. Wit hin a few decades these western Christ ians had created a religio n in which the belief that Jesus was li terally the dying and resurrecting Son of God was the central doctrine. Their Literalist Christ ianit y had n o place for any Inner Mysteries . It di d not view the gospels as allegories, but as historical records of actual events. During the second century, t he leaders of local groups of Christ ians became known as 'overseers' or 'bishops'. Wit hout any Inner Mysteries to impart, these bishops taught that eternal salvation was guaranteed to anyo ne who simply believed the story of Jesus to be literally true. It is this limited form of Christ ianit y,based only on the Outer Mysteries, which would eventually beco me t he Ro ma n Catho lic Church. The ori ginal Jesus Mysteries, which we now call Gnosticism, cont inued to flourish where theyhad originated, in Alexandria. Th is cit y produced the great second and third -century Gnost ic masters Carpocrates, Basilides, Valentinus, Clement and Origen. Literalism, on the other hand, gathered strength in those areas of the Empire which were cut off fro m t he masters of the Gnosis"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"in t he East, eventually beco ming centred on Rome itself, where it took on a narrow autocratic Rom an character. Early init iates of the Jesus Mysteries formed many separate groups in different places, often centred around a particular master of the Gnosis and w orking wi ththeir own gospel s. The Gnostics maintained this tradit ion of myst icism, vari ety and tolerance. The Literalists, by contrast, began to build a centralized authoritarian religion. It i s easy to imagine how those init iated in the Inner Mysteries woul d have looked on aghast at the growth of Literalism, now completely out of their control and beginning to spring up across the ancient world as a new religious cult. Many masters of the Inner Mysteries visited Rom e in order to init iate Christ ians into the Gnosis, but they were not welco med. Literalist bishops were not at all pleased to have so me foreign myst ic proclaim them to be mere 'Psychic Chr istians' in need of a further Pneumat ic init iat ion. They were resent ful o f Gnost ic sages 'stealing their flo ck’by belitt ling Literalist teachings and offering init iat ion int o the secret Inner Mysteri es. The Gnost ics, who had created the Jesus story in the first place, were now accused of perverting the sacred teachings o f the saviour. Irenaeus, the mouthpiece ofLiteralism , protested that Gnostics 'overthrow the fait h of many, by drawing them away under the pretence of superior Knowl edge’ .64 Conflict was inevitable and a bitter battle for the soul of Christianit y e nsued. CONCLUSION Atlast we felt we had found the real Jesus. He is the Mystery godman incognito! He is the my thical 'Son of God’ cam ouflaged as the historical 'Son of David ’. It was now clear to us why, unlike all the other myths of Osiris -Dionysus, the Jesus story had been given an historical setti ng and how, once this had happened, the growth of Literalism was unavo idable. Let us review so me o f w hat we have discovered about the Jesus myt h and its development: • Jesus is Osiris -Dionysus thinly disguised as the Jewish Messiah in order to make the Pagan Mysteri es accessible to Jews. His composite nature is particularly clear fro m t he contradictory accounts of his birth which portray him both as the Messiah in the line o f David and Osiris -Dionysus the Son of God. • In the gospels Jesus makes it clear that he is really the dying and resurrecting Son of God, not the expected Jewish Messiah. • Alt hough he conforms to Jewish expectations about theMessiah as much as possible, by his death and resurrection Jesus is shown to actually be Osiris -Dionysus. • As well as Pagan myt ho logical mot ifs, the Jesus story draws on Jewish myt ho logical motifs, especially fro m the story ofthe Exodus. • The Jesus story draws on concepts and images developed in Jewish inter -testam ental literature which synt hesize Jewish and Pag an ideas. • In some texts the name Jesus has simply been added to turn pre -Christ ian t reatises into Chr istian docum ents. • The Jewish Messiah was expected to be an historical figure, which meant that the Jesus story woul d have to be cast in an historical s etting. • The creators of the Jesus Mysteries used the time and place chosen as the setting for Jesus ’life to encode symbo lic messages. The time of Jesus ’birth links him to the bi rth of the New Age of Pisces and brings him int o c onflict immediately with the hated King Herod and the Romans. The"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"time of his death brings him into conflict with the particularly loathed Ro ma n official Pont ius Pilate. • In 70 CE the Romans laid waste Jerusalem, fuelling the Jews ’ desperate desi re for a saviour. This crisis put external pressure on the historicization process of the Jesus story and produced the Gospel ofMark from the myst ical t imeless Christ preached by Paul. • The Jesus Mysteri es presented to Jews a myst ical Messiah as an alternat ive to all the fundamentalist zeal ot Messiahs causing havoc in Judea at the time. • Alt hough transforming the Jewish Messiah into Osiris -Dionysus in order to introduce the Pagan godman to the Jews was a clever idea, it didn't work. The Jesus Mysteri es were rej ected by Jews but embraced by Pagans as a new Mystery cult. • After 70 CE Jews with knowledge only of the Outer My steri es of Chr istianit y were spread around the Rom an Em pire as slaves and refugees. Those in the West, cut off fro m t he masters of the Gnosis in the East, developed a ne w religio n, based only on the Outer My steri es, which preached an historical Jesus. • The original Jesus Mysteries, now called Gnost icism, continued to flourish in the East. • By the middle of the second century the Gnost ics, who had created the Jesus story in t he fir st place, were being attacked by Literalist Christ ians as heret ics who had perverted genuine Chr istianit y. In synthesizing the perennial myth o f the dying and resurrecting godman with Jewish expectati ons of an historical Messiah the creators of the Jewish Mysteries took an unprecedented step, the outcom e of which they coul d never have guessed. And yet, upon analysis the end was already there in the beginning. The Messiah was expected to be an historical, not a myt hical, savi our. It was inevitabl e, therefore, that the Jesus story woul d have to develop a quasi -histori cal setting. And so it did. What had started as a timeless myt h encoding perennial teachings now appeared to be an historical account of a once -only event in time. Fro m t his point it w as unavo idable that sooner or later it would be interpreted as historical fact. Once it was, a whole new t ype of religio n came into being -a religio n based on history not myth, on blind fait h in supposed events rather than on a myst ical understanding of m yt hical allegori es, a religion o f the Outer My steri es wit hout the Inner Mysteries, of form without content, of belief wit hout Knowl edge. One final part of the puzzle was left for us to put into place. How did Christ ianit y d evel op fro m a minor Mystery cult int o the most influent ial religio n of all t ime? And why was it that the Chr istianit y t hat eventually came to dominate the world was not the grand and ancient myst icism ofthe Gnostics, but the narrow authoritarianism of the Literalists?"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"An Imit ation Chur ch 'And there shall be others who are outside our number who name themselves bishop and also deacons, as if they have received their authorit y fr om God.

There is not a single document in t he New Testament which does not warn of false teachers or attack other Christ ians! At the end of the second century the Pagan sat irist Celsus wri tes: 'Christ ians, it is needless to say, utterly detest each other. They slander each other constantly wit h t he vilest forms o f abuse, and cannot come to any sort of agreem ent in their teaching.'2 He explains: 'At the start of their movement, they were very few in number, and unified in purpose. Since that time, they have spread all around and now number in the thousands. It is not surprising, therefore, that there are divisio ns amo ngst them - fact ions of all sorts, each want ing to have its own territory. Nor is it surprising that as these divisio ns have beco me so numerous, the various parties have taken to condemning each other, so that today theyhave only one thing, if that, in commo n -the name \"Christ ian\". But despite them clinging proudly to their name, in most other respects they are at odds.'3 In the first century, the battles in the Christ ian co mmuni tywere over the relationship of the Jesus Mysteri es to tradi tional Judaism . By the middle of the second century they were between Gnostics and Literalists. The central idea of Literalist Christ ianit y is t hat the Jesus story , bizarre and mythical as it may appear to be, is in fact a true history of miraculous events. In the face o f Gnostic insistence that the Jesus story was actually a myst icalallegory , Li teralists began categori cally asserting that Jesus Christ suffered and was crucified under Pontius Pil ate -a statement that was repeated with such fanat ical insistence that it reveals just how weak the Literalists felt at this t ime.4 The forged Second Letter of Peter, for example, defensively asserts that Literalist Chr istians are not fo llo wing 'some wel l-composed fict ion'!5 The author of letters attributed to Ignat ius urges the fait hful 'not to yield to the bait of false doctrine, but to believe most steadfast ly in t he birth, the passio n, and the resurrection, which took place during the governorship of Ponti us Pilate'.6 He insists: 'Jesus Christ, David's offspring and Mary's, was really born of a virgin and bapt ised by John, really persecuted by Pilate and nailed to the cross in the flesh .’7"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Atthe end of the second century various letters attributed t o th e apostles Peter, John and James were forged to advance the Literalism campaign and to portray the Gnost ics as heret ics fro m t he true teachings of those who had actually known Jesus. The First Letter of John teaches that the way to discriminate between true teachers and false teachers is that the former acknowledge that Jesus Christ came 'in the flesh'.8 In the Second Letter of John (a one -page diatribe against Gnostics!) the author warns: 'The world has been invaded by a host of wrong -headed people wh o won't accept that Jesus has co me as the Messiah in the flesh. If you even say hello to them you're a partner in their evil deeds.'9 To bol ster Li teralism, the Jesus story was adapted. The Gospel of John affirms 'the Word became flesh', changing Paul's f orm ula 'in the likeness of flesh'.10 As well as such adaptations, scho lars have iso lated numerous additions to the gospels designed to emphasize that Jesus literally resurrected from the grave as a physical human being. In their original form the gospels portrayed the resurrected Jesus as a ghostly spiritual figure. Luke and Mark both relate that Jesus appeared 'in another form' to two disciples on the road to Emmaus. According to Luke it was only after the di sci ples had tal ked wi ththe stranger for some le ngth of t ime and invited him to break bread at dinner that they suddenly recognized him as Jesus. At that mo me nt'he vanished out of their sight'. However, later verses have been added to portray the resurrected Jesus parading his 'flesh and bones' and eat ing fish to prove his physical existence.11 John has the mourning Mary Magdalene see a man she takes to be the gardener at Jesus' grave. When he speaks her name, however, she suddenly recognizes him as Jesus, but he orders her not to touch him.12 Just aft er thi s account, however, the story of 'doubt ing Tho ma s' has been added, in which Tho mas declares that he will not believe that Jesus had actually risen fro m t he grave unless he can personally see and touch him. When Jesus appears, he tells Thomas: 'Put y our finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side; do not be fait hless, but believing.'13 TAKING THINGS LITERALLY Literalists took literally what for Gnostics were mystic metaphors. Because they believed that Jesus had litera lly resurrected from the dead in his physical body, they taught that after death all Chr istians would likewise literally be resurrected from the grave in their physical bodies. Tertullian declares that anyone who denies the resurrection of the flesh is a h eret ic, not a true Chr istian. The Literalists even claimed that the Eucharist bread and wine literally became the flesh and blood of Jesus during the mass -an extraordinary assert ion t hat is st ill made by the Catholic Church to this day!14 Taking the Jes us myth as history led Literalists to abandon the Gnostic doctrine of reincarnat ion. Because Literalists believed that the godman had died and resurrected once only in time, they also conceived of a human life as a once -only event. Afterlife reward or puni shment was, therefore, for all t ime, not a temporary precursor to another human life. This left them with what the Pagan Celsus calls the 'o ffensive doctrine1 that a good God could countenance abandoning those who didn't make the grade to an eternit y o f su ffering.15 Literalists also interpreted literally the idea of the apocalypt ic Second Co ming. In the gospel s Jesus is made to promise that he will return in glory wit hin the lifet ime of so me o f his audi ence. The Gnostics, of course, saw this as a myst ical metaphor about the resurrection of the"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"init iate as the Christ or Universal Daemo n. The Lit eralists took this 'prophecy' at face value and so were left with the difficult task of explaining Jesus' failure to appear as promised. The forged Second Letter of Peter conveys the obvious unease and confusio n in t he Literalist Chr istian co mmunit y o ver this issue, and offers its own desperate solut ion, proclaiming: 'In t he final days schemers will co me alo ng with their schemes fo llo wing the lead of their greedy des ires and saying \"Where is the Second Coming that he promised us? In the meant ime our fathers and mothers have died, and the who le world is st ill just the same as it has been since the beginning of creat ion.\" Let this one thing not escape you, dear friends; that a single day for the Lord i s like a thousand years, and a thousand years is like a single day. The Lord isn't late in fulfilling His promise; what some call His lateness really is His pat ience with you. He doesn't want to lose anybody, he wants repen tance to include everybody.'16 Just in Martyr likewise explained that God was delaying the End because he wished to see Chr istianit y spread throughout the world first.17 Other Literalists came up with the ludicrous idea that St John had turned into a sort o f immo rtal and was living in Pat mo s or Ephesus and so Jesus had not got his prophecy wrong after all.18 Basing his bizarre and convo lut ed reasoning on the fact that the Ark of the Covenant was said to have been five -and -a-half cubits long, Hippolytus so me how fixed the End for 202. When thi s date passed uneventfully it was deferred to 500.19 By the middle of the third century, for mo st Christ ians 'the End' was no longer an imminent concern. In the early fift h century , transl ators of second -century Christ iantexts omitted all ment ions of the imminent apocalypse as theywere now just an embarrassment.20 Despite all o f this, of course, many Literalist Christ ians continued to warn 'The End is nigh', as they still do today. A CHURCH OF BISHOPS Gnostics offered i nit iates Gnosis, a here -and -now spiritual experience of a truth beyo nd the illusio n t hat is the world. Literalists offered the hope of a heavenly afterlife through believing in the historicit y o f the gospel stories. By do ing this, however, they created a d ifficult dile mma for them selves: why shoul d any on e believe such a supernatural tale as the Jesus story to be literal history? Writ ing at the end of the second century, Tertullian admits that anyone who judges in term s of ordinary historical experience woul d find the claim that a man physically returned from the grave to be too incredible to be believed.21 In the face of this rational doubt, the best he can manage is to argue: ‘It is true because it is absurd, I believe it because it is impossible .’22 And this fro m a ma n routinely claimed in history books to be a great Christ ian t heologian! In order to present a convincing just ification for interpreting the Jesus story as historical fact, the Literalists invented a spiritual lineage which they claimed connec ted them direct ly t o the apostl es, who had lived so me 150 years previously. This meant they could argue that the histori cityofthe Jesus story was guaranteed by the personal testimo nies of those living at the time, testimo nies which had been fait hfully pa ssed down to them through successive bishops. Literalists used this fabricated lineage as a powerful weapon in their battles wit h t he Gnostics. Gnostics claimed to teach secret Inner Mysteries of which the Literalists were ignorant. Literalists counter -claimed that they alon e were the representatives o f a line of apostolic successio n stretching back to the 12 disciples.23 Literalists argued that this invested their bishops withthe authori tyofthe original apostles. Even today the Pope traces his primacy to Peter on the basis that, in so me accounts, he was meant to be the first eyewit ness of the resurrection.24"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The claim to be heirs to the original disciples was used by Literalist bishops to legit imize their dem and for blind obedience from the Christian f aithful .25 Any on e, such as the Gnostics, who opposed their authority was therefore in revo lt against Christ. A letter attributed to Clement ofRome complains o f 'rash and self -willed people' who have undertaken a 'rebellio n’.26 It procl aims that God has de legated his authorit y t o the bishops and so whoever refuses to 'bow the neck' is guilt y o f insubordinat ion against Christ.27 It even goes as far as to demand that whoever disobeys the divinely ordained authorit ies shoul d 'receive the death penalt y'!28 Let ters attributed to Ignatius likewise warn that the bishop presides 'in the place of God'. Indeed, the fait hful shoul d 'revere, honour, and obey the bishop as if he were God'!29 Wit hout the bishops, priests and deacons, 'there is nothing that can be called a church'. ° The author wri tes: 'Let no one do anything pertaining to the church wit hout the bishop. Let that be considered a valid eucharist which is celebrated by the bishop, or by the person who m he appoints. It is not legit imate either to baptise or t o hold an agape (cult meal) without the bishop. To jo in wit h t he bishop is to jo in t he church; to separate oneself fro m t he bishop is to separate oneself not only fro m t he church, but from God himself.'31 These letters argue that as there is only one God in heaven there should be only one head bishop in t he Church to whom all are obedient. 'One God, one bishop' became the slo gan of Literalist Chr istianit y.32 The Gnost ics, by contrast, organized themselves wit hout hierarchies o f bishops and pri ests. They used the method of drawing lots to decide who should t ake the role o f bishop, pri est, reader of the scripture, prophet, and so on. Each time they met they would draw lots once mo re, so that the roles were constantly circulated. In this way they believed the hand of God woul d choose the ri ght person for the right job at the ri ght time.33 The Literalist Tertullian tells us di sapprovingly: 'And so it happens that today one man is their bishop, tomorrow another; today someone is a deacon, and tomorrow a reader, -today so meo ne is a presbyter who tom orrow i s a layman. For even on laymen too, they impose the funct ions of pri esthood .34 Whilst the orthodox were constructing a permanent hierarchy of power, Gnostics were dem onstrating that they coul d funct ion as spiri tual equals.35 Tertullian is appalled, writ ing: 'I must not omit an account of the conduct of the heretics, how frivo lous it is, how merely human, without seriousness, without authorit y,without di sci pline, as suits their creed. To begin wit h, it is doubt ful, who is a catechumen and who a believer; theyallhave access alike, they hear alike, they pray alike -even with Pagans, if any such happen to come amo ng them. As for peace, they observe it with everyo ne, observing no distinctions.

According to them, a Christ ian must confess the Literalist creed, be bapt ized and above all obey the bishops .40 For the Gnostics, however, the true Church was 'invisible' and only its members could perceive who belo nged to it and who did not.41 Gnostics insisted that it took more than bapt ism to beco me a Chr istian. The Gospel of Philip explains that many people 'go down to the water and come up wit hout having received anyt hing' and yet claim to be Christ ians. Nor did professio n of a creed or even martyrdo m mak e someone a Christ ian, since 'anyo ne can do these things'. The Gnostics quoted Jesus' saying 'By their fr uits y ou shall know them' and demanded evidence of spiritual maturity to demonstrate that a person belonged to the true Church.42 Not surprisingly, Literalist bishops saw such Gnostic individualism as a dangerous threat to thei r authori ty. Thei r attacks o n Gnosticism became ever more fanatical and extreme. Irenaeus urges that Gnostics should 'be recognised as agents of Satan' and warns that: 'God has prepared eternal fire for eve rykind of heresy.’ 43 'Better a Pagan than a heret ic' beco me s a constant Liter alist refrain.44 Wit h characterist ic lu nacy Justin Mart yreven insinuates that Gnostics indulge in 'cannibalism'!45 The author of the New Testament Letter of Jude, a short and rather paranoid polemic wri tten for no other reason than to attack Gnostics, wr ites: 'Dear friends, having every intent ion of writ ing to you about our shared salvat ion, I found myself obliged instead to write you a letter of warning to keep up the fight for the fait h as transmitted to the ho ly o nes, once and for all.

They 'c almly sit beside you, being a blotch upon our love -feasts'. They are 'stars gone off course whose eternal dest iny is the darkness ofthe pi t'. The Letter of Jude recommends 'avo iding with revulsio n so much as a piece of clothing polluted by contact wi ththeir bodies'.47 The forger of the letters of Paul to Timothy describes Gnostic teachings as an 'infestation' which spreads like 'gangrene'.48 In response, the Gnostics called the Literalist Church authorit ies 'vulgar' and 'ecclesiastical'.49 The Gnostic sa ge Heracleon describes the dogmas of the Literalist Church as 'unnouri shing, stagnant water' in contrast to the 'living water' Christ offers to the elect through Gnosis.50 The Testimo ny o f T ruth attacks Literalists who claimed to be Chr istians, but who 'do not know who Christ is'.51 The Second Treatise o f the Great Seth laments that Gnostics are 'hated and persecuted, not only by those who are ignorant, but also by those that think they are advancing the name of Christ', who are 'unknowingly empt y,not know ing who they are, like dumb animals'.52 In this Gnostic text the saviour explains that an 'imitat ion church' has been created which 'proclaims a doctrine of a dead man and lies, so as to resemble the freedo m and puri tyofthe perfect church'.53 The Tripar tite Tractate contrasts Gnostics who are children of the true Father God with the Li teralists who are offspring o f the Jewish false -god Jehovah. The Father's children come together in lo ve as equals and spontaneously help one another. Literalist Christ ians, on the other hand, 'want to command one another, out rivalling one another in their empt y a mbit io ns'. They are inflated with 'lust for power, each one imagining that he is superior to the others'.54 Ori gen, likewise, complains: 'In ma ny so -called church es, especially those in large cit ies, one can see rulers of the peopl e of God who do not allow anyo ne, so met imes not even the noblest of Jesus' disciples, to speak with them on equal terms.'55 THE VALENTINIANS Alt hough Literalist Christians had clearly dec ided that Gnostics were heretics, some Gnostics tried valiant ly to maintain the original visio n of the Jesus Mysteries by attempt ing to hold together the ever -widening gulf between the Outer and Inner Mysteries. Fo llo wing in the original Chr istian t radit ion of Paul, sages such as Valent inus viewed the Church as necessarily co mpr ised ofboth Psy chic and Pneumat ic Christ ians. Paul had constantly advised his disciples on how to keep these two levels of the Church living together harmoniously. Valent inus and hi s fo llo wers saw it as their duty, therefore, to try and reconcile Psychic (Literalist) and Pneumat ic (Gnostic) Chr istians. Paul discriminated between his logos (his Pneumatic teachings) and his kerygma (his Psy chic teachings),56 yet he also insisted that all Christ ians 'confess the same thing' to avoid destructive schisms wit hin the co mmu nit y.5 7Paul advised Pneumat ics58 to keep their understanding a secret 'between yourselves and God',59 so as to not offend the Psychics and so that 'together you may glori fyGod'.60 The Valent inians, likewise, did not disguise the fact that theytaught Inner Mysteries, but also participated in the outward ceremonies of the Church alongsi de Li teralist Christ ians.61 Irenaeus found it frustrating trying to argue theology with the Valent inians, for they simply agreed with everyt hing he said!62 He complains:"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"'They keep asking us how it is that when they confess the same things and ho ld the same doctrine, we call them heretics!'63 But the ol d heresy -hunter is quick to uncover w hat he takes to be a devious Gnostic conspiracy.

'Fro m w hat they say in public' the Valent inians appear to be Literalist Christ ians 'in outward appearance', but 'in private they describe the ineffable Mysteri es'. 4 Irenaeus co mp lains that they even 'assemble in unauthorised meet ings', that is, in meet ings not authorized by the bishop -who was of course Irenaeus himself!65 By the b eginning of the third century Valent inian Christ ians were also split between those in the East who had given up on the Literalists as a lost cause, regarding them as being outsi de the 'Body ofChrist', and the western Valentinians, such as Ptolemy and Hera cleon, who still fought to unite Christianit y.66 Quoting Jesus (who is in turn quoting Plato!67) they argued that 'many are called, but few are chosen , and explained that the majorit y w ho did n ot have Gnosis were the 'called’ , while the Gnostics were the c hosen elect who must teach the many and bring them to Gnosis.68 Ptolemy taught that Christ combined wi thin the Church both 'spiritual’ and 'unspiritual’ Christ ians so that eventually all may beco me spiritual. Elaine Pagels explains: 'Meanwhile, both belon ged to one church; both were baptised; both shared in the cel ebrat ion of the mass, -both made the same confessio n. What different iated them was the level o f their understanding. Uninit iated Christ ians mistakenly worshi pped the creator, as if he were God; t hey believed in Christ as the one who woul d save them from sin, and who they believed had risen bodily fro m t he dead; theyaccepted him by fait h but without understanding the mystery of his nature -or their own. But those who had gone on to receive Gnosis had co me t o recognise Chr ist as the one sent from the Father of truth, whose coming revealed to them that thei r own nature was i dent ical with his -and wit h God’s.’ 69 The Valentinians even conceded that the Literalist bishops, like Jehovah the demiurge, co uld legit imately wield authorit y o ver Psyc hic Christians. But the bishops’ demands, warnings and threats, like those of Jehovah himself, were irrelevant to Christ ians init iated into the Inner Mysteri es who had been redeemed and set free through the myst ical experience o f Gnosis.70 NO ORTHODOXY The carefully fostered tradit ional picture of the Gnostics is of a small group of lunat ic extremists on the fringes of orthodox Literalist Christ ianit y t o which the vast majorit y ofChrist ians subscribed. But this is simply ant i-Gnost ic propaganda.71 Actually, as Gibbon writes in The Decline and Fall o f the Roman Empire, the Gnostics 'covered Asia and Egypt, established them selves in Ro me, and sometimes penetrated into the provinces o f the West'.72 In the first few cen turi es CE there really was no such thing as 'the Church', only co mpet ing fact ions, of which the Li teralists were one. Just in Martyr, a Literalist, Marcion, an unco mpromising Gnostic, and Valent inus, who tried to heal the Gnostic/ Literalist divisio n, were all important Christian teachers in Ro me at exactly the same time.73 This is how diverse the Christ ian co mmu nit y was in the middle of the second century .

Valentinus, for example, was a highly educated Alexandrian philosopher and poet who was elected Bi shop of Egy pt. He was a major force in early Chr istianit y, and Irenaeus deplores the fact that many bishops, deacons, widows and mart yrs fro m t he Literalist communit y had sought init iation into Valent inian Christ ianit y.74 Even the bigoted Tertull ian admitted that Valent inus was 'a capable man, both in intelligence and eloquence'.75 Li kewise, the Literalist St Jerome admits that Marcion was a 'veritable sage'.76 The hero of Literalism Justin Mart yr, on the other hand, desperately wanted to be regar ded as a great philo sopher, but had been refused entry into Pythagorean and Platonic schools o f philosophy for his lack of knowledge of mathemat ics.77 It was only after these rebuffs that he became a Christ ian. The Gnost ic sages authored a huge number of gospels and spiri tual treati ses, including of course the original versio n of the Jesus story that became the New Testament Gospel of Mark. As well as this they also wrote the first commentaries on the gospels. Basilides was reputed to have written 24 books ofcommentaries, though without specific reference to the gospels which later became canonical. He was also said to have written a gospel himself and a book on Hindu teachings!78 Ptolemy and Heracleon (c.170) are both credited with writ ing a commentary of the Gospel ofJohn -so the first commentary on any book in the New Testament was also written by a Gnostic.79 Literalists, by com parison, produced litt le o f real substance, concentrating on polemics against heretics. These anti -Gnostic works only began to be written around the middle of the second century , when Literalism started to emerge as a force in its own right. According to the fourth -century Church propagandist Eusebius, the first anti -heresy writer was a certain Agrippa Castor (c.135).80 Justin Marty r (c.150) i s also known to have co mposed a work against heresies. Nei ther of these works survive, however. Some scho lars have conjectured that this is because theywere themselves far too 'unorthodox' for later orthodox Christ ians.81 No refutations of heret ics survive until the work of Irenaeus at the end of the second century. All subsequent refutations were based more or less on Irenaeus and frequent ly ju st copy his co mments and prej udices. But these documents attacking heret ics are not the definit ive statem ents of 'orthodox' Chr istianit y. In the first few centuries ce we simply do not find any 'orthodoxy' as we understand ittoday . Li teralism can only be regarded as 'orthodox' in retrospect, because Literalists eventually came to control the Church in later centuries. In the first few centuries, d ifferent fact ions wielded more or l ess power at different times and even the most fanat ically 'orthodox' of Chr istians could find themselves ending up as 'heretics'.

CHRISTIANITY AND JUDAISM As we have seen, the Christ ian co mmunit y was divided ri ght f rom the start on the vexed issue of its relati onship wi thtradi tional Judaism. By the middl e of the second century mo st Chri stians were Gent iles, not Jews, and had rejected circumcision and all the other prescript ions and proscri ptions laid down by Mo ses. But controversy still raged. Most Gnostics wanted to completely reject the Jewish god Jehovah in favour of a more myst ical concept ion of God as the supreme Oneness, ident ical to the God of Plato and the Pagan Mysteri es. The influent ial G nost ic t eache r Marci on argued for the complete separation of Chr istianit y fro m Judaism. He produced a text called The Ant itheses, which juxtaposed quotes fro m t he Old and New Testaments to demonstrate how they contradict each other.89 For Marci on, Jehovah was a 'co mmit ted barbarian'90 and the Old Testament merely a catalogue of his crimes against humanit y.91 Christ ianit y was a new revelat ion of the Good God, a universal doctrine which had nothing to do with the imperfect creed of one small nat ion.92 Most Li teralists al so rejected the traditions of Judaism. Indeed, Just in Mart yrrelates with approval the fact that many Literalists would not even talk to their fellow Christ ians who follo wed the Law of Moses, believing that such Christ ians would not enjo y et ernal salvat ion.93 However, Literalists did want to keep the Old Testament. It was regarded as relat ing a divine 'history ’, which endorsed their claim that the New Testament was also factual, not myt hical, It coul d also be used, often in the most ridiculous of ways, as a source of 'prophecies' about the coming of Jesus, which were felt to prove the truth of their Literalist perspective.

They therefore procl aimed that since the Jew s had rejected the saviour who m God had sent them, they had forfeited the ri ght to thei r own spi ritual heri tage, which now legit imately bel on ged only to Chr istians. These Jewish texts became known for the first time as the 'Old' Testament, which foretol d t he 'New' Testament of Christ ianit y. The scriptures of the Old Testament were even sui tably rearranged so that they ended wit h a prophesy which appeared to lead seamlessly into its appar ent fulfilment in the gospels.95 As Literalist Christ ianit y became mor e and more Romanized, so the blame for the death ofJesus was shift ed from the Roman governor Pilate to the Jewish nat ion as a who le.96 In the Gospel ofMatthew the Jewish crowd who demand that Jesus be put to death are made to chant: 'His blood be on us a nd on our children.' 97 As a modern authorit y wr ites: 'The legacy o f these words has been terrible.

It is significant that only at the recent Vatican council has a formal decla rat ion been made exonerating subsequent generat ions of Jews fro m r esponsibilit y for the murder of Christ.'98 From the second century onwards Literalist Christ ians wrote numbers of long and abusive tracts against the Jews.\" Bishop Melito of Sardis (c.170) denounced them as 'God -killers'100 - criminals who had invented an 'ent irely new sort of crime'.101 The devastation the Jewish nation had suffered at the hands of the Roman Empire was deemed to be God's just revenge. The Jews had brought their sufferings u pon them selves.102 Circumcisio n, which the opponents of Paul had regarded as a prerequisite for being a true Chr istian, became a sign o f sharing in the blood -guilt: 'For the ci rcumcisio n according to the flesh was given to you fro m Abraham as a sign so t hat you might be dist inguished fro m ot her nat ions and fro m us, and so that you alone might suffer what you now right ly suffer; so that your land might beco me desolate, and your cities burned, and strangers eat the fruits of your land before you, and not on e of you set foot in Jerusalem. Therefore these things have rightly and just ly co me upon you, for you put the just one to death, and before him his prophets and now you deal treacherously with those who hope in him, and withhim who sent him, Almight y Go d,the Creator of all things.'103 Whilst the Jews were increasingly vilified, traditions were fabricated which portrayed Pontius Pilate as a just and holy man -even a Christian! By the fourth century both Pilate and his wife were honoured as saints! This i s how ludicrous and contradictory the history of early Christ ianit y actually is. THE CREATION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT To wrest Christ ianit y away fro m t he Gnostics and build a centralized religio n based on common dogm as the Li teralist bishops needed to counte ract the influence of the large number of Gnostic gospel s ci rculat ing at the time. They therefore set out to create a limited canon of acceptable scri ptures as a definit ive statement of Christ ianit y and dismiss all other texts as spurious and"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"heret ical. Th e foundat ion fo r thi s was the Old Testament appropriated fro m t he Jews. However, the select ion of other texts to include was a problem. Different Christ ian communit ies had by this time adopted different texts as sacred and all argued that their preferred c ollect ion of gospels, letters and legends should comprise the canon. The argument raged from the end of the second century unt il the fourth century and beyo nd.104 It is a remarkable fact that although nearly all mo dern forms of Christ ianit y do not question the texts included in the New Testament, in the first f our centuri es every single document was at some time or other branded as eit her heret ical or forged!105 The first attempt at constructing a Christ ian canon was supposedly made by Papias o f Hierapo lisc.110. He is a vague figure of who m lit tle can really be said, although, interestingly, he refers to the Gospel of Matthew as a collection of 'oracles', which suggests the text that he had before him was significant ly d ifferent fro m t he text that has come down to us.106 There is clearly no New Testament in Just in Martyr's t ime (c.150). The 'memo irs o f the Apostles', to which he refers, are far fro m t he same as the four canonical gospels.107 In all his works he never ment ions Matthew, Mark, Luke or John. Ta tian (c.170) attempted to synthesize one gospel out of the others, and so cover up the contradict ions between them, but this failed to achieve general acceptance in the Christ ian co mmu nit y.108 At the end of the second century Irenaeus tried canonizing the four gospels we have today using as a criterion of authent icit y t he claim that each ofthem derived from one of Jesus' disciples -which is ironic, because Mark and Luke do not even pretend to be eyewit nesses of the events they describe!109 The New Testame ntexcluded so me o f the earliest and most quoted Christ ian t exts, such as The Gospel of Tho ma s, The Shepherd of Hernias and The Gospel o f the Hebrews, because none of them contain any reference to the quasi -histori cal story ofJesus. The Gospel of Tho mas claims to be a collect ion of 'secret sayings' of Jesus, as recorded by Thomas his 'twin'. The Shepherd of Hermas, which was extremely popular amongst early Christ ians, is a thinly veiled reworki ng o f an originally Pagan text in which Hermas meets a Pagan or acular priestess disguised as an embodiment of 'the Church'.110 As one modern authority remarks, although ignored today , the author of this work is actually 'the early Christ ian who m we know best after St Paul'.111 The Gospel of the Hebrews is the gospel m ost f requently ment ioned by name in the early Church.112 However, it is easy to see why, despite its early popularit y,itdid not m ake it int o th e New Testament either. Amongst other heresies it relates that Jesus was in his mother's womb for only seven mo nths -a strange claim that, as we have seen, was also made of the Pagan godm an Di onysus!113 Many Gnostic works, such as The Acts of Tho mas, were too popular to simply dismiss, so they were purged of their heret ical content and adapted to suit a Literalis t agenda. As one scho lar writes: 'Catholic bishops and teachers knew not how better to stem this flood of Gnost ic wri tings and their influence amo ng the faithful, than by bodily adopting the most popul ar narrat ions fro m t he heret ical books, and after care fully eliminat ing the poi son of false doctrine, replacing them in this purified form in the hands o f the peopl e.'114 The Acts of the Apostles may well have been such an adaptation of originally Gnostic texts.

For the Li teralists Jesus had been a mart yr, therefore to m eet one's death was a sign of follo wing gloriously in his footsteps. Cyprian (died 258 CE) vividly describes the delight of the Lord wi ththe 'sublime, th e great, the acceptable spectacle ’of'flowing bl ood which quenches the flames and the fires of hell by it s gl ori ous gore'.118 Literalist martyrs were idealized as spiritual athl etes and ho ly w arri ors in much the same way that Muslim extremists are today.1 19 To be mart yred was to be guaranteed a place in heaven. Wit h such a prize on offer, many Literalist Chr istians actively sought their death. They believed that 'through suffering for one hour, they purchase for themselves eternal life'.120 Tertullian decl ares that he desires to suffer 'that he may obtain fro m God complete forgiveness', by giving in exchange his blood.121 In many ways these fanat ics, gathered together in small groups on the fringes of societ y, resemble those modern religious cults which al so offer their adherents heavenly rewards for willingly seeking out death through mass suicide -although it is notable that somehow Tertullian and Irenaeus, two of the most vocal enthusiasts for glorious martyrdo m,them selves manage to avo id t his apparent ly desirable fate!122 The Gnost ics, by contrast, viewed the idea that martyrdom ensures salvation as a com plete misunderstanding of Christ ianit y.They believed that one should accept one's God - given fate, including meet ing a mart yr's death,123 but they regarded it as ridiculous and deluded to actively seek out martyrdo m as a quick way into heaven. Spiritual enlightenment was to be found through the myst ical realizat ion of Gnosis, not grand gestures. A Gnostic text called The Testimo ny o f T ruth declares th at those who are enthusiastic to be martyrs are the 'foo lish' who simply say the words 'We are Christians' yet who do not know 'who Christ is'. They are 'empt y martyrs, since they bear witness only to themselves'. Theirs will be only a 'human death' and wi ll not lead to the salvat ion which they expect, for 'these matters are not settled in this way' and 'they do not have the Word which gives life'. Those who teach that God desires 'human sacrifice' ar e making God into a cannibal.124 These Literalist Christ ians are 'the ones who oppress their brothers', by encouraging naive fellow believers 'to the executioner' under the illusio n t hat if they 'ho ld fast to the name of a dead man they will become pure'.125 The author of The Apocalypse of Peter is particularly horrified at Literalist exclamat ions of jo y o ver acts of vio lence done to the 'litt le o nes'.126 Clement of Alexandria writes of those who court mart yrdom mo re sympathet ically as children who have 'not yet beco me men in love with God, as the Gnostic is'. H e explains: 'No one, then, who is irrati onally brave is a Gnostic; since one might call children brave who through ignorance of what is to be dreaded, undergo things that are fright ful.So they touch fire even.

For there are, as in the gymnast ic contests, so also in church, crowns for men and for children.'127 The Gnost ics did not believe that Jesus literally died as a mart yr, but that his death symbo lically represented a profound myst ical truth. To imitate Jesus wa s not to court martyrdo m,but to di e to one's own lower self and resurrect as the Christ within. To the Li teralists such Gnostic attitudes made the sufferings o f the martyrs appear to be futile. The author of a letter attributed to Ignatius writes indigna ntly: 'But if, as so me say, Jesus' suffering was only in appearance, then why am I a pri soner, and why do I long to fight with the wild beasts? In that case, I am dying in vain.'128 Literalists saw Gnostics as traitors who were undermining their attempts to unite the Church in the face of oppression by o ffering a theological justification for cowardice.129 Gnostics, on the other hand, saw Literalists as fanat ical extremists leading the gullible to point less suffering with false promises.'30 THE ROMANS AND THE PERSECUTIONS The tradit ional history of the persecut ion of Christianit y p aints the Roman Empire as having a parti cular hatred of this new religio n, but this was not so. Rome was constantly purging itself o f myst ics, philosophers and religious cults, w hich it saw as a threat to its stabilit y.131 The Ro ma ns had a love/hate relat ionship with the Mysteries, of which the Christian cult was just another example. They were attracted to the exotic spiritualit y a nd profound philo sophy ofthese foreign cul ts, ye t also terrified by the radical challenge they presented to Roman po litical authorit y.The follo wers of the Mysteries of Dio nysus, for example, like the later fo llo wers of the Mysteries of Jesus, were accused of a conspiracy to overthrow the state. From as early as 186 BCE the Mysteri es of Dio nysus had been prohibited in Ro me and the shrines destroyed throughout Italy .132 Huge numbers of init iates were executed, somet imes many thousands at a time.133 Atvarious times during the first few centuries it was, in effect, a crime to philosophize in Rom e.1 34 Even the great Stoic philosopher Epictetus was exiled, along wit h countless others. Like Christ ian mart yrs after them, many philo sophers were sent to their death for refusing to com promise wit h t he tyrannical Ro ma n authorit ies. A text called The Acts of the Pagan Mart yrs glorifies the courage and integrity o f those persecuted init iates.135 Philo sophers are recorded as having gone to the stake laughing at the sudden collapse of human destinies' and dying 'unmo ving in the flames'.136 According to the tradit ional history of Christ ianit y,fro m t he earliest of times large numbers of Christ ians were horribly persecuted by the Romans. In fact, until the middle o f the thi rd century there was no legalized persecut ion of Chr istians. Previous persecut ions had been"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"against individuals only or limited to a particular cit y.Christ ians were not seen as a particular threat and therefore were not particularly oppressed. In the second century, the Emperor Trajan wrote to one of h is governors that Christians must be given a proper trial and that judges must not give weight to anonymous attacks. Christ ians were 'not to be hunted out' and accusers had to pay the costs of any prosecution.137 In 250 CE, however, plague swept the ancien t world, decimat ing whole populat ions. The Empire was on the verge of collapse and the Christ ian cult found itself being scapegoated for Roman misfortunes. The Emperor Decius ordered Christ ians to offer animal sacrifices to the gods for the healt h and well -being of the Empire and inst igated the first general persecut ion against those who refused. It lasted only a year, but was repeated under Valerian in 257 -9 and again under Diocl etian in 303 -5. In the whole of its history, therefore, Christianit y was offic ially persecuted for a total offive years.138 The scale of these persecutions, even the so -called 'Great Persecution' under Dioclet ian, is now known to have been wildly exaggerated by Christian propagandists.139 Writ ing in the middle o f the third century, Ori gen tell us that the 'few' Chr istians who had died for their fait h were 'easily numbered'.140 Under the persecutions of Deci us, in the huge cit y o f Alexandria only 10 men and seven women suffered for being Chr istians!141 Rom an governors actually often showed no desire to deliberately harm the Christ ians. Chr istians who refused to participate in the compulsory rituals of the Empire were offered a com promise. If they refused to eat sacrificial meat, might they not offer incense? One governor pleads wi th a woul d-be martyr: 'Do you want to wait a few days to think it over? Don't you see the beaut y o f this pleasant weather? No pleasure will co me yo ur way if you kill yourself.'142 Ironi cally, it was the Christ ians themselves who often courted mart yrdom . One group of Chr istians approached the governor of Asia and begged him to put them to death, but he refused, telling them that they were free to use cliffs and ropes if they wanted to die so much!143 Like the Gnosti cs, the Em peror and Stoic philo sopher Marcu s Aurelius saw such vo lunteering for mart yrdom as empt y posturing rather than an example of enlightened acceptance of fate. He writes: 'Readiness to die must come fro m a ma n's own judgment, not fro m mere obstinacy as wi ththe Christians: it must come cons iderately and in such a way as to persuade others that death is not horrible, not with tragic displays.'144 Som e Ro ma n E mperors were actually sympathet ictowards Christianit y,regarding it as another int erest ing and exotic Mystery religion. Alexander Seve rus (c.230) was even said to have had a statue of Christ in his private chapel alo ngside those of other godmen of the Pagan Mysteries.145 His mo ther was a patron of the Christ ian philo sopher Ori gen, as well as famous Pagan philosophers.146 THE GROWTH OF CH RISTIANITY Despite the tradit ional claims, there is no evidence that the Roman persecutions led to a significant increase in the number of Christ ians.

But this is co mp lete fantasy, first cult ivated by Tertullian (c.200), who makes the outrageous claim that: 'Nearly all the cit izens in nearly all the cities are Christ ians.’148 Schol ars now recognize that this is a ridiculous exaggeration.149 The mo re trustworthy Ori gen (c.240) admits that Christians were actually only a tiny fract ion of the ancient world's inhabitants.150 The quest ion of how many Christ ians there were in the first few centuries is ve rydifficult to answer. Inscript ions and Pagan texts make next to no references to Christ ians before 250. They are not ment ioned eit her in the two most substantial histories written in the early third century .151 We have only one actual statist ic, and that fro m t he fourth -century Christ ian 'histori an’Eusebius, who is an extremely unreliable source. He tells us that in 251 'more than fifteen hundred widows and poor people ’were supported by Ro me 's Christ ians, who included 154 ministers of varying rank (52 o f who m were exorcists!)152 Scho lars estimate that by 250 about 2 per cent of the Empire's populat ion was Christ ian.153 After this time, it may have risen to around 4 -5 per cent of the population.154 Even in the fourth century, however, Eusebius st ill knows ofonly three little townships which are Christ ian in t he ent ire Holy Land.155 The growth in the popularit y o f C hristianit y in t he fir st three centuries CE was not unique, but part of a general upsurge in the popularity o f the Mysteries throughout the an cient worl d. As it entered the new millennium, religious scept icism was rife wit hin the Ro ma n E mp ire. As Gibbon remarks, 'All gods were seen by philo sophers as equally true, by the polit icians as equally false, and by the magistrates as equally useful.'156 But Pl utarch tells us that the oracles that had been in decline during his youth were flourishing again at the beginning of the second century . During this century in At hens the ceremonies of Dionysus, which had lapsed com pletely, were reinstated and the number of people seeking init iation at Eleusis grew considerably. The Mysteries of Mit hras also became hugely popular across the whole of the Em pire.157 PAGAN REACTIONS TO CHRISTIANITY Chr istianit y was another Mystery cult gaining ground alo ngside many oth er such cults. However, itwas attracting the attention of Pagan intellectuals. Their reactions to this new religio n were similar to those of mainstream societ y t o the many fringe religious cults of today. When Chr istianit y became too popular to be simply ignored, its claims to originalit y were (justifiably) deri ded and its leaders accused of manipulat ing the gullible to line their own pockets and bo lster their own egos. Taci tus and Pliny (c.112), the first Pagan writers to take any notice of Christ ianit y,saw the Christ ians as just superstit ious fanat ics given to over -em oti onal enthusiasm.158 Celsus (c.170) described them as 'a people who have cut themselves off fro m t he rest of civilisat ion' by claiming thei r fait h t o be unique and in opposition to ancien t Paganism.159 In his view, Chr istians are irrational, for they 'do not want to give or receive a reason for what they believe' but rather win converts by telling them 'not to ask questions but to have fait h'.160 Celsus writes: 'Taking its root in the low er classes, the religio n cont inues to spread among the vulgar: nay one can even say it spreads because of its vulgarit y,and the illiteracy"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"ofits adherents. And while there are a few moderate, reasonable and intelligent peopl e who are inclined to interpre t its beliefs allegorically, yet it thrives in its purer form amo ng the ignorant.'161 His fr iend, the satirist Lucian, lampooned Christ ianit y a s ju st a confidence scam aimed at making mo ney fro m t he gullible: 'If a professio nal sharper who knows how to c apitalise on a situation gets among them , he makes himself a millio nai re overnight, laughing up his sleeve at the simpletons.'162 The Christian philosopher Origen, writ ing in the middle of the third century, is equally unco mp limentary towards the Christ ian communit y,describing it as made up of men concerned about how to make money and wo me n gossiping so loudly nothing could be heard!163 Origen sadly acknowledges that as Christianit y became an established religio n, so it became corrupt: 'I admit that at t he present time perhaps, when on account of the mult itude of peopl e co ming to the fait h even rich men and persons in positions of honour, and ladies of refinement, and high birth, favourably regard adherents of the fait h, one might venture to say that som ebeco me leaders of the Christ ian t eaching for the sake of a litt le prestige.'164 In the middle o f the third century a wealthy wo ma n called Lucilla actually paid to have her servant Majorinus made Bishop of Carthage!165 Paul of Samosata, Bishop of Ant ioch in 260, is reported to have found the service of the Church a very lucrat ive professio n. He extorted frequent contributions fro m t he rich amo ngst his flock, a large part of which he pocketed for himself to pay for his luxurious lifestyle.166 In 270 the Pa gan philosopher Porphyry wrote the most devastating crit ique of Chr istianit y in 15 vo lumes. He demonstrated that the Christ ian gospels were full o f inconsistencies, exaggerat ions, impossibilit ies and falsehoods, and could not be inspired by the true God. H e derided the belief in the physical resurrection as materialist ic and absurd. He regarded it as ignorant and vulgar for anyo ne to assert that the great and beaut iful cosmos would peri sh in an apocalypse whilst his own insignificant physical body would be preserved by God for eterni ty. For Porphy ry, promising any criminal that he would be abso lved and enter paradise as long as he was bapt ized before he died undermined the very foundat ions of an organized soci ety o f decent human beings.167 He objected to Chr istian claims to have discovered the one and only way to God, and presented in contrast the 'universal way' o f Pagan philosophy. He included in his books an oracle of Apo llo which praised Christ but asserted that the Christ ian cult was absurd because God I ncarnate was a myth.168 Not surprisingly, when the Roman Empire became Christ ian, Porphy ry's works were prompt ly banned and consigned to the flames.169 THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH It i s one of the great ironies of history that the might y Ro ma n E mp ire eventua lly came to embrace Christ ianit y -not only as another My stery cul t, but as the one and only true religio n.

How could this possibly have happened? The tradi tional history , of course, suggests that it could only have been the hand o f God guiding humanit y away from the darkness o f Paganism. Leaving aside the possibilit y t hat Christ ianit y is God's religio n of preference, however, there are other reasons for its success. Chr istianit y was not the only foreign Mystery cult adopted by the Roman Empire. In 304, just 17 years before Chris tiani tybecame the state religio n, another godman who was mir acul ously born on 25 December and whose devotees also celebrated a symbo lic meal o f bread and wine was declared the 'Protector of the Empire' -the Persian saviour Mithras. The Persians were the ma in rivals and ancient enemies of the Romans, so the Romans' adoption o f M ithras is actually even more shocking than their adoption of the Jewish saviour Jesus. The Mysteries o f M ithras spread extremely rapidly throughout the Roman Empire in the first ce ntury CE.170 At the heights of its popularit y in t he third century Mit hraism was pract ised fro m o ne end of the Empire to the other; as one mo dern authorit y puts it, 'from the banks of the Black Sea to the mountains of Scotland and to the borders of the gre at Sahara Desert ’.171 Mi thraic mo numents often tell us that slaves as well as freemen were init iates of the Mysteries and that often it was the former who achieved the highest ranks, -in Mit hraism the last indeed became the first.172 At the end of the secon d century Em peror Commodus himself was init iated int o th e Mysteries of Mit hras, which created an immense stir in the Ro ma n world and led to a great swell in the cult's popularit y.173A nu mber of Emperors after Commodus attempted to make Mit hraism the relig io n of the Empire. Other Rom an leaders had flirted to different degrees with different Mystery religio ns. Mark Anthony had st yled himself on Dio nysus. Claudius had looked to Attis. Vespasian had worshi pped Serapis. Domit ian honoured Osiris. Elgabalus trie d to enforce the monotheist ic cult ofHelio s.174 To endorse their claim o f 'o ne Em pire, one Em peror' in the face o f increasing fragmentation, the Roman Emperors needed 'one faith' -a universal or 'catholic' religion. All these cults were proposed at diffe rent times, but without success. In the first half o f the fourth century Emperor Constantine tried Christ ianit y. It was an ideal candidate for the role. The Romans needed a Mystery religio n because they were always popul ar wi ththe peopl e. But My stery rel igio ns were led by myst ics and philo sophers, who had the audacit y to question and undermine the authority of the state. Literalist Christ ianit y,however, was a Mystery religio n t hat had purged itself o f a ll its troubleso me int ellectual s. It was already an authori tari an religio n which encouraged the faithful to have blind fait h in t hose ho lding posi tions of power. It was exact ly w hat the Rom an authori ties wanted -a religio n wit hout myst ics, the Outer Mysteries without the Inner Mysteries, form without conte nt. In 321 Constantine became the first Christ ian E mp eror. Although his motivation was clearly poli tical, not spiritual, many years after the event he claimed that his conversio n had com e about through a holy visi on .175 On the eve of battle, he and 'all t he troops' had seen a 'sign ofthe cross' in the noonday sky, inscribed wit h t he words 'By this conquer.' This was not the familiar Christ ian cross, however, but the Pagan 'chi -rho' symbo l.176 Having gone to bed wondering what the sign in the sky had meant , Constantine had been visited in his dreams by Chr ist, who was bearing the same symbo l,and who commanded him to 'use its likeness in his engagements with the enemy'.177 Constantine emblazoned the emblem on his troops' shields, won the battle as promised and became a Christ ian. If he is to be believed, it would seem that Jesus the 'Prince of Peace' won over the most terrible Empire of the ancient world by o ffering its Em peror a m agical military talisman!

Wit h Constant ine's conversio n to Christ ianit y ,the chi -rho became interpreted as an abbreviat ion fo r Christ. This symbo l therefo re had a double meaning, one for Pagans and one for Christ ians, which suited Constantine's purposes perfect ly. Constant ine was above all a pragmat ist. His Christianit y was only prominent w hen it was polit ically expedient. When the victory he had been prom ised in his visio n was honoured with a mo nument, the inscript ion made no reference to Christ ianit y a nd depicted Roman so ldiers receiving divine assistance fro m t he usual Pagan heavenly helpers.178 Despite his miraculous conversio n t o Christianit y,Constant ine had his own head put on the massive statue of the sun god Helios in the forum in Ro me and had co ins minted which depicted him alongside Helios.17 9 And he st ill accepted the title o f Pontifex Maximus, the high priest of the Pagan world -as did a ll Chr istian E mperors up until 382!180 Like m ost Rom an Em perors, Constant ine was a vicious and ruthless man. During his wars in Gaul (306 -12) i t is recorded that: 'Even heathen feeling was shocked when he gave barbarian kings to the beasts, along wi ththeir fo llowers by thousands at a time.'181 Constant ine clearly did not become more compassionate after his conversio n to Christ ianit y. Almost immediately after presiding over the Christian Council o f N icaea in 325 ,he had both his son Crispus and his step -mo ther Fausta murdered.182 Indeed, he deliberately postponed being bapt ized unt il his deathbed so that he could continue sinning and yet be assured of a heavenly afterlife.18 3Constant ine's reputation was such that not even the Ro ma n Church could face making him a saint. 184 The inspirat ion fo r Constantine's Christ ianit y was his mother Helena, who had beco me a Chr istian so me t ime before. Forced into exile after being implicated in the murder of Constant ine's step -mo ther, she went on a tour of the Holy Land. Here s he miraculously found the tomb and birth cave o f Chr ist, along wit h t he remains of the three crosses used to crucify Jesus and the two thieves at Golgotha. This truly was an extraordinary miracle, since thousands of other Jews had been executed in the 300 year s that had elapsed since Jesus supposedly met his death!185 Constant ine erected churches on these fortuitously discovered sacred sites, which are still honoured as holy to this day. Bits of the ho ly cross were sent all around the Empire and Hel ena beca me hono ured by the Catho lic Church as ‘ St.Helena, Discover of the True Cross'!186 Constant ine also erected a giant basilica on the site of the shrine, supposedly marking Peter's grave in Ro me, which would beco me t he Vatican -the powerhouse of Ro ma n Catho licis m.187 Constant ine found the Christ ian co mmunit y deeply divided, as always -not just between Literalists and Gnostics, but also within the Literalist communit y it self. At the Council of Nicaea, Christ ians are said to have begun by piling the Emperor' s lap with pet it ions against fellow Christians!188 Constant ine himself had no grasp on theology. Indeed, he gave speeches which were embarrassingly clo se to heresy.189 However, he knew he needed unit y. He therefore enforced it. A creed was established at Nicaea that is st ill repeated in churches throughout the world today . Those bishops who refused to agree with the creed were exiled fro m t he Empire as criminals by decree o f the Emperor himself.190 Those who signed up were invited to stay on at Nicaea as C onstant ine's guests for his twentieth anniversary celebrat ions.191 Many bishops signed up and later regretted doing so.

He proclaimed toleration for all religio ns194 and even attempted to rebuild the Jewish temple in Jerusalem but, much to the delight of the ant i-Semi tic Christ ian Church, he never succeeded.195 Julian's Pagan renaissance was short lived and after he died Chr istianit y was reinstated and enforced with even greater vehemence. Despite the creed of Nicaea, the Christ ian Churc h remained forever divided against itself, engaging in constant polit ical in -fighting thinly disguised as theological debate. In the authori tari an at mo sphere of the times, the losers were exco mmunicated and their views made anathema. Yet no one was secure. An 'o rthodox' point of view today could be 'heret ical' tom orrow. Towards the end of the fourth century Hilary, Bishop of Poitiers, wrote despondent ly: 'Every year, nay, every moon we make new creeds to describe invisible mysteries. We repent of what we h ave done, we defend those who repent, we anathemat ise those whom we defended. We condemn eit her the doctrine of others in ourselves, or our own in that of others; and reciprocally tearing one another to pieces, we have been the cause of each other's ruin.' 196 By now even Literalist Christians had begun to see the Roman Church no longer as the fulfilment of Christ's plan but as the work of 'the ant ichrist'!197 THE FALSIFICATION OF HISTORY The Roman Church required a suitable history o f it s fait h which vilif ied its enemies and cel ebrated i ts tri umph as a sign of its God -given destiny. The truth of Christ ianit y's origins was, therefore, rigorously suppressed and a more acceptable history was concocted -a fa bricat ion which is st ill taken to be accurate by the vast m ajori tyofpeopl e to thi s day. The Gnost ics regul arly and unashamedly created fantasy gospels. But they acknowledged that they were my thologi zing. Their works, of which the Jesus story itself is an example, were never meant to be taken as anyt hing ot her than allegorical ficton. When the Literalists created their fantasies, however, they attem pted to pass them off as historical records. These works, which form the basis of the tradit ional history of Christ ianit y,are blatant forgeries.198 Atthe end o f the second century Paul's original letters were interpolated and new ones forged to bring him into line with Literalist Christ ianit y a nd distance him fro m Gnost icism. As part of the general Ro ma nizat ion of Christ ianit y,a tradi tion was even fabricated th at Paul had been in clo se co mmu nicati on wi ththe eminent Roman statesman Seneca. Three hundred manuscripts still survive containing eight letters from Paul and 11 letters of Seneca in reply -all com plete fakes, of course, but believed genuine until the la st century ! In them, Seneca is made to embrace Christ ianit y a nd Paul to nominate him as official preacher of the gospel at the imperial court!'99 In the fourth century, on the basis of these fabricat ions, Jerome included Seneca am ongst hi s catal ogue of Chr istian saint s.200 Letters were also forged in the names of various apostles. These are now included in the New Testament and regarded as ho ly scr ipt ure, but at the time were viewed with suspicio n. Even Eusebius, the mouthpiece of Catho lic propaganda, rega rded the authent icit y o f the letters of James, Jude, 2 Peter and 2 and 3 John as dubious and the Revelat ion as ent irely spuri ous.201"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Letters attributed to early Christ ians such as Justin Martyr, Ignatius of Antioch and Clement of Rom e cont inued to be forge d, adulterated and added to well into the fift h century .202 Translat ing works into Latin afforded opportunit ies fo r di storti on. In this way teachings such as those of the Christ ian philosopher Origen were made to appear in sympathy wit h what was regarded as orthodox at the time.203 Fict itious biographies were routinely constructed for Christ ian saints, often direct ly ba sed on the lives and legends o f dead Pagan holy men.204 Stories were invented of Peter coming to Rom e and being crucified upside down to g ive credence to the Church of Ro me being the centre ofChr istian power. But these tales were invented so late that no one even considered including them in t he New Testament. Popul ar Gnostic works were edited to remove their Gnostic teachings and replace them withdoctrinally correct m aterial .205 Christ ians even adapted Pagan works to endorse their own dogm a. Oracl es by the Pagan Sibyl which prophesied the coming of Jesus were forged early in the fourth century and quoted by Constant ine hims elf at the Coun cil o f N icaea as proof of Jesus' divinit y.206 They even forged a Testament of Orpheus in which the ancient prophet of the Mysteri es was made to deny his former Pagan teachings.207 Clumsy Christ ian addit io ns were made to the works of the Jewish Pythagorean Philo,208 and ridiculous legends invented that he had held discussions on the Law with the disciple John and met Peter in Ro me !209 The Jewish historian Josephus was likewise transformed into a Chr istian and was even equated with the New Testament figure o f Jo seph of Arimathea!210 As previously discussed, addit ions were made to his works which reverent ially testify to the histori cal existence of Jesus.211 A further document attributed to Josephus called On the Essence of God was also forged to reinforce th e previous forgery by putting Christ ian doctrines into Josephus ’mo uth. Through careful linguist ic studies, scho lar s now know 'beyo nd any doubt ’that the forger of this text was none other than Hippo lyt us (c.222), the arch heresy -hunter and protege of Iren aeus!212 Scholars have also shown similarit ies in language and st yle between this forgery and Paul's Second Letter to the Thessalo nians, which was written to call int o question the authent icit y o f the fir st (genuine) letter.213 So, Hippolytus may well have also have been the forger of this letter of Paul .214 ST PONTIUS PILATE! The ludicrous nature of what passed for history in the early years of Christianit y is graphically illustrated by the whi tewashing of Pontius Pilate. This brutal Ro ma n governor was so hated by the Jews that he had been made responsible for the saviour's death by those who had originally put the Jesus myt h int o an historical context. But by the second century Tertullian relates the ludicrous tal e that Pilate had washed his hands of Jesus ' death because 'in his secret heart' he was actually a Christ ian!215 According to Tertullian the earliest news of Christ ianit y t o reach Rome was a report from Pilate indicat ing that Christ (whom he supposedly had just executed) was indeed divine.2 16Em per or Tiberi us (who was well known for despising all religio n) immediately wanted to pl ace Christ amongst the pantheon of Ro ma n gods, but had his plans rej ected by the Senate. For some reason this powerful Emperor did not question his normally servile senator s, but instead contented himself wit h shielding Christians fro m t he severit y o f repressive laws. This in itself is so met hing of a miracle, as Tiberius was living many years before such laws were enacted!217"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Subsequently a document called The Acts of Pilat e was forged based on Tertullian's fantasy . Then a further text called The Gospel of Nicodemus was based on this text to create what one modern scho lar calls 'a fict ion t hree levels deep'.218 In The Gospel of Nicodemus we are tol d that when Pilate's report ofJesus' execut ion reached Ro me, the Emperor ordered Pilate to be brought before him in chains. In front of the who le Senate, the gods and the army, the Em peror then declared: 'How could you dare to do such a thing, you most impious one, when you had see n such great signs concerning that man? By your wicked daring you have destroy ed the whole world. As soon as they handed him over to you, you should have kept him secure and sent him to me, and not have fo llo wed them and crucified such a man who was righte ous and did such wonderful signs as you ment ioned in your report. For it is clear from these signs that Jesus was the Christ, the king o f the Jews .’219 Once the Emperor had spoken Christ's name all the statues of the gods fell down and became as dust. Pil ate excused himself by claiming that the 'insubordinat ion of the lawless and godless Jews’ had made him do it. So the Emperor issued a decree against the Jews, demanding: 'Obey and advance against them, and dispersing them amo ngst all the nations enslave them , and expel them from Judea, making the nat ion so insignificant that itis no longer to be seen anywhere, since they are men full o f e vil. ’ Pilate was then led to his execution uttering a prayer to the Lord. As he finished the vo ice of Jesus announced from heaven: 'All generations and families of the Gentiles shall call you blessed, because in your governorship all was fulfilled which the prophets foretold about me, and you shall appear as my witness at the Second Coming.’ We are then told that Pilat e's head was cut off and he was received by an angel of the Lord, at which po int his wife Procla was so overcome with jo y ( sic!) that she immediately gave up the ghost and was buried wit h her husband.220 Pilate ended up being revered as a saint in the Copt ic Church and has his own feast day on 25 June!221 His wife Procla was also revered as a saint in the Eastern Church. Alt hough this may have been believed as history at the time, to modern ears it sounds like obvious nonsense. Yet the more acceptable trad itional history that has been taken as 'gospel truth' for 1,500 y ears was created by the same people who gave us this balo ney. It is just as fanciful and inaccurate, and if it were not for its familiarit y it woul d be just as easy to dismiss. EUSEBIUS THE C HURCH PROPAGANDIST The who le fict it ious history ofChrist ianit y was finally organized and definit ively co llated in the fourth century by Bishop Eusebius, who is known as the 'father of Church history'. He was one ofthe bishops who completely changed their theologi cal posi tion at the Council o f N icaea to court the favour of Emperor Constantine.222 He subsequent ly became Constant ine's personal biographer, glossing over his murders with obsequious flattery.223 Eusebius explained to the fait hful that just as t he Word of God guides and governs the heavens, so the Roman Emperor"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"expresses the will o f God in the go vernment of the civilized world. 24 The Emperor was the vo ice of Christ on Earth! Eusebius' job was to provide Roman Christ ianit y with a suitable history , a task he perform ed wi thlittle regard for truth.225 With beautiful understatement, one modern authorit y describes reading Eusebius as entering a 'tantalising, literary world where not every thing said is to be taken ent irely at f ace value'.226 Another m odern scho lar more blunt ly calls him 'the first thoroughly dishonest and unfair historian of ancient times'.227 Another describes Eusebius' 'dishonest y' in his 'deliberate falsificat ion of dates'.22' Another describes Eusebius' history as 'superficial' and 'intent ionally falsified' and created in 'a very unscrupulous and arbitrary spi rit'.229 As another historian right ly o bserves, 'What can be gleaned of Eusebius does not endear him much to modern scho lars.'230 Eusebius himself indirect ly confesses that he has included in his account of Christ ian history only that which 'might redound to the glory' of the Church, while suppressing whatever coul d disgrace it. 231 A mo dern scho lar concludes: 'We are bound therefore to regard his labours with the greatest mist rust, and to pronounce it a most uncrit ical course to quote him as a competent authorit y; as is the custom of so many in spite of this delinquency, whenever it suits their purpose.'232 Eusebius is quoted as an authorit y o n Chr istian history simply because his is the only surviving 'history ’ofthe Church during the first three centuries.233 His account has, therefore, been adopted by all Church historians after him, thereby perpetuating the lies which have beco me t he tradi tional history ofChrist ianit y. In his 'history' Eusebius repeats all o f the standard accusat ions against the Gnostics. To just ify the claims of the Literalist bishops to represent the original Christ ian t radi tion, he presents apostolic lines o f successio n which link them back to Jesus' d isciples. These supposed lineages were forged earlier, probably by Irenaeus, but Eusebius makes his own addit io ns.234 Often he gives no more than a list of names which he has worked into a history by guesswork and invent ion, often creating inconsistencies and obvio us errors in the process.235 He has bishops leading the Church in Rome from early in the first century, although of course there is abso lut ely no evidence that a single leader of the Christ ian communit y in Ro me emerged unt il much, much later.236 Eusebius also wildly exaggerates the numbers o f Chr istians who suffered in the persecutions and creates biographies for Christ ian mart yrs which are actually derived fro m t he legends of Pagan mart yrs.237 Alt hough he is keen to catalogue the works of earlier Chr istian wri ters, he wisely avo ids telling us any o f the ideas they expressed and thus does not lay them or himself open to accusations of heresy. Even in his account of Origen, who had been the great inspirat ion of his youth, Eusebius tells us nothing o f Or igen's ideas, which were beginning to beco me highly suspect in the orthodox communit y.238 As fo r the Jews, Eusebius delights in their tragi c fate at the hands of the Romans, believing it is no more than they deserved for murdering the saviour. Having w ritten pages relat ing every grueso me detail o f their suffering withobvious relish, he concludes, 'Such was the reward of the Jews' iniquitous and wicked treatm ent of God's Christ.'239 Eusebius constructs the absurd story that God tol d the original Christ ians of the Jerusalem Church to flee to safet y in neighbouring Pella before, in his wrath, he destroyed"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Jerusalem in 70 CE (with a litt le help from the Romans!)240 Yet he also relates that when later Chr istians went in search of the Jerusalem Church they f ound only a group of Ebionite Gnostics.

But then he never seems to notice just how crazy and contradi ctory his fantasies are. Wit hout even the slightest trace of conscience, Eusebius even miraculously produces fro m 't he archive' a letter written by Jesus himself to the Prince of Edessa, congratulat ing the Prince for believing in the saviour without ever having seen him!241 This then was the man who gave us what has passed for the history of Christianit y,an obsequious emplo yee of a tyrannical Rom an Em peror who based his work on a 200 -year tradit ion of deceit and forgery.242 THE DESTRUCTION OF PAGANISM In the second century Tertullian , who cl aimed to have been converted to Christ ianit y by witnessing Christians going to their death as mart yrs, admitted he too had once enjo yed watching 'the ludicrous cruelt ies' o f Roman public persecut ions.243 This lo ve of gore and suffering does not see m to have deserted him after he became a Christ ian. Wit h obvious relish he paints a grim and vio lent picture of the fate await ing Pagans at the 'Final Judgement': 'You are fond of spectacles, expect the greatest of all spectacles, the last and eternal jud gment of the universe. How shall I admire, how laugh, how rejo ice, how exult, when I beho ld so many proud monarchs, and fancied gods, groaning in the lo west abyss of darkness, -so m any magistrates who persecuted the name of the Lord, liquefying in fiercer fires than they ever kindled against the Christ ians; so m any sage philosophers blushing in red hot flames with their deluded scho lars; so m any celebrated poets trembling before the tribunal, not of Minos, but of Chr ist; so many tragedians, more tuneful in the expressio n of their own sufferings; so many dancers...'244 And on he goes, delight ing in the grueso me t errors his opponents will endure for all eternit y. Little did he know that within a few generations such terrors would indeed afflict many Pagans, not at the Final Judgement, but in the fourth century at the hands of the Ro ma n Catho lic Church. Having been adopted as the religion o f the Roman Empire, the Literalist Church terrori zed Pagans wit h relent less brutalit y.Pagan prophets were seized and tort ured until they acknowledged that their gods were frauds.245 Priests were chained to their shrines and left to starve to death.246 Without any evidence to endorse the accusat ions, Pagans were condemned for sacrificing children, sprinkling their blood on al tars to the gods and making guitar strings fro m t heir guts -fantasy crimes to which they duly confessed after suffering agonizing tortures. Many were then burnt alive.247 Som e ancient shrines were desecrated and razed to the ground while others were comm andeered and forcibly transformed into Christian churches.248 The great works of Pagan spi rituali tywere thrown onto enormous bonfires and lost for all t ime. One witness records: ‘Innumerable books were piled together, many heaps of vo lumes drawn fro m var ious houses, to be burnt under the eyes of the judges as prohibited. Owners burnt thei r ent ire libraries. So great was the terror that seized everyo ne.’ 249"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Paganism was not attacked for mistakenly worshipping nonexistent gods. Nor was it ever disputed tha t the gods could indeed perform miracles such as healing the sick and predict ing the future. Rather, Pagan gods were deemed to be devils who worked their magic to deceive and mislead the gullible.250 Pagan 'Daemo ns' became evil 'demo ns' whose worship must be stamped out.251 In the middle o f the fourth century a bisho p dem anded of the Christ ian E mp eror Constant ius Constans: 'It i s enj oined on you by the law of the supreme God, that you severely prosecute in every way the crime of idolatry.

The Pagan Libanius appealed to the Emperor to intervene: 'You have not ordered either that the temples be closed or that no one should enter them .

The attacking forces in each case are numerous, but after countless abuses these separate groups come together and demand an account from each other of what they have done, and it is shameful not to have done t he greatest dam age. ’254 An anonymous Pagan (c.390) sadly predicts:"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"'When I die there will be no shrines, and the great ho ly t em ples of Serapis will depart into formless gloom, and a fabulous and insubstantial darkness will hold sway over the fairest thin gs of earth .’255 Finally , on 16 June 391 Emperor Theodosius issued an edict that closed down all Pagan tem ples.256 A Christ ian mo b immediately took the opportunit y to destroy the wondrous tem ple of Serapis in Alexandria, leaving only its foundat ions.257 An imperial decree demanded: 'Burn all books hostile to Christ ianit y lest they cause God anger and scandalise the pious ’258 and in response illiterate monks destroyed thousands of years of accumulated wisdo m and scientific knowl edge as so much Pagan supers tition. The Pagan writer Eunapius, who describes 'mo nks who resemble men but live like pigs', wri tes despairingly that 'Any on e who had a black robe had despotic power.’ 259 In 415 Archbishop Cy rilofAlexandri a had his mo nks incite a Christ ian mo b to murde r the last Pagan scientist of the Alexandrian Library, a remarkable woman called Hypat ia.260 She was torn limb fro m limb and Cyril was made a saint.261 In the reign o f Constant ine Christ ianit y had been accorded equal status with the Pagan religions of the Em pire. Half a century later, i n t he reign of Theodosius, it was declared to be the only religi on that a person was permitted to practise.262 Theodosius died in 395. Exact ly 15 years later the Visigoths ravaged Ro me. This proud city, the centre of the gr eatest empire of the ancient world, had flourished for a millennium under its own gods. Within a few decades of turning to Christ ianit y, it had destroy ed all the wonders and achievements of ant iquit y and then perished itself.263 Christianit y did not succee d as the one religio n of the Ro ma n Empire where Mit hraism and the other Pagan cul ts had failed. In fact, Christ ianit y was the religion which acco mpanied its downfall. THE DESTRUCTION OF GNOSTICISM Even after Literalist Christianit y had beco me t he state rel igio n of the Ro ma n E mp ire, Gnosti cism rem ained a powerful force. In the fourth century heretical Christ ians were st ill so commo n t hat Cy rilofJerusalem had to warn the faithful to be careful not to step into a Gnostic church by mistake.264 In the reign of Theodosi us there were so many heretics amo ngst the clergy and mo nks in Egypt that the Patri arch Timothy made eating meat compulsory on Sundays, to flush out the vegetarian Gnostics!265 Despite his obvious Gnosticism, the philosopher Synesius was even ele cted Bi shop of Cy rene.266 He had studied Platonic philosophy with Hypatia the Pagan scient istofAlexandria and considered the resurrection to be an allegorical representation of an ineffable Mystery. He taught that the only true religio n is p hilosophy and that the stories and pract ices o f religion are, at best, no more than helpful popular expressio ns o f philosophic truth for non -philosophers.267 In the contemporary climate of orthodoxy , however, he was forced to promise that as bishop he woul d toe the lin e in public but 'philo sophise in private'.268 Yet he still transformed his Easter Eve ceremony for the newly bapt ized into an init iation which had more in commo n wit h t he Pagan Mysteries than orthodox Christ ianit y.269 In response to the continuing popular it y o f G nosti cism the Ro ma n Church set out to unify Chr istianit y by fo rce -an intent ion it carried out with ruthless efficiency. Theodosius passed over 100 laws against Gnostics, declaring illegal their beliefs, meetings, proselyt izing, ownership of prope rty and eventually their very existence!370 One decree reads:"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"'Understand now by this present statute; Novatians, Valent inians, Marcionites, Paulicians, with what a tissue of lies and vanit ies, wi thwhat destructive and veno mo us errors, y our doctrines are inextricably woven!

To prevent this we command you be deprived of all the houses in which you have been accustomed to meet and that these should be handed over immediately to the Catholic Church.'271 In 381 Theodosius finally made heresy a crime against the state. Gnostic writ ings were condemned as a 'hotbed of manifo ld perversit y' which 'should not only be forbidden, but ent irely destroy ed and burned wit h fir e’.272 All philo sophical debate was ent irely suppressed. A procl amat ion declares: There shall be no opportunity for any man to go out to the public and to argue about religio n or to discuss it or give any counsel.'273 Early in the fift h century an abbot, w orking as a 'heavy' for Cyril, the powerful Archbishop of Alexandria, led attacks on heretical Christ ian co mmunit ies, threatening, 'I shall make you acknowledge the Archbishop Cyril, or else the sword will wipe out most of you, and moreover those of you w ho are spared will go into exile.'274 Augustine, the great spokesman for Catholic Christianit y,expressed the mood of the times perfect ly w hen he explained that coercion was necessary since many people respond only to fear.275 Military force was 'indispen sable' to suppress heret ics -for thei r own good, of course. Augustine proclaims: 'Filled wit h fear myself, I fill you with fear.'276 St Paul's spiritualit y o f lo ve and Gnosis had beco me t he Roman Church's religio n of obedience and terror.277 INHERENT INTO LERANCE Alt hough modern Christ ianit y is made up of countless diverse sects with opposing approaches, nearly all o f them - Catholics, Orthodox, Protestants, Non -Conformists and others -are fundamentally shaped by the triumph of Literalism in the fourth cen tury . Most Christians today base their fait h on the historical existence of Jesus. They assent to the apostolic creed formulated under the direct ion of the tyrannical Constant ine. They read only those few texts that happened to have been selected for inclu sion in t he New Testam ent through a process of constant doctrinal conflict, flagrant forgery and corrupt power polit ics in the early Church. We have heen left with the mistaken idea that Literalism is Christ ianit y,not merely one current of thought within it. Why did Literalism triumph over Gnosticism? By its very nature, Gnosticism attracted peopl e of a myst ical nature. Literalism, on the other hand, attracted those interested in establishing a religio n. Gnostics were concerned wit h personal enlightenment , not creating a Church. They could never have triumphed over the Literalists, because they could never have had the desire to do so. Literalism was ori ginally the Outer Mysteries of Christ ianit y,designed to attract init iates to the spiritual path. With their fascinat ing tales o f magic and miracles, and promise o f immortalit y t hrough the simple acts of bapt ism and belief, the Outer Mysteries were meant to be"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"mo re popul ar and wi dely appealing than the Inner Mysteries. As Jesus says, 'Man y are called but few are chosen.’ 278 If the original integrit y o f the Jesus Mysteries had survived, the popularit y ofthe Outer Mysteries would have naturally led more and more init iates into the Inner Mysteries ofGnosis. Once Gnosticism and Literalism were two dist inct tra dit ions in conflict with each other, i t was inevitable that Literalism would prove the more popular. The eventual triumph of Literalism over Gnost icism was a foregone conclusion. What is surprising is that it took so long. Above all, however, Literalist C hristianit y's success was due to one great qualit y it had fro m t he beginning and continues to foster -int olerance. Thi s is not a quirk of history, it is a logical by -product of taking the Jesus story as historical fact. Paganism and Gnosticism were inher ent ly t olerant because they were based on myths.279 Different cults believed in different myt hs, but thi s di dn't m ean that they were in opposit ion to each other. Pluralit y was acceptable because what mattered was the inner meaning, not the parti cular expre ssi on . But i ntolerance is inherent in Literalism. If Jesus is the one and only Son ofGod who requires the fait hful to acknowl edge this as historical fact, then Christ ianit y mu st be in opposition to all other religio ns who do not teach this. Moreover, if a ll unbelievers are to be damned for eternit y it beco me s the moral duty of Literalist Christ ians to spread their beliefs, by force if necessary, to save as many souls as possible, even if it means destroying their bodies to do so. The Roman Church's attacks upon Paganism and Gnosticism were a religious crusade, a God -given duty. Self -righteous intol erance had become ho ly. CONCLUSION As we reviewed the evidence, it seemed to us that the tradit ional 'history' of Christ ianit y was nothing less than the greatest cover up of all t ime. Christ ianit y's ori ginal Gnostic doctrines and its true ori gins in the Pagan Mysteries had been ruthlessly suppressed by the mass destruction of the evidence and the creation of a false history to suit the polit ical purposes of the Ro man Church. All those who questioned the official history were simply persecuted out of existence unt il t here was no one left to dispute it. Parallels wit h mo re recent history helped us to understand what had happened. At the beginning of the twentieth ce ntury a sm all handful of Communists took power in Russia. Yet within a few years huge numbers of people, including many o f the civil servants who had administered the previous regime, had jo ined the Communist Party. Why? Because if you wanted to get on you now had to be a Party member and if you associated yourself in any way withthe past regime you were branded an enemy of the people. Similarly, once Christ ianit y became the religio n of the Ro ma n E mp ire, i ts numbers began to swell enormously. Why? Because Chr istians were given preferent ial treatm ent. The cl ergy were not even required to pay tax!280 If you wanted a peaceful and successful life, you became a Christ ian. If you did not, y ou risked beco ming branded as a Pagan 'dissident' -an enemy o f God. Just a s Stalin's propaganda machine unscrupulously falsified a history for itself which disguised its tyranny and proved its dogm as to be true and good, so the Christ ian propaganda machine likewise fed its lies to the fait hful. Like Communism, Christ ianit y bega n wit h a message of freedo m and equalit y but ended up creati ng an authoritarian and despotic regime. In recent years dogmat ic int olerance has led fanat ical young Communists in China and Cambo dia to l aunch disastrous cultural revo lut ions which have destroye d the ancient riches of their civilizat ions and exterminated large numbers o f the intelligentsia, leaving their societ ies in deep crisis.

Pagan myst icism and scientific enquiry were replaced by dogmat ic authoritarianism. The Ro ma n Church imposed its creed with threats and vio lence, denying generations o f hu man beings the right to think their own thoughts and find their personal route to spiritual salva tion.

In the first century BCE Posidonius had create d a beautiful revolving model of the so lar system which fait hfully represented the orbits of the planets.282 By the end of the fourth century CE it was sacrilegious not to believe that God placed the stars in the heavens each night.283 In the third century BCE, the Alexandrian scho lar Eratosthenes had correctly calculated the circumference of the Earth to within a few per cent, but now it had become a heresy not to believe that the Earth was flat.284 We fo und ourselves asking, if Paganism was so primit ive and Literalist Christ ianit y is t he one true religion, why was Pagan civilizat ion replaced by the 1,000 years we appropriately call the 'Dark Ages'?"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"The Greatest Story Ever T old 'There is one river of Truth which receives tributaries from every side.'1 Clement of Alexandria The ancients would no doubt regard it as fitt ing that we should re -evaluate Christ ianit y at this mo ment in t ime. According to Pagan astrology, Christ ianit y w as created at the beginning of the Great Month of Pisces. This Age is present ly co ming to an end and the New Age of Aquarius is dawning. From the ancient perspective, therefore, we stand at a similar turning point in the flow ofhistory as the early Christ ians. The times we are living in are in many respects reminiscent of the last change of Ages. Apocalypt ic fears abound. Strange new eclect ic cults are springing up everywhere. Established religio n is d iscredited and in decline. What form will spiritualit y t ake in the coming Age of Aquarius? To m ove confident ly fo rward into the futu re it is necessary to come to terms wit h t he past, so it is appropriate to crit ically examine the Literalist Christ ianit y w hich has do minated the last 2,000 y ears o f o ur culture. Spiritually this truly has been a 'Dark Age' characterized by authori tari an r eligi on, religious bigotry and religio us wars. By assuming the role of the only true fait h Literalist Christ ianit y has created an unbridgeable gulf between itself and all other spiritual tradi tions. Its self -procl aimed superiorit y has been used to just ify the vio lent destruction of other soci eties around the world. It has even horribly persecuted its own myst ics and free -thinkers. By adopting the Jewish father god Jehovah as the only acceptable face of God, it has subjugated the Divine Feminine, a theologic al perspect ive it has used to legit imize the subordination o f women. Itsinsistence on blind faith in dogma and opposit ion to intellectual inquiry has led many to reject all forms of spiritualit y as mere superst it ion. For more and more people today religio n is at best a joke and at worst a source of prejudice, intolerance and conflict. Whereas other cultures honour their ancestors as the source of their wisdo m a nd civilizat ion, we have vilified ours as Devil worshippers. What has this done to the Western psyche? We have been a culture cut off fro m it s roots. Only after the rediscovery o f Pagan philosophy in fifteenth century, during the appropriately named Renaissance, or 'rebirth ’, was Western civilizat ion able to climb out of the morass of superst ition an d strife into which it had descended, a process which in recent years has yielded the fruit of modern science. Yet, unlike the ancients, we have not viewed science and spiritualit y as two aspects of the same Mystery, but as implacably hostile to each other . Alt hough it set out to unify the world under the banner of one religio n, Literalist Chr istianit y has actually been the cause of deep divisio ns: Christ ians against heathens, men against women, science against religion, fait h against reason. The Jesus Mys teri es Thesis is not just a new history of Christ ianit y,itis an opportunity to heal the wounds left in the Western soul by t hese dreadful schisms. If Christ ianit y w ere to acknowledge its debt to the ancient Mysteries it could connect again to the univer sal current of human spiritual evolut ion and beco me a partner, not an adversary , of all the other religious tradit ions it has branded as the work of the Devil.

Only by returning to its myst ical roots will Christ ianit y play a role in the creation o f a new spiritualit y for the New Age of Aquarius. Literalist Christ ianit y is bu ilt on the unsteady foundations of histori cal lies. Sooner or later it must topple over. But myst ical Christ ianit y r ests securely on the bedrock of timeless myt hical truth and is as relevant today as it always has been. ONE TRUTH Myst ics of all s piritual tradi tions have taught that there is only one Truth, ever present and never changing. It was not suddenly revealed for the first time 2;000 years ago. Christianit y is o nly a chapter in the perennial human quest for meaning, a current in the sea of evo lving human consciousness, another attempt at articulat ing the timeless Gnosis towards which myst ics have reached fro m t he mo st ancient of days. God did not come to Earth on a once -only excursio n. Nor do we have to wait for his promised apocalypt ic ret urn. The truth is, God never left. Alt hough there is now no tradit ion which can init iate m odern Christ ians into the secret Inner Mysteries encoded in the Jesus story, these profound myst ical teachings are st ill there for those with 'eyes to see' and have been cont inually discovered by the greatest Christ ian myst ics throughout the centuries. Thoroughly exploring what these teachings are is too large a task for thi s present book and must await a further work. All we hope to have established is that there is essent ially one perennial philo sophy at the heart of both the Pagan Mysteries and Christ ianit y, and that these two tradit ional enemies are in fact close relat ives. Our desire is not to attack Christ ianit y,but to point to the possibilit y o f it regaining something it has lost -the Inner Mysteries which reveal the secrets of Gnosis, We do not feel that the Jesus Mysteri es Thesis undermines Chr istianit y,but rather that it reveals the ancient grandeur ofthe Jesus story . It truly is the 'greatest story ever tol d' -a story that has been thousands of years in t he making. In his Study of History, Arno ld Toynbee wrote: 'Behind the figure of the dying demigod there looms the greater figure of a very God that di es for different worlds under diverse names -for a Minoan world as Dionysus, for a Sumeric world as Tammuz, for a Hittite world as Attis, for a"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Sy riac worl d as Adonis, for a Christ ian world as Christ.

Men andwo me n were admitted as equals, all possessio ns were shared inco mmo n and neophytes took a five -year vow of silence. The Py thagoreans rose at dawn to worship the rising sun, spent the day in philo sophical study and religious observances, and at a communal evening meal there were readings fro m sacred scri ptures.

To the init iates of the Mysteries, a human being consisted of amaterial body and a spiritual soul. Our divine 'father' is God, who gives us our immortal soul, our material 'mother' is the Earth(matter), who gives us a mo rtal body. Matter can not give birth alone, but is myster iously impregnated by invisible Spi rit to produce Life,and so is portrayed as a perpetual virgin.

Such motifs led Frazer to see the godraan of theMysteries as 'a personificat ion of the corn' whose death andresurrection represented the harvest ing and regrowth ofthe crops. The Egypt ians bea t th eir breasts and sang a lament as they cut thefirst corn and tram pled it on the threshing floor, because Osiris was 'dying' so that they coul d have bread to live fro m.Likewise, the Greeks wore Dionysus masks and sang sacred songs to the god while they trod the grapes, because Dio nysus was 'dying' to provide them wit h int oxi cat ing wine. During their great fest ival o f so wing, Egypt ian pri ests used to bury effigies of Osiris made of earth and corn which, when exhumed later, were found to have sprouted. Fra zer explained, 'This sprouting ofthe grain would be hailed as an omen, or rather as the cause, of the growth of the crops. The corn -god produced the corn fro m himself; he gave his body to feed the people, he died that they might live.' As we have observed , however, Osi ris-Dionysus was much more than just a god of corn or wine. Egy ptian hieroglyphs call Osiris the 'Life -Force'. He represents the mysterious process of death and resurrection that is Life itself. Pagan commentators, such as Plutarch, acknowled ged the more superficial agricultural allegories in the myt hs of Osiris -Dionysus, but pointed to the deeper myst icalmeaning. To them, the harvest ing and regrowth of the crops was itself an allegory for human death and rebirth. Just as corn grows from seed s planted in the ground, so human beings could be spiritually reborn after they were dead and buried. The Mysteri es may have perhaps begun as magical rites to ensure the continued fert ilit y o f the land, as Frazer suggests, but in their developed form they came to embody the promise of immortalit y to human beings. 173 Ibi d., 338 174 Mark 14 v 24 175 John 15 v 1 -6 176 Wallis Budge, E.

Before the Mysteries came to Greecefrom Egypt the old Olympian rites m ade sacrifice to the gods on theprinciple of reciprocit y -that having sacrificed to the gods, the godswould then give something back to the people. The uneatensacrificial offerings o f the Olympian religio n were replaced by theMystery rites in which init iates myst ically co mmuned with thedivinit y by symbo lically eat ing the body of the god. The Chr istianpriest Dean Inge writes: 'There have always been two ideas ofsacrifice, alike in savage and civilised cults ... the myst ical, in whichit is a communio n, the vict im w ho is slain and eaten being himselfthe god, or a symbo l of the god; and the co mmercial, in whichso met hing valuable is offered to the god in the hope of receivingso me benefit in exchange. The Mysteries certainly encouraged theidea of co mmunio n, and made it easier for the Christ ian r ite togather up into itself all the religious elements which can becontained in a sacrament of this kind.'

Inan early Christ ian writ ing Ignat ius of Ant ioch describes theEucharist as the pharmakon tes Zoes, 'the medicine of immortal life', see Hoffmann, R. J. (1987), 16. 221 Otto, W. F.

The goat shall bear upon him all their iniquit ies into a land not inhabited.' The myt h of the scapegoat was a Mediterranean -wide motif, however. Greek tragedy de veloped fro m t he Dionysus rituals carried out in archaic t imes, the tragodoi being the singers who led the goat to sacrifice, see Burkert, W. (1985), 102. An intriguing development of this motif took place in t he Hellenist ic period when Socrates' birthday was cl aimed as the day 'when the Athenians purify the cit y', see Harrison, J. (1922), 97. Lysias also tells us that the Thirt y T yrants desi gnated their poli tical murders of Socrates and others as a purificat ion -a purge in both the medicinal and the omino us polit ical sense of the word, see Burkert, W. (1985), 83. These fragments suggest that in the centuries after his death, Socrates' disciples were attempting to link his fate with that ofthe pharmakos, a scapegoat who willingly took on his sacrificial ro le in order to purge the sins ofthe ci ty. The very same motifs appear in the life of Jesus. 223 Harrison, J. (1922), 99 224 Burkert, W. (1985), 105 225 Mark 15 v 17 -20 226 Hebrews 9 v 22.

LateHellenist ic allegori sts are th e fir st to say this openly. For the earlyperiod under the sway o f Homer a god is by definit io n immortal andcannot be killed.

See Burkert, W. (1972), 203. Prior toDiogenes and contemporary with Ant isthenes was Diodorus ofAspendus. Satirized by Stratonicus as wearing a 'crazy garment ofskin', he 'gathered fo llo wers and wore long hair, long beard, fo ldedtribon, wallet and staf f.As Burkert notes, threads lead fro m here tothe Stoa as well; both Zeno and Chrisyppus were interested inaspects of Py thagoreanism.

See Polybius, The Rise of the Ro ma n Empire, 349.Timaeus of Locri likewise regarded such tales as 'salutary fict ions',Cumo nt, F. (1922), 78. Other ph ilo sophers, however, vio lent lyattacked these myt hs, which they regarded as 'life -poi soning beliefs'and a perversio n of the true doctri ne. See Cumont, 176. In TheNature of the Universe, 126, Lucretius, the Epicurean philosopher ofthe first century BCE, writ es, 'As for all those torments that are saidto take place in t he depths o f Hell, they are actually present here andnow, in our own lives.'

The judgement of the dead in an afterlife courtgoes back to ancient Egy pt, but thei r divisio n int o th ose on the rightand the left can be seen evo lving as these beliefs steadily penetratedthe West. In The Republic, Book 10, 61413 -d, Plato discourses on theOrphic teachings of the fate of the soul after death.

His theory explained why the constellat ion lying behind the sun at the spring equino x changes over time and the sun appears to move slo wly backwards through the signs of the zodiac over a period of 25,000 years. Hipparchus' calculatio n of this 'Great Year' was accurate to within six seconds of a degree per year , an incredible achievement. See Walbank, F. W. (1981), 187. The sun spends roughly 2,000 years in each sign and the ancients called this a 'Great Month'. During the lifet ime of Hipparchus the month changed fro m Ar ies to Pisces, -in c.2040 CE it will chang e into Aquarius.

This can be just ifiably be int erpreted in manyways: as the 'reason for things' and as 'the ordering principle' andalso as 'the facult y by which the mind understands'. St John's gospelcould be translated: 'In the beginning was the Reason.' St John writesthat the Logos 'was life and the life was the light of men', Sextus thePy thagorean likew ise states, 'The reason that is in you is the light ofyour life,' see Guthrie, K. S.

This relat ionshi p is one of connectivit y, because the two are One. It is, therefore, as Jesus teaches, essent ially a relat ionship oflove.

Runia, D. T. (1993), 133, questi ons Eusebius' account of the history of the school: 'Eusebius' words definitely imply that the school existed before Pantaenus took charge. Why then does he only mention it here forthe first time? Is it because he lacks informat ion, or i s he -fro m hisown apologetic viewpo int on behalf o f o rthodox tradition -engagedin a cover -up?' Runia proposes that: 'Pantaenus took over the school from earlier members who had a more Gnostic orien tati on. Eusebius would then have a reason for denying real cont inuit y.' Marlowe, J. (1971), 251, records that Pantaenus' teacher was a Pythagorean. Putting all this information together would yield the fo llo wing scenario. Arising from Jewish/Pythagorean gr oups like the Therapeutae and basing themselves on the work of Philo, a school of Jewish Gnosticism develops in Alexandria. During the first century its teaching spreads widely in Egypt, Palestine and Syria. Roberts (1979) considers it likely that: 'If Val ent inus and Basilides taught in Alexandria, the obvious place for their teaching woul d have been this school.' See also Runia, 133, note 4.

In 180 CE we hear of Christ ians fro m AsiaMinor living in Ro me . They studied Euclid, Aristotle and 'almostworshipped Galen'. Ironically, Galen mocked the Chr istians'reliance on blind fait h, but these Christ ians seem to have been aliving reply to his cri ticisms. In due course they were exco mmu nicated by the Bishop of Rom e. See Eusebius (1965), 177,where Eusebius expresses the orthodox view of these heretics who'with godless rascalit y corrupt the simple Fait h of Holy WTrit'. 16Robinson, J. M. (1978), 18. The Nag Hammadi codex has an ankh, the Egy ptian hieroglyph meanin g life, tooled on the cover.

See also Wallis, op. cit., which notes that Plotinus does not ment ion his opponents by name, or refer to them as Gnostics, but their ident it y as 'Christians and other sectaries' is confirmed by Porphyry. Plotinus charges his opponents with'abandoning the ancient philo sophy' in favour of revelations by Zostri anos, Allogenes and others. (Works attributed to these authors have now been found at Nag Hammadi.) He regards them as friends who had been so badly contaminated by the new teachings that they coul d not get over it, even after they had been taught the truedoctrine by him. Plotinus wrote against them in order to enlighten his fellow pupils that a) whatever is worthy in the apostates' teaching had been taken fro m P lato, and b) what had b een added to itis far from being true. His work was taken up by his follo wer Porphy ryand enlarged into 15 volumes, Against the Christ ians. Afew fragments survive but the rest was consigned to the flames in the fourth century. 25Robinson,}. M. (1978), 171 . On the Origin of the World is a good example of Gnostic syncretism between Greek myt hs andphilo sophy and Christ ian ideas. A Gnostic text called The Book of the Great Logos has Jesus co mmanding his disciples to go to Galilee and find a man or wom an in who m t he greater part of evil is dead, and take two j ars of wine from them to the place"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"where he is, and also two vine branches. When they have done so, Jesus creates aplace o f offering, placing one wine jar on the right and one on the left, and strews certai n berries and spices round the vessels. He then mak es the disciples clothe themselves in white linen robes. This image is almost ident ical to representations of the Greek Mysteriesof Dio nysus found on ancient vases (see plate 5). 26Mead, G.R.S. (1906), 51 0-11 27Barnstone,W. (1984), 639 28Ibi d., 640.

The Egypt ian t rinit y of Osiris, Isis and Horus is probably the ult imate origin o f bo th Gnostic and Christ ian concept ions of the divine trinit y.The Gnostic myt h dramat izes the fall o f Sophi a fr om heaven and her lost wanderings in the world, where she is ignored or abused by men, see Mead, G. R. S. (1906), 333. This is the same doctrine that is found in Paganism. Only the attainment of Wisdo m co uld lead the fallen soul back to its heavenly origin . Py thagoras, for example, was the first man to call himself a philosopher -literally a 'lo ver of Sophia'. 35Robinson, J. M. (1978), 143.

Kirk and Raven, (1957), 372. This was echoed by Em pedocles: 'He is a holy, unspeakable mind, darting wit h swift thoughts over the who le world,' quoted ibid, 350, and Xenophanes,'One God, greatest among gods and men, in no way similar to mo rtals either in body or in thought.

Aristophanes parodies the same ritualin The Clouds and Plato refers to it in Euthydemus, 277d. Kerenyi,C. (1967), 9, discusses the lamps discovered at Eleusis. These were worn by the dancers led by Dio nysus and mimicked the dance of the'starry aether'. The Mysteries dramat ized the descent and reascent of the soul during incarnation, the lights symbo lizing the planets andstars, wh ich were imagined as a cel estial ladder connect ing Earth and heaven. Dio of Prusa gives us the clearest exposit ion of thi s ri tual and its significance: 'If one would bring a man, Greek or barbarian,for init iat ion int o a myst ic recess, overwhelming by its be aut y and size, so that he would beho ld ma ny myst ic views and hear manysounds of the kind, with darkness and light appearing in suddenchanges and other innumerable things happening, and even, as theydo in the so -called enthronement ceremony - theyhave the i nit iands sit down, and they dance around them -if a ll this were happening,would itbe possible that such a man should experience just nothingin his soul, that he should not come to surmise that there is some wiser insight and plan in all that is go ing on, even if he came fro m the utmost barbarit y?' Kerenyi co mments: 'The int ended reference isto the cosmos, the dance of stars and sun around the earth and othermarvels o f nat ure that surpass the artful contrivances of mystery cerem onies; the com parison of the cosm os wi tha huge mystery hallgoes back to the Stoi c philosopher Cleanthes, who lived in Athensand in all probabilit y w as thinking of Eleusis.'

The Gnost ic does not need to followethical codes to be loving because, as Clement explains, 'He who isfree th rough Gnosis is really a slave because of lo ve for those whohave not yet been able to attain to the freedom of Gnosis.' TheGnost ic, then, is not a depraved hedonist, as the Literalists wouldhave us believe, but someone who chooses to naturally express love for its own sake, rather than fo llo wing an imposed moral code fro mfe ar of evil or hope of reward. Clement explains further: 'The man ofunderstanding and perspicacit y is the Gnostic. And his business isnot abst inence from what is evil (for this is a step to the highestperfect ion), or the doing of good out of fear. Nor any more is he to doso for hope of promised recompense. But only the do ing of good outof love, and for the sake of its own excellence, is to be the Gnostic'schoice.' 152 Quoted in Kingsland, W.

Origen reveals the Mithraicdoctrine about the planets and the stars 'and the soul's passagethrough these. The symbo l is t his. There is a ladder with seven gatesand at its top an eighth gate.'

(1977), 208. 57Angus, S. (1925), 96. Initiation was considered as a death fro m whichbelievers arose through rebirth. In Greek the words for death andinit iat ion are very similar and were a familiar pun. 'To die is to beinit iated,' says Plato. The resurr ection promised by the earlyChrist ians is the same as that offered by Osiris -Dionysus and othermy thical godm en of the Mysteries. In John 3 v 1 -21 Jesus' discipleNicodemus is confused because he takes Jesus' teaching of rebirthliterally. He asks, 'How can a ma n be born when he is old? Can heenter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?' TheEgypt ian sage Hermes Trismegistus likewise preached spiritualrebirth and, like Nicodem us, his student Tat interprets this literallyand confesses to his master, ' I know not, Trismegistus, from whatwomb a man can be born again, nor fro m what seed,' see TheHermetica, Book 13. Jesus and Hermes both explain that this rebirthis not to be understood literally, but myst ically. 58 Quoted in Robinson, op. cit., 52ff. The Tr eati se on the Resurrectionexplains that ordinary human existence is spiritual death but theresurrection is spiritual enlightenment, see Pagels, E. (1979), 42. Again this teaching is derived fro m P aganism. Socrates, in Gorgias, 493a, says, 'I shoul d not be surpri sed, you know, if Euripides was right when he said, \"Who knows, if life be death, and death be life?\" [quoting Po lyidus fr. 7] And perhaps we are actually dead, for I once heard one of our wise men say that we are now dead, and that our body is a tom b.' Heraclitus a century earlier had stated that: 'When we live our souls are dead, but when we die our souls revive and live.' The purpose of init iat ion was to awaken the soul fro m t his death -like state. This is the true doctrine which lies behind Empedoc les' claim to be able to resurrect a man fro m t he dead. With the triumph of Literalist Christianit y t his doctri ne became completely misunderstood as the bringing back to life o f people who had actually died. 59Quoted in Robinson, op. cit., 55 60John 10 v 17 61Pagel s, E.

But t he Titans gave him a mirror to distract his attenti on, andwhile the child gazed in the mirror and was fascinated by his ownimage, the Titans tore the child into pieces and devoured him. Onlyt he heart of the god was saved. This means that Dionysus, when hes aw his eido lon, his reflect ion in the mirror, in a sense wasduplicated and vanished into the mirror and so was dispersed in the universe. According to the Orphic sages, thi s means the world soul is divided and dispersed through matter. But the world spirit rem ains undivided and pure fro m ever y contact with matter.' See Segal, R. A. (1992), 254. When Zeus discovered the crime he blasted the 12 Titans and from their ashes created mankind. This Orphic my thexplains how the divine spark manifests first in 12 ar chet ypal men, the signs of the zodiac, and later in the mult itude of humanit y who are born under the influence o f o ne or other of these signs.

Clement repeatsin a slight ly altered fashio n t his same system. He regards thoseChrist ians who have yet to reach Gnosis as being of three different types, defined by their relat ionship to God as the slave, the fait hful slave and the friend, see Cleme ntofAlexandria, Stromata, 3. The Naassene Gnostics regard 'the capt ives' as caught up in the illusio n of the world. Clement calls Hylics God's 'slaves' because they unwillingly obey the will o f God. Such people are the 'hard of heart' whom the Teacher tr ains through 'corrective disci pline'. The Gnostics regarded 'the called' as those who were called to follow the path and had begun to spiritually awaken. Clement calls Psychics the 'faithful slaves' of God, because they willingly follo w his will. Such Chri stians are 'believers' in need of signs and miracles to strengthen their faith, whom the Teacher trains through 'good hope'. The Gnostics regarded 'the chosen' as those on the higher myst ical path that leads beyo nd belief to Gnosis. Clement calls them 'thefriends' because they are int imate with God. Such Christ ians are aspirant Gnostics who m t he teacher trains through 'Mysteries'. Origen develops Clement's work and relates these three psy cho logical ty pes to thei r abilit y t o penetrate through to the correct int erpretation of the gospel s, see Fidler, D. (1993), 120, quoting Origen, Philocalia 1.8. 111 A Hylic person is unconscious o f the Daemon. The Psychic init iateis aware of the Daemon as a Guardian Angel. The Pneumat ic init iatei s aware of the Daemon as the irown Hi gher Self. The init iate whohas achieved Gnosis is aware of themselves as an expressio n o f theUniversal Daem on. 112 Li ke Gnosti c, Buddha also means 'Knower', from the Sanskrit budh,'to know'. 113 The Gospel of Philip gives an exegesis of the teachi ngs alluded to bySt Paul in 1 Corinthians 13 v 13 on the spiritual qualit ies that can bedevelo ped in these four states of being symbo lized by the fourelements. 'The husbandry of God is ... through four: fait h, hope, loveand gnosis. Our"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"earth is fait h, in w hich we take root. The water ishope, through which we are nourished. The wind is love, throughwhich we grow. But the light is Gnosis, through which we ripen tomaturit y.' See Pagels, E. (1975), 80. 114 In the Pagan system the init iate was led through these states ofawareness by three init iations. In the Pagan Mysteries they werecalled catharmos, 'purificat ion', paradosis, the transmissio n of theesoteric doctrine, and epopteia, seeing through to the Truth.Kingsley, P. (1995), 367, calls this 'the basic physio gnomy ofthemysteri es and stages of init iat ion in t he ancient Greek worl d'.Servius confirms that in the init iat ions, 'Every purification iseffected either by water or by fire or by air,' see Ei sler, R. (1920), 208.The Gnostic system also taught that for th e highest Mysteri es athreefo ld bapt ism was required, of water, fire and spirit, see Angus, S.(1925), 83. This doctrine is also found in the New Testament.Matthew 3 v 11 -12 tells us that John the Baptist brought baptismwith water, while Jesus brought the hi gher init iat ions of bapt ism bybreath (air) and fire. 115 Mead, G.

Obviously it was a rare occurrence andworthy ofme ntion. In Alexandria the Jews had ent irely abandonedtheir own language and adopted Greek by the middle of the thirdcentury BCE.

These scho lar lyendeavours required greatcourage, for they were confronting a deeply entrenched belief in theaccuracy, indeed the divinit y, of the gospels.

Only Matthew was above suspicio n. Our Matthew,however, is not the one that was known to Papias of Hierapo lis, who is said to have been act ive post 70 CE in Asia Minor. He collectedinformat ion about the Messiah fro m r efugees pouring out of Judea,but refers to hi s Matthew as a book of 'oracles'.

The 'scantiness o f Paul's Jesus tradition' is regarded byseveral New Testament prof essors as 'surprisin g', 'shocking' and a'matter of serious concern'. Stanton, G.

Clement, Stromata 7.17, records the Gnosticclaim that Theudas had received secret teachings from Paul -the'Deeper Mysteries' that Paul reserved from his public teac hing andtaught only to a few disciples in secret, see Pagels, E.

Modern research has been carried out onthe earliest collect ions o f Paul's letters, which all contain prologues.Seven of t hese are so similar as to suggest a commo n ori gin, and asthey ho ld Paul to be the 'true apostle' and are strongly ant i-Jewish,they are now considered to be the work of Marcionites. These sevenpro logues are attached to the same Pauline letters that are also nowaccepted as genuine and the churches to which these are addressedare known to have been Marcio nit e strongholds in the middle of thesecond century. All o f this suggests that Marcion, as he claimed, wasindeed the true heir of Paul. By the time Paul's let ters had swelled to 13, other prol ogues needed writ ing. These 'clumsy works' have beendated to the fourth and fift h centuri es. 6Hollro yd,S. (1994), 39 7Robinson, J. M. (1978), 256. The Apocalypse of Paul gives theapostle's visio ns in 10 heavens - a lo wer seven and a supernal three -not just the third that he describes in Corinthians. Another text, TheHypostasis of the Archons, calls Paul 'the Great Apostle' andexplains his teaching in Col ossians 1 v 13 on the 'authorit ies ofdarkness', see Robinson, 163. T hese, the text explains, are thepl anets and stars that control fate and dest iny -just as they are forPaul. 8Barnstone, W. (1984), 652. The Literalist fourth -century heresy -hunter Epiphanius complains: 'They fabricate another little book inthe name of Pau l the Apostle, full of things unspeakable, which theso -called Gnostics use, which they call the Ascent of Paul; thepretext (for so calling it) theyfind in the fact that the Apostle says heascended into the third heaven and heard ineffable words, which it isnot permissible for a man to speak. And these, they say, are theineffable words.' 9Ibi d., 445 10Liidemann, G. (1995), 198 -9, calls these fakes 'foo lhardy', as theyo nly succeeded in putting 'a spotlight on the struggles' between theGnostics and the orth odox Church to claim the powerful figure ofPaul. The author of 2 Thessalo nians, in a pathetic attempt to suggestauthent icit y,wri tes, 'Greet ings to you in my own handwrit ing,which is a mark of all my letters: this is what my wri ting looks like.'This is one ofthe numerous addenda to Paul's letters made byscribes, usually to issue threats against dissenters. See 1 Corinthians 16v 21 -4, where the writer reassures the reader This greet ing is inmy own hand -Paul'. The mo st ri dicul ous of these is in Galat ians 6v 11 -18, where a scribe launches out into a polemic against the Jewsbut introduces it with Paul's supposed words: 'Look how big theletters are, now that I am writ ing to you in my own hand.' 11Liidemann, op. cit., 61. Regarding the Pauline letters, Liidem annwri tes, 'Schol ars generally agree that of the thirteen extant letters,seven are authent ic (Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Gal atians, Philippians, 1 Thessalo nians and Philemon), whereas the rest have been co mposed by"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"later disciples in the apostle's name.' See Wells, G. A. (1975), 17, which refers to Schmit hal's evidence that all the principal Pauline letters, apart fro m Galatians, are likewise co mposite. In the early Church, opponents of Paul were not averse to tampering wit h his letters. Both Irenaeus and Tertullian, for example, quote from Galat ians but omit the word 'not' in a key passage, thus turning Paul's meaning fro m t he negat ive into the posit ive, see Pagels, E. (1975), 104. 12Wilso n, I. (1984), 154. Computer tests have confirmed thesuspicio ns lo ng held by theo logical scho lars that whoever wrotePaul's letters to Timothy and Titus it wasn't Paul, see Liidemannop. cit, 288. 13Pagel s, E. (1975), 5. Valent inian Gnostics cite only Ro ma ns, 1 and 2Corinthians, Galat ians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossian s, 1Thessalo nians and Hebrews. This list corresponds exact ly to theearliest known Pauline collection attested from Alexandria. 14Liidemann, op. cit., 135 15Metzger, B. M. (1987), 202, says of Eusebius' attempt to delineate anaccepted canon: 'The mo st tha t Eusebius can register is uncertaint yso great that he seems to get confused when making a statementabout it.' None the less he admits that the authent icit y o f theepist les of James and Jude is doubted, see Eusebius, (1965), 61, also 2Peter and 2 and 3 John . Revelat ion he regards as spuri ous. Afterpi cking our way through his well -guarded statements we end upwith a canon of the four gospels, Paul's epistles minus the Pastorals,and 1 Peter and 1 John. 16Pagel s notes that Irenaeus strikingly opens his treatise AgainstHeresies, claiming 'the apostle's authori tyto oppose the Gnostics -by cit ing both Timothy and Titus', see Pagels, op. cit., 5. She alsorecords Tertullian's defensiveness on the issue and regards it asinstructive. He notes that the heret ics have da red to impugn thevalidit y o f the Pastorals, but insists that the 'same Paul' who wroteGal atians also wrote Titus. 17Pagel s, op. cit., 163. The Pastorals received their name because oftheir major concern with how the Church is to be organized. AsPagels not es, the authent ic let ters like 'Ephesians, Col ossians andHebrews, on the other hand virtually ignore Paul's role as anorganiser of ecclesiastical congregat ions'. 18lTimothy4v7 191 Timothy 1 v 3 -4 201 Timothy 6 v 20 211 Timothy 5 v 20 222 Timothy 2 v 1 7-18.

(1975), 8 -10 26Liidemann notes other examples of second -century hostilit y to Paulin addit io n to Clement's vigorous polemic. Acts contains veiledcrit icism o f Paul. By the criteria of Acts 1 v 2If Paul does not qualifyas an apostle as he was not with Jesus during his lifet ime and had not seen the risen Jesus, see Liidemann, G. (1995), 54, 57, 199. Pagels suggests that ecclesiast ical Christ ians might have preferred to exclude Paul's letters 'but it was too late, he was already a chief apost le and stood in high regard', see Pagels, op. cit., 161. Towards the end of the second century the Literalists therefore took another tack.

Paul's mother tongue was Greek and he usesonly the Septuagint versio n of the Old Testament. See Brandon, S. G.F.

Liidemann observes that whereas the gospels are 'thirdperson accounts', 'o ften contradictory' and 'do not come fro m e yewit nesses', in Paul 'we hear his own vo ice in his mother tongue, freefrom all background no ise, accessible t o all who do not shrink fro mt he trouble of reading him'. See Liidemann, op. cit., 61. 33Wells, G. A. (1975), 183 34Ulansey, D. (1989), 68ff. Strabo writes: 'The people of Tarsus havedevoted themselves so eagerly, not only to philosophy, but also tothe wh ole round of education in general, that they have surpassedAthens, Alexandria, or any other place that can be named wherehave been schools and lectures of philosophers.' Athenodorus ofTarsus even became a tutor to Emperor Augustus. Athenodorus wasin turn a disciple of Posidonius, arguably the greatest philosopher ofthe first century BCE. Pompey twice turned aside from campaigns inAsia Minor to visit Posidonius and Cicero describes him as a friend.He is one of the first astronomers to make an orrery, which Cicerosay s 'shows in its revo lut ions the movements of the sun and starsand planets, by day and night, j ust as they appear in the sky', seeCicero, The Nature of the Gods, 159. In his travels to Bri tain hemade the discovery that the m oon governs the tides. Th is he musthave considered certain proof of astrology's first axio m,that theheavenly bodies have a direct effect on the physical wTorld. All of theastronomical and astrological knowledge acquired by the Tarsi anintellectual s, parti cularly the discovery ofthe precessio n of theequinoxes by Hipparchus, who worked at nearby Rhodes, made amajor contribut ion to the doctrines o f M ithraism. It was int o thi sci tythat Paul was born, at a time when Tarsus was at the height ofits power and influence. 35 Ulansey, op. ci t., 68. Tarsus was the capital of Cilicia, where,according to Plutarch, the Mi thraic Mysteri es were being practised as early as 67 BCE. Ulansey considers it significant that the appearance of Mit hraism co incides almost exactly with the lifet ime of Posidoni us and is in the same part of the Mediterranean. Hipparchus' discovery o f the precessio n of the equinoxes had revealed that in the cycle known as the 'Great Year' the sun was passing fro m Ar ies into Pisces at the spring equinox. Mithraic iconography portra ys Mithras as the god who turns the wheel of the Great Year and thereby ushers in the New Age. Paul shows himself aware of 'the passing age' in 2 Corinthians 4 v 4. 36Happol d, F. C. (1963), 186; see also St Paul and the Mystery Religio nsby H. Kennedy.

The Alexandrian cult of Serapis and hisconsort Isis was widespread in t he Graeco -Rom an worl d at this time.That Paul might have been a 'Steward of the Myst eries' ofSerapi s isent irely possible. Em peror Hadri an writes o f the citizens ofAlexandria, 'Here you see Chr istians worshipping Serapis, andworshippers o f Serapis who call themselves bishops of Chr ist,' seeD'Alviella, G.

At Cenchreae, near Corinth, wait ing to board a ship bound for Ephesus, Paul 'cut his hair for he had made a vow'. This is a curious report and not in accordance with Jewish Law, which states that hair is only to be shorn at Jerusalem. Near Cenchreae, however, was a temple of Isis where Greek sailors cut their hair and dedicated it to the goddess as 'Stella Maris' in hope of a safe crossing. 41Acts 17 v 28 42In 1 Corinthians 15 v 37 Pa uluses the most ubiquitous of imagesfro m t he Mysteries, the reaping and sowing of the crops as a symbo lo f mystical death and resurrection of an init iate. He speaks of thesprouting of a grain of wheat as an image of the resurrection andwrites: 'The seed you sow does not come to life unless it has firstdied.' 43Plato, Apol ogy , 23b: 'He is the wisest who, like Socrates, knows thathis wisdo m is worth nothing.' 441 Corinthians 8 v 2 45Plato, Phaedrus, 250b: 'For there is no light of the higher ideas whichare preci ous to souls in the earthly copies of them, they are seenthrough a glass dimly.' 461 Corinthians 13 v 12 47The Phillips translat ion, quoted in Happo ld, F.

At this stage theywere known asmystae -those with 'closed eyes'. Only at the highest stage ofinit iation was the veil rem oved and the mystae became epoptae -those who had 'seen'.

When the Jews prepared the Greekversion o f the Old Testament theytranslated the unpronounceablename YHVH into Yahaveh (Jehovah) by adding to it the vowels fromAdoni. At first this vowel name was probably a secret, but by thefirst century BCE it was obv iously widely known. Diodorus of Sicilyin 50 BCE writes: 'Amo ng the Jews Moyses [sic] referred his laws tothe god who is invoked as Iao,' see Book 1.94. The archaic Mysteryname ofDionysus in Greece and Italy was 'Iacho', from which derive'Iakkos' in Greec e and 'Bacchus' in Italy. Iacho, Dunlap suggests, waspronounced wit h a silent 'ch' as in 'loch'.

The Septuagint provides the best evidence ofthis. By translat ing the obscure name of God in the Old Testament(Exodus 3 v 14), as 'I am that I am', the translators of the Septuagint,in the words of Bickerman, Tlatonized the Lord himself.

Also legendary is that 72 separate Jewish scribes turnedout 72 versions that were unanimous in their fait hful translat ion ofthe sacred texts. In fact the translation was made in parts over twocenturies: the Pentateuch over t he course of the third century, Isaiahand Jeremiah during the first half o f the second century and Psalmsand the rest of the prophets during the second half, see Marlowe, 83.The Greek translation which we have inherited as the Christ ian OldTestament update d and reinterpreted Jewish scripture in line wit hGreek culture.

To prove his position in the line o fapostolic successio n Irenaeus was forced to fabricate a rather unusualinterpretation of the length of Jesus' ministry. He shrinks thenumber of generations necessary to link Jesus' time to hi s own byextending the age of Christ as well as that of the apostles. To do thishe co mbines the Synoptic tradition that Jesus was 30 when bapt ized with John's reference to mult iple visits to Jerusalem and his claim that Jesus was not yet 50 (John 8 v 56-7). He concludes that Jesus must have preached unt il he had passed his fortieth birthday. As Perkins notes, 'Irenaeus then appeals to the testimo ny o f apostolic tradit ion to confirm this extraordinary claim.' See Perkins, P. (1993), 180. Irenaeus thus p roves that elders in t he Asia Minor churches of the early second century were still able to learn the truth direct ly fro m apostles (i.e. Polycarp, who learnt direct ly fr om the apostle John). The Gnost ic t eacher Ptol emy , Irenaeus quips, has not even seen an apostl e in his dreams! (Adv. Haer. 2.22.6.) The liberties that Irenaeus then took with the length of John's life eventually gave birth to the bizarre legend that he in fact never died, but still lived on in Patmos or Ephesus, see Campbell, J.

The Valent inian text The Interpretation of the Gnosis admits that the Church which was ori ginally one was now split into fact ions and attempts to reconcile both Gnostic and Literalist Christ ians wi theach other. 67Plato's statem ent that 'Many carry the wand, but few beco me Baccho i' became proverbial in the Hellenist ic period and was oftenshortened to 'Many are called but few are chosen.'

He is also one of the firs tChrist ians we know of who was executed for his beliefs, seeStevenson, J. (1957), 30. Irenaeus is clearly aware that Gnostics havedied for the faith, see Pagels, E.

The Manichaean treatise probably gives us agood idea of the contents ofMarci on' s Antitheses. It points out thatthe two testaments are mutually contradictory and that by retainingthe Ol d Testament, the Catholics had ignored the warning of Christand put 'a new piece o f c lothonto an ol d garm ent'. In doing so theyhad returned the Church to the bondage of circumcisio n. The lives ofthe Old Testament patriarchs vio lated the moral precepts of the NewTestam ent.

Under a successio n of adoptive Emperors fromHadrian in 117 CE there began a sustained period of peace, prosperit yand relat ively benign government. All o f these Emperors were moreor less obsessed with Greek culture and philosophy. The 'philosophicway o f life' became identified as the superior life. The secondcentury was hailed in retrospect (by Philo stratus in 225 CE ) as 'theSecond Sophist ic', in honour of the first which took place inClassical Athens seven centuries earlier. During this period allmanner of cults and philosophies spread widely. Gibbon, along withoth er historians, begins his narration of The Decline an d Fall wit hthe death of the philosopher/Emperor Marcus Aurelius in 180 CE. 158 Hoffmann, R. J.

St August ine likewise stated, 'I wo uld not believe the Gospel if t he authorit y o f the Catho lic church did not com pel me .’Fidler, 320. 282 Ci cero (1972), 159 283 Metzger, B. M. (1987), 233. This was the view of Philaster, the Bishop ofBrescia ( died c.397 CE). Philaster also composed a treatise to attack 28Jewish heresies and no less than 128 Christian heresies, see Potter, D. (1994), 105. W. Hyde, Paganism to Christianit y in t he Ro ma n E mp ire, 1946, presents a depressing picture of the anti - int ellectual nature of the early Church, the destructio n of books and tem ples, the closing of school s and the killing of adherents of otherfaiths. 284 The classical scho lar Frank has reconstructed the main stages of Greek astronomy, in an apparent ly necessary order: devel opm ent of the understanding of space, of solid geo met ryand perspective byAnaxagoras and Democritus, discovery of the sphericit y of the Earthand the 'mo vements of the planets in the form of geo met rically perf ect orbi ts' by the Py thagoreans o f Archy tas' circle, first mat hemat ical explanat ion of the movement of the planets by Eudoxus, discovery ofthe rotati on of the Earth on its axis, and finally the 'Copernican view of the world' in the sy stem ofPhilo laus. See Burkert, W. (1972), 302. The earli est m ent ion of a spherical Earth inextant literature is in Plato's Phaedo, 110b, see Guthrie, W. K. C.(1962), 295, but Bion of Abdera, the fo llo wer of Democritus, was acquainted in 400 BCE with the mathemat ical consequences of the spheri cal shape of the Ea rth, and in 430 Hippocrates of Chios had proj ected the cel est ial circles onto the Earth, obviously presupposing its sphericit y,see Burkert, 305. All o f these advances took place inthe Classical period. The Hellenist ic period saw equally mo mentous discover ies. Eratosthenes calculated the obliquit y of the eclipt ic and the diameter of the Earth withan error of less that 1 per cent, see Marlowe, J. (1971), 71. Hipparchus, his successor at the Alexandrianlibrary , determined the precessio n of the equino xes, the size of the sun and the plane ofits apogee, the mean motion o f the moon, it snadir, its apogee and the inclinat ion o f it s orbit and also calculatedlunar eclipses, see Marlowe, 75. Then suddenly wit h t he triumph of Chr istianit y St Augustine declared, on t he basis of his own limited knowl edge of Manichaean astrol ogy , that the Earth was flat. As unchallengeable Christ ian dogma this belief persisted throughout the Dark Ages. As Draper observes, 'No -one did more than this Father to bring science and religio n i nto antagonism,' see CranstonS. (1977), 149. CHAPTER 12: THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD 1Quoted in Inge, W. R.
