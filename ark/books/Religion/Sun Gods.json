Sun Gods as Atoning Saviours © Dr M D Magee Contents Updated: Monday, May 07, 2001 • Atoning Saviours • The Twin Sun Gods • Origin of the Crucifixion of the Gods • The Cross • Krishna • Suffering Saviours • Prometheus • More Saviours Punished in Hell • Alcestis • Ixion • Quirinus (Romulus) of Rome • Jesus as a Sun God • Sixteen Crucified Saviours Abstract The doctrine of salvation by cr ucifixion had an astronomical origin. The sun is hung on a cross or crucified when it passes through the equinoxes. The sun god exists as twins, a bright twin and a dark twin, summer and winter, bright and dark. Pe ople in northern climates were saved by the sun’s crucifixion when it crosse d over the equatorial line into th e season of spring, at the vernal equinox at Easter. The sun that is crucified is the dark winter sun, lacking the warmth and brightness of the summer. It is resurrected as , or supplanted by, its twin, the bright warm fertilizing summer sun that continues on to ascend in to heaven. In the hot cl imates of the ancient near east, the summer sun is cool winter s un that had brought the rains, and his death was bewailed by people forlorn until he came again in the autumn. In Ezekiel, women outside the temple gates bewailed the death of Tammuz. Christianity confused the two traiditions. Atoning Saviours I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"writes Paul in 1 Corinthians 2:2. The determination not to know anything but the crucifixion of Jesus Christ was narrowing down knowledge to ra ther a small compass. Evidently converts in Corinth were questioning, and Pa ul begins by establishing that questions are not allowed to Christians. Paul has to berate the wise and praise the foolish in this epistle. God chose the foolish things of the world not the wise. And so it has always remained—the most marvellous way of gulling the credulous. Anyway, already in the 50s of the first century some people were asking questions and one of the questions will have been whether Jesus was really crucified. Irenaeus, one of the most frequently quoted Chri stian writers of the anci ent bishops, declares upon the authority of the martyr Polycarp, who clai med to have got it from S John and all the elders of Asia, that Jesu s Christ lived to be about fifty year s old. There must have been a margin for distrusting the fact of the cruc ifixion. Yet, if Jesus was a saviour, it is likely that he must have been crucified because other saviours of the sa me type were. “Sacrilege!” Paul’s Christians, trained in foolishness, cry. “Jesus Christ was the only crucified saviour !” Sorry, other saviours are suspected of crucifixion, and certainly many were cruelly punished for saving humanity. Irenaeus might have felt it politic to deny crucifixion to distingui sh the Christian saviour from the others! The Persian equinoctial ceremonies dedicated to Mithras seem to have involved crucifixion, when Haman the Wicked, standing for the winter sun, is crucified in Esther to arise as the summer sun who is the Saviour, Mithras. The sl ain Divine Intercessor of the Caucasians, Prometheus, suffered hung on a tree or a rock for the sins of mortal beings. Attis, Ixion, Tantalus were all hung on trees or wheels in crucifixion. Yet the Christian di sciple hugs to his breast the bloody cross of the murdered Jesus, confident that he wa s the one god that ever died for the sins of man. The Twin Sun Gods There are two suns, summer and winter, bright and dark or stormy, and thes e are seen daily when the sun crosses the heavens bright, then sinks to the west darkening and remains dark through the night until dawn. The sun god theref ore exists as twins—a bright twin and a dark twin. The god of the full year—the complete annual movement of the sun though the zodiac—is divided into its two half yearly parts—the good god, and his twi n, the evil god. In solar mythology, the sun god has two twin sons. These gods represent the summer and the winter but which is which depends on where you are. In the northern climates, the good god is the bri ght and light summer su n, while the wicked god is the dark and cold winter s un. In the ancient n ear east, the good god was the stormy sun of winter which brought the rains, while the wick ed god was the fiercely burning hot sun of summer that scorched the earth and parched the vegetation. Either way, their lives are intertwined in the annual cycle, and give us the dualistic ideas that preceded the regression to monotheism. The crucified one, in the ancient near east, paradoxically, is the dark twin which is why saviour gods often have a dark or black complexion. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The summer “bright” sun god is born at the winter solstice, and the increasing hours of lightness in the day show him growing in strength unt il he reaches his greatest power, the summer solstice—the longest day. The winter “dark” su n god, is born at the summer solstice, and the increasing hours of darkness show him growing in strength until he reac hes his greatest power, the winter solstice—the longest night. As one tw in grows in power, the other declines in power in an endless battle between light and darkne ss and good and evil. John the Baptist gives us pause for thought when he says of Jesus: He must increase, but I must decrease. Jn 3:30 A relic of the original belief in the dual solar nature of the Christian myth, it must have been said at the birth of the summer sun at the winter solstice, for, in this myth, John is the winter sun, as his association with water makes clear. He is Oa nnes, the Babylonian equivalent (Ea), born at the summer solstice and dying at the spring equinox. 24 June, the end of the summer solstice, was supposedly the birth date of John the Baptist in the Christian calendar, who was born six months before Jesus, according to gospel tradition. In f act, “Jesus” is not a separate god but a title of John—Saviour. The gentile Churches deliberately confused the tradit ion to distinguish Christians from the followers of John the Baptist. Both were Nazarenes and both had the same sun god, but the Christians had to distinguish their god from the Bap tist’s. So they made John the Baptist the herald of Jesus. In the gospel stories, Jesus actually has a twin ca lled Thomas but that is not his name. It simply means twin, as does his New Testament surname, Didymus. He takes no part in the drama except to doubt the resurrection for which he demands pr oof and is allowed to put his hand into the god’s spear wound. This is the mythical relic of the spear wound being caused at his hand. The gospels also count among the apostles John and James of Zebedee who are brothers and rivals. John is the same winter sun. James is a rendering of th e Hebrew Jacob, and Jacob in the Jewish scriptures is the twin brother and rival of Esau. Jacob is said to mean supplanter—he supplants his brother—and Esau is said to mean hairy. John the Baptist dressed in rough clothing of camel’s hair. Christian images remarkably show John the Baptist as horned like Moses— explained away by Christians as horns of light—a nd even with the limbs of a satyr and cloven hooves. Esau therefore equates with John, and they are emblems of summer fertility, effectively the classical god of woods and fields, Pan. The r eason is again astronomical . John the Baptist is of course the water carrier of Aquarius, but th e summer rains in Palestine extend over December and January and so include the month of Ca pricorn. He is therefore also the Goat. Like Esau, Jesus has a brother called James w ho supplanted him—he becomes the leader of the Nazarenes after him. He has the title, “The Ju st,” justice being a solar function, and perhaps particularly the harsh summer sun’s. Thus, the two solar gods of the original Christian myth are revealed as John the Baptist and James the Just , the winter and summer suns respectively, John being the Saviour—Jesus. The bi blical books try their best to disguise the solar meaning underlying them, but leave enough tantalizing clues to make it evident, if not clear. The real life of a patriotic Jewish bandit has been forced into the container of this solar myth to give us Christianity."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"In the complete original solar myth, each god dies when slain by their twin at the equinoxes. The winter dark sun dies at the spring equinox, when the daylight hours exceed the night time ones, while the summer bright sun dies at the autumn equinox, when the night time hours exceed the daylight ones. In Welsh mythology, as Mike Nicholls has sh own, Gronwy slays Llew and Llew slays Gronwy at each equinox in turn. Gronwy, Llew’s dark self, strikes Llew with a spear, but Llew is transformed into an eagle, an interpretation of the sun in Scorpio—the autumn equinox. Llew is the Welsh god of light, and his name means “lion.” The lion is the symbol of the bright sun god because Leo is the constellation of midsummer—th e summer solstice. The goat is the symbol of the dark winter sun, being str ongest in Capricorn—the winter so lstice. Later, Llew kills Gronwy with a spear to have his revenge, while he is standing at the same spot , not literally, but the equivalent spot, the other equi nox—Gronwy is the winter sun. Other examples are Gwyn and Gwythyr, Balder a nd Hoder/Loki, Gawain and the Green Knight, Lugh and Balor, Balan and Balin, Romulus and Re mus, Prometheus and Epimetheus, Merodach and Haman, Krishna and Balarama, Esau and Jacob, James the Just and John the Baptist (Jesus). Their mode of death is by crucif ixion, by transfixing with a spear, or perhaps an arrow, against a tree which thereby makes the shape of a cross with the projectile, or by be ing burnt on a pyre. In practice, one half of the myth is often suppressed to put more emphasis on the other which leads to salvation. Solar myths were mixed up with the vegetation myth s, the seasonal cycle that required the priests to tell the farmers the proper time to start ploughing. This needed the equinoxes to be noted easily. There is no actual cross in the sky that lets anyone know directly when the equinoxes happen, so the priests found proxies for them. The ma in one was the start of the year, the autumn equinox. This was noted as when the sun was in Virgo, and its sign was when the sun rose heliacally as if it was replacing the star Spica, which gave its name to the month originally (Chaitra). Spica is significant at the other equin ox too because it rises just as the sun sets. The vernal equinox was when the sun was in Aries but there was no clear star marker for it. In Yehud, the sign will have been when the shafts of the dawn sun il luminated the Holy of Holies, and the orientation of the temple will have been fixed to capture the heliacal rising of Spica in Virgo. It meant that the temple was not orient ed directly east but ab out 85 dgrees from the azimuth. H Van Dyke Parunak's revised estimate ( Was Solomon's Temple Aligned to the Sun? ) was 84 degrees. More widely, the deity whose deat h brings on the death of vegeta tion is Kore at Eleusis, the daughter of Demeter, the corn Goddess. Yet el sewhere it is a dying god, Attis, Adonis, Tammuz, Osiris. The Persian religion is also unclear because Mithras a nd the goddess Anahita were so closely connected that Herodotus mistook Mithras as the goddess. Mithras killed the primeval bull which is likely to be the s un rising heliacally in Taurus, suggesting that Mithras is the summer half year, and the good sun of the northern tribes. Anahita does not seem to have been introduced until the Persians entered the near east in which case she would have been the Virgin sun heliacally rising as Spica in Virgo, and stan ding for the winter sun, the good, sun of the hot near eastern climates. Anahita was a water godde ss which would mean she was associated with"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the winter rains that fertilised the earth. Mithras had been considered a g ood god in the north but now had become the bad sun of the hot season. The Persians in the fifth century swapped their calendar and made the day for cel ebrating Mithras an autumn day, in September. Thus the God and the Goddess stood for the same period of time, the wet season of winter. Spica is the sheaf of corn held by Virgo, an d the September sunrise might have been seen originally as the birth of Mithras, the winter su n. Virgo will have been Anahita seen as walking the land preparing it with her water, and Mithras the benevolent sun fertilised it with the water of life—semen. In spring, the winter sun died, crucifie d as the hot sun of the dry season rose into the sky. Anahita sacrificed a bull, the heliacal rise of Taurus, to bring back the winter sun to life, and since Mithras was the winter sun, this will be likely to have been where Herodotus made his error. The priests or priestesses of An ahita sacrificed the bull for Mithras. In the Cybele myths, Attis is said to have b een revivified as a goddess, seeming to combine the female and the male vegetative principles. Th e good winter sun was cruc ified or castrated in spring and the Virgin goddess was revived in autu mn, giving birth to the good sun as the heliacal rise of the sun in Virgo. The goddess is both mother and lover of the sun god, their mutual love causing the plants to grow. She is also the old nurs e, in many myths such as those of Eleusis, so that she appears in her triple asp ect of Maiden, Mother and Crone. Origin of the Crucifixion of the Gods The doctrine of salvation by crucifixion had, like many of the ancient forms of religious faith, an astronomical origin. The sun is hung on a cr oss or crucified when it passes through the equinoxes. People in northe rn climates were saved by the sun’s crucifixion when it crossed over the equatorial line into the season of spring, at the vernal eq uinox at Easter, and thereby gave out a saving heat and light to the world and stimulated the generative organs of animal and vegetable life. The sun that is crucified is the dark wint er sun, lacking the warmth and brightness of the summer. It is resurrected as, or supplanted by, its twin, the bright warm fertilizing summer sun that continues on to ascend into heaven. When the dark sun is the undesirable one that is crucified, it shows that the myth is appropriate to northern climates. The legend is read as the sa lvific death of the evil winter sun to resurrect the summer sun. This seems to have been the Pe rsian new year ceremony when it was the wicked"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Haman who was crucified. The Persians coming from the north and settled on the cooler Iranian plateau will have had the northern view origin ally, but changed it when they adapted to hot Babylonian conditions, and cha nged their calendar, as historians know they did. In the hot climates of the anci ent near east, the summer sun is undesirable because it burns up the landscape, so the myth was read as the unjust d eath of the desirable winter sun having nourished the land, leaving the people forlorn until he came again in the autumn. The cool winter sun that had brought the rains, the bounteous sun, made the sacrifice, and his death was bewailed. He had done nothing but kindness, but still had to die at the hands of his cruel adversaries. In Ezekiel, the women outside the temple gates bewailed th e death of Tammuz, suggesting the latter interpretation. The date of Jesus’s resurrection is the position of the sun at th e time of the vernal equinox when the priests could declare that th e winter sun was dead—the day was now longer than the night. March 25th was considered the end of the sun’ s passing through the vernal equinox. Christ is plainly the loved sun god not the hated one, so he is the dark winter sun of the ancient near east, like Krishna, and is depicted as dark skinned in some pictures. Moreover, the “black but comely” lover of the Song of Songs was said to mean Jesus. At a later part of the year the autumn equinox se es the bright summer sun transform into the dark winter sun. The ancients in the near east must once have celebrated th e death of the blazing summer sun and the arrival of the stormy sun at the autumn equinox, when they carved or painted sexual organs on the walls of their hol y temples with fertilization in mind. This was certainly the case with the temple at Jerusalem, the symbolism of which is purely sexual, the temple being the womb of the land, fertilized by Yehouah at the autumn equinox when its rays shone directly into the holy of holies from the Mount of Olives. The Cross The fertilizing winter sun having been crucified, and the summer sun risen into the heavens in resurrection, the blood of the grape, ripened by it s the heat, was symbolically “the blood of the cross,” or “the blood of the Lamb.” Jesu s is not the true vine for no reason. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Because of our Christian culture and its imagery, the cross is necessarily the instrument of the saviour god’s torture. However, be cause the celestial origin of crucifixion in solar myths is that the sun crosses over the celestial equator, the heavenly sign of the equinoxes, the image of a crossover in the sky would be a cr oss like the Greek letter Chi (X ) not a Plus (+). Constantine’s cross in the heavens that signalled his victory at the Milvian bridge was a Chi not a Plus, and the traditional Roman sign of the Christian was Chi Ro, the first two letter of the name Christ. This shape is the shape a man takes when he is stretched out by bonds such as he might have if tied to the ground, to a tree or a wheel. So we might be looking for icons in which the god is depicted such that his body forms a cross, like that of the famous illustration by Leonardo. It has always been presumed that death, and es pecially death by crucifixion, involved the highest state of suffering possible to be endured by mortal s. Hence, the gods must suffer in this way as an example of courage and fortitude which their followers must emul ate. To do this they must be superior to their devotees. They must not merely die, but submit to the most ignominious mode of suffering death that could be devised—crucifixion. This gave the highest finishing touch to the drama. And thus the legend of the crucifixion became th e crowning chapter, the a ggrandizing episode in the history of their lives. It was presumed that nothing le ss than a god could endure such excruciating tortures without complaining. Hence, when the victim was reported to have submitted with such fortitude that no murmur was heard to issue from his lips, this circumstance of itself was deemed sufficie nt evidence of his godship. The story of the crucifixion, ther efore, deified or helped deify great men and exalt them to the rank of gods, though it was usually falsely added for this purpose. Though some of the disciples of Buddhism, and some of the earliest professors of Christianity also, including, according to Christian history, Peter and his brother Andr ew, voluntarily chose this mode of dying in imitation of their crucified Lord, they were not promoted to divi ne honours. Christianity focused all its attention on the singular sacrifice of its Ch rist but had it evolved slightly differently some of the earliest saints at least would now be wors hipped as gods. They had been granted the divine qualification of crucifixion. To retain their following, reli gions are based on unchangeable dogmas which disciples must accept to the exclusion of all know ledge adverse to their own creed. Whenever they are able, they actually destroy contrary evidence for fear of rivalry. Then they magnify their own religion to a unique position above all others. The earlier Chri stian saints, having determined like Paul, to know only “Jesus Christ and him cr ucified,” made stern efforts to obliterate from the page of history facts damaging to their case. The disciples of the Christian faith have burnt books, blotted out passages and bowdlerised testaments which suggested the opposite of thei r belief. Not only that, they have demolished monuments showing crucifixions of previous atoning gods so that they are now unknown. Hence, the disbelief of Christians when other cas es are mentioned. It con tinues in more recent times."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"An ancient sculpture or icon in context tells us mo re about origins, and there have been reports of a crucified Hindu god, assumed to be Krishna, in ancient temples. Iconogr aphy can be placed in a historical period more closel y than a text. Those responsibl e for evaluating these pictures should do so, not just pretend they are not ther e. Documents themselves are often unreliable, especially religious ones that have a clear purpose of persuasion to a particular belief. It is better to regard them as unreliable until th ey can be shown to be genuine. A report on the Hindu religion, made out by a deput ation from the British Parliament, sent to India to examine their sacred books and monuments, was left in the hands of a Christian bishop at Calcutta, with instructions to forward it to England. On its arrival in London, it was so horribly mutilated as to be scarcely recognisable. An ac count of the crucifixion was gone. But, if the Christian myth was syncretized to Krishna in the y ears since Christianity arrived in India, written sources like this would be valueless. No one knows when a legend was introduced. Krishna Krishna, which means dark, plainly suffers huge losses, cursed as he was to lose the whole of his people and to die alone and misera ble. The only death of Krishna now in the Mahabharata is to be shot him in the sole of his foot by a hunter’s arrow while practising yoga in a forest. It seems odd, to the western way of thinking, that a man who had seen everyone he knew, including most recently his brother, Balarama, killed off under a cu rse, should be peacefully practising yoga in the forest. That is the way of mythology. It gave Krishna, by sitting crosslegged—possibly a remnant of the original myth—a way of receiving an unlikely wound in the sole of his foot, just as Achilles was killed in his heel. Christians will say that crossed-legs can hardly be seen as an indication of crucifixion, but th ey are indeed symbolic of th e equinoxes, as the symbolic torchbearers of Mithras’s icons show. The uplifted torch with right leg over left is the bright summer sun, while the downturned torch with left over right is the dark winter sun. The hunter, Jar, who killed Krishna only has to be identifie d with the brother, Balarama, to restore the original myth—the summer sun kill ed the winter sun by crucifixion. Hindus had a motive to suppress any crucifixion myths—to avoid para llels with Christianity that might have lost proselytes to the missionaries. Ed itors of the Hindu sacred texts will have altered the legend in the present era—when Christianity reached India with th e heretical Christians"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"called Nestorians—to avoid any imp lication that they had derived it from Christianity, or indeed to eliminate any possibility of Krishna being mi staken for Christ that might have assisted Christian proselytizing. The Krishna legends were still changing in the Christian era, as is shown by the accretion of the legends of Gopala to those of Krishna in the early centuries AD. If this is true, Christians ar gue, it would have been better fo r Hindus to have kept Krishna crucified. Having their own crucif ied saviour would have stopped the Nestorians from making converts among the Hindus, whose cr ucified saviour was much older than Christianity itself, and who had existed long before Christ ians ever came to India. The a ssumption is that the crucifixion of Krishna had the same import as the crucifix ion of Christ. Naturally, it would have been important as the god’s ultimate sacrifice, but Chri stians made it central to their outlook—Hindus probably did not. Indians attracted to the idea of crucifixion, and the success of Christianity shows it is an attractive idea, will have been more prepared to turn to Christ if they saw him as an aspect of Krishna, or even as another avatar of Vishnu. For most sun gods, crucifixion seems to have been an essential but not alwa ys the central part of the god’s myth. There is nothing surprising about any god with a solar as pect being crucified or suffering some equivalent fate, and so we should not be surprised to h ear that there is or was such a legend about Krishna. And it would not help to ask a Hindu wh at they thought the original legend was, or whether they counted Krishna as a sun god. A Hi ndu cannot enlighten us about the true origins of Krishna, once it had been s uppressed, any more than a Christ ian can enlighten us about the suppressed history of Chri st. Both have their preferred mythol ogy that they will believe despite any evidence to the contrary. Krishna is considered to have b een a historic figure, like Chri st, living about the time of the Indo-European conquest of India in 1000 BC. But he has acquired the attri butes of a sun god just as Christ did in his elevation. He was an av atar of Vishnu, a sun god, who creates Krishna the dark twin and his brother Balarama the light twin from two hairs of his head, one dark and one white. He also had the patronymic Vasudeva, signifying he was a sun god. The Romans saw Christ as a sun god and put the control of the solar religions of Rome in the hands of the bishops. No one can deny that Ch ristian iconography shows Christ as a sun god. Later religions might have syncretized with Ch ristianity by adopting a crucified saviour, but Christians do not like the fact that crucifixion was an earlier syncretiza tion of ancient mythology with Christianity. Paul and othe rs realised the value of having a newly crucified example of an old phenomenon. Suffering Saviours These myths arose before the time of Christ, but their exact date cannot be fixed, because the history of ancient mythology is not known and probably cannot ever be known, and not least because chronology before the time of Alexander the Great (330 BC) gets increasingly uncertain. Some, like Alcestis, can be dated to before the life of the author of a work in which they appear. The dating of icons, especially from distant or isolated cultures is also uncertain. Even mainstream studies of th e ancient Near East are involved in c ontroversy over dates, Peter James,"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"for example, claiming in a well argued case that several centuries have been mistakenly inserted into near Eastern chronologies. Nevertheless, these instances show that the belief in the punishme nt of gods was prevalent long before the crucifixion of Christ. These crucifix ions and atoning deaths are not vouchsafed as actual occurrences. They are mythical not real events. To establish the atoning punishment of divine saviours preceding Christ is an easier task than showing that some were crucified, but six will prove it as well as the sixteen given by Graves . Indeed, one case is sufficient. The reader is left to decide. Tammuz was a god of Assyria, Babylonia and Sume ria where he was known as Dumuzi. He is commemorated in the name of the month of June , Du’uzu, the fourth month of a year which begins at the spring equinox. The fulle st history extant of this savi our is probably that of Ctesias (400 BC), author of Persika . The poet has perpetuated his memory in rhyme. “Trust, ye saints, your Lord restored, Trust ye in your risen Lord; For the pains which Tammuz endured Our salvation have procured. Tammuz was crucified as an atonement offering: “T rust ye in God, for out of his loins salvation has come unto us.” Julius Firmicus speaks of this God rising from the dead for the salvation of the world. This saviour which long preceded the advent of Christ, filled the same role in sacred history. Even the Catholic Encyclopedia notes: “Nature Worship generally, and Agrarian in particular, were responsible for the Tammuz cult of Babylon, with which the worships of Adonis and Attis, and even of Dionysus, are so unmistakably allied. Much might have been hoped from these religions with their yearly festival of the dying and rising god, and hi s sorrowful sister or spouse . The cross of Christ, as experts seem to agree, was actually a bar placed across the top of an upright, so it was not a cross at all. It was a “Tee” (T), called “Taw” in Hebrew and “Tau” in Greek. So the cross that the victim was suspende d from was actually a cr ossbar, and perhaps in those days this was called the cross. The “Taw” sign was the sy mbol of the dying and rising god, Tammuz, and “Taw” was the sign that was made on the heads of those marked for salvation by the god. So, crucifixion images might not be as conventional as the ones based on the Catholic crucifix. Speaking of this crucified Messiah, the Anacalypsis informs us that several histories are given of him, but all concur in representing him as havi ng been an atoning offering for sin. And the Latin phrase “suspensus lingo,” found in his history, indicates the manner of his death. He was suspended on a tree, crucified, buried and rose ag ain. Attis is the Phrygian version of Tammuz, and Adonis and Jesus could equall y well be included here as othe r versions of the same god."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Prometheus (Hesiod 800 BC) Prometheus was an Indo-European sun god, as hi s procurement of the sun’s energy as fire shows. He was the Caucasian Orpheus, the benef actor of humanity, whom he taught skills he had learned from Athene (whose birth from the head of Zeus he had assisted). The skills were those such as architecture, astronomy, navigation, mathem atics, metallurgy, medici ne and such like. In Attica he was worshipped as the god of craftsmen. Zeus wanted to destroy humanity and spared them because of Prometheus’s plea. But Prometheus was getting too clever and suffered the fate of several saviours who upset Zeus. The legend of Prometheus justifies the sacrificial practi ce in the ancient Near Ea st of offering fat (for the fire) and bones (for the sweet smell) to the gods while the lean flesh is reserved for the priests. In particular, Prometheus stole the fi re of the sun from Olympus by hiding a glowing charcoal in a stalk of fennel and taking it to mort al beings who had been condemned by the angry Zeus to eat their flesh raw. He is depicted as Zeus Prometheus at Th urii, where he holds a swastika (Sanskrit, pramantha —prometheus), the symbol of th e sun and fire—produced by a fire drill (swastika), often a tedious process which made the Aryans prefer to keep their fires permanently alight. So, the cause for which Pr ometheus suffered was hi s love for the human race. Humans were punished by Zeus but Promethe us took pity on them and gave them warmth. Therefore, he too was punished by Zeus. The punishment of Prometheus was described by Hesiod, and other writ ers. Prometheus was crucified on a symbolic tree, depicted as a post, si tuated near the Caspian Straits. Hesiod writes: “With shackles and inescapable fetters Ze us riveted Prometheus on a pillar. The illustration is of an ancient Laconian bowl with Prometheus on it , tied to a pillar, a symbolic tree like the cross, while the eagle eats at his liver. The point about th e carrion eating birds in these legends is that the crucif ied corpse was left hanging to be pecked by birds, doubtless a familiar sight at one time, and deserving a myth ical explanation. An anonymous poet describes a scene like it, thus: "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"“Lo! streaming from the fatal tree His all atoning blood, Is this the Infinite?—Yes, ’tis he, Prometheus, and a god! Well might the sun in darkness hide, And veil his glories in, When God, the great Prometheus, died For man the creature’s sin. Christians complain that Prometheus is not “cru cified” here, because “a re al crucifixion is on a cross, and Prometheus is not on a cross. He is ju st tied to a tree, with his feet on the ground, and is is not nailed to anything.” The word crucifixion refers nowadays to a cross, but the ancient punishment which it represents is most commonly hanging on a tree, a form that applied to several anci ent gods. Most scholars, even Christian ones, recognize that the cross is a symbolic tree. In Justin Martyr, thinking he is quoting from a psalm, tells us that Jesus was considered to have b een hung from a tree: “Let them rejoice among the nations. Th e Lord hath reigned from the tree. 1 Apology 41, Indeed the scriptural reference in Deuteronomy 21:22—often taken as prophetic of Jesus—is to hanging on a tree, and Peter and the apostles ( Acts 5:30;10:39) say Jesus had been hanged on a tree. Crucifixions generally did not involve nailing but tying, a nd tying even when the hands or wrists were nailed to make sure the weight wa s carried even if flesh yielded. Ultimately, the point is that the saviour of ma nkind, here the Titan Prometheus, was cruelly punished, or at least had to suffer cruelly in the myth. The story of Prometheus’s punishment, burial and resurrection was acted in Athens, in a trilogy of plays written by the great Greek playwright , Æschylus, five hundred years before Christ, showing its great antiquity. Prometheus Bound is the only survivor of the three plays. Zeus had decided to put an end to humanit y, but the titan, Prometheus, in tervenes, saving them, so Zeus punished him for it. What Prometheus had done wa s to make humans immortal, so that Zeus’s thunderbolts did not force them to descend in d eath to Hades. Besides this, when the wrath of Zeus terrified them and they knew they were ab out to die, Prometheus gave them hope. Now, these are the very gifts that Ch ristians still believe Christ ha s exclusively conferred upon them— the hope and expectation of life after death! Besides these gifts, though, Prometheus taught peopl e how to be civilized. Christians also think that to be Christian is to be peculiarly civi lized in outlook, despite all the historical evidence to the contrary. Some non-canonical myths of Jesus have him teaching humanity ploughing, planting the vine and so on, just as Prometheus did, and Orpheu s after him too. The civilization Christians attribute to Christ is the love of others, something they like to boast about so long as they never have to put it into practice. Loving so meone as strange to them as Arabs is just too much! The myth of Prometheus later made him th e creator of humanity as well, moulded by him out of clay, according to Pausanias in the sec ond century AD. The goddess, Athena, breathed life"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"into the clay figures to vitali ze them. Non-Christians, like Lord Byron, depicted Prometheus as a kind god whose aim was to make the wretched hu man condition more tolerable. Christians like John Milton saw the parallel of Prometheus and Ch rist, Milton using Prometheus as an image of Christ, even though he preceded Christ by hundreds of years. The modern story of this crucified God, which has him bound to a rock for thirty years, while vultures preyed upon his vitals, is a Christian fraud, inasmuch as the crucifixion aspect of the drama was omitted. Yet even in the extant translations of Prometheus Bound by Aeschylus, the god is plainly crucified, albeit on a rock: “Force: Seize his hands and master him. Now to your hammer. Pin him to the rocks. Drive stoutly now your wedge straight thr ough his breast, the stubbor n jaw of steel that cannot break. Now for his feet. Drive the nails through the flesh. When Prometheus is crucified in this way, Force taunts him just as Jesus was in the gospels: “Run hot now, you there on the rocks, Go steal from gods to give their goods to men What will they do to lift these woes from you? Prometheus, whose name means “forethought,” had fore seen it all, just as Jesus was supposed to have, and muses to himself in his agony that he had: “Nothing, no pang of pain that I did not foresee. A chorus of maidens lament his agony and desola tion, weeping in sorrow. Soon we hear the very line that is attributed to Christ addressing Paul ( Acts 26:14), proof enough th at the author knew the play: "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"“Don’t kick against the pricks, The version of Prometheus given by Aeschylus has Prometheus bound for eternity, because as a god, he was immortal and his liver grew again ever y night, but Zeus fired a thunderbolt that sent the captive to Tartarus still bound. Zeus’s thunderbolt shook the earth, rocks were rent, the whole frame of nature became convulsed, and in a storm, which seemed to threat en the dissolution of the universe, the solemn scene closed, and Prometheus depa rted to the underworld in deat h. Tartarus is the abyss of the underworld—the equal of the Chri stian Hell—and to go there means death! Prometheus had told Zeus the secret he wanted to know, and Zeus, responding to his son Herakles’s pleas, allowed Herakles to kill the eagle and free the captive. Pr ometheus was freed from Tartarus, and later was elevated to Olympus. Confinement to Tartarus is death, liberati on from Tartarus is resurrection. Christians find it impossible to understand this. The dismissal to the underworld after the crucifix ion suggests that Promet heus was crucified at the autumn equinox. He is therefore the beneficial summer sun of cool countries being sent back to Hades at the end of the summer. Prometheus is only restored to Olym pus because the centaur, Cheiron agrees to lose his immortality to allow Pr ometheus to regain his. So here the redeemer of humanity is himself redeemed by the self-s acrifice of his personal redeemer Cheiron! Several other benefactors of humanity—and ther efore saviours—were cr uelly punished by Zeus. At one time they were the gods of foreign, rebe llious or defiant people and so have been punished in hell in the myths of the Greeks. "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"More Saviours Punished in Hell Tityus was another god punished by crucifixion, with vultures peck ing at his liver in Tartarus, but this time he was spreadeagled and pinned on the ground, the oldest form of the punishment. This was for trying to have illici t sex with Leto—the liver was thought of as the centre of sexual power. He was a giant and a son of Gaia, so must have been a Titan, as his name might imply. Stealing a sexual pleasure from a goddess or revea ling sexual indiscretions of a god seem to be euphemistic ways of hiding the revelation of di vine secrets to humanity. In other words, he sounds like a disguised or olde r version of Prometheus. Another suffering god was Tantalus, who was s upposed to have been a king of Lydia and therefore extremely rich, blessed by his mother, the Titaness, Pluto (wealth). Tantalus, being so favoured by the gods, became immortal by dining with them on nectar and ambrosia, and one story of his punishment is that he served up to the gods in return the bo iled corpse of his son Pelops. The Gods detected the nature of the meal and he was punished for it. Only Demeter anguishing over the fate of Kore, absentmindedly ch ewed a shoulder. The s houlders of sacrifices were always reserved for the king or the prie sts as they were in the Jewish religion (Lev 7:32;11:21). Those w ho dine with gods are gods, so Tantalus was really a non-native Greek god popular enough to have been once acceptable to the Greeks. Sacrifices were offered as broth, not roast, in countries influenced by the Persian religion, or perhaps in ancient Indo-European tradition. There are other, more “tantalizing” myths ho wever. Some place him in Corinth not Lydia, suggesting he might be associated with the lege nds of Sisyphus with whom he is punished in Tartarus. Like Prometheus, he stole from the gods to give to mortals. He betrayed to humanity certain divine secrets that he heard at the dinn er table with them, and also stole nectar and ambrosia, the food of the gods, which confers i mmortality. There is a strong hint here of a eucharistic type of meal believe d to confer immortality on to its partakers. When the gods found out he intended to benefit mort als he was punished for it. The Gr eek gods reserved immortality to themselves. Because his secrets came from dining with the gods, he was forb idden to eat or drink, even though food and drink were tantal isingly available. This savi our of humanity was obviously crucified! He is hung on the branch of a fruit tr ee! It is perhaps a tree of life because it has"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"multiple fruits growing in it—the tree of life has twelve—and is suspended over a lake. He is depicted peering through the greener y in abject terror. The level of the lake slowly rose up to his chin such that he could bend his head for a gulp of water, but each time he did, the water level fell away to expose the muddy bottom. Each time he bent his head to bite a fruit, a gust of wind bounced it from his mouth. So, he suffered everlast ing torments of hunger and thirst. Jesus was, of course, tormented with gall to drink when he thirsted. In another myth, Tantalus is punished by ha ving a large rock suspended above his head threatening to fall upon him at every moment, so he suffers an eternity of immediate fear. The rock, like that of Sisyphus is the solar disc, sh owing that Tantalus was a sun god. Scholiast on Pindar’s Odes declares this to be the case. A sacrificial victim to the sun god will have been put in a cage decorated with the fruit of the earth and dropped into a lake as the canonical myth suggests, or burnt on a pyre as was Tantalus’s son, whence the real reason for his fear. In fact, th e folk custom of the Jack in the Green (Green George) in which an effigy is first ducked and then burnt will be the relic of the custom. In Medieval times, at May Day, the vi ctim was encased in a wooden cage decorated with holly, ivy, spring flowers and fluttering ribbons. The tradition was maintained by chimney sweeps which suggests the fate of the original victim. The fearful image of the green man sprouting leaves will be the same. The man wa s not originally sprouting leaves but looking through them in terror. Yet another benefactor of hu manity punished in hell was Sisyphus, who was condemned to rolling a large stone up a hill in Tartarus, but each time it roll ed back again. Sisyphus who is supposed to have founded Corinth and the Isthmian games, revealed one of Zeus’s amorous affairs, but this will be anot her derogation of the or iginal in which he aimed to pass divine secrets to mortals. Zeus sent Thanatos (deat h) to embrace him. Sisyphus however, tricked and overpowered Thanatos, and chained him up, so that he could not embrace people, and human beings became immortal like gods. Here again is a strong hint of the god pr omising eternal life to his devotees. Mars, who had a vested interest in people killing each other, set Thanatos free again and despatched Sisyphus to Tartarus, proba bly signifying that the religion was forcibly suppressed. A saviour of the human race, actua lly saving them from death, is punished by a jealous patriarchal god. Sisyphus was read by the Greeks as including the word “sophos,” “wisdom,” and they took it to mean “crafty,” in the sense of “cunning” but originally will have meant “clever” or “thoughtful” like Prometheus . Curiously Jesus is often identified with Wisdom, though Wisdom was a goddess, Sophia."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The punishment of Sisyphus reflec ts his original nature as a sun god, presumably of Corinth, where there was a temple to Helios. The time sp ent by Paul at Corinth might not have been purely fortuitous. The cult was based upon the Hittite sun god, Tesup, and will have been brought into Corinth by traders from Rhode s where Tesup was worshipped. The boulder Sisyphus rolls up the hill stands for the disc of the sun, and Sisyphus was the god who rolled the solar disc across the vault of the heavens, havi ng to begin his endless task anew each morning because overnight the sun has re turned to the east. Sisyphus and Ixion (another, sun god—see below) were put next to each other in Hades, suggesting an association. In his myth, Sisyphus was a cattle owner, anot her characteristic of some sun gods, who were often represented as bulls (compare Mith ras). He is the parallel of Laban in Genesis (29-30) from whom Jacob tricked cattle. Laban means wh ite, a colour associated with the sun. The end of the story of Sisyphus is even more revealing. Being so wise, he tells his wife not to bury his body when he dies. This is a mythical explanation of the corpse s of crucified victims being left to hang. Arriving in Hades, he comp lains to Persephone, the queen of the underworld, that he had suffered an injustice by not being burie d and asked for a three days respite to correct it. Persephone agreed but Sisyphus had no intenti on of keeping his three day promise. It could not work. Omniscient gods could not be tricked so simply, and Hermes was quickly sent to inflict permanent death on Sisyphus . Paul addresses the Greeks ( Acts 17:2-34) referring to an altar inscribed “To an Unknown God.” Luke puts this speech in the Areopagus in Athens immediately before Paul departs to Corinth. Pe rhaps Luke was misinformed or has used poetic license and the altar was to Sisyphus, whose name was unmentionable and whose tomb was unknown—in Corinth. What is interesting is the reversal of myths like that of Jesus where the god dies for three days. Here the god is reprieved from death for three days. It might be simply an expression of the ancient belief that the soul does not finally leave the corpse until after three days, or it might be part of the denigration of the Corinthian god by inverting what was a resurrection after three days. The Hellenes will have denigrated the Corint hian god for racial reas ons, they disliked the importation of a foreign god into the heart of th e Greek peninsular, and so had him punished by their own gods. The Greeks eventually accepted foreign gods—including gods who died for three days—and some aspired to Olympus, but these sinning g ods punished by Zeus in Tartarus were pre- Olympian, or gods of rebellious nations seen as rivals to the Olympians, or perhaps the Greeks were suppressing mysteries except their favoured ones of Eleusis, and a few other privileged places. Only Tantalus and Ixion of these saviours of humanity are still seen as crucified, but the common themes among them imply that it, and a communion meal conferring immortality, are likely to have been in the original myths, now suppressed. Aesculapius was a sun god as his parents prove. He was born of Apollo and Coroni s. Zeus raised Aesculapius from the dead and restored him as a god. Before that Zeus slew him with a bolt lest the whole race of mortals should escape death. Aesculapius ha d raised so many from the dead that Pluto thought he waould have no dead people to rule. Here is the same my th of immortality, first suppressed then admitted as legitimate."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Alcestis A less usual atoning god was Alcestis, who was fe male, the only example of a feminine god atoning for the sins of the world by self-sacrifice, unless the Danaids are considered in the same light. Her husband, Admetus, who wins her in ma rriage by riding a chariot pulled by a lion and a boar, forgets to sacrifice to Ar temis on his wedding day and, ente ring the bedchamber, sees a coil of snakes. This will be a polite way of saying sn akes copulating, which is considered a bad omen in India still, and plainly rela tes to the bridal chamber. It signifies his early death, but the sun god Apollo, whom he had done a favour for, arranges for him to escape death if someone would die in his place. His elderly parents refuse telling him to accept his fate, and only Alcestis is willing to die for him. She takes poison in the canonical myth, and dies but Persephone in Hades refuses to accept her because of her devotion and sends her back. So the saviour goddess dies and is resurrected. The chariot of Admetus pulled by a boar and a lio n suggests the full year , since these are the symbols of the two half years. The implica tion is that Admetus was another sun god, whose chariot was the half year of winter represented by a boar and the summer represented by a lion. The sun often is depicted as riding a chariot or as a charioteer. Admetus has the same form as Prometheus and Epimetheus, so might stand for the full year. Mithras of Persia atoned for ma nkind, and prepared for the salv ation of mankind through slaying the primaeval bull—the first sacrif ice. He was born on the twenty-f ifth day of D ecember, and his celebrations at the spring and au tumn equinoxes were associated with crucifixion on a tree. These were the Persian New Year festivities de scribed in the scriptural book of Esther, and involved the crucifixion of the ol d year, considered wicked, so th at a new and uncorrupted year could take its place. This was seen as an annua l rehearsal of the eschaton when the wicked world is finally replaced by the purity of the original creation of Ahuramazda. Christian writers, like Tertullian, imply that Mithras was slain, and yet do not say how. It has been suppressed. The Romans saw a great deal in common between M ithras and Christ, probably because they both originated in Persian mythology. Ixion "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Ixion, a mythical king of Thessaly, was crucif ied on a wheel, the rim re presenting the world, and the spokes constituting the cross. Ancient kings were often the god of the tribe, because unsophisticated people saw themselves as ruled by the god, not by the man who acted for him on earth. He is said to have carried the burden of the world on his back while suspended on the cross. He was therefore called the crucified spirit of the world. Ixion was another sun god, a Thessalian sun god. He was married to Dia, meaning the sky, but ha d intercourse with a cloud, but the cloud was the wife of the sky god, Zeus, who therefore punish ed the headstrong sun god. This signifies a victory of the Greeks (God = Zeus) over the Th essalians (God = Ixion). The sky God Zeus condemned him to be crucified on the solar wheel as it traversed the sky forever. A man tied to a wheel is crucified because his body forms a cross. This myth seems to be a Hellenic version of a non-Hellenic sun god where the god is considered ignoble for ravaging the wi fe of Zeus, and so is punished. Like most ancient myths, there are competing versions. In one versi on the punishment was an eternal crucifixion in Ta rtarus but in another th e eternal crucifixion was in the sky. The latter was probably the original one, but the Greeks would not allow such a gl orious crucifix ion and placed it in the pits of hell. The cause of the punish ment might have been historic—an ambush of Ionians (Eioneus) who were trapped and burnt in a fiery pit—but even this might have been part of a solar myth, the victims being sacrificed to the sun. It is curious that Chris tian writers will recount a long list of miracles and remarkable incidents in the life of Apollonius of Tyana, the Cappadocian saviour, forming a parallel to those of the Christian saviour, yet say not a word about his crucifixion, even though they can—and do when forced to consider it—attribute it to syncretism to Christianity. Christian writers find it necessary to omit the cr ucifixion of these saviours fearing the telling would lessen the spiritual force of the crucifixion of Christ, whic h has to be unique. They thus exalted the tradition of the cruc ifixion into the most important dogma of the Christian faith. Hence, their efforts to conceal from the public the fact that it is of pagan origin. They had full control and power over publishing for a millennium, a much longer time than was needed to expunge all referemnces to the cr ucifixion of earlier gods. Even icons were destroyed and the few that remain can and are always questione d by Christians, either as not authentic or misinterpreted. Justin Martyr admits that the cross was alr eady a well known and used symbol to the Romans. Addressing the Roman emperor An toninus Pius, he wrote: “And the power of this form (the cross) is shown by your own symbols on what are called “vexilla” (standards) and trophies, with which all your state possessions are made, using these as the insignia of your power and go vernment, even though you do so unwittingly. And with this form you cons ecrate the images of your empe rors when they die, and you name them gods by inscriptions."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" Justin was pleading for his life but was so inept that he repeatedly insulted the emperor and the Romans. That is why he is now called “Marty r.” Minucius Felix, on e of the most popular Christian writers of the second century, confir ms this not long afterwards, charging Pagan Romans with displaying “gilded and adorned cro sses” sometimes hung with the image of a man, but denied that crosses were si gnificant to Christians. Addressing the people of Rome, he says: Crosses, moreover, we neither worship nor wish for. You, indeed, who consecrate gods of wood, adore wooden crosses perhaps as parts of your gods. For your very standards, as well as your banners and flags of your camp, what else are they but crosses gilded and adorned? Your victorious trophies not only imitate the appearance of a simple cross, but also that of a man affixed to it. And this man Christians denoted a god. Mackey’s Lexicon of Freemasonry says that Freemasons secretly taught that the doctrine of the cruc ifixion, atonement and resurrection preceded the Christian era, and that similar doctrines were taught in all the ancient mysteries. These coincidences are evidence that the tradition of the crucifixion of gods has been long prevalent among Pagans. To those who say the ancient crucifixions of gods were mere myths or fables, having no foundation in fact, but added to thei r histories as mere romance, the reply is that there is the same ground for suspecting it as bei ng true of Jesus Christ. Many of the early Christians and contemporary Jews and gentiles doubted it, an d some openly disputed its ever having taken place. Others bestowed upon it a mere spiritual significance, and not a few considered it symbolical of a holy life. Quirinus (Romulus) of Rome The association of the crucifixion of Christ with a violent convulsion of nature, and the resurrection of the long-buried saints, events not supported by anyone in contemporary history, can only discredit the whole story. To appeal to Ro mans, Jesus was partly gi ven a parallel history to Romulus (Quirinus). The death of this Roman savi our is remarkable for th e parallel features to that of the Judaean saviour, not onl y in the circumstances of his crucifixion, but also in much of his antecedent life."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"• Romulus and Remus were of royal blood, th eir mother, Rhea Silvia, being of kingly descent from Aeneas, • Romulus and Remus were conceived and born of a virgin because Rhea Silvia was made a Vestal Virgin by the usurping king Amuliu s, so that she could not bear a son, • Romulus and Remus were sought by the reigni ng king, Amulius, to be put to death, but were saved in the fashion of Moses and Sa rgon of Assyria by being floated down a river (another ancient legend), • Romulus and Remus were watched over by shepherds as children, • Remus was put to death by his brother, perhaps crucified, • Romulus was put to death by wicked hands, and the whole earth was covered in darkness, • Romulus finally was resurrecte d, and ascended to heaven. In the canonical narrative, Romulus dies as an old man by disappearing during a thunder storm whereupon he was deified, but there are many varia tions in which he is murdered. Romulus was supposed to be favoured by Jupiter (Zeus), the sky god, to whom he dedicated a temple in his myth, and Rome was founde d at the spring equinox. In the myth, the twin who dies is Remus, killed by Romulus, and the reason is that he stepped across the boundary of Rome befo re the wall was built, an obvious parallel of the sun crossing the celestial equator. But it is Romulus who goes on to asce nd to the godhead as Quirinus. Remus is the Roman Haman, who dies to permit th e city of the sun to rise. The two brothers, Romulus and Remus, have echoes of Prometheus and Epimetheus, and could be distant variants of them. Mitra had his dark twin Varuna (perha ps evolved into Ahuramazda in Persia). Krishna had his twin Balarama.

The Virgin Birth of Romulus and Remus Retold © 1998 by Frank E Smitha from The Ancient World Online Fire awed the early Romans, as it did the Gr eeks and others. The Romans believed in a goddess of fire called Vesta, and they had a sacred te mple of fire tended by four females—the Vestal Virgins—who were selected while they were child ren and were expected to serve thirty years. During their service they were expected to remain virgins, for the Romans believed that to please the gods, women who were unmarried and not tryi ng to bear children should remain chaste. A Vestal Virgin was part of the greatest le gend among the Romans—the legend about Rome's origins. The legend begins with a Vestal Virgin giving birth to twin boys and claiming that the boys had been fathered miraculously by the god Ma rs—a god of fertility and later also of war. The Vestal Virgin was the sister of a king. The ki ng believed his sister was lying and that she had violated a sacred law. To put things right with the gods the king had his sister imprisoned, and he had her twins put afloat in a basket on the Tiber Ri ver. The two boys, called Romulus and Remus, were expected to drown, but the river re ceded and the basket carrying the boys came to rest on the river's bank, where a shepherd found them. "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Around the time of Jesus Christ, when this legend was still popular among Romans, a Roman historian named Livy tried looking back centuries to determine wh ether the legend was true. The earliest version that Livy found described the wife of the she pherd who rescued Romulus and Remus. It described her as a she-wolf (a bitc h) because of her alleged loose morals. Legends evolve, and by Livy's time the legend held that the boys had been rescued by a real female wolf—a notion that was put into the famous Roman sculpture a wolf nursing the two boys. According to the legend that Livy studied, Ro mulus and Remus grew into manhood, and they killed their uncle, the king, in revenge for his ha ving imprisoned their mother and for his having unjustly usurped power from their grandfather. The boys restored th eir grandfather to the throne, and they founded Rome where they had emerged from the river. Then Romulus and Remus quarreled—as had Cain and Abel. Romulus killed Remus, and he became Rome's first king. To populate his city, Romulus gathered people from other countries. And, to give his subjects wives, he abducted you ng unmarried women from a nearby tribe called the Sabines—an incident to be known as “The Abduction of the Sabine Women.” The fathers of the women were outraged, and the Sabines reta liated by attacking the Romans. The abducted Sabine women, now apparently contented wives, intervened in the fighting and brought peace between their husbands and their fathers. The legend ends with Romulus, after a long reign, vanishing into a thunderstorm. He became a god. Th en he reappeared, descending from the sky, declaring to those listening that it is the will of heaven that Rome be the capital of the world, that Romans cherish the art of war a nd that others realize that they cannot resist the strength of Roman arms. Jesus as a Sun God The idea of a Son of God is amongst the oldest cults of the patriarchal god worshippers. The sun is the son of heaven in all primitive faiths. The firmament is personified as the Father on High and the sun becomes the Son of God. Then, because no wrongdoing is missed by the sun in its travels around the heavens, it becomes the Son of Righteousness. The s un in its annual course around the zodiac and its regular daily periodicity typified the ever present, everlasting, ever faithful qualities that reassured people."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"For Christian clergy who are always scared that one of these days their flocks will catch on and be outraged at the confidence trick they have been subject to, the Jesus of the New Testament bears an uncomfortable resemblance to other my thical figures. Many of the patriarchs, prophets, priests and kings of the bible ar e sun gods allegoricized as men by ancient poets. They can be recognized because there is negligible historical evidence for them. Many scholars agree that the patriarchs of the bible and even Saul, Davi d, Solomon and Samson are ancient gods whose myths have been ludicrously accepted as hi story even by the most scholarly of men. The ancients saw in the sun’s annual course round th e heavens an image of human experience— conception, birth, growth, victory, death and resurrection. In the dramas of the mystery religions the central character was the initi ate in the role of the sun god. Christians have confounded pre-Chri stian Persian and Hellenistic cosmic principles with Jesus, a historical human being, a national hero of the Je wish nation fighting repr ession. The Jesus of the gospels was given the characteristics of a solar god. The Jews too then connived in the deception by rejecting their hero as a Pagan sun god and nothing more! When the cruel summer sun of the ancient near east died at the autumn equinox, by a miracle the sun rose in the constellation of Virgo—the sun was born of a Virgin. When the bounteous winter sun was crucified at the spring equinox, the sun ro se in the constellation of the lamb, and the crucified god was the sacr ificed lamb of god. Light imagery is widespread in descriptions of Jesus. He is the “Light of the World” ( Jn 8:12) but the only proper “Light of the World” is the sun. “Behold, he cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him, and all kindreds of the eart h shall wail because of him. Revelation 1:7 is a description of the sun as the god, Tammuz. The sun, in the form of its reflexion as it rises and sets, walks on water. Jesus is the saviou r of mankind, but truly the proper saviour of mankind and all life on earth is the sun—without it we should be unable to survive."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" The sun’s corona is traditionally depicted by a halo, a sunburst or a crown of thorns, and indeed the halo can be taken as an indication of a sun g od in pre-Christian art. Sun gods such as Horus, Buddha and Krishna are shown with haloes before it became a Christian convention. Often Jesus is depicted surrounded by a sunburst of rays. The hor ns of the older deities and the rays of light radiating from the heads of Hindu and Pagan gods s how that gods were ofte n given the attributes of the sun. The halo, that origina lly indicated a solar god, was transferred to other divine people in Christian art. The halo became the symbol of a god and then a holy person because it is a characteristic of the holy sun. The sun has 12 aspects being the 12 signs of th e zodiac or constellations, through which it must pass in its yearly journey. It is born in the sign of the goat, the Augean stable of the Greeks, then has an adventure as it enters each different sign during the course of a year. Finally it dies and is reborn or resurrected after three days on the twen ty-fifth of December in the same sign of the celestial goat. From ancient times the year was partitioned into the 12 segments based on the constellation that the sun was in at the time, and from this the sun itself was given the aspects of the imagined signs in the heavens or friends or fo es were given these imagined characteristics. The magic number 12 is usually derived from this source and so it is with the twelve Labours of Hercules and the tribes of Israel. The rationalisati on of the number twelve of the apostles is that they were to rule over the twelve tribes, but the or igin of the twelve is then still solar. In fact, there were not twelve tribes and the number is only chosen to meet the requirements of a sun god. People in agrarian societies appr eciated the importance of the s un in agriculture. Farmers noted that the sun descended in altitude in the sky as it m oved southwards until 21 or 22 December, the winter solstice, when it stopped declining for th ree days and thereafter started to ascend and move north again. The sun seemed to die for three days on 22 December when it ceased its heavenly motion and was born again on December 25th, when it resumes its heavenly motion. The punter worried that the sun mi ght really die and not begin it s annual ascent again, just as primitive peoples worried that the night might not end when the sun had set."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Ancient astronomer-priests knew of the annual cycl es of the sun and told the punters that they could influence it in its journeys—if they were rewarded for their skills. Priests always were frauds—modern ones are no different in claiming they can help people get eternal life—and pretended they had rituals to revive the sun each winter. Each year on 25 December, when it was born again, people celebrated its birthday. Sons of god are born on December 25th because the sun is. Jesus has no known birthdate but he wa s given the birthdate of the Unconquerable Sun because he was perceived by the Romans and the Greeks as a sun god. Early Christians, like Minucius Felix, repudiat ed the cross because it was Pagan. The first images of Jesus show him as an androgynous youth, the Good Shepherd, carrying a lamb. The original occupant of the cross was this lamb. A man was not shown hanging on a cross until long after the invasions of the barbarian whose traditional sun symbol was the cross. That Christians worship on Sunday shows the or igins of their god. The sun has been viewed consistently throughout history as the saviour of mankind for reas ons that are obvious. Without the sun, life on the planet would die. The Eucharistic host, meant to be the body of Christ is kept and displayed for worship in a monstrance, having the shape of a radiating sun! The ancients had no “only-begotten” son of the Chri stian type because the term they used was in Greek “monogenes,” and in Latin “unigenitus,” and did not mean “only-begotten,” but “that which was begotten of one pare nt,” the father, alone. The ancients meant by the term to designate the projection into matte r by God of the force of life, not the sole and unique product of the union of spirit and matter, or a male god and a female human. What can the Christian honestly make of the story of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ? It is a stolen legend. The Indian chief Red Jacket is reported to have replied to the Christian missionaries: “Brethren, if you white men murdered the son of the Great Spir it, we Indians have nothing to do with it, and it is none of our affair. If he had come among us, we would not have killed him. We would have treated him well. You must make amends for that crime yourselves."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" This view of the crucifixion, from the viewpoint of a people regarded as savage, is more sensible and rational than that of Christians, who make it meritorious and a moral necessity. If the act were a moral necessity then Judas as well as Je sus was a saviour, because, without him in the Christian story, the act which saved the world c ould not have happened. If it was necessary for Christ to suffer death upon the cr oss as an atonement for sin, th en the act of crucifixion was right, and a monument should be erected to the memory of J udas for bringing it about. Only Christian logic can find a flaw in this argumen t. They say that even though it was God’s fore- ordained plan, Judas could only have played his part because he was wicked! So the Christians finish up believing that the means justify the en d, because their own Father would use a wicked man to achieve the salvation of the world. It is hardly any surprise that the Christian world remains so wicked despite being saved. If the inhabitants of this plan et required the murderous death of a god as an atonement, we must presume that all other inhabited worlds need a divine atonement. If there are millions of world inhabited by intelligent beings in the universe then they all need a saviour. Presumably, there is only one Most High and it is He who has to be incarnated in each case. He begins to look a bit like a fetishist getting a kick out of slumming it in the worlds of the mortals. Or rather, it begins to make the whole concept look ludicrous. The idea of gods coming down from heaven, bei ng born of virgins and dying a violent death for the moral blunders of the people originated in an age of the world when mankind was savage and blood was the requisition for every offence. In t hose days no one had any idea of other possible worlds besides our own and the realms of the gods themselves. So the idea of the supreme god playing his tricks seemed reasonable. Today it do es not, to anyone with a remaining brain cell. Sixteen Crucified Saviours Kersey Graves, in a well known book written ove r a century ago, gives examples of sixteen crucified gods or saviours. Most are very an cient and the evidence he presents arguable, depending upon the interpretation of pictures or sculptures, since no original written sources now exist, often victims of Christians determined to preserve the memory of only one crucified god."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Some have already been considered. Others are doubtful. Any evid ence of these doubtful cases—or indeed others—particularly pictures would be welcomed. Kersey Graves cites the god Wittoba of the Te lingonesic (500 BC), woshipped apparently in the Travancore and other southern states of India in the region of Madura, who is depicted with nail- holes in his hands and the soles of his feet. Nails, hammers and pincers are constantly seen represented on his crucifixes and are objects of adoration among hi s followers, just as the iron crown of Lombardy has within it a nail claimed to be of his true original cross , and is much admired and venerated for that reason. The chan ce of Christian syncretism has to be discounted, but references to Wittoba are im possible to find in accessible books. He also cites Bali of Orissa 725 BC. In Orissa, in India, they have the story of a crucified God, known by several names, including the above, all of which, we are told, signify “Lord Second,” his being the second person or second member of th e trinity. Most of the cr ucified gods occupied that position in a trinity of gods , the Son, in all cases, being the atoning offering. This God Bali was also called Baliu, and sometimes Bel. Monume nts of this crucified God, bearing great age, may be found amid the ruins of the magnificent city of Mahabalipore, partially buried amongst the figures of the temple. Graves says Indra of Tibet is shown nailed to the cross and that the antiquity of the story is beyond dispute. There are five wounds, representing the nail-holes and the pi ercing of the side. Marvellous stories are told of the birth of this Divine Redeem er. His mother was a virgin of black complexion, and hence his complexion was of the ebony hue, as in th e case of Christ and some other sin-atoning saviours. He descended from heaven on a mission of benevolence, and ascended back to the heavenly mansion after his crucifixion. He led a life of strict celibacy, which, he taught, was essential to true holiness. He inculcated great tenderness toward all living beings. He could walk upon the water or upon the ai r and he could foretell future events with great accuracy. He practised the most devout co ntemplation, severe di scipline of the body and mind, and completely subdued his passions. He was worshiped as a god who had existed as a spirit from all eternity, and his follo wers were called Heavenly Teachers."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" The Celtic Druids depict their god Esus (Hesus) of Gaul as having been crucified wi th a lamb on one side and an elephant on the ot her, and that this occurred l ong before the Christian era. The elephant, being the largest animal known, was chosen to represent the magn itude of the sins of the world, while the lamb, from its proverbial innocent nature, was chosen to represent the innocence of the victim, the god offered as a prop itiatory sacrifice. We have the Lamb of God taking away the sins of the world. The Lamb of God could therefore have been borrowed from the Druids. This legend was found in Gaul long before Jesus Christ was known to history. Graves claims the historical basis of the crucif ixion of the Mexican god Quezalcoatl is explicit, unequivocal, tangible, and ineffaceable, “being inde libly engraven upon metal plates.” One of these plates shows him as having been crucif ied on a mountain. Another shows him as having been crucified in the heavens, as S Justin tells us Christ was. Sometimes he is shown as having been nailed to a cross, sometimes with two thie ves hanging with him, and sometimes as hanging with a cross in his hand. If these are unquestiona bly pictures of Quezalcoa tl, the question has to be asked whether they are Christian syncre tisms and therefore later than Cortez."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" Today, Quetzalcoatl is said to have departed to the east saying he would one day return, but his manner of doing this seems to have been by throwing himself on to a funeral pyre, being cremated and then resurrected as the plan et Venus. The ancient sun gods demanded human sacrifice to start the sola r year and often rather than crucifix ion, this was burning on a pyre, or in Europe in a wicker basket. Another myth is that he burnt in the h eat of the sun. Birds flew out of his ashes which carried his heart up to th e sky to become the planet Venus. Quetzalcoatl again has characte ristics of a sun god. The Aztecs seem to have been sun worshippers and Venus is the planet that heralds the sun. A picture that purports to illustrate the legend of Quetzalcoatl rising as Venus, show s a sun figure emerging from a fire with outstretched arms! There seems to be no heart or birds or planet Venus. Elsewhere in Aztec legend, Nanahuatzin self-immolates on a pyre to create the fifth sun. Are these myths being properly distinguished? Iao of Nepal in 600 BC was crucified on a tree. The name of this incarnate god and oriental saviour occurs frequently in the holy bibles an d sacred books of other countries. Some suppose that Iao is the root of the name of the Jewi sh God, Yehouah (Jehovah), often abbreviated to Yeho.

Who Lies Sleeping? 2. Birth Narratives I © Dr M D Magee Contents Updated: Sunday, July 04, 1999 Monday, 05 April 2004 • The Myth of the Virgin Birth • Joseph and Mary • Bethlehem and Nazareth • The Line of David • The Genealogies • Mary Abstract The Virgin Birth is unknown to Paul. The earlie st Christian writings, Paul's Epistles, do not mention it. Jesus was of the seed of David according to the fl esh (Rom 1:3), and Jesus was born of a woman under the law (Gal 4:4). By any natural standard, Jesus was illigitimate—her husband did not impregnate Mary so Jesus was not the son of her husband. He was therefore not a son of David as the genealogies seek to sh ow. Nor was Jesus a son of David because he himself, according to the synoptic gospels, deni ed it. If Paul was right in saying, “Christ was descended from David according to the flesh”, Christians have to conclude he meant Mary’s flesh so as not deny the miraculous birth. Then the gene alogies of Joseph are spurious and superfluous. Joseph is unnecessary to the story, and Mark did not mention him at all. But Christians like the idea of a Davidic descent of Jesus, and believe it, even though God as the Son denied it. The Myth of the Virgin Birth Mankind will not emulate extraordin ary leaders but instead fall to their knees, adore and worship them. Rather than follow a difficult example it is easier to deify the exem plar thus providing an excuse for not emulating him—“How can mere me n do what gods can do?” This inclination to worship Jesus as a god rather than follow hi m as a man stems from the earliest days of Christianity. Christians take the belief that Jesu s was “son of God” to mean he was divine. Proof is his Virgin Birth, a myth found from end to end of the Hellenis tic world. Divine heroes were not the product of human fathers. Their mothers were impregnated as virgins by the god in some supernatural way."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"If our ideas about the dates of the gospels are correct, within 60 years of the crucifixion, Jesus’s adoring followers had created the myth of the conception of Jesus by the Holy Ghost making him at least half a god from the start. He thus b ecame an impossible role model for merely mortal men. Yet even the half of him that was human passed on by his mother was too much for the adorers—they wanted a fully fl edged god. After centuries as a tolerated heresy, in 1854 the doctrine of “The Immaculate Conception of the Mother of God” was adopted by the Roman Church. It made Mother Mary in to another perfect being, free of original sin, like Jesus. From her own birth date she was incapable of sin throu ghout her life. She was defined as a sinless mate for God Almighty to conceive a divine son. Jesus as a fine example of principled and dedicated manhood had been usurped by the adorers and worshippers. Nothing certain is known about Jesus’s bi rth, childhood and early manhood. Indeed, few doctrines of the Christian faith are so slight in their foundations as that of the Virgin Birth of Jesus. The virgin birth was not attested early in Christianity. Mark, John and Paul never mention a special birth, Paul even denying it explicitly, as if he had heard the rumour and wanted it scotching. The earliest Christian writings are Paul’s epistles, and no mention is made of the Virgin Birth in them. Paul could not be more exp licit in recording that Jesus was “of the seed of David according to the flesh” ( Rom 1:3) as if he were refuting the suggestion. He insists that Jesus was “born of a woman under the law” ( Gal 4:4) but he does not know, or apparently care, who she was and he knows of no miracle in the conception. For Paul, Jesu s was the Son of God through the “Spirit of Holiness” which did not require a supern atural conception. Mark and the last gospel, John , have no narratives of Jesus’s bi rth and upbringing. The gospel of Mark is the next writing chronolog ically after the epistl es. We have no proof it existed within forty years of the death of Christ yet it is ignor ant of the tremendous miracl e of the Virgin Birth. Both Mark and John begin the history with Jesus heralded and baptized by John the Baptist at the age of thirty. The original Mark was a description of the active career a nd death of a Jewish leader, appointed by John in his early manhood. The implication of the omission of the birth storie s from the final gospel might be that its author did not accept them. Since they were also omitted from the first gospel, either Mark did not know about them or he also did not accept them . These observations alone seem sufficient to treat them with distrust. The wonderful story of the birth of Jesus does not publicly appear until at l east a century after the event. What would an historian make of a le gend about the birth of Napoleon which did not appear until a hundred year s after he was born? Indeed, no church father cites the birth narratives as we now know them until Irenaeus in 177 AD. The early church could not consider the mother of God having a sexual relationshi p with any man lest doubt be cas t upon Jesus’s title as Son of God. So it suited the church fathers to compose the birth narratives and justify them from the “prophecy” they found in Isaiah . Joseph and Mary Mark and Paul never mention Joseph, and no r does Matthew when th e birth narrative is excluded. Contrast Mark 6:1-3 with the parallel Matthew 13:53-55, written about 25 years later."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"In Mark , Jesus is the carpenter, and hi s father is not mentioned. In Matthew , Jesus is the son of the carpenter. Mark has nothing certain to suggest the nuclear family of the birth narratives. The Jewish custom was to associate a son with his father’s name not his mother’s. Joshua ben Miriam is absurd and insulting, implying precisely what early critics claimed—Jesus was illegitimately born. To speak of someone as the son of Mary is to imply he has no father. Elsewhere in the New Testament , Jesus is the son of Joseph, a contradiction of the birth narratives, unless Jesus was adopted. More likely is that Jesus was a son of Judas, meaning Judas of Galilee. Jesus might have been a natural son of Judas, but he could have been called a son of Judas in the sense that he was a follower—he was a member of the Galilean bandits founded by Judas. This tradition would have had to be droppe d like a hot cake, as soon as it began to emerge, and evidently it was too hot to me ntion in the earliest gospel, Mark , though no alternative had been substituted. To get rid of the accusations th at Jesus was a son of Judas of Galilee, later gospels made Jesus the son of Joseph, and Judas was the name given to Jesus’s “betrayer” to complete the revision. Joseph is therefore fictional. In Matthew 1:19, Joseph is called a “just man” which is code for an Essene. Joseph was chosen as the name of the fa ther of Jesus as a sop to the Samaritans who were amongst the first Nazarene converts. Samari tans lived in what was the Northern Kingdom of the two Jewish kingdoms where the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, descended from the Joseph of the Torah, had settled in legend. Samarita ns thought of themselves as “sons of Joseph”. Jesus was therefore given a father with the na me Joseph so that the messiah was a “son of Joseph” in line with their expect ations. Further proof is that Matthew tells us Joseph’s father is Jacob, just as the father of th e scriptural Joseph was Jacob. Mary the Virgin is central to the gospel narrative onl y in the birth stories in the early chapters of Matthew and Luke . Elsewhere, she travelled to Jerusalem when Jesus was twelve ( Lk 2:41-52), she urges Jesus to change water into wi ne at a mysterious wedding at Cana ( Jn 2:1-12), she is snubbed by Jesus ( Mk 3:31-35; Mt 12:46-50; Lk 18:19-20; 11:27-29), her neighbours at Nazareth have little respect for him ( Mk 6:1-6; Mt 13:53-58), she is present at the crucifixion where Jesus entrusts her well being to John, according to John ( Jn 19:25-27), and finally she appears, in Acts 1:14, at prayer with the apostles. It is not a lot to build a historical picture of her, especially when she is unique in history if not in mythology, as parthenogenesis has never been attest ed in human beings, or even vertebrates, yet miraculous births were common in the clas sical myths for both gods and outstanding men. Mary was certainly called “The Virgin” from the time of Matthew and Luke , around the end of the first century, and Mary could really have been a virgin. If she were a sister in the women’s branch of the Essene sect, akin to the female Th erapeutae, she would have been chaste by choice, just as the male Essenes were, and many a pious Christian nun. She could not then have been a natural mother, but she could still have been a ritual mother. Catholic priests call themselves “Father” and nuns still call themselves “mothe r”, even though they are lifelong virgins. "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Christians automatically reject any notion that their superstition did not begin with the man described in the gospels, even though much of the terminology seems to have been already established before Christ. Mary wa s a type of nun. She officiated as a ritual mother at a rebirth ritual, part of the rights of passa ge of any Essene, but being a ritu al mother did not relieve her of her virginity! The apologists will say that this is hypothetical, a nd so it is, but it is a better hypothesis than one that actually requires a virgin to give birth to a natural son while still remaining a virgin. In the two gospels with the birth stories, Joseph was betrothed to Mary. The implication is that she was too young to marry, yet Joseph is her husband ( Mt 1:19, although the words “to be” are inserted in some texts), a nd they seem married too in Luke 2:5. Apologists, lik e Geoffrey Ashe, once a devotee of Mary ( The Virgin ), claim betrothal was like marriage in practice—when the man took the girl into his house they were effectively married and sexual relations could begin. It is unlikely, and, though it doubtless happened, it was not proper. Even so, it was not true of Jo seph for Mary was already pregna nt when he supposedly took her for his wife ( Mt 1:20), meant to denote when she jo ined his household. He found she was pregnant and decided to divorce her, but the angel appeared and persuaded him otherwise. Apart from the angel, which solves the problem for believers but for no one else, Joseph had found his virgin bride to be pregnant when he took her in. There is only one honest in terpretation of this. Mary had allowed herself to be seduced as a minor. The fourth century Jewish work, Toledot Yeshu , the History of Jesus , explains that this was the case, though it is too late to be good evidence. What is closer to the events is that the same allegation was considered by Origen as a widespread rumour in the second century. That Christians had two quite different traditions of Mary and Joseph at the birth of Jesus gives us no confidence in the historicity of either. In the story that Jesus was illegitimate are three possibilities, and the absence of the story in several of the sour ces suggests other possibilities— Jesus had an utterly unremarkable birth, or he was an orphan brought up by a home for destitute boys and girls. The Essenes took in such children. The Essenes in the Scrolls called themselves the Poor or the Ebionim, and early forms of Jewish Christianity had the same name. The more Jewish of the Ebionite sect s of the second century rejected Paul, and the miraculous birth stories. They saw Jesus as a prophet who would return in glory, but had been born as a normal man. Apologi sts say they were just anti-Paul but Paul advocated no miraculous birth either. Paul’s ep istles prove that the first Christian missionary made no use of the supposed miraculous birth of Christ! So, it seems no far-fetched inference that these Ebionim were in the tradition of the Jerusalem Church of James the Just. Their fathers were the first Jewish Christians. They were said to have used a Hebrew version of Matthew . Geoffrey Ashe, one who considers himself a careful historian, calls the Ebionite gospel “a censored text of Matthew in Hebrew”, inferring from it that the Ebionite s were a breakaway group of Chris tians rather than the original ones. Like most biblicists and pseudo-historians, he is careful to fill his book with footnotes, but gives no authority for this statement and the conclusion from it. It is simply his own assumption derived from his own belief in Christianity. It is mo re likely that the Hebrew Matthew was a"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Syriac sayings document, perhaps the one known to scholars as “ Q ”, a variation of which seems to have appeared as the Gospel of Thomas . The Christian Matthew was the Greek recension of this book amalgamated with Mark , the editor retaining the original authorship of the sayings work, Matthew . When the same procedure was followed elsewhere, the book was given a new name, whether the name of the editor or not, Luke . If this is so, then it confirms the hypothesis of the Ebionites as the earliest Christians, and enjoys the characteristic of plausibi lity, to use a favourite Christian criterion of truth. Ashe is as bogus a scholar when it comes to his beliefs as most other Christians. A reason he offers for disregarding the Ebionite evidence is that it is from outside the Church, an excellent reason for accepting it, the Church never having been noted for its honesty. Moreover, the Ebionites were outside the Church because Rome had expelled them as heretics. Bethlehem and Nazareth Matthew and Luke both have birth narratives but each has a different story. Matthew , the next gospel after Mark , seems in its original form to have known nothing unusual about the birth of Jesus. The first two chapters are an afterthought. The gospel really be gins, at the third chapter, in the same place as that of Mark . Then someone prefaced it with one of the two genealogies of Jesus that were in circulat ion (1:1-17). Next—the new be ginning is quite clear—somebody added a short account of how Jesus was born (1: 18-25). Lastly some other hand added the legends of Chapter 2. The Messiah wa s to be born in Bethlehem as the Old Testament is interpreted as saying: But thou, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though thou be lit tle among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me th at is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting. Micah 5:2"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Matthew renders this citation as: “And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, ar t not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, t hat shall rule my people Israel. Mt 2:6 Not much difference, you might think, but Ephrathah has been omitted and the prophecy has otherwise failed unless Jesus became, at some stage, the ruler of Israel. The significance of dropping “Ephrathah” is that , with it included, it is much clearer that a legendary son of Judah, Bethlehem Ephrathah ( 1 Chr 4:4), 123 of whose children supposedly returned with Zerubabel from exile ( Neh 7:26), is meant and not a to wn. In the quotation from Micah , “thousands” is more accurately translated as “houses” or “clans” as it is in the RSV, and Matthew actually gets it correct in referring to Bethlehem as a prince! Confirmation that the reference is to an aristocratic “father” and not a place is that the pronouns and adjectives applied to Bethlehem are masculine, whereas towns are uniformly feminine in Hebrew grammar. Since Jesus does not seem to be a member of the House of Bethlehem, Matthew has to pretend that the Bethlehem meant was the town. So, in Matthew , Jesus’s parents came from Bethlehem in Judæa but on returning from Egypt they settled in Nazareth in Galilee. Jesus was born at home in a house in Bethlehem. In Mark , Jesus is simply of Nazareth and Bethlehem is not mentioned. In Luke , the Holy Family lived in Nazareth and went to Bethlehem to be taxed, where Jesus was born in a stable. The Emperor A ugustus decreed that “all the worl d should be taxed”, and each man was to go, with his family, to the city of his fathers. This meant a journey of eighty miles for the poor carpenter and his pregnant wife, and since every family in Judæa had to get to the city of his ancestor of a thousand years earlier, Judæa must have presented a highly interesting spectacle. The most practical government of an cient times, the Roman, is supposed to have ordered this piece of lunacy, through the Governor Cyrenius (Quirinius). But we learn from the historian Josephus that what Cyrenius really di d was a much smaller matter, and that it was done in the year 6 AD, or ten years after the death of Herod. Moreover, northern Palestine was not under Cyrenius, but under the indepe ndent prince Herod Antipas and the Jews had so little in the way of tax-registers that in the year 66 AD they had to calculate the population from the number of paschal lambs. A papyrus discovered in Egypt in 1905 AD and now kept in the Bri tish Museum is an edict dated 104 AD of the Prefect of Egypt, Gaius Vibius Ma ximus, declaring that a census by households had begun and that everyone away from their normal ad ministrative district had to return to their own “hearths” to register, unless they had a sound reason for registering in a town because they had some essential function. Dishonest apologists te ll us that this is the same as moving to the district of their ancestors , just as it was supposed to have been in the bible narratives. The whole sense of it was that people who were working away from home had to return home to be counted unless they had some duty that could not be le ft unattended, when they could register their presence locally. In the bible, Joseph’s “hearth ” was supposedly established in Nazareth and he had no reason to go to Bethlehem, some notional ancestral region."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The birth arrived, and it was romantic, in the mange r of a stable, usually depicted as a cave. The cave at Bethlehem said to be the birthplace of Jesus was, the Christian father Jerome tells us, actually a rock shrine to the god Tammuz (A donis—Lord) whose symbol was a cross. The Christians took over a Pagan sacred site as th ey did many times over, and adopted the cave, a common symbol of Pagan religi ons. Apollo, Cybele, Demeter, Hercules, Hermes, Ion, Mithras and Poseidon were all adored in caves. Hermes and Dionysos were wrappe d in swaddling clothes and laid in mangers. By introducing the village of Bethlehem, Luke and Matthew connect Jesus as messiah with David the warrior king whose home town this wa s. There is nothing else in the gospels to associate Jesus with Bethlehem. In Luke 1:26 Nazareth is a city! But Nazareth was probably not even a village—it did not exist until Christianity became the official religion of the Empire in the fourth century AD when Helena, the mother of C onstantine, on pilgrimage to the Holy Land, was horrified to find Nazareth did not exist. She named an obscure si te in a suitable location Nazareth to fit the story. Neither Luke nor Matthew refer to the birth story again and i ndeed it contradicts the main story. Presumably his family or at least his mother w ould have been aware of all that feting by kings and shepherds, and glory in the heavens, and the reason for it all. Yet later they are continually puzzled and disappointed by Jesus’ s behaviour. And why bother tr ying to establish a divine conception when both refer to Joseph in the main na rrative as the father of Jesus. The Ebionites accepted Joseph as the natural father. Jesus himself never claimed to have been born mi raculously. He did not once allude to it, though it is hard to see w hy he should not have done to prove his divi nity if, as Christians claim, he was divine. The Virgin Birth was tacked on to Luke and Matthew , years after the event, to prove Jesus’s divinity. and to hype up th e new god. Yet now most Christians are outraged if its truth is questioned. The mystical Book of the Revelati on of John the Divine does not mention it, though it would be perfect for inclusion in such an allegorical piece. None of the Jewish patriarchs were born of virgins and, though older women beyond the menopaus e had their wombs “opened” to conceive Isaac, Jacob and Samuel, no divine impregnation was suggested. Line of David Saviours had to have royal blood to give them dignity, but they had to have a humble birth to allow them to be identif ied with the struggling masses. Their unpretentious birt hs in poverty in stables or caves were intended to make a virtue of abject conditions. Th e genealogy of saviours is not always given in their myths but certainly some other saviours besides Christ were descended from kings and began th eir life in humble circumstances to suggest the benefits of poverty and humility. "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Buddha is directly traced through a royal pedigree. His mother was betrothed to a rajah, and her son belonged to the same royal caste as Kris hna. The Prophet of Islam, Mohammed, began life humbly and, like Christ, had nowhe re to lay his head. A cloak sp read on the ground served him for a bed, and a skin filled with date leaves was his pillow. The genealogy of the God Yu of China is traced through a line of princes to a very remote origin, though Yu only became the most prominent Chinese God in popular culture from about 600 AD. His whol e life was a lesson of practical humility, and he proclaimed at every step the mantra of Christianity: This is the way. Walk ye in it. The dubious birth narratives of Matthew and Luke each include a genealogy that shows Joseph as the father of Jesus, and trace his lineage back to David, Abraham, and even Adam. The Jewish messiah was to be a son, mean ing a descendent, of David. The Old Testament predicted that the messiah was to be of “the seed of David” as the Pharisees are made to remind Jesus in the gospels. So the evangelists made Davidic gene alogies—which seems to have been unknown to Jesus when the Pharisees wanted his pedigree—for Joseph. Joseph was the father of Jesus except in one sense—he had not impregnated his wife! The virgin birth narratives kick both these genealogies into touc h. The birth stories in the two gospels come from different source s and differ widely but both contra dict their central thesis that Jesus’s mother was a virgin by giving a gen ealogy to show that Joseph was descended from David, an irrelevancy if Joseph had not impregnate d his wife. The original idea was obviously to trace Jesus’s lineage through Joseph to David to fulfil messianic prophecy. Then the idea of making Jesus more divine through a virgin birth arose and was tacked on spoiling the object of the genealogy. Then they could no longer serve their purpose of showing Jesus as descended from David. That is no problem to Christians, keen to find the most ingenious ways of upholding what they call the “Truth”, a nd simultaneously proving that, for God, all things are possible. The editors of both gospels see the problem and tr y to avoid it. For Christians, the line of Mary was sufficient for the Davidic descent, so that both Joseph and Mary were in the line of David. QED! To establish this, though, a cacophany of unlikely things have to be ye lled out, and direct evidence such as the Syriac Matthew found in 1892 has to be ignored. This work, confirmed by an ancient citation of it, states unequivocally that “Joseph begat Jesus who is called Christ”, though Mary is mentioned as the betrothed of Joseph. Thomas Boslooper ( The Virgin Birth ) notes that another Syriac text, describing th e appearance of the angel to Joseph, has it announcing, “She shall bear to thee a son”. In Luke , it was done by inserting “as people thought” to show Jesus was not really Joseph’s son and in Matthew by slyly separating Joseph from his son by inserting, after Joseph, “the husband of Mary, of whom was begotten Jesu s”. The genealogies of Joseph in Matthew and Luke ( Matthew 1:2-17 and Luke 3:23-38) give Joseph different fathers. Did the gospel writers intend to show that Jesus was so remarkable that, not only was God his father but he had two mortal fathers as well, because the two Josephs must ha ve been different men having, in the male line, different grandfathers?"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Christian commentators try to suggest the two genealogies are not both of Joseph. That in Luke is really Mary’s, even though L uke says it is Joseph’s ( Luke 3:23), and Jesus was of the house of David through his mother’s lineage. But if the in tention was to imply th at Mary was begetting Jesus then the person inserting the story was eith er ignorant or depended on the ignorance of his readers, for only men could beget according to Jewish convention. In the Syriac Matthew, “Joseph begat Jesus”. Fertilisation of the ovum by the sperm was onl y discovered in the nineteenth century. Though Genesis 3:15 refers to the seed of the woman, implyi ng that the Jews knew about eggs carried by women. Perhaps some did, but not average peopl e. Jews, like the Greeks, thought the whole human being was present in miniature in the male sperm. The woman was simply the soil for the seed to grow. They wrote of a woman who had no ch ildren as a spent field, as infertile or barren. This idea was carried into Christian Europe and held until the Middle ag es. Christians had no idea that women had their own seed. This is why Mary nor any other woman could participate in a genealogy. Matthew’s inclusion of four women in his genealogi es was for other reasons and their presence would have highlighted them to an educated Jew. The reason Christians believe Jesus was in the lin e of David has little to do with any evidence that he really was the heir to the throne. Though the Jews were assiduous keepers of genealogical tables to enable them to prove their nobility, we have to believe that they kept these records accurately for over a thousand years, through the disruptions of multiple conquests, loss of the leading classes in exile and so on. The habit proba bly stems, as most things Jewish really do, from the “return” from “exile”. Th e colonists were keen to establish themselves as the true Israel, and quite different from the locals. They th erefore set up their right to the priesthood on hereditary grounds and, at some stage claimed descent from Aaron and Zadok who had become legendary. Thereafter, they freely al tered the record to according to the political circumstances. In 1000 years at a reproductive rate of a genera tion every 25 years there could have been a million million descendants of David, even if eac h family had only two surviving children. In a small country, these descendants were interbre eding considerably, impying that everyone in Palestine, except for the most r ecent immigrants, must have ha d some of the blood of David coursing in their veins. Almost everyone coul d have traced their lineage to David, given the genealogical tables. Jesus must have had some Davidic blood, had his great ancestor existed, but it is most unlikely that he could have proved he wa s heir to the throne. He was a waif taken in by the Essenes according to their custom. An excellent reason for him to have been left with them by his mother is that he was illigitimate. Jesus could not have been first in line to the thro ne of David, even if the order of precedence was known. Christians admit that by any natural standard, Jesus was illigitimate—her husband did not impregnate Mary and Jesus was not the son of her husband. He was therefore not a son of David whether he was the son of God or the comm on bastard of a Roman soldier. It is certain that Jesus was not a son of David because Jesus himself, according to the synoptic gospels denies it. In Mark 12:35-37 and parallel passages at Matthew 22:42 and Luke 20:41, Jesus pointedly explains that the messiah could not be the son of David."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Jesus’s proof that the messiah wa s not a son or of the line of ki ng David satisfied the attendant crowd.

The only reason he could have ha d for making such a repl y was that everyone knew he could not fulfil the Davidic crit erion of messiahship. Jesus was not a claimant to the throne of Israel by lineage. He was a star, a man whose destiny it was. Son of David was a position to be attained or granted by God not one that came by birth. Mark can have had no reason for including any passage in which Jesus seems to deny what the church already accepted unless it was genuine tr adition and he felt obliged to put it in this particular spot, and the authors of both Matthew and Luke felt obliged to copy it. Since in Mark , Jesus refutes the idea that he is the son of David, he had no need to provide genealogies that contradicted this teaching of the Christian Christ. The authors of Matthew and Luke reproduced the same refutation of Jesus’s descent from David without noticing that they had done their best to prove it earlier. It is that Hopeless Ghost asleep on the jo b again. So, though the genealogies were unnecessary from Jesus’s own teaching and fr om the imposition of God as the actual father, they remained in the gospels. The Davidic descent was a myth the Christians liked. Ask any Christian whether Jesus was a son of Davi d, meaning a descendant of the ancient Jewish king, and they will ready assent that he was. Ignatius (c 100 AD) writing respectively to the Ephesians and to the Trallians th at Jesus Christ was conceived by Mary of the seed of David and of the spirit of God and was truly born. Either Mary was of the seed of David or the Holy Ghost was but Joseph was not involved. The apocryphal gospe ls and Justin Martyr had the same view. How is the view of these early Christians compa tible with Jesus’s own refutation of it in the synoptic gospels. Nobody denies that Mark’s gospel at least must have been written by the time of Ignatius, and Matthew and Mark were also in circulation by the time of Justin. So, it seems that the correct tradition in Mark was overlaid by the romantic n ecessity of having a messiah with proper Davidic credentials. Th ese were provided by the genealogi es in the early editions of Matthew and Luke but then the birth narratives were adde d. The truth that Jesus was illigitimate therefore is rejected in the genealogies then re-admitted in the birth narratives in the Greek convention of having a demi-god conceived by a God. Why then do Christians think that Jesus was the son of David. Since both Matthew and Luke refute their own assertion that Je sus was the son of David by putting in birth stories that show he was not, the idea that Jesus was the son of David must have been an early misconception. It is not surprising. It was the messian ic preconception that the messiah was the son of David, and it was the old tradition rather th an the truth which prevailed. In Mark , Jesus refuted the idea and, in this gospel, it only reappeared when blind Bartimaeus addressed Jesus as the Nazarenes were leavin g Jericho. Luke accepted these as the only two instances but nevertheless includ ed a genealogy which purported to prove that Jesus was a son of David. Matthew did the same, and although he menti oned “son of David” ten times, it is mainly as the title chosen by unclean spirits or the blin d in addressing Jesus. Jesus did not want to be seen as a messiah in case the auth orities should get to know, so hi s disciples had instructions to silence anyone addressing Je sus with a messianic title."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Once Jesus was accepted as the Messiah, he was gi ven messianic features whether he had them in reality or not. The acceptance of Jesus as a son of David by th e church was one of the first pious sins of omission of the bi shops. Not the apostles, though. Revelation and Acts do not state that Jesus was a son of David. Nor, interestingly enough does John which otherwise was keen on building up the legendary aspects of Jesus Christ. Indeed in John 7:41-44 the dispute among the multitude about the messiah coming from Galilee inst ead of Bethlehem and of the seed of David refutes both the Davidic origin of Jesus and th e myth created by Matthe w that he was born in Bethlehem. The only epistles of the apos tles to speak of it are Romans 1:3 and 2 Timothy 2:8 where Paul pointedly admits it was his gospel not the gospel. Paul of course, kne w of no miraculous births categorically saying in Galatians 4:4 as if to refute any contra ry suggestion that Jesus was “born of a woman under the law” (in short, legitimat ely). Paul, knowing nothing else, was ready to accept messianic convention—the messiah was the s on of David. We must conclude that Paul, who knew hardly anything of the real circumstances of the life of Jesus, spread his own gospel that Jesus was of the line of David. The Genealogies Christians are even able to hold to the truth of both genealogies and the virgin birth, yet quite apart from the difficulties with believing a virgin birth, the gospel genealogi es differ widely with each other and contradict the Old Testament . If Paul was right in saying, “Christ was descended from David according to the flesh”, Christians have to conclude he meant Mary’s flesh so as not deny the miraculous birth. If Jews allowed a descent via the mother, then the genealogies of Joseph are spurious and superflu ous. Joseph is unnecessary to the story, and Mark did not mention him at all. Luke, in his gospel, names forty-one genera tions from David, to Joseph, though he had previously represented it as being forty-two. Matthew says that from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, but according to his own list there are only th irteen. Then he tells us there are fourteen generations from Davi d to the exile but, according to 1 Chronicles 3, there were eighteen. And the name s in the lists of Matthew and Luke are so widely differe nt from that found in Chronicles as to defy all logic. From David to Joseph, the two lists only agree twice, the names of Salathiel and Zerubabe l alone agree in both lists. Matthew tells us that the son of David, from whom Joseph des cended, was Solomon, but Luke says it was Nathan. The next name in Matthew’s list is that of Rehoboam, but the corresponding name in Luke’s list is Mattatha. Matthew’s next name is Abijah, which Luke gives as Menna, while Chronicles supports Matthew and gives it as Abijah. Matthew says Joram begat Uzziah, but Chronicles virtually declares Joram had no such son, although he had a great-great-grandson Uzziah. But Luke says, in effect, there was no su ch person in the genealogical tree, or family line, as either Joram or Uzziah. "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Matthew says Josiah bega t Jechoniah and his brethren, about th e time they were carried away to Babylon. But Chronicles declares that Jechoniah was Jehoiak im’s son, and not Josiah’s, and that Josiah had no such son. We also learn, from 2 Kings 13, that Josiah was killed eleven years before the exile to Babylon, and could not well be get a son after he had been dead a decade. Matthew, after naming twenty-four generations as fillin g out the line, and making it complete between David and Jacob, concludes with his a nd “Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary”. Luke, besides making his list four teen generations more than Ma tthew’s, declares that Joseph was the son of Heli. So that Joseph either had two fathers, Jacob and Heli, or Matthew or Luke , or both, were glaringly wrong, with all their inspiration by th e Holy Ghost. One Christian answer—their excuse for the ineptitude of the Holy Ghost—is that Joseph’s mother married twice, and one line is through Jose ph’s natural father, Jacob, while the other is through his step father, Heli. We have to believe, therefore, that a stepfather can “beget” a stepson, and Christians assure us he can. What is true of Joseph is true of Jesus, so that Joseph, merely Jesus’s stepfather, could beget Jesus. Again, Luke says that Salathiel was the son of Neri, but Chronicles says he was the son of Jechoniah. And after Chronicles had registered Zerubabe l as the son of Penniah, Matthew and Luke both declare that he was the son of Sala thiel. They agree here in contradicting Chronicles , which is the only instance but one of their agreem ent in the whole list of progenitors from David to Joseph. With this exception they contradict each other all the way through, and in many instances that of Chronicles , too. Such is the harmony in the words of divine inspiration which Christians admire so much. Pious liars need gullible believers. Because Christians liked the idea of a Davidic descen t, they had to try to e xplain it in the light of the Virgin Birth, and for long they argued that Luke ’s was the genealogy of Mary, Heli being her father, Joseph being Heli’s son-in-law, not his son. We must accept that Jews saw no need to distinguish a son from a son-in-l aw since Heli is de scribed as begetting Joseph, not Mary. The author of the genealogy was conscious that Jewi sh women did not beget, and to make her seem to do so would have declared Je sus as fatherless—a bastard. Luke’s genealogy appear s in an odd place ( Lk 3.23), when Jesus begins his ministry at 30 years of age not at his birth, but the birth narrative of the first two chapters of Luke is in a style and language distinctive from the rest of Luke . It is Greek with a str ong flavour of Hebrew as opposed to the normal Greek of the rest. It is as if someone today delibera tely wrote in biblical English. Theologians claim it is a deliberate sty listic device to give continuity with the Old Testament . However, the elaborate dating given in Luke at the start of Jesus’s ministry ( Lk 3:1) suggests that the original gospel started here and the birth narrative in its peculiar style was added. The genealogy therefore originally came near the start of the gospel, where it would be expected, but associated with Jesus’s baptism on his thirtieth birthday. It show s that Jesus was a king after the fashion of the Pharaohs who were reborn at their thirtieth birthday and, indeed, Essene practice was to consider people mature only at their thirtieth birthday. The Damascus Rule says that the Essenes kept lists of the “Sons of Zadok, the el ect of Israel, according to their generations”. These lists will have offered a source for the genealogies of Matthew and Luke ."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Luke’s genealogy gives Adam as “the son of God” making all men sons or descendants of God, though he missed out the word “son” in each case except the first, as if to s uggest they were not literally “sons of”. Adam was made of the dust of the earth, and the gos pels recognise that God had the power to raise sons from stones. Why th en did God have to make his redeeming son by impregnating a human woman supernaturally, like the Greek gods? Christians might respond that the saviour had to have a human mother to be human but the Virgin is now a goddess, herself immaculately conceived, so how is she human? Th e gradual accumulation of pious lies has led in Christianity to absurd contradictions like thes e, yet Christian punters are never detered by the irrational. Mary In Luke , Mary and Elizabeth and Zacharias had rema rkable experiences but kept them such a dead secret that Paul and Mark never heard of them! Pious liars always come up with plausible explanations of these anomalies and satisfy the alarm of some of the faithful who were beginning to look a little askance. Now, Ch ristianity is such a tissue of lies from end to end, believers believe it because it looks so implausible! A priest named Zacharias had a barren wife, and “an angel of the Lord” appeared and told him that his wife would have a son. This son is to be “great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink”, and then the angel went and said much the same to Mary, except that her son was to be fatherless. Now, clerics avoid bringing to the notice of thei r readers another passage of the bible, referring to the birth of Samson: And there was a certain man of Zorah... and his wife was barre n and bare not. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman, and said unto her: Behold, now thou art barren, and bearest not, but thou shalt conceive and bear a son. Now, therefore, beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong dr ink, and eat not any unclean thing; For, lo, thou shalt conceive and bear a son, and no razo r shall come on his head, for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb. Judges 13:2-6"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Familiar? The angel tells Mary that she will conceive. As she is engaged to be married, this should not be a startling announcement but Mary is troubled and expostulates that she “knows no man”. Mary might have been a little deaf or simple, a nd misunderstood him to sa y that she had already conceived, but the oldest Latin manuscript of Luke has not the words, “How can this be? I know no man”. Has somebody, later, in terpolated the words? An a pocryphal gospel of the second century, considered below, describes Mary as vow ed to virginity for life, not engaged to Joseph, and such virgins sometimes observe their vows. It would suggest that the virgin Mary was a type of nun, a female Nazarite consecrated to G od, and had a ritual role as a mother. There were more miracles and “t hese things were noised abroad through all the hi ll country of Judæa”, by the shepherds as you would expect, and created an enormous sensation, but everybody forgot in a few years. The incarnate God submitted to the delicate operation known as circumcision and there were more miracles. Yet, when this wonderful bei ng, at the age of twelve, showed signs of precocious wisdom, his father a nd mother “were amazed” (2:48) and apparently as irritated as parents of any naughty boy would be. The story in Luke of the boy Jesus remaining in the temp le when his parents spent three days looking for him contains no elements of Nazarene tradition, except that Jesus might have been intensively coached by the Essene priesthood. No Jewish boy would have been so rude to his parents as to say: “Why are you looking fo r me? You ought to know I’d be about God’s business!” Such lack of respect for parents, th en or now, is quite un-Jewish. Since Mary and Joseph did not understand this repl y, the circus of the nativity must have been nonsense. The composition of this brief episode preceded the nativ ity as the use of the word “parents” shows. So, despite kings, gifts, shephe rds, heavenly hosts, precocious intellect and what have you, Jesus’s mother later on did not know her son had been designated a king. An editor of Luke in 2:19 and 2:51 acknowledges the problem, pretending th at Mary kept it to herself. Apparently everybody else forgot all about it all too, and the secret was onl y let out a hundred years later. Matthew goes so far as to make Mary and her sons think of putting Jesus under restraint as a madman! So Mary definitely had fo rgotten it all for the duration of th e rest of the gospel stories. The final verse ( Lk 2:52) of this section indicates that Jesus was himself a Nazarite—he was “in favour with God”, a scribal formula meaning he had been consecrated to God, which was why he was being coached by sages.

Birth Narratives II © Dr M D Magee Contents Updated: Sunday, July 04, 1999 Monday, 05 April 2004 • Prophecy of a Virgin • Pantheras • Virgin Mothers • Perpetual Virginity and the Holy Family • Mary, Joseph and the Holy Family • A Brotherhood? Abstract The virgin birth narratives spoiled the purpose of the genealogies, so must have been needed. It was because Jesus had been ca lled Ben Pandera, Son of the P anther, a black man. A virgin (Greek, parthenos) birth explained the rumour that Jesus was a bastard. Pandera was a slur on the word parthenos, Christians said. But Pagan demi -gods were often sons of virgins, so the pun is an unlikely invention of Pagans, though not th e opposite. Even normal birth by the impure route was too ignominious for th e Christian Son. It had to be spotless, or immaculate, and the mother had to remain a virgin. So, Christians quickl y took Mary to be as intact as a pious nun, a perpetual virgin like Pagan goddesses, even after Jesus had been born. Yet Luke describes Jesus as Mary’s first-born, and all the gospels mention brothers of Jes us and sisters too. Prophecy of a Virgin An attempt was made, in Matthew 1:22-23, to justify the virgin birth story by referring to Isaiah 7:14 where is written: “Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel. Though Matthew interprets this as a messianic prophecy it is not—it is part of a warning Isaiah is giving regarding events of that time—and i ndeed it is absurd even in the gospel because Matthew’s angel has just directed Joseph to call the child “Jesus”, not “Immanuel!” Nevertheless, Matthew’s reading of it as a messia nic prophecy is the sort of thing that Essene pesharists did. Matthew even uses the pesharist’s formula, “w hich being interpreted is”. In their books of commentaries, Essenes would take parts of the scriptures and rein terpret them in ways"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"that suited them. That Christians freely did th e same indicates their common roots—and they still happily call Jesus “Immanuel” thou gh that was never his name. The word translated “virgin” employed in the Greek version of the Jewish scriptures was “ parthenos ”, but a reference to the origin al Hebrew yields the word “ almah ”. Both “ parthenos ” and “ almah ” did not necessarily mean a virgin as we understand it, a woman who had never had intercourse. In Greek, it could mean youth, the state of unmarriage, or even a person who is first married. In Hebrew, it could mea n, beside the usual meaning, an immature girl who could not conceive because she had not ye t started to menstruate. The Hebrew word for “virgin” is “ bethulah ” and would surely have been used in Isaiah if “virgin” was the meaning the author intended. Young girls were betrothed to thei r future husbands until they coul d legally marry at the age of twelve and a half—menstruation usually starte d later. A married virgin could therefore conceive—in Joel 1:8 a virgin’s husband is mentioned. Mary was described as betrothed to Joseph implying that she was a minor under the ag e of twelve and a half—Joseph might have broken the law by having sex with a minor, and pr etended he was surprise d at the outcome to protect himself. Matthew 1:25 is at pains to refute any such thought by stating that Joseph “knew her not” till she brought forth her first born s on—the euphemism “knowing her” meaning having sex with her. In any event, the virgin Mary c ould have given birth with no miracle involved. The idea of a virgin as a premenstrual girl allows her to have children and still be a virgin. If she were to conceive from her very first ovulation, she would not ha ve menstruated but would be a mother and still a virgin . If she conceived at th e first ovulation after th e birth, she could be a virgin mother of two children of different ages. Since Jewish girls often married before menstruation, “virgin” mothers were not unusual, explaining the case in Joel 1:8. Mary was a minor who could become Joseph’s wife when she r eached the age of twelve and a half. Thus the “virgin” Mary could have given birth. If she did, the truth was misunderstood in the ge ntile world of the Roman Empire, and indeed beyond, where it was de rigeur not only for gods but also great men to be born of virgins. Ra, Hatshepsut, Amenophis III, Cyrus the Great, Julius Caesar, Pythagoras, Alexander, Augustus and others, were thought to have been born miracu lously. Plato was born of Paretonia, begotten of Apollo, not Ariston, his father , according to one authority. Pers eus, Apollonius of Tyana, Fu- Hsi, Lao Kium, Zoroaster and Attis all came of virgin mothers according to their believers. Pantheras The earliest gospel written, Mark , has nothing to say about Je sus’s father. Though Jesus is described as a carpenter, his fath er is nowhere mentioned either as the carpenter or as Joseph. This suggests that, in the earliest tradition, Jesus was a waif or a foundling. The earliest refutation of Jesus is that he was the illigitimate son of a Roman soldier called Pantheras. The name Pantheras was found among Roman soldiers. "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Was Christ Black? Several saviours are sometimes shown as being black, including Jesus Christ. There is more common sense evidence that the Christian saviour wa s black or dark skinned, than there is of his being the son of a virgin. Though the gospel writ ers say nothing about Je sus’s appearance, his earliest disciples obviously knew. In the pictures and portraits of Jesus by the early Christians, his complexion is black, but care is taken to show his lips as red, suggesting realism rather than an odd convention. Solomon’s declaration in the Song of Songs, “I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem” ( Song 1:5), has always been taken to mean Christ, a curious belief unless it stems from a very ancient tradi tion perhaps going back to Jesus himself. If the belief of the Christians were to come true and Jesus were to return at his second coming as a black man, how would he be received by negr o-hating Christians? Would they bow their knee to a black god, asking forgiveness for the grave error of their racialis t ways? Or would they decide that he was an impos ter and crucify him afresh? According to Origen (185-254 AD) in Contra Celsum , the Pagan philosopher Celsus, who was famous for his arguments against Christianity, cl aimed in 178 AD that he had heard from a Jew that Jesus’s mother, Mary, had been divorced by her husband, a ca rpenter, after it had been proved that she was an adultress. She wandered about in shame and bore Jesus in secret. His real father was a soldier named Pantheras, possibl y a Moor to judge by the name. Tertullian, in 198 AD, quoted the Toldot Yeshu , where Jesus is several times called Ben Pandera to the same effect. So, Jesus was the son of the Panther, ben Pandera, and so he was known from an early time by the Jews. In the Jewish material, besides Ben Pandera, Jesus is called Ben Stada. In one story, this is a besmirching na me of Mary, from a pun on “stada” as meaning a woman who has rejected her husband. Interestingly, this Mary is called a braider or hairdresser, implying a meaning of “magdalene”. Christians always argue that this is an attempt to denigrate (oop s) Jesus because “son of a virgin” is “huios parthenou”, in Greek, and “huios pantherou” (son of a panther) is a plain enough pun on it. The presence of the name, Ben Pandera, in the Jewish writings shows that the rumour probably began in Palestine, ye t Pandera is not a pun on the Hebrew or Aramaic words for a virgin, so it arose among Greek sp eakers. If the excuse is true, some Greek speaking Jews must have been laughing at the Chri stian birth story by punning on the word “par thenou” to get the name “Pandera”. Equally, however, the stories of the virgin birth could be a way of trying to explain that Jesus was called Ben Pandera. There was nothing unusual in Paganism about demi-gods being born of virgins, so there seems no obvious reason why the pun should have been invented by Pagans, but that it should have been used by gentile Christians to defend their new god against a true but undesirable rumour seems quite likely. Which is th e chicken and which the egg is not evident, but since Matthew all but admits th e truth writing about 100 AD, it is rather more likely that the virgin birth narratives were invent ed to dispel the rumour that Jesus was the bastard son of one Pantheras than that Pantheras was invented to denigrate the birth stories. There must have been a pressing need for them because they spoiled th e purpose of the genealogies. With a convenient interpretation of Isaiah 7:14 as a messianic text, though it pl ainly is not, Matthew was able to justify his invention. Luke’s versio n is also aimed at refuting the same rumour, so that when an"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"angel appears to Mary to say she will conceive, she immediatel y replies, with no thought of Joseph to whom she was betrothed: How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? Luke 1:34 The gentile bishops came up w ith the ruse of ch anging the Greek name “Pantheros” to “parthenos”, the Greek word for virgin, to explain the defaming story of “the panther”. It is not a mistake that is easy to explain accidentally in Greek. Not only do the “n” and “r” interchange, but also the vowel “e” in Pantheros and Parthenos differ in the Greek. One is epsilon and the other eta. The bishops pretended the misunde rstanding was in Hebrew, the name “Pandera” being a Hebrew attempt at pronouncing—“part henos”—but problems remain, and the change still looks deliberate rather than accidental. Since the birth stories are accepted as late additions to the gospels, Jesus did not have the title, “Son of the Virgin”, until late in the second century of Christianit y, and the Pagan pun on the title could not have arisen before, unless it wa s not a pun but a genuine tradition. The tombstone of a soldier was found in Binge rbrück, Germany, inscribed: Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera of Sidon, aged 62, a so ldier of 40 years’ servi ce, of the first cohort of archers, lies here. The first two names are the obligatory Roman names he took when he was granted Roman citizenship. “Abdes” is his own Semitic birth name . “Pantera” is the personal or nick name his friends knew him as. Eventually, in typical fashion, the Christian bishops incorporated a Panthera into the holy family, as the father of Joseph, to have an excuse for the name. “Pantheras” (Greek, “panther”, “leopard”, whence “hunter”) was popular as a pe rsonal name of Macedonian soldiers in the armies of the Seleucids. Epiphanius (320-403 AD), with no evidence he was willing to quote, cites Origen as saying that “Pan ther” was the nickname for Jac ob (James) the father of Joseph. He took the name as an epithet giving him some dignity, thus explaining the name “Pandera”, but in that case, it implied that Jesus’s ancestr y was not Jewish but Macedonian. He was fair and red-headed, after all! Now you have to question the motives or efficien cy of God, or the Holy Ghost, one of whose tasks was to ensure the inspiration of the Holy Word. Why was all of this necessary? Why did God make the twelve year old Mary pregnant be fore she even got married? Or why did the Holy Ghost have to tell the story as if she had been impregnated as a minor, causing all the questions and doubt. She could have married Joseph normall y, and God could then have seen that the “Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee”, making her respectably pregnant by the Holy Ghost with out any knowledge of Jo seph or any impropriety to the outside world. It is not a question that Ch ristians are supposed to think about, but the need for it from the plain fact that the gi rl was illegally pr egnant is obvious."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The silence of the gospels over Mary’s condition cannot dispel the doubts about it any thinking person must have. The easy acceptance of the miracle does not gel with the harsh treatment the Jews meted out to promiscuous women, indeed, even victims of male lust . It tells against the Christian myth that this was a family. A Jewish husband would have been outraged, and notionally the adulterous woman could have been stoned to death. Had the girl been raped, then the rapist could have been stoned, but, as today, the suspicion fell upon the victim as encouraging the act. In practice, stoning under the Roman Peace was pr obably itself illegal, but the social attitude behind it must have remained strong, and it happened as a mob action. Where stoning was impossible, social rejection must have been th e usual rersponse. The Essenes had systems of fines and penances, leading to ul timate expulsion from the comm unity, so their attitude might have been more like that of Jesus in the instance in John , where he invited the guiltless to throw the first stone. The crime was dire and frowned upon, but could be dealt wi th less harshly than death. So, if the scandal is to be accepted as real, then the seduction of the maiden looks more compelling within an Essene community than in Judaism at large. The Essenes famously maintained their numbers by taking in those troubl ed by the vicissitudes of life, and what could have been more of a vicissitude than being born in scandalous circumstances? Since the perpetual virginity of mo ther Mary is absurd, what coul d have suggested it other than the need to hide a scandal. Apologists like Geoffrey Ashe ( The Virgin ) think this is “inadequate to inspire such a doctrine or secure general asse nt”. The story was invented a minimum of half a century later, among gentiles not Jews, in a c ountry distant from Palestine, and among bishops who had already secured themselves a followi ng among Godfearing gent iles and Hellenised Jews. Are we to imagine that believers, even then, would accept the scandalous truth when the bishops had a well prepared explanation? These be lievers, as they are today, are not called sheep for nothing. The lie was perfectly acceptable in a society that expected miracu lous conceptions and births of gods and demi-gods. Believers were happy that the new Christian demi-god, Jesus Christ, conformed. Ashe concedes “the logic of the son of God concept” wa s enough. The miraculous nature of the relationship betw een the god, his son and the chosen virgin was sufficient. These early believers noticed the parallels with the pr evious gods and demi-gods, and virgins that had given birth and remained virgins because they received the same titles and epithets as their illustrious predecessors. What right has a poor Jewi sh girl to the title Queen of Heaven? The simple fact is that Mary was not the first Queen of Heaven, nor was Jesus the first son of God. These honours were transferred from classical precedents. Ashe accepts that religious fiction was indeed writt en, but he cannot bring himself to believe that it was written from the outset over the basic even ts of Christian and Marian belief. But the ultimate truth could uphold the origin of the my thology as not being utter fiction, though at another cost. A suggestion on these pages is that the Essenes ha d various rituals that have not come fully to light, but can be hazily seen in the New Testamant and Christian practices. One was a rebirth ceremony, one a ritual wedding and one a ritual feeding, the precu rsor of the Eucharist. We"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"know there were women Essenes, because some Essenes married and the strictness of their practices would demand that they married wives of the same be liefs. We do not know that there were female celibates to match the male ones, but the graves of wo men have been found at Qumran, and the closely similar Therapeuts, desc ribed by Philo, had female celibates in the order. Moreover, women as well as men could be consecrated to God as N azarites. It seems most unlikely that there were no female Essenes, and to judge from the gospel ceremonies they served ritual roles. Mother Mary was one of these ce libate nuns and she served as the ritual mother of Jesus at his rebirth ceremony, a ritual probably associated with Baptism, as it still is. This Mary, therefore had an important relationship of a ceremonial ki nd with Jesus in the order, but she was not his natural mother, indeed could not have been be cause she was a chaste nun, but was his ritual mother. As a ritual mother, she could remain utterly virginal forever, while having a son. Equally, Jesus could have this r itual mother, but have no recognisable earthly father, but consider himself reborn of God. It is likely that all the Es senes considered themselves reborn as angels, at least from the age of thirty, and therefore directly sons of God. Barabbas was the ritual name of these born-again men. Virgin Mothers Thomas Boslooper, considering the assertion of many Christian critics that other religions had precedents for the miraculous birth of gods a nd demi-gods, is quoted by Ashe as saying: “It is difficult to find a statement in all the li terature of biblical criticism which is more misleading. There is no example so clear of the Christia n technique of argument. Come out with the devastating criticism whether it is true or not, and every Christian will automatically believe you. It is the Christian big-lie techni que. This “devastating” assertion is true only in the sense that no other miraculous birth precisely matches that of Christ. Few of them are known in more detail than a sentence or two, or a short account at best , so it is easy to claim—with Boslooper—that there are actually no precedents at all. It is a popular Christian apologetic ploy. What does not match in every detail does not match at all! What does match does not match in meaning or interpretation! The central point is that conception in classi cal mythology was often unusual. The details are irrelevant so long as the charac ter has an unusual introduction to the world that marks him out as special. The degree of restraint or flamboyance in the telling is a cultura l matter with no bearing on the peculiarity of the concep tion. Christianity began opposi ng sexuality as sinful, so no sexually prurient detail entered into the story, wh ereas the classical religions were more sexually honest. Christians now, after two millennia of indoctrination over sexuality, think the “tastefulness” of the Christian stories proves th em. No justification coul d be more circular! A man, even if he were thought of as a god, had to be born of a woman, and this could not be concealed, but paternal parentage is never so obvious, being known only to the mother, if anyone. The ancients felt that an offspring of a god, a son of god, should have a purer maternal"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"origin than mortals, and this was evidence of his supernatural or divine origin. So, the purity of his maternal parentage required the saviour to be born of a pure woman—a maiden. Hence, saviours often were born of virgin s. Pure, holy and chas te virgins, just like Mary, mother of Jesus, gave birth to gods, sons of god a nd saviours, but often long before her. The Christ had to be a man, so had to be bor n like a man, but with a father who was God. The age old magical conception was the best that c ould be invented given the constraints, but Luke is suggestive: The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and th e power of the Highest shall overshadow thee. Luke 2:35 Today people would rightly not believe a woman, however virtuous, giving birth to a child and saying she had not had sexua l intercourse. In an age of miracl es and ignorance of natural law, she was believed with credulity and many maidens claimed that gods fathered their sons. At one time it became so common in Greece that a decr ee made death the punishment of any woman insulting a god by charging him with fathering her child. The idea of miraculous birth goes back to anci ent myths that preceded any direct knowledge of how people were conceived. Birth seemed arb itrary, and primitive ideas of why conception happened involved natural phenomena like wind, s unlight, eating things, and seeing things, and it could be by touch, through the ear, the navel a nd the eyes. Moreover, in societies of extended families, the identity of the father was not know n until taboos, even in primitive societies meant that people sought partners outside the extended family. Another source of the myth was the practice of priests of deflowering virgins, or curing the barrenness of infertile matrons (often the impot ence of their husbands) by allowing the woman to sleep in a temple when a god might impregnate her. Details came from the woman’s dreams, because when the ploy was successful, the clues were in dreams, just as they were in the biblical stories. Like Freudian psychoanalysis, to dream of a snake or a swan was to dream of phallic symbols, and the child would be th at of any god symbolised in th e dream. Olympia, the wife of Philip of Macedon, conceived Alexander while she was sleeping in the temple of Apollo, where she was impregnated by Zeus in the form of a snake. How can a woman be impregnated by a snake or a swan, unless she too is in that fo rm? Ultimately, these are psychological matters, but careless young girls found them useful excuses for the consequences of their adolescent adventures. Christians might smile, but how is Mary different? A man, according to Luke , pretended to be an angel called Gabriel. He wa s charming and persuasive, and the young girl was naïve and innocent because she was only twelve. What is so impossible about this that Christians deny it, substituting something utterly unbelievable, that they then say is proof it is divine? In remote time, the virgin mother of Osiris claimed her son was begotten by the father of all gods. The likeness of this virgin mother, with the divine child in her arms, is commonly shown in old temples in Egypt. Scholars have said that th e worship of this virgin mother, with her God- begotten child, prevailed everywhere. Her son of God was shown in effigy, lying in a manger,"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"just as the infant Jesus was afterward at Bethle hem. The worship of this virgin mother and her god is of ancient date as is prove d by ancient sculptured figures. In their myths, virgin births were familiar to every Greek. Christians will complain that these virgin births were utterly unnatural, forgetting that all virgin births are! Herakles had a virgin birth. His mother Alcmene (Alcmena) was married, but had vowed to remain chaste until the death of her brothers had been avenged. Zeus had se lected her as the mother of a mortal hero he needed to help him win a battle against the giants. Alcmene was still a virgin [Comment] when Zeus impregnated her. Zeus’s heavenly spouse, Hera, was against the child and opposed him in every way she could. Eventually she promised Ze us that she would desi st if the young demi-god would achieve twelve great works. In the end, the wife of Herakles poisoned him, and he made a funeral pyre and got a shepherd to ignite it. A cloud came down from heaven, and the disciples of Herakles saw him rise from the summit of the pyre physically in the cloud to heaven. Hundreds of years later, the virgin-born Savi our from Nazareth was “taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight” from the summit of a hill ( Acts 1:9). According to Chinese mythology there were tw o beings—Tien-Chu and Shang-Ti—worshipped in that country as gods (Lords of Heaven) in the Chou dynasty more than twenty five hundred years ago, born of virgins who knew no man. Shang-Ti also was the father of the first emperor of the Chou dynasty, impreganting th e mortal woman when she ste pped on his footprint. Maia, mother of Buddha, Semele, mother of Dionysos , and Persephone, mother of Zagreus, Shing- Moo, mother of Fu-Hsi all had miraculous confinements and births, as did Io, called in Æschylus, the chaste virgin, whose son was the son of god. The Latin inscription “Partura Virginis” , “the virgin about to brin g forth”, has been found on Pagan temples in Celtic countries. Mayence was, it is said, the virgin-m other of the god-sired Esus of the Druids. In images more than two thousand years old, she is depicted enveloped in light, with a crown of twelve st ars upon her head, exactly the same as the apocalyptic figure of the Christian Book of Revelation . She is also shown with her f oot on the head of a serpent. Apologists say that the classical stories are not virgin births like Mary’s. Ashe declaims that “male sexuality is always present” in Pagan birth narratives. He knows it was not in the Christian case. Why? Because he believes it was not! That’s faith for you! The Virgin Birth of Christ was without sex, without physical agony. But why is he so certain Mary’s was? The origin al Pagan idea was that the mortal girl should have been a virgin before she c onceived, like Alcmene, not that she remained a virgin after she had given birth! Besides normal conception ordinary birth was al so too ignominious for a god. It had to be spotless, or immaculate. Jesus Christ in an apocryphal gospe l, like Krishna was born through his mother’s side, rather than the impure route. Though not in th e canonical works, some of the Christian fathers endorsed this story. And, in some cases, the mother, like the mother of Krishna, was still held to be a vi rgin, even after she had given bi rth to other chil dren—a greater miracle than the biblical version, though deprecated by Christians . Yet even this parallels Mary, who remained a virgin even though she had given bi rth to Jesus and his br others and sisters."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Christians, for no good reason, believe that Mary was perpetually a virgin, but again this is just like important Pagan goddesses. However, wh at goddesses can do, human women cannot. No woman can physically give birth while remaining a virgin—her hymen remaining intact—even if she had managed to conceive somehow while rema ining one. Even if a fatherless conception is possible, a birth in which the woman remains a vi rgin is not, unless we are to admit Caesarian sections, like Krishna’s, into the reckoning. If they are admitted, th en it is anothe r miracle that Mary survived what was possible but danger ous until recently, but such a birth was not miraculous. Because of the danger to the mother, the Romans usually permitted it only on dead women, to save the foetus in the last four weeks of a pregnancy. None of this is available for discussion among Christians. They know Mary was a perpetual virgin, and Pallas Athene was not, despite her myth. Many an cient goddesses were perpetual virgins such as Athene, Isis a nd Cybele. Apologists claim these are only myths or metaphors! when Philo speaks of “God-begotten children” and “virgin mothers”, apologi sts dismiss it too as metaphor. Could the whole of the Christian gospels be just meta phor? Askance looks of hatred and incomprehension. Ashe concedes that th e ancient goddesses were indeed virgins and mothers, but that is to “leave humanity behind ”, meaning they are myths about supernatural beings! There is some subtle difference between a Catholic praying to Mary and a Canaanite praying to Anath, so at least Ch ristians think, though what it is is impossible for the outside observer to see. In fact, it is differe nt for no other reason than that they believe it is. The doctrine of immaculate conception is anci ent but the manner of the holy conception was different in different countries. Fu-Hsi (Fo-hi), the legendary founder of China, was conceived when his mother ate a flower she found while ba thing. His gestation peri od was twelve years. His successor was also miraculously conceived. Christians will bleat that being conceived by eating a flower is not the same as being overshadow ed by the Holy Ghost. Quite so! It is utterly different in the detail, but the detail is not what is important in these stories. It is the theme of a miraculous—particularly fatherless—conception that is the same. It is without sex and without physical agony despite the enormous brain Fu-Hsi must have deve loped while twelve years in the womb."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" The ecstasy of S Theresa of Avila No Christian can admit it as equivalent, though, to the Christian birth stories. It is actually too miraculous. When Luke says “the Holy Ghos t shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee”, there is a broad hint of sexuality. Something “kind of” sexual happened! But a flower? Don’t be silly! When pushed on this “overshadowing”, the Christian apologist can retreat again. Whatever it implies, a spirit cannot enjoy normal sex with a material woman. But then neither can a flower. If these storie s were meant to be true in any sense, it could only have been that the desperate mother made some such excuse for her condition. Mary was penetrated in her excuse by the Holy Spirit, or the archangel Gabriel, if he is different. Gabriel is the messenger of God, so he equates with Herm es, the messenger of the Greek gods but who was also a phallic god. Gabriel therefore brought more th an messages to Mary. Perhaps, like saintly Christian nuns, she had fantasised it in her adol escent dreams. S Theresa of Avila dreamed she was penetrated by Christ. The mother of Fu-Hsi dreamed she had eaten a water lily. In reality, such stories meant she had dallied with a hum an seducer but was too young to understand what he was up to, what she had done , or what the risks were. Zoroaster was immaculately c onceived by a ray from the Divi ne Reason or Word. Herodotus also explained that such conceptions occurred by way of a ray of li ght and according to Plutarch’s book on Isis and Osiris it entered through the ear. Tertul lian confirms it was a ray of light. Thus medieval pictures of Mary at the moment of concepti on show a ray of light entering her ear. But the idea of being “overshadowed by the Holy Ghost” seems to have been most current. God, the father of a god was believe d to “overshadow” the mother of a god, to"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"impregnate her. In 550 BC, Pythia s, the mother of Pythagoras, c onceived by a spectr e or ghost of the god Apollo, the sun god. Does the ghost of the sun god differ in principle from the Christian Holy Ghost? A Chinese sect worshiped a saviour known as Xaca, who was conceived of his mother, Maia, by a white elephant, which she saw in her sleep, an d for greater purity, she brought him forth from one of her sides. Tamerlane’s mother conceive d having had sexual interc ourse with the god of Day. The mother of Ghengis Khan, being too modest to claim that she was the mother of the son of God, said only that he was the son of the sun. Juno of Rome also grew pregnant at the touch of a flower to give birth to Mars. No impregnation could have been purer. So the most immaculate con ception of all was that of the god of War! If it sounds absurd, how is it more senseless than conception by a ghost? Botany has shown that, at least, a flower can fertilise othe r flowers but no science has yet inve stigated the virility of ghosts. The Greek Juno, Hera, was immaculately impregnate d by the wind to give bi rth to Vulcan. Here is a close parallel indeed for the word habitually translated as spirit or ghost in the scriptures and continued into the Greek of the New Testament really means breath or wind! So literally the virgin Mary was impregnated by the wind just like Hera. Re garding the observations of G Higgins on Juno, Andreas Ardus writes by em ail to correct the citation, and offer the suggestions which follow: “The Goddess Februa, or Februata Juno, became the Purificata Virgo Maria. The old Romans celebrated this festival in precisely the same way as the moderns—by processions with wax lights, and so on, and on the same day, 2 February. The author of the Perennial Calendar observes, that it is a remarkable coincidence t hat the festival of the miraculous conception of Juno Jugalis, the blessed Vi rgin, the Queen of Heaven, should fall on the very same day the modern Romans have fi xed the festival of the conception of the blessed Virgin Mary. Be ing merely a continuation of an ancient festival, there is nothing remarkable in it. G Higgins, Anacalypsis Andreas Ardus also notes: “This festival of the Purification of the Virg in corresponds with the old Roman festival of Juno Februata (purified) which was held in the last month (February) of the Roman year, and which included a candle procession of Ceres searching for Proserpine. Edward Carpenter, Pagan and Christian Creeds—their Origin and Meaning Oskar Seyffert says Juno was known under many names as the goddess of nuptials, and the name Iuga (Yoke) is one of them. He gives no feast day for her but he says the calends were a bad day for marriage, one reason perhaps why the festival was on 2 February, anothe r being that the first was devoted to Juno Sospita, the national goddess. 2 February is actually the date of the “Presentation of the Lord” in the Catholic Ca lendar, celebrating when the infant Jesus was presented in the temple, and Mary was purified ( Lk 2:22). This seems to be the real link between Juno and Mary, Godfrey Higgins was suggesting. It was not the concepti on but the purification"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"of the virgin that was celebrate d on this date. William Woods ( A History of the Devil ) confirms that 2 February was the Roman day of purificat ion. Since the Church adopted 25 December as the birth date of Christ, in Mosaic law, 41 days later would have been Mary’s date of purification, 4 February. It fell so close to the official Roman fe stival on 2 February, that was the day chosen. The second century Stoic, Aelianus, in De Natura Animalium , describes what seems to have been a version of the virgin birt h of Christ. He says in Herod’ s reign a Judaean maid had made love to a serpent, become pregnant and father ed the son of a god. At the time, Asklepios of Epidauros was well known as fathering many a de mi-god to matrons who made the appropriate sacrifices and slept overnight in the sanctuary. She would dream th at Asklepios appeared to her as a serpent, and if she later had a child, she was sure it was the offspring of the god. Augustus was called “ Divus ”, it is said, because his mother conceived him in the temple of Apollo, the god appearing to her as a serpent. Julius Caesar too was immacula tely conceived, being the son of the beautiful virgin Cronis Celestine and be gotten by the Father of all Gods, Jupiter. Both Buddha and Krishna, of India, were immacu lately conceived. The mother of Krishna was overshadowed by the supreme God, Brahma, and th e Holy Ghost was Naraan. Krishna’s mother had given birth seven times previously but rema ined a virgin. Philostratus, the biographer of Apollonius of Cappadocia cites his source Damis as saying the virgin mother of Apollonius—the contemporary and rival saviour of Jesus Chri st—gave him birth by be ing overshadowed by the god, Proteus. Several of the virgin mothers of gods and gr eat men go ten months between conception and delivery. The tradition of the miraculous conceptions of gods, sons of gods, saviours and messiahs was prevalent in the world from ancient times on, be ginning long before the mother of Jesus was overshadowed by the ghostly representative of the Most High. The belief in immaculate conception extended to every nation in the world. The furtive pregnancy of young women by a god is a recurring theme in Greek mythology. Dishonest Christians will insist their own fantasy is unique, but it is no more unique than any other. Both the prevalence and an tiquity of the idea of divine conception among the heathen is conceded by earlier Christian writer s in their arguments from preceden ts of the divinity of Christ. S Augustine, Origen and Lactanius tried to persuade us of the immaculate virginity of the mother of Jesus Christ by the example of similar Paga n events. They conceded that the doctrine of divine conception was long anterior to Christ and not unique in his case. In Luke , the birth of John the Baptist is no less miraculous than that of Jesus. John’s mother is an old woman, Elizabeth, and his father is an old prie st, Zachariah, who complains that he is past it! Yet John is conceived and born six months before Jesus, according to Christians. So, an impotent old man and a barren old woman ha ve a son. Are we to assume that this was old Zachariah suddenly became a stud again, once hi s old dear had turned into Li z Hurley? Objectively, this is a better miracle because the factors of ag e and impotency preclude pregnancy utterly."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Presumably Elizabeth was not a virgin, so this wa s not a virgin birth, but that is often not the point—it is the miraculous conception. Perpetual Virginity and the Holy Family From as early as the second century, Christia ns took Mary to be, like the Pagan goddesses, a perpetual virgin, and so, rejecting any other of Mary’s possible confinements as supernatural ones, she must have remained as chaste as a pious nun, once Jesus had been born. S Jerome insisted on this article of dogma . Curious, then, that the leader of the Jerusalem Church was James the Just, described by Josephus as “the brother of Christ”. Matthew 1:24-25 implies that Joseph had sexual relations with Mary once she had given birth to Jesus. In Luke 2:7, Jesus is described as Mary’s “first-born”, implying she had others. All four gospels speak of brothers pf Jesus, and two mention sisters. The direct and simple interpretation is that Jesus had a large family of brothers and sisters, children of his own mother, Mary, and the Christians in the first century accepted it as so. Catholics, who still believe the perpetual virginity tale, say the “brothers and sisters” of Jesus were really cousins, indicating more incompetance by the Holy Gu ardian of the Word, and that the Jews were indifferent to proper family relations. Christians delight in finding excuses for the lapses of the Holy Ghost, but the frequency of th e need for it illustrates the immense credulity of the believer. Why is God, or His spiritual agent, so incompeten t at putting over the message of salvation? The most cunning excuse invented by pr ofessional Christians is that God made it hard to believe to test the believer’s faith! Thus faith becomes synonymous with foolishness. Joseph could have been an elderly man who ha d married before and had several children by earlier wives. Thus, the brothers and sisters of Je sus were his half brothers and half sisters. The word used for brother is “ adelphos ” usually meaning a blood brother, but the Septuagint uses “ adelphos ” for other relationships like that of Lot and Abraham ( Gen 14:14,16), Jacob and Laban ( Gen 29:12.15) and 1 Chronicles 23:22 where it means cous in. Moreover, the assignment of Mary to the care of John ( Jn 19:25-27) suggests that Ma ry had no other family. The brothers of Christ in Mark are James, Joses, Jude and Si mon, but none of his sisters are named, perhaps because they were all called Ma ry! The Jude who supposedly wrote the epistle called himself the brother of James but “a slav e of Jesus Christ”. He does not sound like a brother of Jesus Christ, even t hough he is a brother of James. The Essenes were a brotherhood but they had ranks, and the lower ranks were serv ants, or slaves, of th e higher ones, explaining this usage. Jesus was of the highest rank among the Essenes, but had, in the view of his followers gone on to an even higher status in opening th e gates of God’s kingdom. Everyone therefore was a slave to him. Followers of deities were their slaves from the earliest times in Sumer. Jude ranked himself below Jesus but level with James. In fact, Jude’s letter is a later pseudepigraph, but shows that the Essene terminology was still in use over a hundred years after the crucifixion, and continued in use into modern Christianity. It is again something that Christians have to deny since it shows that Jesus did not bring an orig inal revelation. He was a part of the Essene brotherhood."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Mary, Joseph and the Holy Family Two men, James and Joses, appear in Mark 15:40 with a Mary: And also women were watching from a distance, among whom also was Mary Magdalene, also Mary the mother of Ja mes the less, and of Joses, and Salome. Mark 15:40 Are these part of Jesus’s family, or is she the “other Mary”? And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre. Matthew 27:61 In the end of the sabbath, as it began to daw n toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre . Matthew 28:1 And is she the Mary described as “mother of Jose s” or “the mother of James” or “of James”? And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.

Matthew 27:56 It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles. Luke 24:10 And who is who in this passage in John? Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. John 19:25 "},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Is this four women or three? Is Mary of Cleopha s (or Clopas) the sister of Mary his mother? Here “the wife” is inserted by pious translators before “of Cleophas”, whereas in the previous cases above, “the mother” is inserted before “of Jame s”. So, the natural read ing of it becomes that Mary the mother of Christ had a sister, also call ed Mary, who was the wife of Cleophas. If this sister of the Virgin Mary were the mother of Ja mes and so on, then they were Jesus’s cousins, as the Catholics always maintained. But could Mary the Virgin have had a blood sister also called Ma ry? It has to be accepted as possible, but God’s agent is again doing a terrible job of arra nging the story to be understandable because it seems so unlikely. If the Inept Ghost arranges for brothers-in-law to be called brothers, then sisters-in-law can be called sisters, and then this Mary would be th e sister-in-law of the Virgin, and Cleophas is possibly her brother—who marri ed another Mary (the other Mary)—and Heli was their father. If Joseph joined this family as an apprentice, he would have been taken as an adopted son of He li, so he too could have been li sted as a son of Heli. Geoffrey Ashe surmises that Joseph eventually married a Mary, one of Heli’s daughters. When Heli died, his son, Cleophas, became the head of the fa mily, continuing to employ Joseph. The brood of children of Cleophas grew up with the solitary son of Joseph and Ma ry, so that they all seemed to be brothers and sisters to th eir friends and neighbours. So it is that Ashe ingeniously explains away the extended family of Jesu s in the gospel acc ounts, but Joseph rema ins a cipher, less significant than Cleophas in this scheme. Since we are speculating as hard as we can, the “o ther Mary” could have been Joseph’s sister and still been the sister-in- law of Mary. Cleophas was therefore ma rried to Joseph’s sister, or perhaps Cleophas was Joseph’s blood brother, taking in the young widow when Joseph died young. These reconstructions might be plausible, the main criterion of Christian “history”, and it seems more plausible in Judaism that a br other would take into his family his brother’s widow and child than that a brother-in-law woul d, but the figure of Joseph never gets any clearer. He has to die young leaving the young girl a widow, or unmentiona ble is that he was f eckless and had only one son by Mary because he left her destitute, perhaps before they were even married, being only betrothed, the girl being a minor. Mary the Virg in then depended on her sister’s husband or Joseph’s brother to support her. Chri stians do not want to hear that. Another excuse could be that Joseph was an elderly man with several children including a daughter, Mary, the “other Mary”. Perhaps this ol d man took in the poor naïve girl who had been ravaged by a Roman soldier called Pantherus—a M oor from north Africa. Joseph legitimised the “adoption” by betrothing the girl , and she and her son were brought up in this old man’s large family. When he died many years later, his own son, Jacob (James), grandson of Joseph’s father, Jacob, according to one of the genealogies, it being a social custom to name eldest sons after their grandfather, became head of the family. Je sus hated Romans for the treatment meted out to himself and his mother, becoming a leader of a rebel band and dying on the cross. Fine for Christians except for the end of it. Ashe boasts that even if the virg in birth doctrine is nonsense his reconstruction of Mary’s family relations is an “unsuspected answer”, “implicit in the record”. Yet to get the unsuspected answer the “Mary of Cleophas” has to have “wife” supp lied by the reader for it to mean anything. Why then do we not have a “Mary wife of James”, supplying “wife” in these cases instead of"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"“mother”? The words are missing but reconstr uctions depend on them. Arbitrary insertions become gospel truth, and then “history” is rewri tten by pious liars on their basis. Whether Ashe’s reconstruction is valid or not, the great historian convi nces himself that it is, and so is blind to its omissions. There is something about the myth of Christ that taints otherwise honest people, turning them into liars and confidence tricksters. A Brotherhood? It is an entertaining game, recons tructing the bits of the story the Holy Ghost forgot to clarify, but where does it get us? Such reconstructions are meaningle ss when there is nothing to distinguish them. All are plausibl e but desperate attempts to k eep the idea of a Holy Family, maintaining as much as possible of the gospels’ pe rsistence that Jesus had brothers and sisters, yet had to be an only child if the virginity of Mary was perpetual. The criterion of parsimony demands the simplest explanation of the central historical facts set in the proper historical context. All of it is better explained by re jecting the invisible holy family as a construction of the early Church, and accepting that Jesus was a member of an apocalyptic fraternity with an associated sorority, and one that has undoubted and extensive similarities with Christianity. The James the Less, son of Mary ( Mk 15:40) is listed as an apostle. The epithet will signify rank in the brotherhood. Another James had a higher rank. If it is James the son of Zebedee, then James the Less became the leader of the Jerusalem Church. The last shall be first! James the Less also seems to be the son of Alphaeus, a problem so lved by equating Alphaeus with Cleophas, both being different Greek attempts to translate Halp ai or Chalpai, according to the degree of gutterality of the “h”. Chalpai is a form of the name Caleb (Chalubai), w ho was, with Joshua, the only two of twelve spies, each standing for a tribe, sent into Canaan to bring good news back about the prospects. Caleb stood for the tribe of Juda h. God, therefore, allowed only these two to cross into the Promised Land. Jesus identifies with Joshua, so Chalpai/Cleopas seems to be another title in the Essene se tup, their idea of entry into G od’s kingdom being modelled on the original entry into th e Promised Land. If the ceremony of in auguration of an Essene required a rebirth, then each Essene had a ritual mother. It begins to look as if these ritual mothers were called Mary. The Book of James , later called the Protevangelium , written in the second century but showing signs of an Essene original, offers yet another plot. It says Mary was the daughter of a wealthy but previously childless couple. Told by an angel she would give bi rth, the woman, Anna, resolved to consecrate the child to god. It is a co py of the mother of Samuel, also called Hannah, doing the same ( 1 Sam 1). The child was therefore a Nazarite! The story says Mary became a temple maiden, living in the temple precinct, and ministered to by angels. The High Priest, Zachariah, eventually entrusted the adolescent Mary to the guardianship of Joseph, an elderly carpenter, who already had sons. Mary remained in the service of the te mple and was spinning thread (suggesting the word “magdalene” meani ng braider!) when the an gel Gabriel brought her his news. Joseph the guardian was suspected of illegal seduction, but the accusation passed by and Mary thereafter remained a vi rgin. Here, then, is yet another version of Jesus’s brothers, but Mary’s father is named as Joachim, not Heli."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The great historian and apologist, Geoffrey Ashe, tells us “it is not history” and has “little genuine tradition” behind it. He knows the author was ignorant of the setting, but for no other reason that he believes the gospel accounts rather than this one. That is not good historical methodology. The people in the Protevangelium were members of a village community of “Israel”, in which they were all close neighb ours. Moreover, the Jerusalem temple did not employ young virgins! Ashe thinks it comical to im agine the small girl skipping about the feet of the armies of workmen employed by Herod who was rebuilding the temple at this time. So, the author was ignorant. Unless, that is, it is Christian apologist s who are ignorant. Ashe knew about the Dead Sea Scrolls , though it did not dent his prej udices. The Essenes called themselves “Israel”, as opposed to Jews genera lly who were “All Isr ael”. The distinction between them was righteousness. Only the Essene s were, and that is w hy they alone were the true Israel. So, James, if he was the author of the Protevangelium , was quite plainly and characteristically describing an Essene communit y. They, above all Jews, kept themselves apart from All Israel when they coul d, although they were practical e nough to have a book of rules, the Damascus Document , for those who had no choice but to meet the impure and unrighteous in their everyday business. They preferred to live, like the modern da y Amish, in their own “camps” or villages separated from the villages of other Jews, and those who lived in cities, like Jerusalem, had their own houses in their own E ssene quarter, where in tercourse with their impious neighbours would be minimized. Thus th ey were clearly identifiable with the community described in the Protevangelium . What Ashe thinks utterly proves the author’s ignorance is that Mary was a temple maiden. Essenes rejected the built temple, but considered their own congregation as a living temple. They themselves were in transit between heaven and earth and so were embryonic angels. Anyone not aware of the Essenes, or not wanting to admit it if they were, would have read the references to the temple and angels as being actual, and no t the product of a partic ular understanding. Gentile Christians quickly wanted their belief to seem to be a unique revelation, and so they expunged everything obvious about the Essenes. They never appeared in the New Testament for example, and here Mary was depicted as a maiden br ought up in the Jerusale m temple. It rather convincingly shows that the community were ind eed Essenes because of the way they thought of themselves as a living temple. The prejudices of the great histor ian and Christian apologists in general are inexcusable. They believe the gospels are God-given, with no proof other than what th ey have always been led to understand, and that therefore su ffices. It does not suffice for a nyone who is properly scholarly. Christians cannot be scholarly an d simply believe their childish fa iry stories with no conclusive proof they should have the respect they give them . It does not matter that their parents believed it and so do millions of their friends. They all suffer from the same lack of discernment. They just believe what they are told. No historian could make such cav alier assessments of competing texts. The fact that the texts they prefer are religious texts is an excellent reason for treating them with suspicion. People will give them excessive credence simply because they have been accepted as authoritative in the pa st, irrespective of their validit y. Once the canon of acceptable books had been decided by the Church, other books that were historically more valid, were forgotten, or even deliberately destroyed in the Church’s timeless war against unorthodoxy and"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"heresy. So it is that a book like the Protevangelium , long ignored, might contain genuine tradition quite contrary to th e beliefs of the dogmatized. In this book, Joseph is not th e husband of Mary but her guardian. The reason is given—she has been devoted to God as a life long Nazarite vowed to perpetual virginity, and could not marry, just as modern Catholic nuns cannot without br eaking their vows. She was seduced by a charmer pretending to be Gabriel, or by her own guardian, be traying his trust, or by one of his sons, or by a Roman soldier called Pantherus, to consider the various options open, and gave birth to an illicit child. It might well have been that he to o was consecrated to God as a Nazarite and an Essene, becoming a great but unrecognized Jewish martyr, and gentile god. Gabriel is not described as appearing to the girl at Nazareth, but contrary to the views of the apologists, that is a point in it s favour, for Nazareth seems to be another Christian fiction. She is, though, described as would a Nazarite, a much more likely origin of the description Nazarene than Nazareth is. That Mary was vowed to chastity also explains her question to the angel, “How shall this be?” It is typical of apologists that Ashe asks, “How is it that she married if she had a vow of virginity?” When Christ enters, all reas on departs. The different story offered simply does not register in th eir consciousness. The evidence m ounts up that the gi rl was seduced contrary to her vow of ch astity. Mysteriously getti ng pregnant was itself a s candal, as it generally has been ever since, and the Church found it conveni ent for more reasons than one to hide it as a miraculous conception. The putative marriage was to legitimise what seemed illigitimate in fact. But the truth might be the idea offered here, that the girl was a ritual mother, and no scandal occurred, merely a misunderstanding that could not be righted without the Church having to admit it had emerged from an older Church—the yahad or congregation of the Essenes. In summary, Joseph is a cipher. His son is homeless and owns nothi ng but a coat. His wife had to be left to someone else’s care when the son died, yet Jesus had brothers. This is not a description of a family. The Essenes owned nothing except their clothes. Yet everyone had a means of support from the communal purse, and everyone ha d somewhere to stay in the communal houses. Acts is utterly clear that the first Christians lived in the same way, and it was a crime to violate the rules of poverty. The Holy Family was a brotherhood!

Anyway, that really is not your pr oblem, it is just that your source is pretty narrow in its scope. If you go to any library or good bookshop, you should find a book about Greek myths that will give you the story. I have for example a book called, in the UK, Who’s Who in Classical Mythology , by M Grant and J Hazel which is a Teach Yourself book published in the US by David McKay and Co Inc, 750 Third Avenue NY. It explains that Alcmene re fused to sleep with Amphitryon until he had avenged her brothers. When this had been accomplished Zeus appeared to the beautiful and wise Alcmene looking like her husband and impregnated her. Soon after, Amphitryon himself arrived and was disappointed by his tired reception, whereupon his wife explained why she was cool about his seeming vigour. Told what had ha ppened by his wife, he sought the explanation from the prophet Tiresias, who said Zeus had cuckolded him, because he had chosen Alcmene as the mother of the valian t mortal who would save the gods the bother of fighting the Giants. Amphitryon, fearful of divine jealousy, resolved neve r to have intercourse again with his wife, who went on then to have the twins from her only two occasions of sexual dalliance.

Birth Narratives III © Dr M D Magee Contents Updated: Sunday, July 04, 1999 Monday, 05 April 2004 • The Magi and the Star of Bethlehem"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"• Shepherds and Angels • The Massacre of the Infants • Early Proof of Divinity • The Immaculate Conception of Jesus • Christ a Powerful God Abstract Why were Jesus’s family assessed for tax by the Romans when Quirinius taxed Jud � a. Galilee, where they lived, was not ruled by the Romans but by the puppet king Herod Antipas? Roman custom was to register people for a census at their place of residence not at their place of birth which imposed absurd burdens on people. If Matthew was written in Alexandria in Egypt, its birth narrative humours the large Jewish populati on there—the Jewish Son of God was sheltered in Egypt. Matthew exalted Jesus to the equal of Moses by gi ving him an equal history. No historian mentions Herod’s massacre. Even Lu ke, reputed a good historian by theologians, does not mention it. In Matthew, Magi saw the “sta r” and rejoiced with great joy. Soon they fell down worshipping Jesus. An interpolation disguises th e rejoicing being over the prophesied man of destiny. The “star” is human. Essenes had twel ve leaders and three priests, these latter were probably the three wise men. The Magi and the Star of Bethlehem As soon as god-begotten saviours were born, they were often visited by wi se men—called in the apocryphal Christian gospels Magi, Persian priest s. Magi, magic and magician are derivations from the same root, all suggesting a wisdom handed down by the gods. When the fame of Pythagoras (600 BC) reached Mileta s and neighboring cities, their wise men came to visit him. In the Anacalypsis , Magi came from the East to offer gifts at Socrates’ birth, bringing gold, frankincense and myrrh, the very same offerings given to Christ. Gold, frankincense and myrrh were traditionally offered as gifts to the sun in Persia more than two and a half thousand years ago, and in Arabia about the same time. Zoroaster of Persia (700 BC), says he also was visited by Magi at his earthly advent. Matthew tells us of a miraculous st ar bringing from the east to Judæa three wise men bearing gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. “We have seen his star in the east, and have come to worship him. Mt 2:1 Details of now well known gospel traditions give n by early writers in respect of the birth narratives show that they were not known in the same way as they emerged. This Christian Star story makes its first appearance about the year 119 AD in Rome and, curiously enough, three wise men had in 66 AD been brought to Rome fr om the east to worship the emperor! Moreover, a precursor of the story of Matthew’s travelling star occurs in Virgil (60 BC) wh ere a star guides Æneas westward from Troy. Ignatius of Antioch in a letter of about 110 AD describes the star which appeared at th e birth of Jesus:"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"A star shone in heaven brighter than all the stars. Its light was indescribable and its novelty caused amazement. The rest of the stars, along with the sun and the moon, formed a ring around it, yet it outshone them all. This description sounds like a possible supernova, and the description in Revelation 12, if that is the same event, sounds more like a spectacular comet sweeping across the sky towards the sun rising in Virgo. Supposed astronomers have made a publishing industry latterly out of identifying the star of Bethlehem without arriving at anything conclusive. Though they call themselves scientists, all they really have is their own speculation to offer irrespective of the historical evidence that they seem uninterested in, depending simply on the gospels alone. Really most of them are Christian apolgists tryi ng again to get bogus historical ev idence for the gospel events. Apologists have stupidly suggested that the star was a meteorite, even though they move at huge speed and burn out in seconds. For hundreds of years, astrology an d meteorology had been used for predicting the future in Babylon and Persia, and even quite trivial cele stial events had meaning, including the sound of thunder. Conjunctions of stars, and their rela tions to the moon, and the zodiac were common enough events, and the supposed star need not ha ve been a supernova, or any complex meeting of the stars in the sky, even if the star desc ribed meant anything like th is at all. It was a misunderstanding or deliberate dramatisati on of the messianic title, “The Star”! These wise men, led by a star, which nobody sees but themselves and which moves in such a way as to guide them across country, arrive at Je rusalem and lose the scent. The divine guidance then acts in a way which certainly perplexes the mere human mind. The sages go and tell King Herod that a new “King of the Jews” has be en born somewhere and Herod, in a fury, and believing the statement with childish credulity, orders the murder of all the children in Bethlehem and the entire region under th e age of two and a half years. The little Almighty is taken, presumably on donkey- back, hundreds of miles across the desert, to get out of the way, and let the innocents suffe r murder. Miracles and apparitions crowd the narrative but the simple miracle of changing the king’s heart a nd sparing the children does not occurs to God, or his chroniclers."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"An apparent absurdity in Matthew’s story, is that the wise men followed the star in the east, when they were coming from the east. Unless they circumnavigated the world or walked backwards so that they pretended they were trav elling east because that was the way they faced, they must have been travelling westward, which w ould place the star to their backs. The tale of the Magi reads like fairy tale but note, Matthew does not say the wise men followed the star but simply that they had “seen his star in the east”. He writes it was his star not just a star or even the star, suggesting a astrological or prophetic meaning—it could st ill contain genuine Nazarene tradition. The stars have a clear role at the births of severa l of the saviours and to mark important events in their subsequent history. The ancients thought the arrival of gods and great people would be announced by a star. A star figured either before or at the birth of Abraha m, Caesar, Pythagoras, Yu and Krishna. Zoroaster, about 1000 BC, prophetic ally announced to “the wise men” of that country that a saviour would be born, “attended by a st ar at noonday”. Simlarly when Nared had examined the stars, having heard of Krishna’s fame , he declared him to be from God—the Son of God. The Roman Calcidius speaks of a wonderful star, presagi ng the descent of a God amongst men. A star foretold of the birth of the Roma n Julius Caesar. The Chinese God Yu was not only heralded by a star, but co nceived and brought to mo rtal birth by a star. All nations once believed that the planetary bodies or their inhabitants controlled the affairs of men, and even their births. That is astrology which still holds sway over many gullible people. Early people thought a star was alive, becaus e it appeared to move, and acted as though controlled by a living spirit. In Job 38:9, the morning stars join in a chorus and sing together. Pliny in his Natural History records that the people of Rome fancied they saw a man they took for a god in a star or comet. Th e apocryphal book of Seth relate s that a star descended from heaven and lighted on a mountain, in the midst of which a divine child was seen bearing a cross. Jews, Pagans and Christian could have had no id ea that stars were immensely bigger than the earth and even the nearest was untold millions of miles away and could hardly hop hither and thither as international guides. The practice of calculating destinies by the stars ha d long been popular in the East at the time of Christ’s birth and, indeed, the Essenes were adept at it, as the astrologi cal texts of the scrolls indicate. An astrological interpretation of the star of Bethlehem makes more sense than the notion of a star leaving the firmament and tr avelling untold light years to stand over the young child Jesus, as he lay amongst the oxen and asses in a stable ( Mt 2:7). To those who like to see God grossly violating his own laws of nature, th ey might as well believe, since it would have been much easier, even for God, th at the star was a larg e electric light bulb suspended on a wire from heaven. Using Chris A Marritt’s SkyMap Pro to look at the movements of the planets from Jerusalem, 5.00am on 21 September 11 BC proves to be a likely tim e for ancient astrologe rs to think that a great king had been born. It was the autumn equinox. Mercury, the messenger of the gods, had risen at 4.02. Venus had risen at 4.34. The sun was to rise at 5.25 and Mars at 7.38 followed by Jupiter at 8.37. Most important however was that the constellation of the Virgin with her infant Spica rose at the very time that the sun itself rose . Thus Spica, the infant, seemed to be the sun"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"on this occasion, and had been preceded by the planet Venus and the messenger only shortly before. The heliacal rising of Spica was not itself unus ual, so the portents depended on the planets coming into conjunction with it. Moreover, within a few days th e four planets Jupiter, Venus, Mars and Mercury were in the same part of the sky as the sun, the new born infant, and so were eclipsed by it. On 6 November 11 BC, all five heav enly bodies set together in Scorpio. It might well have been seen as an eschatological omen by Persian and Babylonian astrologers, and soon would be seen as an omen of a great victory over the eagles, the Romans, Scorpio being also considered the eagle by the ancients. It seems odd that the divine Father chose to reveal the bi rth of his son, Jesus, to heathen idolaters hundreds of miles distant in Pers ia. And why should a skill in as trology give them the privilege of seeing the world saviour at birth while pe ople of God’s own el ection—His Chosen—were denied the honour? Indeed they were denounced as fools and a vipers, desp ite their having put up with countless troubles at His behest, in atte mpting to stave off the pressures of mightier surrounding nations with their heathen gods in favour of Him, Yehouah, the ungrateful god. Matthew mentions the word east three times in ni ne verses, and curiously it is the same word translated “dayspring” in Luke 1:78 which also means a branch! Now this might seem coincidental since a title of Jesus was “the Bran ch” but “the star” referred to is a metaphorical use of the messianic scriptural citation Numbers 24:17. Since the reference to “a branch” is also messianic, the coincidence is beginning not to look accidental. Matthew records: When they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. Matthew 2:10 This verse makes much more sense if in “the star” they recognize a man of destiny rather than a twinkle in the sky. The first part of Matthew 2:11 has been inserted, for without it the wise men rejoice with exceeding great joy th en fall down and worship him—all ve ry natural if “the star” is human. Essenes were organized such that there we re twelve leaders and three priests. It seems from the clues remaining that the three wise men are really three Zadokite priests, the leadership of the Essenes. In reality they were present to participate in the cr owning ceremony, the baptism in the gospels, but have been moved back thirty years in Matthew to appear at the actual birth rather than the ritual rebirth of the baptism. It seems then that a call on the lines of, “Where is he that is born prince of Israel? for he is the star, and he is the branch”, was part of the coronation ceremony. Matthew immediately records that Herod heard of this and was troubled. Herod was the paranoid Idumaean king of the Jews who murdered half of his sons, young prin ces he suspected of plotting against him. When Augustus Caesar hear d of Herod condemning his son Antipater, he remarked: “It is better to be Herod’s pig ( hus ) than his son ( huios )”. If Herod had discovered that part of an Essene ritu al involved crowning a prince, he woul d have been outraged. Now Josephus says that Herod and the Essene s were on good terms but that seem s belied by the fact that the Essene centre at Qumran was deserted during most of Herod’s reign. If Matthew 2:1-18 is anything to go by, Herod did not get on with the Essenes."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Shepherds and Angels In many mythologies, as soon as god-begotten sa viours were born into the world they were adored by shepherds. Instead of wise men Luke 2:8-21 has lowly shepherds, who had been “watching their flock”, coming a- visiting, notified by angels of th e birth of God. Sometimes the visitors were angels, leaving the splendid perfection of heaven to adore the new born saviour of this wicked world. Christian imagery usually has both! Angels and wise men appeared to Confucius who was born in 598 BC. Five wise men came from afar to the house where the infant lay to present their offerings to him. Celestial music was heard in the skies, and angels attended the scene. Th e only difference in the Christian story is the number of wise men. Matthew ( Mt 2:1) does not give the number, but popularly it is three. Luke speaks of a multitude of the heavenly host praising God ( Lk 2:13). Popularly the heavenly host was singing its praises so we have another way of saying that celestial music was heard. How complete the parallel! It goes further. Confucius, like Christ, had twel ve chosen disciples. He was descended from a royal house of princes, as Christ from the roya l house of David, and like Christ was born poor. He had a disagreement with a monarch and retire d for a long period from society into religious contemplative seclusion. He taught the same Golden Rule of doing to others as we desire them to do toward us, and other moral maxims equal in importance to anything in the Christian scriptures. In Luke , an angel saluted Mary: Hail, thou that art highly favoured; the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou among women. Lk 1:28 In the next chapter the angel jo ins with the heavenly host in praising God. The same is found in the Ramayana, when Brahma and Siva, with a hos t of attending spirits, came to the mother of Krishna, the eighth avatar of India (1200 BC), and sang: In thy delivery, O favoured among women, all nations shall ha ve cause to exult. When Krishna was born, he was inundated in flow ers by the gods, the equivalent of Christian angels. Pipes and drums were played in the heav ens, trees blossomed and pools were filled with clear water. The room was illuminated by his light, and the countenance of his father and mother shone with its brightness and glory. They had an image of him as a king a nd, realising he was the preserver of the world, they began to worship him, but like the virgin Mary quickly forgot all this and soon regarded him as an ordinary infant! The ninth avatar of India, Buddha (600 BC), is similar. On a silver plate in a cave in India is an inscription stating that a sain t in the woods, at the time of the advent of Buddha, learned by inspiration that an avatar had app eared in the house of Rajah of La ilas. He flew through the air to the place beheld the new-born saviour. He declared him to be the great avatar destined to establish a new religion."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The metaphor of a shepherd is one of those that the Essenes were fond of—which is why it appears so often in Christianity. The Essenes, among many other things, ca lled themselves “the watchers for the kingdom”. Thus the Master in the Community Rule is commanded to watch always for the judgement of God. We have noted that the Damascus Document interprets Zechariah 13:7—a very important passage for E ssenes and Christians—by applying the metaphors the “humble of the flock” and “those w ho watch for him” to the Essenes themselves. Luke has used the same metaphor of the watche rs and their flock, the children of Israel, and dramatized it into the birth story. One scroll fr agment, discussing the e xpected visitation, even uses the same terms as Luke —“the holy spirit”, “the meek”, “glad tidings”, “the messiah shepherds the holy ones” and “commands the heav ens and the earth including the heavenly host”. The heavenly host in Luke 2:14 are calling for the kingdom of God when they sing: Glory to God in the highest; on earth peace, good will towards men. Though a desirable sentiment the offer of goodwill to all men is not meant. The proper translation of the best ma nuscripts is given as: “on earth peace to men in whom He is well pleased. The men in whom God is well pleased are the Es senes, His righteous, to whom glory and peace come in His kingdom, because those who... ...walk by the spirit of truth shall recei ve abundance of peace and everlasting joy in a life without end. Next Luke 2:22-38 has Mary and Joseph—described as the parents thus acknowledging Joseph as the father (in short, a passage preceding the invention of the Virgin Birth)—present at the temple for Mary’s ritual purif ication after ch ildbirth. There an unknown man described as “just” and “devout”, “waiting for the consolation of Israel”, and “having the holy spirit upon him” chants his Nunc Dimittis before Jesus. These words denote him as an Essene. The word translated “devout” is peculiar to Luke and might be his transl ation of “Nazarite”. The clergy have always denied any connection with th e Nazarites, perhaps because they did not like others besides Jesus in the story consecrated to God, and because the word is remarkably similar to Nazarene, suggesting that the latter might ha ve had nothing to do with Nazareth. So Luke or an editor avoids it. “Waiting for the consolation of Israel” meant he was waiting for the messiah and therefore the kingdom. The word “Lord” beginning the song in Luke 2:29 is a mistranslation— it should be “Master”, immediately showing its Essene origins and that it is the departing Master recognizing the new Master. The song is litany from the coronation or transference ceremony of the Nasi. Luke being a gentile has altered vers e 2:32. Originally, following Isaiah 9:2, it will have read, “a light to lighten the darkness”, meaning the sins of th e people, but Luke had a good knowledge of the scriptures and knew that Israel wa s “the light of the gentiles” ( Isa 49:6) and merely substituted"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"this here. Anna the prophetess is one of Luke’s female additions to placat e the church’s female congregations. The Massacre of the Infants Matthew 2:13-18 says Joseph learnt in a dream that Herod would kill the baby and so took off to Egypt just in time to miss the massacre of th e innocents of Bethlehem by Herod, who sure enough decreed the murder of al l children under two years ol d. Joseph heeded the divine warning, and fled as directed, only returning after Herod had died. Such a massacre and hiding of a ch ild of great promise from the wrath of a king is one of the oldest themes in mythology. Many of the infant saviours were threaten ed with death and yet were miraculously preserved—the saviour saved! The tyrant king or ruler of the country usually feared the young god, by his superior power and goodness, would prove a riva l king, and so took measures to destroy him. It has alre ady happened in the Christian bible: And the King of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives... And he sa id, When ye do the office of a midwife to the He brew women, and see them upon th e stools, if it be a son, then ye shall kill him. Exodus 1:15-22 And so Moses was, like Sargon of Babylon a t housand years before, hi dden in an ark of bulrushes on the river. Herodotus, the Greek hist orian, tells us that King Cyrus of Persia had similarly to be hidden away at birth from a jeal ous king, and every Jew knew the story of Cyrus. Suetonius, the Roman historian, gi ves a similar legend about the bi rth of the Emperor Augustus. The wholesale “massacre” alone is peculiar to th e Jesus story and that horrible detail is enough of itself to damn it. No Roman or Jewi sh writer ever heard of the horror. Not one writer of that age, or of any nation, ma kes any mention of Herod’s massacre even when they are listing crimes. Even the Rabbinical writers who detail his wicked life so minutely, fail to record such an atrocious act, which must ha ve been published far and wide. Josephus, a Jew contemporaneous with Matthew, who records all the crimes of Herod, does not mention this atrocity (about fourteen thous and in number) in Judæa. Roman historians who give us any account of Herod’s character do not say anything about any such deed. Nor does Luke, who has a reputation among theologians as a good historian. Nevertheless the story places the na tivity in the reign of Herod the Great, 37 to 4 BC, and so Jesus was born sometime before 4 AD. Dionysos Exiguus, a sixth century monk, calculated the year of Herod’s death and assumed it was also the year of Jesus’s birth. Unfortunate ly his calculation was four years out and so our calendar has been ever since. Herod’s death is now recorded as 4 BC rather than 1 AD as it would have been if th e monk were correct."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" In any case was he right to assume Jesus was born in the same year that Herod died? For it to be true, Jesus must have been born before Christians think he was. Herod died in 4 BC when the holy family was already hiding in Egypt where they had fled to escape him, according to Matthew . When they fled, Jesus was no longer a new born child, because Herod had been looking for boys up to the age of two. The implica tions are that Jesus was born before 4 BC and possibly even before 6 BC to allow time for fleei ng, the infant to be up to two years old and an indeterminate number of years abroad. Since Herod was an old man when he heard the news of the birth of his rival—not less than sixty-eight according to Josephus—h e could hardly have been worried about an infant rival. By the time the infant was adult Herod would have been dead. Nor can it be argued that he worried for the sovereignty of his children, who he treated a bysmally, if he allowed them to survive at all. The elements of truth in the story of Herod are that he was an ogre and that at this time Herod suppressed the Essenes. He literally did murder thousands of children but they were the same Children as those of the gospels. They were not infants but the Children or Sons of Israel, meaning the Jews. And he certainly was paranoid because the children he could correctly be accused of murdering were his own children—some of his own sons who he feared as rivals— but they were adults when murdered. Josephus says the Essenes were favoured by Herod because one of them, Menehem, had accurately prophesied that Herod would be king. They were allowed not to make an oath of fealty to him unlike all other Jews except Phar isees. Essenes would not, of course, recognize any Lord but God and, short of butchering them all, Herod perhaps had no c hoice. Josephus relates this tale immediately before he describes Hero d’s reconstruction of the temple in 19 AD even though the event itself occurred twenty years before—even be fore Herod became king. The association of the favouring of the Essenes with the construction of the temple implies that Herod sought the Essenes’ support in his project which was initially unpopular. The help he might have needed was an army of priests trained as masons to build the sacred inner buildings, the holy of holie s and its approach. Bribed with the promise that the Zadokites would be established as the ac cepted priesthood, it seems the Esse nes agreed only later to find they had been tricked. Assembling the materials mu st have taken a year or so, the construction of the inner buildings took eighteen months and th e outer cloisters another eight years, but the surrounding porticoes and the i mmense platform supporting the temple courts took many more"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"years to build. The Essenes might have been f obbed off with Herod’s excuses for not instating them during the eight year period but surely for no longer and so they c ould have fallen out of favour between about 15 and 8 BC. Luke 2:1-7 tells us Caesar Augustus decreed a taxation and associates the birth with the necessary census. Matthew has no record of there being a census and no census in the reign of Augustus is known in Judæa near the supposed y ear of Jesus’s birth, though there certainly was one about 6 or 7 AD conducted by Quirinius, Legate of Syria, putting Jesus’s birth date at least ten years later than Matthew . Such a late date means either that Jesus was crucified at the age of 30 in the year that Pilate was recalled, or that he was younger than 30 when he died. If the length of his ministry in John is correct, Jesus must then have b een only around 25 when he started his ministry. And, if the census was that of 6 AD it is not clear why Jesu s’s family had to be assessed for tax by the Romans when Quirinius taxed Judæa since they lived in Galilee and Galilee was not ruled by the Romans but by th e puppet king Herod Antipas. Furthermore Roman custom was to register people for a census at thei r place of residence not at their place of birth which would impose absurd burdens on people who had established themselves elsewhere, and many enterprising Jews had done this even in those distant times. Christian apologists try to explai n all this by asserting without sure foundation there was another census ten or fourteen years earlier—from August us, Romans carried out a census every fourteen years in their dominions—and indeed Herod could have agreed to a census when the Jews were persuaded to pay tribute to Rome. This takes us again to about 8 BC by which time the Essenes had fallen out of favour with Herod, and Jesus’s family was fleeing to Egypt in Matthew . It is also about the time that Qumran began to be reoccupied after several decades of desertion. Indeed Egypt might have been Essene code for Qumran. It all ties together but there is no evidence for the earlier census. Why, for example, doesn’t Matthew mention it? And why was there no rebellion when the earlier taxation wa s imposed as there was for the later one? The Essenes would certainly have been opposed to it. We have to admit that there is no solid ev idence about when Jesus was born, though it was before 4 BC when Herod died. Christian clergymen teach the children in their charge the dates of Jesus’s life as if they were certain of it. Perh aps when the children are a little older the priests admit that no one really knows, but then they say it does not really matter.

Suetonius says that the Roman Senate tried to get rid of th e baby Octavius, (the Emperor Augustus) in the same way. Matthew wants to show Jesus as the equal of Moses and so exalts him by giving him an equal history. The story of the popular Hindu deity, Krishna, is strikingly similar in nearly every fe ature. It is so close in some details that earlier scholars thought that these were derived from an early Christian mission to India. Modern scholars reject the idea, and they w onder only if some parts of the Christ and the Krishna legend did not co me from a common source, a source which some find in the legends about the Persian King Cyru s given by the Greek historian Herodotus. The Hindu branch of the Hindu and Persian race, the eastern part of the Aryan race, lost the severity of the original religion, and developed its phallic an d sensual elements. Buddhism failed and the cult of Krishna gained in popularity until it appealed more than any other of the numerous religions of India. It flourished in India two or three centuries before Christ, but no one is sure whether there is a historic al person at the root of it, as in the cases of Buddhism and Jesus. The legend of Krishna is that he was born of a married woman, Devaki, but like Maya, Buddha’s mother, she was considered to have had a mira culous conception. King Kansa was warned in a vision that the son of Devaki would destroy him, and take his place, and the child had at once to be taken away out of reach of the monarch. The king had Devaki’s earlier children put to death (“murder of the innocents”), and Krishna had to be saved, as King Cyrus was saved from the King of the Medes and Moses from the King of Egypt. Krishna, more over, gave signs of his real divine origin soon after his birth and in his boyhood. In the end Krishna—who is most unchristlike in his amorous adve ntures among the milkmaids, which endear him to the unascetic Hindu—killed King Kansa, took his place, and wr ought marvelous things for his people. "},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"A familiar religious emblem of India was the statue of the virgin mother, Devaki and her divine son Krishna, an incarnation of the great god Vis hnu. Christians say the story was taken from Christianity, but, if the Hindus were to adopt any foreign mode l for their own gods, they had extensive contact with Egypt and Isis and Horus w ould be models rather th an the hero of some minute and unimportant sect of a minute and uni mportant people. In f act mother and child images are age old in religion and probab ly go back to Mother Goddess religions. Among features in common is the angel warni ng, and Krishna’s angel was not only thoughtful enough to warn the parents to flee , but informed the tyrant ruler, to make sure he played his proper role. Kansa, the ruler, heard an angel voice announcing that a rival ruler had been born in his kingdom. In the Christian story it was sli ghtly hit and miss, depending upon the Magi to inform Herod almost accidentally. Kansa, like Herod, set about devisi ng a way to destroy his infant rival. Herod’s decree required the destruction of all infa nts under two years of age ( Mt 2:16), even though he had commanded earlier that the young child s hould be sought diligently ( Mt 2:8). Kansa decreed that active search be made for whatever young children there may be upon earth, that every boy in whom there may be found signs of unusual greatn ess be slain without remorse. There was in a cave temple at Elephanta in Indi a a sculpture—universally admitted to be much older than Christianity—of a king with a drawn sword, surrounde d by slaughtered infants. The slaughtered infants in the cave are all boys surrounded by gr oups of men and women in supplication. For those with ears to hear, the story in Matthew is copied from the Hindu religion and was surely learnt from Sadhus in Alexandria or from Persia. In each case: • There was an angel warning about the impending danger • The governor or ruler was hostile to the mission of the young saviour • A bloody decree was issued aimed at the destruction of the infant Messiah • The hurried flight of the parents takes place • the Gospel of the Infancy of Jesus , for hundreds of years believed by Christians to be inspired by divine authority, relates that Chri st and his parents sojourned for a time at a place called Matarea. One place claimed as the birth place of Krishna was Mathura. As Krishna and his parents crosse d the River Jumna in their flight , they nearly drowned but the infant Krishna noticed and with his foot part ed the waters and they passed over safely, like Moses and the Israelites crossing the Red Sea. Egyp tian legend has similar stories. The mother of Zoroaster had alarming dreams of evil spirits se eking to destroy her unborn child. A good spirit consoled her, saying: “Fear not. Ormuzd, Most High God, will protect the infant, sent as a prophet to the people and the world who are waiting for him. "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Christ and Krishna are otherwise quite different stereotypes. Yet worshippers on the plains of India saw the appearance on earth of their god much as the Christians of the first century saw theirs. Was there a common source in some of the older myths, or simply a parallel evolution of the religious imagination playing about the birth of a god? Who knows but The Jesus ideal is just one version of a legend which st retches over three thous and years of time and is found equally in Egypt and Syria, Greece and Rome. Early Proof of Divinity. Asiatic religion had its Christs as well as the reli gions of nearer Asia and of Europe. The Sheng Mu (Holy Mother) of the Chines e and Japanese is commonly repr esented with a divine son. The God Yu, who was concealed in a manner similar to that of Moses was depict ed as a babe on the knee or in her arms of his virgin. Even Kong-fu-tse, who escaped the common fate of reformers—deification—was credited with supernatur al portents at birth. It is a natural urge of the devout mind to invest its hero with superhuman experiences. Buddha’s teaching, as settled by mo dern scholars, was so decidedl y non-religious that one would not expect him ever to be adorned with a supern atural halo. He not only plainly disavowed all the gods of India, but he bade his disciples wa ste no time in disputing about God and personal immortality. He was an Agnostic , a humanitarian. Yet, pure Buddhism almost perished from the earth. What is generally called Buddhism in Asia has no more relation to Buddha’s teaching than Roman Catholicism has to the teaching of Je sus. It is a system of temples and statues, priests and monks, rosaries and censers, rites and vestments, heavens and bells. Buddha himself was degraded to th e divine level. What would s eem admirable and superior in Buddha and Jesus if they were men, becomes pe tty and trivial when on e measures them by a divine standard. Christian apol ogists deny that there is any pa rallel between Buddha and Jesus because Buddha’s mother, Maya, was married. The real parallel is that Buddhists were like Christians in that they could not have their god born of carnal intercourse, and so his conception was miraculous. It does not matter that a woma n who is not a virgin gives birth without intercourse. The point is not that the woman had had intercourse but that she had not had intercourse on this occasion. Buddhis ts did not call Maya “a virgin”. They believed in a “virgin birth”. Krishna, Hercules, Zoroaster, Yu, Bacchus, Romulus, Moses and Cyrus, were each threatened with death but were miraculously preserved. The case of Augustus is related by Suetonius, that of Romulus by Livy, and that of Cyrus by Herodotus . Pharaoh, like Herod, to kill the infant Moses, ordered the death of a ll the male infants—though Herod di d not exclude female infants. And cuneiform tablets found in Mesopotamia relate the same story as th at of Moses about the great semitic king Sargon of Akkadia in the third millenium BC!

Ch rist proved his divine nature by equalling the doctors in the temple when only about twelve years of age. The fame of Christ went out through all the region round about, according to Luke 4:14. The voice of fame soon published the birth of a miraculous child—not Christ this time but Æsculapius—and the people flocked from all quart ers to behold him. In China, Confucius’s extensive knowledge and great wisdom soon made him known, a nd kings were governed by his counsels, and the people adored hi m wherever he went. He was ra tional and able from infancy. When the God Shang-ti, was questioned on the s ubject of government and the duties of princes while yet a child, his answers we re such as to astonish the whole empire by his knowledge and wisdom. One Grecian god killed serpents which attempted to bite him while in hi s cradle. The proof of Osiris’s divinity was a blaze of light shin ing around his cradle soon after he was born. Pythagoras displayed such a remarkable character, even in youth, he attractd the attention of all who saw and heard him speak. He was never at any time angry, never laughed, never acted irrationally or behaved badly. B ecause of his fame people flocke d in multitudes to see him. The people were astonished at Ch rist’s understanding and answers ( Luke 2:47). The Gospel of the Infancy says that his tutor Zacheas was astonish ed at his learning. In the Mahabarata, the parents of the Saviour Krishna, to secure his education, sent hi m to a learned Brahmin, whom he astonished with his learning, and under whose tuition he mastered the sciences in a day and a night. Men, seeing the wonders perf ormed by this child, told Nanda, his adopted father, that this could not possibly be his son. As soon as Buddha was born, a light shone around his cradle, when he stood up and proclaimed his mission, and the River Ganges rose in a mir aculous manner, but was stilled by his divine power, just as Christ stilled the tempest on the se a. He was born amidst great miracles, and soon as born, most solemnly proclaims his mission. The divine power and mission of Yu of China was very early evinced by the display of great miracles. Moses, Solomon and Samuel showed mental superi ority in early life; proving that if they were not considered by the Jews as gods, they were at least “from God”, endow ed by him with divine power while yet mere children. The Immaculate Conception of Jesus The natural conception of Mary is exclusively “The Immaculate C onception” to Catholics, dirty and sinful though Christians consider sex to be, especially out of wedlock. But surely there can be no more immaculate conception than a conception by God Himself, not by the normal sinful biological appendage but by a miracl e. Let us conclude with a concise summary of some puzzles and questions about Jesus’s supremely “i mmaculate” conception and virgin birth."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"• The gospels show that Christ himself did not claim to have a miraculous birth. He did not once allude to it, though as the pr incipal evidence of his divini ty, as Christians claim, he would have done so. • His paternal genealogy, as made out by Matthew and Luke , completely confounds his Virgin Birth. They both trace his lineage through Joseph, which they could only do if Joseph was his father. • His own disciple, Philip, declared him to be th e son of Joseph, and several texts show that it was the original belief. • The story of the Virgin Birth rests on the slender foundations of an angel and a dream. Mary got it by an angel, and Joseph by a dream , and thereby we have the whole of the story of the divinity of Jesus Christ. • However, we have neither Joseph’s nor Mary ’s report of these things, but only Matthew and Luke’s. We do not know that either of th em ever saw or spoke with Joseph or Mary on the subject. • If Christ were a miraculously born god, would his mother have reproved him for misconduct when she found him in the temple, as she, if no one else, must have known his nature? • If Mary conceived miraculously, why wa s it kept so long from Joseph? Did the concubine of God intend to deceive her lawful husband? An angel had to be sent from heaven to let him into the secret. • Why did not God inform Joseph by “inspiration” instead of using th e round about way of sending an angel to do it? • “Mary was found with child of the Holy Ghost” , but as we are told nothing more about the circumstances, does it not leave us suspicious? • Since it all seems to have been based on dreams, was carried on through dreams, and has no better foundation than dreams, why should we gi ve it better credit than similar stories found in heathen mythology? Or is it that Ch ristianity is just a dreamy religion? • In an educated and scientific age, should we accept reports of the birth of a God based on no better a foundation than dreams, angels a nd the legends of orie ntal mythology? In particular, can any scientist entertain the idea of infinite beings, themselves mere conjecture, actually impregnating human females? • Essene belief was that sexual intercourse wa s sinful, procreation was impure and human children were born thus cont aminated. Human beings were imperfect and any god sent into the world as a saviour had to avoid such contamination. The solution was that incarnate gods entered the world through huma n virgins to avoid the impurity and the slander that the saviour might have arisen in more normal ways if the mother were not a virgin. Can anyone unbiased deny that such th inking is the source of the origin of the story of Christ’s Virgin Birth? • If Christ had to come into the world a voiding the impurity of human conception and birth, why did he not descend directly from heaven in person? If he can descend on the clouds at his—still awaited—second advent, w hy could he not do the same at his first advent, thereby pre-empting reasons for doubt and saving far more of fallen humanity? • Could anyone, free of religious guilt and indoctrination, presen ted with these stories as the truth today, willingly and joyfully accept them as proof that someone was a god? Or would they consider them to be fraudulent inventions, intended to gull the credulous?"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"There are so many incongruities in divine revelation that it becomes knavery to dismiss them as God’s mysterious ways, as Christians and Jews do. Yet both agree that God gave us reason. So why doesn’t He expect us to use it when He chooses to reveal something to us? Why are Christians so sure that they have not been hoodwinked by the Devil posing as God? As a supernatural theory of the events of the world, it makes more sense than the Christian idea. Christ a Powerful God The birth of an incarnate god had been annually celebrated for ages in the ancient world, and particularly where Christianity developed. Then, according to Christians, it actually happened! It is as plausible as Superman arriving today from the planet Krypton. The early Christians obviously attributed to their Saviour the kind of birth that was ascr ibed to rival gods. Admittedly, this is a deduction, not a known fact , but the late acceptance of the idea among Christians noted for their gullibili ty tells against it be ing known among the first followers of the Christ. It is plausible if later converts from Pa gan religions expected th at such a god would be born in the conventional way for gods , and eventually so it was. Paul knows nothing of it. Mark , which on many grounds we know to be the oldest gospel, knows nothing of it. Matthew in its original form knows nothing of it. Luke , the latest of the synoptics, has a long story about it. We reach something like the third decade of the second century before the story appears, though it must unquestionably ha ve circulated in the Churches for some time before Luke could write it. We are invited to believe that Christ the savi our is really a powerfu l god merely adopting the cloak of human form so that he can save the hu man race. A god disguised as an infant is surely still a god with the powers of a god. Why then is it that the powers of this disguised god seem to grow as a human grows? He is vulnerable to human enemies as an infant because he has not yet grown powerful enough. As an infant this saviour of the world cannot even save himself from wicked human beings. If that is the case why did the hugely powerfu l Devil, the supposedly evil god, not notice and take advantage of the baby god’s weakness? Millions of human beings were later to die as devils, condemned by the professors of th is loving religion, Ch ristianity, yet the De vil was so weak or stupid that he could not succeed even when hi s enemy deliberately made himself helpless! If murdering innocent people is the criterion of the wo rk of the Devil, then Christianity is the best candidate. Christians claimed Pagan religions were devilish yet took from them. Some modern Christians think this is an unanswerable refu tation of Christian “borrowing”. It is not at all unanswerable or a secure position. Those that think it is, think in terms of Christiani ty as it is now—complete, as they see it. In the early years of its adoption in to the empire, it was not complete, was extremely malleable and church Fathers often used Pagan arguments as arguments for Christianity. They were ready to say, “Our reli gion is just like yours in su ch and such a respect”."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Rome, when it forced Christianity upon Eur ope, deliberately adopted a large amount of Paganism. Bits of ritual, altars , statues, hymns, local deities, were taken into the new religion. Does even the orthodox suppose that Jesus ordere d the use of candles, in cense, holy water and vestments? Yet these things we re adopted by the new religion. We have little historical knowledge of the Chri stians of the first centu ry. Between the simple groups of Jesus worshippers of Paul’s Epistles and Acts, and the developed Christian doctrine of the second century, lies a whole world of e volution on which we have no positive light. The reasonable view is that the influence of the Ol d Testament, the shape given by the Jews to the supposed messianic prophecies, the natural impuls e of ascetic and Esseni c believers to isolate Jesus from all sexual intercours e and the broad beliefs of the Persians, Egyptians and Greeks about the birth of their saviours, together gave shape to the traditional figure of Jesus. The impregnation of a woman by a god was a fam iliar idea, and, if she had been hitherto a virgin, she was held to be a virgin mother. Most prominent of all were the greatest of Egyptian goddesses, Isis, and the greatest of Greek goddesses, Cybele. When at last the Church was forced to permit a veneration of a semi-divine mother, to compete with the most popular feature of Pagan religion, statues of and hymns to Isis and Cybele were appropriated to Mary. If religious history is to be believed, God had many well-bel oved sons, born of pious and holy virgins, besides Jesus Christ. Desp ite this each is his only begotten, or his first begotten, son. All are as well authenticated as the story of Jesus Christ, that is, not very! Before you go, think about this...

He has sent us this summary. Abstract Christians never think it strange that the birth date of Jesus is the birth date of many of the incarnated gods of antiquity. That Pagans venerat ed the birthday of Chri st as the birthday of their gods is beyond coincidence. At the winter solstice, the sun seemed to stop declining in the sky for three days. Its was at crisis point. It mi ght die! Then it began to rise on the 25 December, the sun’s rebirth. Both the year and the day of Ch rist’s birth are unknown. There is no reason to suppose that Jesus the Nazarene was born on Chri stmas Day. The importan ce of 25 December to Pagans made Christians think it must have been the birthday of their me ssiah. When Constantine made Jesus a god, 25 December, the birthday of th e sun gods and particularly that of the chief rival to Christianity, Mithras, was selected as his birthday. By celebrati ng at the same time as Pagan religions, the bishops accaepted Christ as a sun god, hoping to pull in Pagans worshippers. What are the origins of the vari ous ingredients of the now traditional nativity scene? Traditional Winter Festivities Midwinter festivities are far older than Christian ity and have appeared in every culture of the northern hemisphere. When Christianity, on contro lling Europe, first reached England, Northern Germany, and Scandinavia, its missionaries found Pagan rites already celebrated on Christmas day. The early Christians tried to convert Paga n celebrations to Christian ones but with only partial success. In the resulting tangle, Paga nism has partially held its own and many objects associated with Christmas are explicable only as deep folk memories. So, Christians incorporated many of these rites into their Church festival."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"The root of midwinter ri tuals is the winter sols tice, the shortest day wh ich falls on or around 21 December. In the days before the solstice, ritu als were devised to prevent the sun getting any weaker. When they worked, with the day getti ng longer after the sols tice, was the time for celebration. The date of 25 December was when the sun visibly began to rise again after three days at the lowest ebb. It was the Roman fes tival of the “unconquered sun”, Mithras, proving by his rising again that he was again unconquered. It was chosen deliberately to Christianize this traditional celebration. In Scotland, never subject to the Romans, the main midwinter festival is still the entirely non-Christian one of Ho gmanay, the New Year, although the Christmas celebration has advanced in popularity in recent years. Besides sun worship, today’s Christmas festivities reflect a complex of other Pagan rites, many distorted from their original purpose. The tw o chief ones are the Roman Saturnalia and the Germanic-Nordic festivities centeri ng around Wotan and tree worship. The Roman Saturnalia, held on 17 to 19 December, were days of public revelry in honour of the god Saturn, with much sexual licence. During the Saturnalia all business was suspended and many distinctions of rank were forgotten. Mast ers sometimes waited on their slaves—a custom reflected to this day in the military custom of officers serving Christmas dinner to their men. Saturn is one of the ancest ors of Father Christmas. Evergreens, the mistletoe of the Druids, the yule logs which had been brought in every year to blaze on the open hearths, the feasting and carous ing, have all come down to us, often from northern Europe in Pagan days and from Pagan sources. The side boards of the well-to-do are still often graced by the head of a boar, the successor of the b east which slew Adonis. Various modern customs show that Christmas is still a developing institution. Father Christmas is the outstanding example, and so are some carol s. The words of “Good King Wenceslas”, for example, were made up by a nineteenth-century cl ergyman, J M Neale, to go with an old tune. People who attack the commercialization of Ch ristmas are missing the target. For uncountable centuries the midwinter festival has been a time for jollity in a most material way. Christmas Before Christ The nations of the north also ha d their greatest festival of the year in midwinter. To these northern barbarians, shuddering in the snow la den forests beyond the Danube, the return of the sun was the most desired event of the year, a nd they soon learned the time—the winter solstice— when the “wheel” turned. The sun was figured as a fiery wheel, and as late as the nineteenth"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"century there were parts of France where a straw wheel was set on fire and rolled down a hill, to give an augury of the next harvest. Hence “ yule ” (from the Teutonic word “ hoel ” or “wheel”) was the outs tanding festival of the ancestors of the French and Germans, the En glish and Scandinavians. The sun was born, and fires (“Yule logs”, still traditionally symbols of Christmas, though usually in the form of a chocolate cake) flamed in the forest villages, th e huts were decorated with holly and evergreens, Yule trees were laden with pres ents, and stores of solid food and strong drink were lavishly opened. This lasted until Twelfth Day, now Epiphany. The Scandinavians celebrated the 25 December as the birth day of their god Freyr, the son of their supreme god of the heavens, Odin. Long before Christianity, as mid-winter approache d, Rome was lit up with joy. It was the festival of the old vegetation-god Saturn who, as a god, died or was displaced by Jupiter, the sky-god, but had a fine temple on the Capitol. His festival lasted seven days, from 17 to 24 December, and was the most joyous time of the joyous Roman year. For the whole week, no work was done, the one law being good cheer and good nature, but the 25 December was the culmin ation of it all, the greatest festival in the Roman calenda r—the Birthday of the Unconquered Sun... There was great rejoicing, illuminations and public games, and all shops were closed. Presents were exchanged, and the slaves were indulged in special liberties—on this one day they were free. They donned the conical cap of the freedman—a s frolickers continue at Christmas, and on other festive occasions today, to don caps of pape r—and sit at table while masters wait on them. On 25 December, crowds filled the streets and ra ised festive cries, and the women of Rome paraded, singing in a loud voice, “U nto us a child is born this da y”. Stalls laden with presents lined the streets near the Forum, but the grea t present of the season was a doll, of wax or terracotta. Hundreds of thousands of these dolls were on sale on the st alls and held in the arms of passers by. Once human beings we re sacrificed to Saturn, and, as human life grew more important than religion, the god or his priests had to be content with effigies of men or maids— dolls! It was a time of peace on earth, for by Roman law no war could begin during the Saturnalia, and of good- will toward all men. The festival went back far into the mists of pr ehistoric times. It had been earlier a one-day festival, the feast of Saturn, an important magico-r eligious festival for insuring the harvest of the next year, rejoicing that the year’s work wa s over, and helping and propitiating the god of fecundity by generous indulgence in wine and love. The mysterious winter dying of the sun was also arrested. The entire known world of two thousand years a go had its “Christmas without Christ”. The figure of Christ was drawn in all its chief feat ures before a line of th e gospels was written, unarguably in the details relevant to Christmas. The first symbol of the Christian religion, the manger or basket cradle of the divine child, the supposed unique exhortation to humility, was one of the most familiar religious emblems of th e Pagan world. Had it been exhibited to a crowd in one of the cosmopolitan cities of the Empire, it would have been strange or new to few. One might pronounce it Horus, another Hermes, anothe r Dionysos, but all would have shrugged their"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"shoulders nonchalantly at the news that it was just another divine sun child in the great family of gods. The world flowed on. The names only were changed. The identity of these old traditions with Chri stmas are no longer disputed by scholars. Only ignorant fundamentalist ministers and some barm y priests of other denominations deny it. The celebrations of the birthdays of Mithras and Horu s are as certain as the Saturnalia. Legends of the miraculous birth of gods, demigods, and heroes in the ancient world were as certain as that the Chaldeans knew astronomy and the Romans built tenement buildings. Christians never think it strange that the birth date of Jesus is also the birth date of many of the incarnated gods of antiquity. They never think it curious that it was for ancient astronomers when the old sun died and was re-bor n and a new sun began to climb again in the heavens. At the solstice, it seemed to hover at the same altitude in the sky for three days, the critical time in the slow decline and possible death of the sun. Then it began to rise on the 25 December, the great day of the sun’s rebirth. That Pagans venerated th e birthday of Christ as the birthday of their gods is beyond coincidence. Sun Gods Astronomically, the sun begins a new year of life at the winter solstice, a nd so the 25 December, or some day proximate to that date, was selected in remote antiquity fo r the celebration of God’s birthday, when sun gods were worshipped. At th e first moment after midnight of 24 December the nations of the East would rise to celebrate the arrival of 25 December, the birthday of their gods. At midnight on the twenty-fifth of the month, Savarana, which is our December, millions of Krishna’s disciples celebrated his birthday by decorating their houses with garlands and gilt paper, and giving presents to frie nds. The people of China also traditionally celebrated this day, closing their shops. Buddha is sa id to have been bor n on this day after the Holy Ghost had descended on his virgin mother Maya. The god of the Persians, Mithras, was born on the 25 December long before the coming of Jesus. The Egyptians celebrated this day as the birth da y of their great saviour Horus, the Egyptian god of light and son of a virgin mother, the queen of the heaven, Isis. Osiris, god of the dead and the"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"underworld in Egypt, another son of a holy virgin, was born on the 25 December. Adonis, revered as a dying and risi ng god among the Phrygians then the Greeks, was born on the 25 December. His worshippers held him a yearly fe stival representing his death and resurrection, in midsummer. Even the temple at Jerusalem was used to celebrate the birthday of the god Adonis in the years when Jesus might have been born, Herod being no Jew by conviction. The cave in Bethlehem which is said to have been th e birth place of Jesus was also previously a place in which the birthday of Adonis was celebrated. The Greeks celebrated the 25 December as the birt hday of Apollo, the gr eat sun god, and it was also the day upon which were cele brated, by their respective worshi ppers, the births of Adonis and of Mithras. That day was the birthday of Hercules, the son of their supreme god, Zeus, through the mortal woman Alcmene. Bacchus, th e god of wine and revelry among the Romans, known among the Greeks as Dionysos, was born on this day. The 25 December was so highly regarded as a day suitabl e for the birthday of a god that it wa s selected for the apotheosis of Alexander the Great when he was first acclaimed as God in the temple of Amon (Jupiter) in 322 BC. Mithras A prosperous Asiatic sun religion dwelt on the Va tican hill before the Popes commandeered it for Christianity. Mithras was an Aryan sun god, called by the Romans “t he Unconquerable Sun”. The reform of the Persian religion by Zoroas ter (Zarathustra) had put the ethical deity Ahuramazda so high above the old nature gods th at he was practically the one god. But Mithras stole upward, as gods do, and Persian kings of the fifth century BC put him on a level with Ahuramazda. The Persians conquered and ble nded with Babylon, and M ithras rose to the supreme position and became an intensely ethical de ity. He was, like Aten and Christ, the sun of the world. He sacrificed the pleasures of life, like Christ , but unlike Zeus. Mithraism spread rapidly, was respected, and was strikingly like Christianity. During the third and fourth centuries AD, Mithras had become the most important solar god in the Roman Empire. Drastic asceticism and purity were demande d of his worshippers. They were baptized in blood. They practiced the most severe austeri ties and fasts. They had a communion supper of bread and wine. They worshiped Mithras in under ground temples, artificial caves called grottos, which blazed with the light of ca ndles and reeked with incense. They celebrated the epiphany of this god, savi our of the world, on 25 December. Aurelian adopted the 25 December in 274 AD as the day to celebrate “ Natalis Solis Invicti ”, the birthday of Sol Invictus. As that day approached, near midnight of the 24th, Ch ristians might see the devotees of Mithras going to their temple on the Vatican, and at midnight it would shine with joy and light. The saviour of the world was born. He had been born in a cave, like so many other sun-gods, and some of the apocryphal gospels put the birth of Christ in a cave. He had had no earthly father. F Cumont, the great authority on Mithras, who it is now fashionable to di sparage, collected for us details about the Persian reli gion, and more than one of the Christian Fathers refers to the similarity of the two religions. Mithras had ha d 25 December as his birthday for ages. He was"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"eternal—the unconquered and unconquerable sun—the sun god as a spiritual god, with light as his emblem and honesty his supr eme command. What could the Ch ristians do? Nothing, until Constantine. Then they took 25 December, and Mithraic garb, customs and ritual, and so zealously dissolved the Mithraic religion into Ch ristianity that only scholars know anything about it. Horus A Roman writer of the fourth cent ury, Macrobius, in a work called Saturnalia (1:18) discusses the practice of representing th e gods in the temples as of different ages. He says: These differences of age refer to the sun, which seem s to be a babe at the winter solstice, as the Egyptians represent him in their temples on a certai n day, that being the shortest day, he is then supposed to be small and an infant. This is confirmed and elaborated by a Christian writer, the author of th e “Paschal Chronicle”, who says: “Jeremiah gave a sign to the Egyptian priests, saying that their idols would be destroyed by a child-saviour, born of a virgin and lying in a manger. That is why they still worship, as a goddess, a virgin-mother, and adore an infant in a manger. He wants to explain age old customs to which th eir god is indebted as imitations of their own much later god. The stories of Jesus and Horus, the god in question, are similar. Horus was a sun god of the Egyptians. In the ad justment of the rival Egyptian gods, when the tribes were amalgamated in one kingdom, about 3000 years be fore Jesus was born, Horus was made the son of Osiris and Isis. In the Egyptian religion that emerged from the s yncretism, Osiris, a supreme and transcendental god who had acquired the attributes of most ot her Egyptian gods, was the father of Horus. Among his many titles were Lord of Lords, King of Kings, God of Gods, the Resurrection and the Life, the Good Shepherd, Eternity and Ever lastingness, the god who “made men and women to be born again.” He became Serapis in the Hellenistic period, a god much like the Christian concept of Yehouah. Horus and his Father, Osiris, were even interchangeable, reminding us that Jesus said: I and my Father are one. Osiris was a god who suffered at the hands of th e evil Set—another Asiatic god conceived of as the brother of Osiris—died and ro se again, to reign eternally over the souls of the righteous dead. He is depicted as dark in complexion, suggesting he is the sun of night or winter, the gentle sun of the ANE who is father of th e sun of the horizon, the sun that daily pa sses from the eastern horizon to the western one. His worshippers believed that, like their god, they would inherit eternal life. Some say Osiris’s coming was a nnounced by the “Three Kings” or the “Three Wise Men”—the three stars Mintaka, Anilam and Alnitak in the belt of Orion, wh ich point di rectly to Osiris’s star in the east, Sirius (Sothis), the sign of his birth. Osiris typified the Christian idea of a"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"messiah, a saviour god, rather than the Jewish idea of a conqueri ng king. His flesh was also eaten in the form of communion cakes of wheat, the plan t of truth, just as Christians devour wafers which are the body of their saviour god. In the bible, Psalms 23 is an Egyptian appeal to Osiris. A hymn to Osiris as the Good Shepherd begs him to lead the deceased to the green pastures and still waters of Paradise, the nefer-nefer or most beautiful land, to restore the soul to th e body and give protection in the valley of the shadow of death (the Tuat). Be fore the Lord’s Prayer, an Egyp tian hymn to Osiris-Amun (Amen) began, “O Amen, O Amen, who art in heaven.” Amen was also invoked at the end of every prayer. It was later rationalized, in Judaism, into a nod of assent si gnifying “Truly” or “Verily”. Horus was born of the virgin Isis-Meri, Isis the Beloved, on 25 December. Like his father, his birth was announced by that star in the east (Sothis) and attended by the three wise men. Isis was the sister and the lover of Osir is, but whether we should speak of her as “a virgin mother” is a matter of words. In one Egyptian myth she was f ecundated by Osiris in their mother’s womb, in another and more popular, she was miraculously impregnated by contact with the false phallus of the dead Osiris. Virginity in goddesses is a mythical virtue not a practical one. It is as real as the eternal life that all of these speculative religions promise. Why should Pagan beliefs have to be used to explain the Christian vi rgin birth myth? The Septuagint plainly, but in a false translation, said, “A virgin shall conceive”, and this was taken to refer to the Messiah. Moreove r, if Jesus despised conjugal relations, as early Christians believed, they could not accept that he, as a god, w ould have chosen the vile union necessary to enter the world. The early Christians in whose circles the gospel stories developed, will have seen this as an implication their God was virgin born, like the equivalent Pagan legends. It would have seemed a necessity of a ny god in the Hellenistic world. The birthday of Horus was annually celebrated in the temples, about 25 December. A figure of Horus as a baby was laid in a manger, in a scenic reconstruction of a stable , and a statue of Isis was placed beside it. In the catacombs at Rome are pictures of the baby Horus being held by the virgin mother Isis—the original Madonna and Child. Horus was the rising sun, the sun of the east. He was the daily saviour of mankind, saving us from perpetual darkness. He was the light of the world. His birth festival was a Christmas without Christ. This spectacle is still presented in every chur ch in the world on 25 December. Catholic priests have taught their flocks to believe S Francis of Assisi invented this touching scene of the humble birth of the redeemer. Francis of Assisi will never have read the obscure “Paschal Chronicle”, but some other Christian writer had seen and re produced it, and it had come to the knowledge of S Francis. Christ’s crib is an exact reproduction of the scene exhibited in Egyptian temples centuries before Christ, and the Egyptian legend it self is thousands of ye ars older than Jeremiah. On the analogy of the Christian practice, the Egyp tian legend must have described Isis as having given birth to her divine son in a stable. In Al exandria, there was a similar Greek celebration on 25 December of the birth of a divine son to Kore (the “Virgin”). And this is not the end. The Greeks had a simila r celebration. The idea of a divine son being born in a cave was common, or there were actually several scenic represen tations of the birth of these"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"gods in their festivals. J M Robertson gives some in Christianity and Mythology . Hermes, the Logos (like Jesus in John), the messenger of the gods, son of Zeus and the virgin Maia, was born in a cave, and he performed extraordinary prodi gies a few hours after bi rth. He was represented as a “child wrapped in swaddling clothes and ly ing in a manger”. Dionysos (Iacchos, Bacchus) was similarly represented. The image of him as a ba be was laid in a basket cradle in the cave in which he was born. God’s Birthday Why was the “only true god” born on a Pagan date—25 December? There is no reason to suppose that Jesus the Na zarene was born on Christmas Day. The birth date of Jesus is unknown. Both the year and the day of his birth are unknown. Neither the New Testament nor later tradition provide reliable evid ence. The Christian world had no chronology. There is no clue in the gospels as to the date when Jesus was born, except Luke’s reference to shepherds watching their flocks by night, if that can be considered as evidence. Certainly, if shepherds were out at night watchi ng their flocks, it could not have been in mid-winter that the birth took place. Winter is the rainy season, and even in Palestine flocks are folded at that time of the year, and not roaming about in the rain and sleet accompanied by cold and damp shepherds. Mary forgot the date of a unique ly wonderful day or forgot to mention it. Admittedly, poor and illiterate parents in undeveloped societies do not remember the dates when their children were born and often do not even remember the year—simple people are not ruled by clocks and calendars as we are. But, if, as Acts claims, Mary, Jesus’s mother, lived with the disciples after the crucifixion, she never told them when her son was born, and this is surprising even for a poor person considering the interest shown by ki ngs, shepherds and angels at the time. Indeed, the traditional Christmas story stands in curious isolation from the rest of the New Testament . Neither Jesus himself, when grown up, nor his earliest fo llowers claimed authority on the grounds of a special form of birth. The apostle Paul, in his ex tensive writings, discusses in detail the nature of Jesus w ithout once mentioning a miraculous birth. It was only on later generations that the stor y of a miraculous baby adored in a stable by shepherds and kings began to make an impact. To this day it inspires art, poetry and a salutary humility in the lives of many, but Mary could have experienced none of it because the gospels indicate that she had no recollection of it. Nor had the first Christians ever heard of it. Early Christians found themselves having to tell the world of the most tremendous birth there ever was on this planet not knowing when it happened. Christian scholars of the first two centuries ev en differed over the year Jesus was born, some believing that he was born fully twenty years befo re the currently accepted date. Centuries after the event, the year of Christ ’s birth was determined but was determined wrongly. Nobody now holds that Jesus was born in the year 1 AD. Our calendar, which com putes years supposedly from the birth of Jesus, was drawn up by a miscal culating monk in Italy in the sixth century. The miscalculation is obvious in that, on the basis of the New Testament story, Jesus must have been born by 4 BC, the year when Herod died."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Considering that an omnipotent God descended from heaven and performed astounding miracles to proof that people could now be saved in ev erlasting life, it seems odd that no one noted the year of his birth, even though ma ny beings from shepherds to angels knew about it. The Holy Ghost was being his usual incompetent self. This should be sufficient to banish all faith in Christianity. No event of Christian history was marked by jus tifiable dates for nearly four hundred years. For these first three or four hundred years, various Churches celebrated the birthday of Jesus on different dates. The day chosen as the birthda y of Christ was the day which best fitted the doctrines of that Church, not the day upon wh ich Jesus had actually been born. No one knew what day that was, but nobody cared. What was im portant was to select an auspicious and a suitable date. The eastern Churches kept it on 6 January, now the Epiphany. The Basilidians celebrated Christ’s birthday on the 24 or 25 April. Other Christian sects celebrated it, so Clement of Alexandria informs us, on the 25 May. Perhaps they believed that Jesus’s birth date wa s irrelevant—only his divi ne life was relevant and that began at his baptism. Sadly, they di d not know the date of the baptism either and arbitrarily chose 6 January. Why? Because that date had long been associated with people bathing in blessed water. Followers of the god Osir is, the deity of the Nile, had held a festival, the “Festival of the Immersion”, on the river on 6 January from time immemorial. Christian Copts celebrate it still. The Hi erophant poured holy water into the river and blessed it, then people bathed in it. The Greeks id entified Dionysos with Osiris and so on 6 January the sacred waters were blessed in both the religions of Os iris and Dionysos! Epiphany is a continuation of these Pagan rites. The Egyptian Gnostics known as Basilidians, s eeing the immersion ceremonies as a symbol of the baptism of Jesus, celebrated it on 6 January and gr adually Christians elsewhere adopted this date as the anniversary of the Jesus’s baptism. By 386 AD the two great Ch ristian festivals were Easter, the festival of the crucifixion, and Epip hany when rivers and sp rings were blessed and water was drawn and saved for baptisms throughout the year. Aristides Rhetor in about 160 AD tells us that water drawn from the Nile at the “Festival of the Imme rsion” is at its purest. Stored in wine jars, he says, it improves with time just like wine. And so does the myth! Two centuries later Epiphanius writes that the stored water actually changes into wine ! In Dionysos worship, water turns to wine on 6 January. The miracle at Cana when Jesus turned water into wine is celebrated in the Christian calendar on 6 January! Today the Epiphany celebration is most closely associated with th e visit of the Magi at Jesus’s birth and has been since the fourth century AD. Magi were Persian priests so it seems likely that the legend was introduced from Mithras worship, originally a Persian religion. The Epiphany of Mithras was observed by shepherds who brought gifts, as in the Luke version of Jesus’s birth. Rather than merely equalling a rival, the editor who inserted the birth narrative into Matthew took a more positive tack. He aimed to show the s uperiority of Christianity over the other eastern religions—the divine baby Jesus is superior to the divine Mithras whose priests bring gifts to the new god. So the three Zadokites who officiated at Jesus’s rebirth were adapted into Magi from Persia appearing at his actual bi rth to prove that even the pr iests of Mithras worshipped the Christian God."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Cassian at about the beginning of the fifth century says th e Egyptian provinces regarded Epiphany as being the birth date of Jesus. This was because Jesus was thought to be exactly 30 years old on his baptism. Note also that the Pe rsian law-giver Zoroaster was exactly thirty when the spirit of god des cended on him, and the Egyptian Ph araohs held a celebration called Sed exactly 30 years after the day they had been chosen by their father as his successor, their spiritual birthday. As many Churches commemorated the bi rth and the baptism of Christ on the same day, the festivals will have originated before any birth story was known, when the gospels began, like Mark , with the baptism of Jesus. On the day that Jesus was baptized, Christ was born. Christmas The chief mythical constituents of the life of Jesus were known all over the cosmopolitan Græco- Roman world, most particularly in the overlapping fringe of th e Græco-Roman and the Persian- Egyptian worlds—the eastern coast of the Med iterranean—where the gos pels were certainly composed. Whatever city we may favour as the cradle of the gospels, Alexandria or Antioch, Smyrna or Ephesus, every myth and ritual representation mentioned was familiar there. Mithraism spread from Persia to Britain. Roman soldiers prayed to Mithras in the towers in which they guarded the north of England from the marauding Scots. The religion of Isis and Horus was even more familiar round the Mediterr anean. The legend and ritual of Dionysos were hardly less familiar. Romans had celebrated this festival for centuries as Pagans. Every Roman was familiar from childhood with the great midwinter festival, and in the earliest da ys of the Christian era the religions of Persia and Egypt, w ith similar festivals, had spread over the Empire. So, from end to end of the Roman Empire, 25 December was the bi rthday of the unconquered sun, of the saviour Mithras, and of the divine Horus, and they and the others were represented almost exactly as the birth of Christ was described in the gospels a nd is depicted in Cat holic churches today. The Roman emperor, Constantin e—popularly considered the embodiment or incarnation of the supreme Roman sun god—Sol Invictus—later pres ided over the counci l of Nicea (325 AD) which lead to the official Christian recognition of the Trinity as the true nature of God. The importance of 25 December to Pagans made Christian converts think it must also be important to their newly adopted religion. They easily supposed it must have been the birthday of their messiah. Since his birth date had been for gotten, when Constantine made Jesus a god, 25 December was selected as his birthday, be cause it was the birthday of other gods, and particularly that of the chief rival to Christianity in the Ro man Empire, Mithras. The bishops were typically opportunistic. By celebrating at th e same time as Pagan religions they hoped to offer the same benefits and pull in some Pagan punters. Christmas remained the start of a new year up to the tenth century. In 336 or 354 AD, hoping to counteract the Mani chaean heresy—that Jesus was never born at all but was a phantasm—the Christians took the date of the solar birth as the birthday of Jesus. The solar celebration was so widespread and popular that the church c ould neither ban it, nor stop it being identified in the popular mind with Jesus’s birth anyway. Al most all religions have some root in primitive sun worship, and the Christ ians merely acknowledged a custom which the adherents of most of the contemporary religions had carried on for many centuries before that"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"time. Jesus was identified with the sun by bot h Cyprian and Ambrose. Jesus and Mithras had become almost identical in the minds of the western populace. Church leaders moved the date of Jesus’s birth “aft er the flesh” from 6 Janua ry to the birthday of the Unconquerable Sun. No evidence was quoted, nor any tradition appealed to, to show that the 25 December was the actual birthday. The only atte mpt made to show that Jesus was actually born upon 25 December, and that the origin of Christmas Day was not Pagan, was based on the Annunciation being the 25 March. From that date —itself selected upon doc trinal and not upon historical grounds—nine months leads to the 25 December, which would, if the Annunciation was a physiological process identi cal in its working with sexual conception, be th e correct date for the birth. As the 25 March was itself a da te inherited from Paganism, and not a date supported by evidence of any kind whatsoever, th e theory has not gained acceptance even among theologians. There was no universal agreement upon the 25 Decem ber as Christmas Day. The churches of the Eastern Empire accused the Western Church of idol atry and sun worship, and for long continued to observe Christmas Day on the 6 January. The Egyptians did the same until the year 431 AD. But even the 6 January was connected with the birthday of God. Epipha nius argued the birthday of Christ must be the 13th day after the 25 December, corresponding to days for the twelve apostles and Jesus himself, and bringing Chri stmas Day to the Epiphany, a day observed in Egypt as a festival of the Virgin, Kore Kosmou. 25 December was still listed as the “Birthday of the Unconquerable Sun” in the calendar of Philocalus in 336 AD, the year before Constantine died and a quarter of a century after he had supposedly made the empi re Christian, and the Emperor Honorius (395 to 423) coul d still speak of 25 December as being a “new” festival, yet a text of about the same time says it was one of the three great Christian festivals so holy that theatres had to close by law. Saint Augustine was one who did not approve of this particular concession to Paganism. Christians were never too keen on following the instructions of their holy texts though they usually made a great show of studying them. Had they taken notice they could not have taken these Pagan practices into the di vine religion of Essenism. The sc riptures warned against it quite explicitly: “Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou inqu ire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise. Deut 12:30 It was hard for the gentile Christian converts though. They had lately been celebrating these festivals and all their friends still were. So they thought—“What does it matter?” New religions inherit or copy the jdoctrines a nd festivals of the old. The Moslem month of Haj is celebrated at the time of the year when pre-Moslem Pagan fes tivals had previously been held, and the ancient Pagan rites are still carried out during the Haj cele brations. The ritual rema ins, the explanation of it changes. The clergy tell us the explanation is a myth in Paganism, but the revealed truth in their patriarchal religion! Christia n ministers have been so flexible in the face of serious rivalry"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"as to be unprincipled. Yet in the face of weak or isolated rivals, it has applied the devil’s own punishments as if they were the guardians of hell not heaven. For Christians, Christ was the real sun that had risen upon the world. Why not boldly pinch the birthday of the unconquered sun? The masses could th en be told they were celebrating Jesus. The ribaldry, license and fooling were contrary to Essenic, now Christian, prudery, but despite attempts to stop it all, it tha nkfully persists until today. When we celebrate Christmas we continue the pr actice of hundreds of gene rations of our remote ancestors, who held festivals at that season every year for many centuries before Christianity had ever been heard of. The harmless festivities of Christmastide, and the spirit of peace and goodwill with which they are traditionally associat ed, are customs and feelings which it would be sad to see forgotten or eradicated. Peace and goodwill reign more easily when the followers of all the religions join together and celebrate the return of the sun and the beginning of a new year, than when theologians assemble to decry the idolat ry of others and to wr angle about which of the gods were really born on the 25 December. Christmas is not the only Christian fe stival which ignored the warning of Deuteronomy , and was stolen from ancient Paganism and adapted to the E ssenism of Jesus. There is also Easter. Easter, roughly corresponding with th e vernal equinox was al so a time of festival for the followers of many ancient religions, but the period of th e year in which Easter is celebrated does correspond with the biblioal story, as the crucifixion is said to have taken place at the time of the Passover, the two events being theologically parallel. Yet Christians spilt torrents of each other’s blood in quarrels about the fixing of the date of Easter , and accepted Christmas Day without much demur. The Feast of S John, the Holy communion, the Annunc iation of the virgin, the assumption of the virgin, and many others have th eir roots in ancient Pagan wors hip. Midsummer Da y is the Feast of S John the Baptist and is dedicated also to saints Philip and James. Saints Peter, James, Andrew and Paul were given uni mportant days even though we are told they were Christ’s Apostles. Virgin Birth How did it arise? One answer is that it was th e work of an all-powerful God intervening in human affairs. For believers, in theological “logi c”, such a statement is impregnable, but it is insufficient for those who demand natural explanti ons using standard historical methods. Recent scholarship, assisted by the Dead Sea Scrolls , has thrown much new light on the nature of the Judaism which produced the Christian “Jesus of Nazareth”. To understand the beginings of Christianity one must first understand the Jews of the first century AD. Little in the New Testament is there by accident. Most of thes e writings has a purpose, but the authors of the New Testament had habits of thought which were alien to those of the twentieth century. They considered it legitimate to describe what ought to have happened without bothering too much about what did . They accepted the Jesus was the Messiah and so messianic things must have happened to him!"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The sources for our Christmas st ory are the opening chapters of Matthew and Luke . The other two gospels, Mark and John , do not mention it at all, no r does any other part of the New Testament . The authors of Matthew and Luke were evidently writing from different viewpoints— Matthew was aimed at a Jewish readership and Luke at a gentile one. Their acc ounts of what ought to have happened are also differe nt and inconsistent. In Matthew , the story is of a virgin, Mary, betrothe d to a man called Joseph. Both, apparently, are residents of Bethlehem. Mary becomes pregnant and Joseph is assured in a dream that this is the work of the Holy Ghost and so he does not put her away. The baby is born in the ordinary way—with no mention of a stable or a manger—a nd soon afterwards the fa mily is visited by wise men from the east who bring gifts. King Her od hears from the wise men of the birth of a royal pretender and orders all in fants in Bethlehem to be slaughtered. But Joseph gets a warning in a dream of Herod’s intentions and escapes with his family to Egypt. La ter, on the inspiration of another dream of Joseph’s, the family settles in Nazareth. The Luke account, on the other hand, has no wise men, no slaughter of the innocents, no flight to Egypt and no dreams by Joseph. Here, a virgin, Mar y, is betrothed to Joseph, both of them living in Nazareth. Mary becomes pregna nt after a direct revelation to her from an angel. Joseph’s reaction is unrecorded. Because of a unique form of census, Joseph has to go from Nazareth to his ancestral town, Bethlehem, to be regi stered. There is no evidence, apart from Luke , that such a strange census ever took place. It would have been a chaotic affair, uncharacteristic of the Bomans. In Bethlehem, Joseph and Mary find th e inn full up and the baby is born in a stable. Shepherds learn of the birth from an angel and go to the stable to be the first to adore Jesus. Matthew tries to relate the circumstances of the birt h of Jesus to traditions associated with the births of other Jewish holy men, notably Moses. These traditions are to be found both in the Old Testament and among non-scriptural Jewish legends. The Old Testament version of Moses is that he was born at a time when Pharaoh was slanghter ing Jewish male babies . His mother saved him by hiding him among reeds on the edge of the rive r. Non-biblical writings supplemented this account by telling how both Pharao h and Moses’s parents learnt through dreams of the future greatness of the infant. The parallel between the in fancy stories is more than a coincidence. Similarly, the star, the wise men, the placing of th e birth at Bethlehem and Joseph’s descent from the royal House of David are all fitted to Jewi sh tradition and scriptural prophecies. The reasoning of the writer and the early editors of th e script appears to have been that Jesus the Nazarene by his life has shown himself to be the Lord’s Messiah, so, his birth must have been in accordance with Old Testament prophecies. Individual Old Testament passages, collected together and interpreted in ways which then were normal, were picked out to form a birth story. The Luke story is more consistent than that of Matthew and less related to Jewish requirements. It relies upon angels as messengers instead of upon dreams. It gives an ac tive role to Mary and minimises Joseph. It also gives Joseph’s genealogy but with the names, even that of his father, completely different from Matthew’s version. The stable and the shepherds have little theological purpose except to copy other religions. The story creaks only in the census, which is"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"a way of setting the birth in Bethlehem rather than Nazareth. Both the Matthew and Luke birth stories are apparently the newest part of the New Testament . Even after they were first written new material continued to be added. However, the virgin birth was not to be found in Jewish tradition, but only in gentile Pagan mythology. Mainstream Jews, unlike some Paga n groups, attached no religious value to virginity, though one sec tion of the Essene sect, describe d in the Dead Sea Scrolls, had introduced to Judaism the practice of celibacy. So me Jewish heroes had been born of mothers who had passed the ordinary ag e for child-bearing, as with Sa rah and Isaac or Hannah and Samuel. There was a special divine providence to “open the womb” but no suggestion that a human father was unnecessary. Matthew is far from clear on the “v irgin” birth. What exactly wa s a “virgin” in those times? There were two definitions. The first corresponde d to the modern one, that of a girl whose hymen remained intact, but a second appear s in the earliest Jewish legal codes, the Tosephta and the Mishnah , both of which belong to the first two centuries AD. One rabbi quoted in the Tosephta is Eliezer, who was flourishing in the pe riod 90-l30 AD. Eliezer is asked: “Who is a virgin?” His answer is: “She w ho has never seen blood, even if she is married and has had children”. The Mishnah, the main rabbinical work of the same period, fits in with this. A virgin is “she that has never yet suffered a flow, even though she was married”. These statements reflect the Jewish distaste for me nsruation inherited from the Persian religion. In this period, if a man touched a menstruating woman, even accidentally, he was accounted defiled. In Jesus’s time it was possible for a woman to b ear children without ever having menstruated. A girl was counted marriageable when she was 12 years old and many girls were married at that age. Many such young wives would not have reach ed puberty in those times when food was harder to come by and everyday lif e harder than today. They c ould have been experiencing sex with their husbands without ha ving yet ovulated. At their fi rst ovulation they could have conceived a child. To be “born of a virgin” in this sense mi ght have been not uncommon, but might have marked out sons as specially holy because they had been born of a woman who had never been defiled by menstruation. How did the non-Jewish theme of a supern atural virgin birt h take root in Matthew ? The question is especially puzzling in view of the pains taken in the opening verses, befo re the virgin birth is mentioned, to set out Jesus’s genealogy, the pur pose of which was to prove that Jesus was Joseph’s son and an heir of the House of Da vid. The relevant passag e ends: “...Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary. Of her was born Jesu s”. This, in various translations, is the accepted, orthodox text of Matthew . But in one very early version, discovered during the nineteenth century, the relevant passage states specifically: “Joseph, to whom was betrothed the virgin Mary, begot Jesus”. A possible clue to why the virgin birth got in to the text can be found in Matthew’s quotation from Isaiah : “The virgin will conceive and bear a son”. This, at first sight, would appear to bring the idea of a virgin bi rth within the range of Jewish pr ophecy, but the quotation is based on a mistranslation. In the original He brew, the passage refers not to a “virgin” in any sense of the word but to a “young woman”. The word “virgin” crept in by error in the Greek translation, the"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Septuagint . The existence of this error is accepted t oday by all scholars, including the Roman Catholic ones who prepared the Jerusale m Bible. “Virgin” is no longer used in Isaiah , although necessarily it has to be retained in Matthew’s quotation of it. But once the word “virgin” became part of the Greek version of Matthew , it is easy to imagine a non-Jewish person taking it lite rally, and erecting a theology upon it. The process would have been the more obvious because he was accustomed to myths of supernatural births. The Greek hero Hercules, to take only one example, was supposed to have been born of a union of Zeus with a mortal woman. Astronomical Origin of the Virgin Birth The tradition of divine saviours being born of undeflowered women has an astronomical aspect. It has been said: “The adventures of Jesus Christ ar e all depicted among the stars, and this is why the Romans saw him as a sun god like Mithras with whom he eventually became identified. The myth of the Star of Bethlehem comes from the prophecy of Numbers 24:17: There shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Seth. This is a text often quoted by Christian writers as having a prophetic reference to the Christian Messiah. The same text goes on to say, “It shall destroy the childre n of Seth”, a prophecy which is plainly false if it is meant, like the rest of it, to apply to Jesus Christ. This prophecy is obviously a prophecy of a tradit ional victorious messiah of Israel, modelled on king David. The star of Jacob or Judah, both being the same, is shown on astronomical maps as prominent in the constellation Virgo, the Virgin, called by the Hebrews, Ephraim. It was known in the Syrian, Arabian and Persian Systems of astronomy as Mess aeil and was considered the ruling genius of the constellation. Messaeil is “Messa El” (The Anointed or Son of Go d)—apparently the star, Spica. The star of Jacob was evidently a figure from astrology, in which the virgin is shown rising with an infant son of God in her arms. The virgin, with her god-begotten child, the bright st ar, Spica, represented as an ear of corn (the meaning of the name of the star), was pictured in the heavens from time immemorial. They are present in the Hindu zodiac, at least three thous and years old, and in the ancient Egyptian one. Virgo commences rising at midnight, on the 25 December, with this star in the east in her arms— the star which piloted the wise men. Accord ing to Albertus Magnus, in his Book on the Universe: The sign of the celestial virgin rises above th e horizon, at the moment we find fixed for the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Sir William Drummond adds in Œdipus Judaicus : The anointed of El, the male infant, who rise s in the arms of Virgo, was called Jesus by the Hebrews... and was hailed as the anointed king or Messiah. Now though the sun is annually reborn on the date chosen for Christ’s birth, 25 December, the midwinter solstice, for a period the sun was also born at the autumnal equinox as the infant son of God, the “bread of life”. This is the time of the original Jewish New Year, Rosh ha Shanah, 1 Tishri, the religious new year as opposed to the civil new year which began on 1 Nisan. Rosh ha Shanah was designated in Jewi sh religious law as a festival and a time of great rejoicing. Paradoxically it was also the Day of Judgement because it was an annive rsary of the creation. This is the real date of the birth of Chri st, if Christians want to celebrate it. The reason is that in the centuries ending the first millenium BC the precession of the equinoxes led to a curious celestial event. The child of the cosmic virgin, Spica, rose on the Eastern horizon at the autumnal equinox at the sa me time as the sun. So after the conste llation of the virgin had risen just before dawn in the east, the sun rose just when the bright star Spica was expected to rise. It seemed as if the son of the virgin, the ea r of corn symbo lising the bread of life (Rosh ha Shanah celebrated the beginning of the agricultu ral year), had risen as the glorious sun. The virgin had given birth to a god. What was even more spectacular on some of th ese occasions was that the morning star, Venus, the Queen of Heaven, rose in the constellation of Virgo before the sun! So the sun rises as the child of the virgin Queen of H eaven over the eastern horizon, appearing out of the sea in many countries. In Latin, sea is “mare” whence Maria or Mary. The infant god arises as the light of the East in the arms of his mother, Mary or Venus, the morning star, which rises minutes before the child. Also interesting is the fact that the Virgin in an cient zodiacs is associated with a tree, in which case the son would be an offshoot, a shoot or a br anch, all of which were messianic names, and the word Nazarene comes from the word “neser” meaning a branch. The messianic name, Shiloh, which puzzled scholars for a long time also means branch and therefore m eans the star, Spica. When the branch or son of the virgin appears as the light of the east in all his glory then the messiah has been born. Whence: We have seen his star in the east , and have come to worship him. Mt 2:8 This phenomenon occurred in 11 BC and 3 BC and eith er event might have been associated with Jesus, though the earlier one is the favourite. The Essenes who were as trologers trained in Babylonian exile would have seen all this. It later escaped into the empire as literal truth instead of the astrological signs it originally was. The story of the slaughter of the innocents is also widespread because origin ally it was again part of the allegory of the sun’s journey through the heavens. When the sun passed through the constellation of Gemini in May, he was imagined to have destroyed them. The Greek word to"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"destroy is “anaireo” which literally means “to pass through” or “withdraw from” as well as “to take away”. The sun takes on the characteristics of each constellation it proceeds through so here Hercules is an infant twin. In myth that is, of course, what he was, his brother being Iphicles. So Hercules was a sun god who in his journey through the heavens threatens to kill himself as an infant of the constellation, Gemi ni. His earthly, adopted father had to flee with him and his mother to Galem for protection from threateni ng danger. Herod’s name suggested a link with Hercules so he fitted appropriately into the legend. Jesus was, of course, supposed to have had a twin brother, Thomas. Pharaoh’s slaughter of the childr en, Christians believe, is referre d to in the bible when Rachel weeps for her children, a passage introduced by: In Rama, there was a voice heard. Note that “Rama” is the Indian and Phoenican name for the zodiac, and that Rachel had two children only—Joseph and Benjamin—equivalent to Castor and Pollux. Rachel then was the queen of heaven, Venus, because for the Assyrian s and the Phoenicians she wept when the sun passed through the astronomical twins, the cons tellation of Gemini, doubtless fearing their destruction. The stories of gods cohabiting with virgins, and begetting other gods, are of astronomical origin. Astronomy and religion were interwove n at an early period of time. The whole story of Jesus cannot be reduced to so lar mythology. Once the crucifixion legend of the historic Jesus had been carried into the Pagan empire he came to be understood as a sun god. He collected bits of sun god my thology, but some people today, stra in to explain every element of the biography of Jesus in th e gospels in terms of sun myt hology. There is plainly a genuine story of a living human at the core of the gospels, most clearly s een unadorned in Mark’s gospel. This was its novelty—here was a s un god that had lived on earth recently! But the Christians, largely ignorant people at first, fell for the cosmic Christ co mpletely. They believed the cosmic Christ, the sun god, had actually ap peared on earth recently and sacr ificed himself, like the gods of the mysteries. The Gnostics said to the Christians: You poor ignoramuses ( idiotai ), you have mistaken the mysteries of old for modern history, and accepted literally all th at was only meant mystically. "},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The Trappings of Christmas The Star What are the origins of the various ingredient s of the now traditional nativity scene? The traditional nativity scene, shown in thousands of pictures, models and p1ays, rests upon no single authority. It is a synthesis of di fferent traditions brought together over the centuries. S Francis of Assisi in 1224 AD was the first to introduce a cr ib into church. The sources of the various elements are: • Matthew provides the star and the wise men and also Herod’ s massacre of the innocents, and the flight to Egypt • Luke provides the stable, the mange r, angels and the shepherds • Various later speculations provide the ox, the as s, the wise men shown as three kings and Joseph shown as a white bearded old man. The star is an emblem which appears over and over again in Jewish t hought of the period. It dated back to the prophecy of Balaam in the Book of Numbers , “A star shall come forth out of Jacob”. In the Dead Sea Scrolls , one of the expected messiahs is cal led “the star” an d he is to be the interpreter of the Law. The messianic Simon bar Kosiba, who led the Jews in revolt against the Romans in 132-135 AD, was nicknamed “Son of the Star” and the coins he minted showed the Jewish temple with a star. "},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Wise Men The Greek word for wise men in Matthew really signifies astrologers. “From the East” means from Mesopotamia or Persia, the home of the Zoro astrian faith, a religion which, with its angels, its conflict between darkness a nd light and its teaching on the im mortality of the human soul, preceded Judaism. Heaven and hell we re originally, Zoroastrian ideas. In mainstream Christian tradition, the wise me n are called kings although it has no scriptural warranty. The presumed sources were Isaiah : “The nations come to your light and kings to your dawning brightness” and Psalms 72: “The kings of Sheba and Seba will offer gifts; all kings will do him homage”. So the wise men became kings. The ox and the ass in the stable also have no New Testament basis. They will have been from Isaiah : “The ox knows its ow ner and the ass its master’s crib”. Then it is customary for Jo seph to be depict ed as an elderly man, again without New Testament warranty. But, as with so much else, this is not accidental. It arose because of the orthodox Christian theology that Mary remain ed perpetually a virgin. Since the New Testament refers plainly to Jesus’s brothers, Joseph had to have been a widower who had already had a family and that the brothers were really only half-brothers. An elde rly man fits this image. The complete development of th e classic Christmas scene took many centuries. In the early Church the feast of the Epiphany, commemorating the wise men and Jesus’s baptism, was more important than Jesus’s birthday. It was not unt il about 330 AD that Christmas was recognised as a feast. The importance of it gr ew as part of a conscious polic y of Christianising the Pagan midwinter rites which had already long existed. The first model crib, for placing in church, appears to have been made by S Fran cis of Assisi as late as 1224. So by a rich combination of tr adition, legend and interpretation there developed the Christian Christmas. "},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Santa Claus The present red-robed figure of Father Christmas is a combination of three traditions: Christian, Pagan and commercial. The latest addition to the Father Christmas legend came as recently as 1939 with “Rudolph the Red- nosed Reindeer”. On the Christian side, Father Christmas is S Ni cholas, an old man who was Bishop of Myra in Asia Minor in the fourth cen tury. Although he was bad-temper ed, he was kind-hearted and became the patron saint of children. Up to the ni neteenth century, pictures showed S Nicholas distributing gifts to children wearing not a Santa Claus outf it but bishop’s vestments. The Pagan Father Christmas was a more sinister figure, connected in southern Europe with the god Saturn and with fertil ity rites. There were al so Nordic legends of a mysterious personality who appeared in midwinter. The Lapps had the “Yule Swain”, an 11 foot high giant who rode around on a goat on the days before Christmas. The present stereotype of Santa Claus, a jolly ge ntleman with a white beard, red robe and sledge with reindeer, was a nineteenth-century American invention, the definitive pictures being drawn by the commercial artist Thomas Nast (1840-19 02 AD). Around Nast’s Sant a Claus gathered a sub-Christian theology that he was a universal spirit of love and goodwill. The New York Sun printed every Christmas for half a century the seme reply to a little girl who had written in to ask if Santa Claus really existed. Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist. I and you know that they abound and give to your life its highest beauty and joy. According to European customs, especially in France, the Netherlands and Hungary, S Nicholas had distributed gifts to good children on his feast day, 8 Dece mber. Accompanying him on his rounds was an assistant with a birch rod. Child ren who had been naughty during the year got a whipping instead of presents. The new Santa Clau s was transferred to Christmas Eve, and gave"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"presents to all children, good and bad. A quite sepa rate tradition of Christmas gifts was that of masters rewarding their servants and other people of inferior status. The recipients carried around “boxes” into which employers were expected to drop coins. So, 26 December was called “boxing day”. Snow and Stagecoach The modern image of a “white Christmas” spra ng up during the nineteenth century, mainly for decorative reasons. The familiar Christmas card scene of a stagecoach might be a recollection of the great frost of 1847 when many coaches got stuck in drifts and Christmas mails were delayed. Robin and Wren The wren and robin redbreast, which appear on so many Christmas cards, also reflect folk- memories. Since pre-Christian time s, people have been superstitious about the wren, the tiny bird with a big voice. It was a sacred bird which flew higher than any other bi rd by sitting on the back of an eagle before taking off on its own, an d which could be hunted only on one day, in midwinter. The ceremony of hunting the wren on 26 December lasted at least into the nineteenth century. In Wales, the dead wren was ceremoni ally carried in a decorated wren house. Because of its tameness, the robin was regarded as a friend of man and it supposedly took part in church services and funerals. Stor ies about the robin and the wren a ppear to have come to Britain from the Mediterranean dur ing the Bronze Age. They are linked together in the ol dest of nursery rhymes, “The Marriage of Cock Robin and Jenny Wren”, and its better-known sequel, “Who Killed Cock Robin?” Both are adaptations of ancient traditions it is now impossible to reconstruct. "},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Christmas Tree Christmas festivals today incorporate many othe r Pagan customs, such as the use of holly, mistletoe, Yule logs, and wassail bowls. The cu stom, from Germany but of Aryan origin, of bringing an evergreen tree into the home and festooning it with lights, candies and gifts became popular in Britain in th e mid-nineteenth century, partly be cause of the example set by Queen Victoria and the German Prince Consort, Albert . The Christmas tree is the most obvious aspect of ancient Pagan celebrations which were later incorporated into church rites. Only in the last 50 years or so has developed the cheerful custom of householders placing it in a window so it is visible in the street. Be hind it is the pre-Christian cults of Germanic tribes in the forests of Prussia and Central Europe. The Christian celebration was originally derive d in part from rites held by pre-Christian Germanic and Celtic peoples to celebrate the wint er solstice. The Christmas fir tree, because it keeps its green needles throughout the winter m onths, was believed by pre-Christian Pagans to have special powers of protection ag ainst the forces of nature and ev il spirits. Particular trees and groves were accounted sacred and could be approached only by pr iests. The Christmas tree is derived from the so-called paradi se tree, symbolizing Eden, of Ge rman mystery plays. The use of a Christmas tree began early in the seventeenth century, in Strasbourg, France, spreading from there through Germany, into norther n Europe and Great Britain, and then on to the United States. "},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Yule Log The burning of the yule log, a custom which last ed into the present cen tury and is still not entirely extinct, was a ceremonial way of producing midwinter heat and light and had sacrificial significance. To an accompaniment of jollity, th e log was dragged into the house on Christmas Eve and set to burn throughout the feast. The word “Yule” is of Norse orig in and refers to the midwinter festival. For many cen turies it has existed in the E nglish language as a recognised alternative to Christian terms. The seventeenth century Puritans who, under Crom well, tried to ban Christmas celebrations for being both Popish and Pagan, us ed as one motto: “Yule-tide is fool-tide”. They made it a criminal offence to eat mince pies. The word “Noe l” may mean the start of the New Year, but for at least eight centuries it has been used as a musical shout of joy for the birth of Jesus. Mistletoe This parasitic growth, with its white berries, is more heavily loaded with Paganism than any other Christmas emblem. As far back as history goe s, it has been held in superstitions awe. Early Christians hated it and by canon la w they rigorously excluded it from church decorations. To this day many orthodox Christian clergy regard it as inco rrect, if not blasphemous , to place it within a church. The mistletoe has an ancient connexion with fertility rites, as the custom of kissing under the mistletoe dimly commemorates. The continua nce of such kissing reflects a triumph for tradition. The ancient British Druids, according to th e Roman naturalist, Pliny, used the juice as an aphrodisiac and a cure for sterility. More wide ly, it was used as a semi-magical cure for a variety of ailments. Even today it is used by pract itioners of witchcraft as one of their staple emblems. In the Middle Ages, Christians tried to bring it within their system by de vising the legend that the mistletoe was once a proper tree—the one used by the Romans for Jesus’s cross. As a"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"punishment it was shrivelled up and made parasitic. The creation of this legend illustrates the deep antipathy felt towards a plant that was widely regarded as an evil growth. Yet, in spite of long centuries of censure and disapproval on th e part of officialdom, mistletoe has stubbornly held its own as a midwinter decoration. Holly and Ivy The custom of bringing evergreens into the home fo r the midwinter festival dates back to before the dawn of known history. Because Christians ha ted mistletoe so much, they laid stress in particular on holly, the prickles and red berries being held to be emblematic of Jesus’s passion. Ivy was more simply of decorative value, anothe r alternative to mistleto e, though the bitterness of the berries was held to alle gorize the Passion. But holly is the main Christian decoration for both home and church. Addition by Larry Wright The worship of the Virgin Mary is, in all relevant details, the same as the worship of all the other Goddesses that were prevalent in the ancient world. Mary is Is is, or Venus, or Aphrodite, or Semiramis, et al... She is the “Q ueen of Heaven” or the “Mother of God”, or the “Star of the Sea”, or the “Immaculate Virgin”. The Mother and Child were worshipped in Babylon, as were Isis and Horus in Egypt. In Greece there was Ceres as the Great Mother with a babe at her breast, or Irene with Plutus, and even in China ther e was Shing Moo, also w ith a babe. The ancient Etruscans and Italians worshipped the goddess Nutr ia, who also had a son in her arms, and the Virgin mother Devaki suckled the divine Kr ishna. Minerva was honoured by the title “Virgin Queen”, as was Juno who was called the “Virgin queen of Heaven”. The Virgin Mary, the Grecian Venu s, and the Egyptian Isis et al ... are all Queens of the starry heavens, for they are all pers onifications of Virgo, the eter nal virgin of the zodiac. The constellation Virgo is a Y shaped group, which the st ar at the foot is the well known Spica, a star of the first magnitude. The whole resembles more a cup than the human figure, but when we remember the symbolic meaning of the “cup”, th at seems to be an obvious explanation of the name Virgo, which the constellation has borne sin ce the earliest times. Virgo lies very nearly on the ecliptic, that is the im agined path of the sun."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"In Egypt 3000 years ago, the birthday of the sun god was celebrated on the 25 December, the first day to noticeably lengthen after the day of the winter solstice—the 21 December. At the midnight hour on the first minutes of the 25 Decem ber the birthday of th e sun was celebrated. The sun was then in the zodiacal sign of Capricorn, then known as the Stable of Augeus, so the infant sun god was said to ha ve been born in a stable. Brightly shining on the meridian was Sirius—the “Star from the East”, while rising in the east was Virgo the Virgin of the zodiac, with the horizon passing through the centre of the constellation. It is this astronomi cal fact that is the basis of the many legends of virgin born world saviours. To the right of Sirius was the co nstellation Orion, “The Gr eat Hunter”, with three stars in his belt. These stars, in a straight line, point at Sirius and were anciently known as “The Three Kings”. Depicted in the Zodiac of the temple Denderah, the constellation Virgo was pictured as a woman with a spike of corn in on e hand, and on the adjacent margin the Virgin was denoted by a figure of Isis with Horus in her arms. Carpenter remarks: But it is well known as a matter of history that the worship of Isis and Horus descended in the early Christian centuries to Alexan dria, where it took the form of the worship of the Virgin Mary and the infant saviour, and so passed into the Eu ropean ceremonial. We ha ve therefore the Virgin Mary connected by linear succession and descent w ith that remote Zodiacal cluster in the sky! A curious confirmation of the same astrological connection is afforded by the Roman Catholic Calendar. For if this be consul ted, it will be found th at the festival of the Assumption of the Virgin is placed on the 15 August, while the festiv al of the birth of the Virgin is dated the 8 September... At the present day, the Zodiaca l signs— owing to the precession of the Equinoxes—have shifted some distance from the constellations of the same name. But at the time when the Zodiac was constituted and thes e names were given, the first date obviously would signalise the actual disapp earance of the cluster Virgo in the sun’s rays, i.e. the Assumption of the Virgin into the glory of th e god, while the second date would signalise the reappearance of the constellati on—or the birth of the Virgin. The Jews held that the time of the messiah’s advent was to be astrologically indicated by the conjunction of the planets Jupiter and Saturn, in the constellation of the Fishes. The prophecy related to the entrance of the vernal equinox into the zodiacal sign of Pisces the Fishes—due to the precession of the equinoxes—in approximately 255 BC. Bethlehem means the “The house of the bread corn”, in the mansions of the zodiac, Virgo is the place of the seed for sowing, and the opposite sign Pisces, is the mansion of the “Bringer forth in fruitfulness”, first set in heaven in accordance with the seasons of Egypt. The Hebr ew messiah was to be born in Bethlehem, because the birthplace above was localised in the c ity of Judea, the land of the solar birthplace in the sign of the Fishes. The ancient starry drama was pl ayed out yet again. At midnight on the 24th of December Virgo rose in the east and a new infant saviour wa s stable born. All the sins committed on earth gradually drifted down to Capric orn, hence the filthy condition of the stable, whose cleansing was one of the twelve zodiacal labours of He rcules, himself a sun god. The second-century church father Justin Martyr remarked that Christ was born when the sun had its birth in the Augean stable, Jesus coming as a second Hercules to cleanse the foul world. There is another stable in the constellation Auriga on either side of which are Taurus th e bull and Ursa Major,"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"known in Egypt as the “Ass of Typhon”. Here we ha ve the ox and ass of th e traditional nativity scene. It is also worth noting that the stars of the Great Bear were known to the Arabians as “Martha and Mary”, and also the “Coffin of Lazarus”. “The Three Kings”—the stars of Orion— the Magi from the east mentioned in the gospels ( Mt 2:11), at the birth of the sun god, came to pay ho mage, and bring gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. The reason for presenting these particular gi fts is explained by the fa ct that of the seven metals dedicated to the genie of the planets, gold was the one consecrated to the sun god, and frankincense and myrrh were the gums burnt in censers, at his worship. Despite their astral origins, Ch ristians later “disc overed” the bodies of Melchior, Gaspar and Balthassar; and placed them in their new cathedr al in Constantinople. From Constantinople the bones of the three kings were, as a special favour to Mi lan, allowed to be moved to that city. When Milan was captured by Frederick Barbaro ssa in 1162 AD, the Archbishop of Cologne persuaded the Emperor to transfer these relics to his cathedral; and there for the last eight centuries the bones have rested. The shrine of the “Three Kings” thereafter became one of the greatest treasures of Cologne cathedral. The Egyptian astrological elements in the stable myth are provided by Massey: “The manger is the celestial, zodiacal and the actual birthplace of the messiah in Egyptian mythology. The typical birthplace wa s designated Apt or Aptu, whence came the name of Abydus. Ap means to manifest and expos e to view, also to gui de; Apt is the place or person. Apt, as person, was the most ancient genitrix who first brought forth from the waters as the fish, dragon or hippopotamus, hence Aptu is the mythical fish. Apt as place was also the pool of two truths, the piscina of the beginning, which wa s made zodiacal at last in the sign of Pisces. Th e pool, fish, uterus and crib, ar e all types of the birthplace named apt, and the “apt” is also a manger. The manger, apt, is a sign of the birthplace in Thebes, as in Aptu (Abydus). Thus the hierog lyphics will explain why the divine child, as Ichthyus, was born in a manger. One position of the manger can be identified by the asterism called Proesepe, in the sign of Can cer, which was at one ti me the place of birth of the god at summer solstice. The manger at Bethlehem had been the birthplace of the divine babe in a far earlier cult. Hieronymu s describes the Syrian Adonis, extant in his time 331-420 AD and says that in the place where the redeemer cried in the manger, the lament of the women mourning for Adonis had been heard even in later times, as it assuredly had been in the pre-Christian period. According to the Chronicle Of Alexandria , the Egyptians not only consec rated the nativity of the new-born babe and the virgin mother, they had the symbolic custom of exposing a child in a crib to the adoration of the people. When Ptolemy as ked why this was done, he was informed that it was an ancient mystery—the crib or Apt being iden tical to the manger, thus being the same babe in the manger—that was born in the Apt above. It is clear that the worship of the virgin mother was a common practice in the ancient world. In the sixth or seventh century the Roman Pagan fe stival of Diana celebra ted by torch light on August 13th, was adopted by the Christian cult as the “Dormition” or “Falling asleep of the"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Mother of God”. This later became known as th e “Assumption of the Blessed Virgin”, and was celebrated two days later than the Pagan festival—on August 15th. The worship of the Virgin, the Queen of Heave n, became one of the grand features of the Christian religion. Mary the mother of Jesu s, was pronounced Theotokus— “Mother of God”— by the Council of Ephesus 431 AD, and a church on the site was made sacred to her. Twenty years later in 451 AD at the council of Chalcedon Mary was further likene d to the many virgin mothers that had preceded her by being pronounced a Virgin. Ephesus was chosen, because here had stood the great temple of Arte mis, the great Virgin mother of Asia minor—of whom Isis was the prototype. Artemis was to the Greeks what Diana was to the Romans ( Acts 19:27). Her temple had been rebuilt for the fourth time under the patronage of the fabulously rich Croesus. It took 140 years to complete and was dedicated in 430 BC. It was destroyed by fire, but was rebuilt to even greater magnificence by about 356 BC, and became known as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. It was finally destroyed by an edict of the Christian Emperor Theodosius in 381 AD. Her Assumption was decreed in 813 AD, her Immacu late Conception became dogma during the pontificate of Pope Pius IX in 1854. Although the former was not made official papal dogma until the pontificate of Pius XII in 1950 AD. Regarding the elevation of Mary, Smith remarks: Mary soon began to compete in popular affection with Isis, Cybele and Demeter. It required but slight and easy changes to transfe r to her the stately ritual of the goddess Isis, with its shaven and tonsured priests, its matins and vespers, its tinkling music, its jewelled images of the mother of god; the anc ient portrait of Isis and the child Horus was ultimately accepted not only in popular opinion, but by formal Episcopal sanction, as the portrait of the virg in and her child. There can be little doubt that the Virgin Mary has been modelled direc tly upon the Egyptian Isis, for the two are virtually indisti nguishable. The qualities which so endear Mary to the Catholics are the ones which made Isis so popular in Egypt. Both goddesses, gentle mothers that they were, could intercede with the all-power ful creator and stern judge far mo re effectively than their sons, and accordingly both have been styl ed Intercessor. Other titles of Isis incl ude saviour of Souls and Immaculate Virgin, all appropr iated by her Christian counterpart. Like Isis before her, Mary is portrayed standing on a crescent moon with an arch of stars above her head. Certain images of Isis were celebrated for their miraculous movements, or the shedding of tears, and she was even said to have appeared to he r worshippers on rare bu t special occasion. This miraculous work of “Our Lady” was naturally co ntinued by the Christian church which gradually took over the cult of Isis. In fourth-century Alex andria, the Temple of Isis and the Church of Saint Mary stood side by side, the devotees of the mother goddesses indifferently frequenting either. The end came in the sixth century, when th e last remaining Temple of Isis, on the Nile island of Philae, became a Christian church at th e point of a sword under an edict of Justinian."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"In the foregoing it has been argued that Mary the vi rgin mother of Jesus, like her counterparts in the many saviour cults of antiquity, had their origin in the starry heavens, patterned on Virgo the celestial world virgin of the z odiac. This symbolism of the birth of a new sun god, with its attendant message of hope and redemption at the wi nter solstice, originated in Egypt with the infant Horus and his mother Isis, the Egyptian Madonna. The doctrine of the Mother of God was brought in along with the wors hip of the Madonna by Bishop Cyril, and the monks of Alexandria, in the 5th century AD. Figures of Isis nursing the infa nt Horus were taken from the temples to serve as the Madonna and Child. The na me Madonna is no more than a contraction of “ Mater Domina ” or Great or Lady Mother—in Roman times a title of mother goddesses in general. As we have noted, Isis was also represente d like Mary standing on the crescent moon with twelve stars surrounding her head, and with the infant saviour in her arms enclosed in a framework of the flowers of the Egyptian bean or lotus. The Virg in Mary was often depicted in this manner in medieval art; and she was represente d in statuary as being black or dark skinned; black Madonnas exist today in many of the cathedrals of Europe. The most ancient pictures and statues in Italy and other parts of Europe, of what are supposed to be representations of the Christian Virgin Mary and the infant Jesus are bl ack. The infant god, is depi cted in the arms of his black mother, his eyes and drapery white, but he is himself is perfectly black. The reason why these early representations of the Virgin Mary and Jesus are black, crowned, and covered with jewels, is that they are of pre-Christian orig in; as Isis the Egyptian “Queen of Heaven” was worshipped in Europe for centuries before the Christian Era. Temples and statues were erected to her at Bol ogna in Italy, and the church of Notre Dame in Paris is built on the original site of a Temple of Isis. On the entrance to the north cloister is figured the signs of the Zodiac, except that the sign Virgo is replaced by the figure of the Madonna and Child. Finally, in many parts of Italy can be seen pictures of the Virgin with her infant in her arms, inscribed with the words, “ Deo Soli ” (Sun God). This be trays their Pagan origin. Before you go, think about this... It is lawful, then, to him that discusses, disputes and preaches of things eternal, or to him that narrates of things temporal pertaining to religion or piety, to conceal at fitting times whatever seems fit to be concealed.
