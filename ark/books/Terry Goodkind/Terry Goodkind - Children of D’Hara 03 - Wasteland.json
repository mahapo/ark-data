I’ll be all right. Take the sliph andgo.”Richard hadn’t said a word. He seemed frozen in place, standing there on the topof the stone wall around the sliph.“I’m sorry you can’t travel in me, too, Mother Confessor,” the sliph said in hersilken voice while showing a smooth, silvery smile, “but you and your babieswould die in me.”Kahlan thought the sliph sounded a bit too satisfied that Kahlan couldn’t travelwith Richard.The Golden Goddess wanted to end Richard and Kahlan’s line of magic. She woulddo anything to kill them both, but she would be especially ferocious aboutkilling their children should they have any. Those children were more thanKahlan’s longtime wish; they were a promise of a future with magic to protecttheir world.Kahlan struggled to hold back tears of crushing disappointment that she couldn’ttravel in the sliph and get to the Wizard’s Keep. The Keep was a place ofsafety. Besides the Sisters of the Light and other gifted people there, the Keepitself had powerful shields. The massive Wizard’s Keep was designed to protectthe First Wizard, and by extension his loved ones and children. They felt surethey would be safe there from the Golden Goddess and the Glee. Richard andKahlan’s children would be safe there to live and grow, to run through thehalls, laughing, as Kahlan had done as a little girl, while Richard found a wayto put an end to the threat from the goddess and her kind.But because she was pregnant, Kahlan couldn’t travel in the sliph. The Keepsuddenly seemed very, very far away.“I will take Lord Rahl,” the sliph cooed. She circled a quicksilver arm aroundRichard’s waist as he stood as if paralyzed on the stone wall of her well,staring down at Kahlan. “As you say, Mother Confessor, you can remain behindwhile I take him to the Keep.”Unable to stand the tension under Richard’s penetrating gaze, Kahlan yelled,“Go!”Despite her best efforts, tears were beginning to well up in her eyes. She knewshe wouldn’t be able to hold them back for much longer. She wanted him to leavebefore she lost control of her emotions.Shale looked from Kahlan back to Richard. “I will protect her, Lord Rahl, whileyou go get help.”“We will protect her too,” Cassia said as she nodded her agreement with Shale.She stepped closer to Kahlan. “With our lives.”Vika, standing on the wall next to Richard, said, “I will go with Lord Rahl andprotect him.”Vika looked over at him, uncertain if she should jump into the roiling silverwaters of the sliph ahead of him, or wait.Kahlan’s lower lip began to quiver. “Go and get help, Richard, would you,please? I’ll have your sword. I know how to use it and it has served me well inyour absence in the past. I’ll have plenty of protection. I’ll be fine until youcan get back to me.”Richard finally pulled away from the silver arm the sliph had around him. Whenhe did, it shrank back, seeming to melt down into the pool and become part ofwhat looked like nothing so much as liquid silver sloshing in the well. Theglossy silver face, which reflected the room around it, showed no emotion.Free of the sliph’s arm, Richard hopped down off the short stone wall and walkedacross the room, his raptor gaze seeing no one but her. Kahlan couldn’t stoptrembling. Dreading what he might say, she involuntarily backed away a step.When Richard reached her, he softly enclosed her in his strong arms and thenpulled her tight to him. She could no longer hold back the tears as she buriedher face against him.“I’m sorry, Richard,” she blurted out. “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you. I couldn’t,not in the middle of—”Richard pressed her head to his shoulder. “Hush now. No need to cry aboutsomething so wonderful.”“But—”“I’m not leaving you for anything.”“But you must get to the Keep.”“We’ll figure something out. I’m not leaving you, not at a time like this.”“I didn’t want to tell you. You need to be able to protect us. I didn’t want toburden you with this on top of everything else. I didn’t want it to be adistraction.”Richard let out a soft laugh as he briefly hugged her tighter. “It’s not adistraction, Kahlan. It’s motivation.” He pulled back, holding her by her armsas he looked in her eyes. “The sliph said babies. Not baby. Babies.”Kahlan nodded. “I’m pregnant with twins.”Richard’s eyebrows lifted a little in surprise. His smile warmed her heart and,in that instant, dispelled all her terror and fear. She suddenly felt the fulljoy of it again.“A boy and a girl,” Shale said.He turned a serious frown on her. “You knew?”Kahlan put a finger against his jaw and turned his face back to her. “I made herswear that she wouldn’t tell you. I guess I made the same mistake the goddessmade up in the library.”His smile returned as he gazed into her eyes again. “What mistake is that?”“I underestimated you.”His smile widened at that.Kahlan grew sober. “But Richard, you still need to get to the Keep. You can’tstay here if you hope to stop the goddess. That’s what matters. There are giftedthere who may be able to help. The Sisters of the Light are there. Maybe youcould make a quick trip there in the sliph and bring back some of the Sisters.”“You are what matters,” he said softly as he gently pulled Kahlan back into hisarms.She buried her face against him, now with tears of relief and joy.“This is what we have been fighting for since we first met in the Hartlandwoods,” he told her. “For life, for the right of life to continue. And then forour right to continue, for our own happiness.”Holding on tightly to him, Kahlan had never loved him more.She should have known."},{"pageContent":"2 [006.html#a6]“What do you wish to do, Lord Rahl?” Vika asked.He finally drew back from Kahlan. “What my grandfather would have said to do, ofcourse.”Vika pulled her single long blond braid forward over her shoulder and held it inher fist as she looked down at him. Finally, she hopped down off the short stonewall.“I don’t understand, Lord Rahl.”“Zedd, my grandfather, always said to think of the solution, not the problem.The problem is that Kahlan can’t travel in the sliph. We’re focused on thatproblem.”“I didn’t know your grandfather.” Vika looked at a loss. “I’m sorry, Lord Rahl,but I don’t know what that means.”“It means that instead of thinking of the problem—that the sliph can’t take usall—we instead need to think of the solution. I’m hoping we will be safe at theKeep—Kahlan especially—so we need to get there. If the problem is that she can’tgo in the sliph, the solution is that we have to get there another way.”Vika brightened. “I will get horses and supplies together.”Richard smiled at her. “Good thinking, Vika. That is the solution.”Shale stepped closer. “Lord Rahl, won’t that be dangerous? Traveling all the waythere? I’m from the Northern Waste, which has enough of its own dangers, butI’ve heard very ugly things about many of the places down here. I’ve heard thatD’Hara is dangerous enough in its own right, but the Midlands is a savage andwild place and traveling across it can be quite perilous.”Kahlan knew the truth of that. When she used to travel the Midlands, she alwayshad Giller, an experienced wizard, with her at all times for protection. Richardwas a wizard, of course, and more powerful than Giller had ever been, but Gillerdid have the advantage of having been trained his whole life in the use of hiscraft and in the dangers of the Midlands.Richard had been raised in Westland, far away from any knowledge of magic, andthe gift didn’t work the same way in him as it did in others. Unlike a typicalgifted person, he couldn’t necessarily call upon his ability at will—bothbecause of his lack of a lifetime of training and because his gift wasfundamentally different. Being the gift of a war wizard, his power came forthmostly as a function of rage.“I can testify to the fact that the Midlands is indeed dangerous,” Kahlan said.“But it’s also a place of beauty and wonder.”Shale shot her a cynical look. “Beauty won’t save us. The key word in what yousaid is ‘dangerous.’ We would have to cross a lot of dangerous territory.”“Well, it’s obviously dangerous for us to stay in the People’s Palace,” Richardtold the sorceress. “We will be under constant threat and unrelenting attack aslong as we’re here. Here, the goddess can keep an eye on us, so to speak,through everyone in the palace without the gift. That’s pretty much everyone.She can watch us and pick a time to attack when we are at our weakest. We cannever have a moment of safety, here.“There are gifted at the Keep who may be able to help us, and perhaps moreimportantly, the Keep has numerous powerful shields of every kind that canprotect Kahlan and the babies. There are some shields here at the People’sPalace, but not nearly enough. It simply isn’t safe for us here. We need to getto a place of safety so we can figure out how to combat this threat. That placeis the Wizard’s Keep in Aydindril. We can’t go in the sliph, so we either walkor go on horseback. There is no other way. It’s as simple as that.”Shale crossed her arms as she considered his words for a moment, visibly coolingas she did so. “You’re right. We’re not safe here. I can’t offer any bettersuggestion.”Berdine scowled at him with fury in her blue eyes. “Well, I’m going, too. I’llnot be left behind this time. I’m going.”Richard turned a smile to the concern that was so obvious in her expression. “Ofcourse you’re going. I wouldn’t think of going without you, Berdine. We’re allgoing.”“I’ll organize a detachment of the First File to escort us,” Cassia offered.“How many soldiers do you wish to take with us?”With one arm around Kahlan’s waist, Richard took in all the tense faces watchinghim. “None. We can’t risk it.”Cassia leaned in as if she hadn’t heard him correctly. “Can’t risk it? Can’trisk having protection? It’s a long way across a lot of dangerous territory. Aunit of cavalry and soldiers of the First File would act as a deterrent to thosedangers. A show of force would prevent a fight from happening in the firstplace. The last thing we want is a fight. You or the Mother Confessor could behurt or even killed in a fight. Why wouldn’t you want to take adequateprotection?”“Because the goddess has the ability to use soldiers to spy on us, just the sameas she can use anyone else. If she knows precisely where we are, she can sendthe Glee to attack us out in the open in the Midlands. Worse, just as she usedNolo to try to stab Kahlan to death when he was alone with her, the goddesscould use one of those men to attack us when we least expect it. Whereas Nolowas rather inept with a knife, the soldiers of the First File are experts withtheir weapons. Those soldiers wouldn’t be protecting our backs, they would be athreat when our backs are turned.“The Golden Goddess only has to be successful once and Kahlan is dead. Thegoddess will then have accomplished her objective of destroying the chances ofour magic living on. That would ensure the eventual extinction of everyone inthis world.”“He’s right,” Kahlan said, the strength finally coming back to her now thatRichard knew she was pregnant and was determined to protect her and the twins.More importantly, it was also clear from his reasoning that her pregnancy wasn’tgoing to be the distraction she had feared. “It’s not a matter of their loyalty.We know beyond any doubt that they are loyal. It’s a matter of the ability ofthe goddess to bend them to her will and use them.”Richard turned back to the sliph. Her smooth silver face was still watching him,and the shiny surface of that face reflected the people watching both of them.“Sliph, you may go back into your sleep. Thank you for coming.”“Even if the Mother Confessor can’t travel, I can still take you to the Keep,Lord Rahl. Come, we will travel. You will be pleased.”“I would like that very much, but I can’t leave Kahlan. I must stay to protecther. Since I can’t have the pleasure of traveling in you, you may go back intoyour sleep until the day when I can travel in you.”Kahlan knew that Richard understood the unique nature of the sliph. He knew howto talk to her in a way that she not only understood but he could put it in away that didn’t lose her trust. Kahlan just didn’t like the nature of thenecessary flattery.“Thank you, Master. I’m sorry you won’t be traveling in me. You would have beenpleased.”“Yes, I know I would have,” he said. “I hope to one day soon have the pleasureof traveling in you. Until then, you may go back to be with your soul.”The silver face smiled. “Thank you, Master.”With that, the shiny silver face seemed to melt back down into the ever-movingliquid silver filling the well, and then the entire mass of her swiftly sank outof sight with accelerating speed.Shale planted her fists on her hips. “Someday you are going to have to explainthat to me.”“If you like,” he said, “but I can tell you right now you will not be any morepleased to know the story.”When she let her arms fall back to her sides, Richard gestured around at all thewomen watching him. “From now on, the only ones we can trust are the nine of us.We all have magic that prevents the Golden Goddess from getting into our mindsor seeing through our eyes.”“Do you really think that if we took soldiers who are loyal to you,” Shalepressed, “that the goddess could actually use them?”Richard shrugged. “Maybe not, but are you willing to risk it?”“Are you willing to risk danger to the Mother Confessor by traveling dangerouslands?” the sorceress asked.Richard frowned at her. “So then, you relied on soldiers for your protection inthe dangerous Northern Waste?”“No. I relied only on myself.” Shale sighed when she realized what he had justdone. “I see your point.”“You told me when we first met that when you were meditating you could feel somestrange entity probing, trying to get into your mind, but it couldn’t.Remember?”“Yes.”“That had to be the goddess. Your gift protected you and she couldn’t get in.None of the soldiers have the benefit of that protection. We in this room arethe only ones we can trust to be free of the goddess’s control.”Richard finally retrieved his sword from where he had left it leaning againstthe stone wall of the well. He slipped the baldric back over his head beforeattaching the scabbard at his left hip. He looked at each of them in turn.“Until we get to the Keep and the gifted there who may be able to help, it mustbe us nine against everyone else because everyone else is a potential threat.”Vika turned a sly smile to her sister Mord-Sith. “We are Mord-Sith. We have nodesire to babysit soldiers, anyway.” She turned back to Richard. “Unless youthink it best to travel on foot, we are going to need to get horses. That’s nota problem at the palace.”“Except that Lieutenant Dolan and the First File know we’re leaving the palace,”Richard said, “so they will likely assume we’re leaving on horseback. That meanswe have to assume the goddess knows that as well and will be watching for it.But she won’t know which direction we go unless the soldiers see us leaving. Itwould obviously be easier and quicker getting to the Keep if we had horses, buttaking them would mean that soldiers would by necessity see us collecting them.Any number of the First File standing watch on the high ramparts would easilyspot us leaving on horseback and know which way we went.”Kahlan’s concern was evident in her expression. “That means the goddess couldsee all of that through any of their eyes.”Richard agreed with a nod. “Getting away on horses without being seen is aproblem.”“Then stop thinking of the problem, and think instead of the solution,” Shalesaid.“What would the solution be, then?” Richard asked her.Shale leaned toward him. “Think. Who do you have with you on this journey?”The way the sorceress asked the question reminded him of so many gifted peoplewho had taught him valuable lessons.Richard shrugged, not sure what she meant. “We have the nine of us. Kahlan, me,six Mord-Sith—”Shale flashed him a cunning smile. “And me.”"},{"pageContent":"3 [006.html#a6]The stables were partway across the sprawling city-palace. Once they had horses,then Shale would need to do her part, but before they reached the stables theyneeded to avoid being seen by people throughout the palace. Being spotted wouldexpose them to the risk that the goddess could also see them and send Glee toattack.To keep out of sight after leaving the room with the sliph’s well, the nine ofthem had to make their way through a labyrinth of underground passageways andtunnels that few people other than the Mord-Sith knew about or used, then climbiron ladders in ventilation shafts and a series of ancient, rusty, iron spiralservice stairs. They managed to remain unseen the entire journey through therarely used areas of the palace.Nyda, in the lead, brought the party to a halt when she reached a small metalaccess door. She carefully pulled it open just enough to peek out. Oncesatisfied it was safe, she pulled open the door, letting short, wavy-hairedBerdine go through first. The tall, blond Nyda went next. When Richard poked hishead through, he saw that they were behind some of the storage buildings. Beyondwas a staging area and then a number of buildings with stables. The buildingshad roofs to protect them from the open sky above, which revealed fadingdaylight. The first of the strange, new stars in that sky were just beginning toappear.Not far away, between the dark shape of the buildings to each side of them, wasa large manure pile waiting for eventual use in the many gardens throughout thepalace grounds. Besides the food transported in by vendors who brought it up theinternal passage, the gardens and greenhouses in the palace were an abundantsource of fresh food to feed all the people living in the palace. The manure fedthose crops.That large manure pile served to hide the nine of them, but because of the stinkit wasn’t a pleasant place to hide. Richard reminded himself that it wasn’tnearly as bad as the horrific stench of the remains deep down in the foundationarea.“Something smells funny,” Shale said.Richard turned to her with an incredulous look. “Maybe it has something to dowith this big pile of manure right in front of us?”As Shale leaned out to peer into the distance, the sarcasm didn’t seem toregister with her. “No. It’s something else,” she murmured, half to herself.“Like what?” he asked.The sorceress’s attention finally returned to him. She shook her head unhappily.“I’m not sure. It’s not something I’ve exactly smelled before, but for somereason I feel like I should know what it is.”Richard realized she was serious, but it didn’t make any sense and he didn’twant to take the time to discuss the unknowable. Instead, he advanced in acrouch and then leaned out from behind a manure cart to survey the area. Hewanted them to be able to get out of the palace and on their way to the Wizard’sKeep without being seen. Anyone who saw them meant that it was possible thegoddess could see them, too. If they could get away cleanly, then the journey tothe protection of the Keep’s shields and gifted would be that much lesshazardous.In the distance Richard saw soldiers on horseback just returning from patrol,likely around the base of the plateau. Horses were also occasionally used in thepalace’s special passageways meant for mounted soldiers, enabling them toquickly get to distant areas or trouble spots. Sometimes they used ramps upthrough the inside of the plateau that were also used exclusively by troops.Less commonly they used the narrow road that wound around the outside of theplateau.That was the road they were going to need to use to get down to the AzrithPlain. One of the problems with that was that there was a drawbridge withsoldiers stationed at it. Richard was trusting that Shale had some witch woman’strick to make those soldiers think they were someone else, or even not see themat all. He didn’t care what she did, only that it worked.Vika pointed at stable workers taking the horses as the tired soldiersdismounted. “Over that way, where the man is lighting the lamps on the outsidewall of the stables, is one of the buildings where the fresh horses are kept formen to take out on patrol.”Kahlan rested a hand on the hilt of the knife sheathed at her belt as she cameup in a crouch close to Richard and Vika. As beautiful as Richard thought shelooked in the singular dress of the Mother Confessor, she looked just as good tohim in her traveling clothes with a knife sheathed at her side. Some of her longhair fell forward over her shoulder as she carefully leaned out to take a look.“How many fresh horses do you think are in there?” she asked. “Do you thinkthere are enough?”Vika looked a little surprised by the question. “There are a lot of stables allthroughout this one area. There are hundreds and hundreds of horses. I’m notsure of the exact number. With as many horses as I’ve seen here and other areascombined while living and working at the palace under Darken Rahl’s rule theremight even be thousands.”Richard was jarred by her saying “while living and working at the palace underDarken Rahl’s rule.” Before Richard defeated Darken Rahl, as under the tyrantsof the House of Rahl before him, the work of a Mord-Sith living at the People’sPalace was the work of torturing people for information or simply because theLord Rahl wanted them tortured to death as punishment. The Mord-Sith wereexperts at keeping their captives on the cusp between life and death forprolonged periods of time to extend their agony.The Mord-Sith didn’t come by that work easily. They themselves were takencaptive as young women and broken through years of the same kind of torture theylearned to use on others. They became the chattel of evil men—property, weaponsthose men used for their own ends.That training eventually drove those women to madness. Richard had once been thecaptive of an especially ruthless Mord-Sith, Denna, who had introduced him intothat hopeless, surreal world of madness.Vika’s words had brought all those unwelcome memories unexpectedly flooding backto him. As he had done so often, Richard forced those memories from his mind.“Vika is right,” Berdine said as she snuck up closer behind them. “The palacemust have at least a thousand horses in all. For all I know, it’s possible thetrue number is twice that. And that’s only counting the horses belonging to theFirst File.”“Then they shouldn’t miss the dozen and a half we’ll need,” Shale said as sheand the rest of the impatient Mord-Sith, ducking low, joined Richard.Berdine gave her a reproachful look. “You think cavalrymen don’t know everyhorse? Know how many there are, and which stables house them? They live withthose horses. Many sleep in barracks at the rear of the stables so as to be athand should they be needed on a moment’s notice. They would miss one set ofreins, to say nothing of a saddle. One missing horse would be noticedimmediately.”“We aren’t out to steal them,” Richard said. “We merely need you to collect whatwe need. The stables provide horses and supplies to the Lord Rahl all the time.That’s what you are doing this time as well. It’s nothing unusual.”Vika nodded. “I got the horses for you the last time, remember?”“When we went down to see Nolo’s people,” he said as he turned back to watch thestablehands leading the horses into the stables to unsaddle, water, and feedthem.Vika nodded. “That’s right. I’ve been to the stables many times before. Thesoldiers and workers aren’t going to dare to ask a Mord-Sith why she wants adozen and a half horses and supplies. I’ve been here a number of times and theyknow it’s always on orders from Lord Rahl. Not you, Lord Rahl—your father. ThatLord Rahl. Anyway, they won’t give a second thought to my request for horses andsupplies.”“That hardly seems like the secrecy we need,” Kahlan said. “The whole point isthat we don’t want the goddess to know that we’re collecting horses, otherwiseshe will be watching to see where we are headed. If these men know, then it’spossible if not probable she would know as well.”Shale gestured dismissively. “Leave that to me.”Richard looked over at her. “What can you do?”“She’s a witch woman,” Kahlan reminded him in a low voice so that thestablehands wouldn’t hear her.Richard turned his frown toward her. “What does that have to do with it?”Kahlan put a hand on the side of his shoulder. “Witch women are masters ofillusion, remember? People see what a witch woman wants them to see. Redappeared beautiful and young to me, much like Shale, but she appeared to othersas an elderly woman.”When Richard looked back over his shoulder at Shale, she showed him a sly smile.“Let me worry about the solution to this problem.”Richard realized that he knew what Kahlan meant. Witch women could make you seewhat they wanted you to see. More than once Shota had appeared to him as hismother. He knew what Shota looked like, or at least how she presented herself tohim when she wasn’t creating the illusion that she was his mother. But hecouldn’t be entirely sure if that was her real appearance or not. He suspectedthat the same thing was true of Shale.“All right,” he said to Vika. “Why don’t you go and tell the stable master thatyou need a dozen and a half horses, with saddles for nine of them. And supplies.We will need traveling supplies—food, water, sleeping gear. He doesn’t need toknow who it’s all for. Let him assume what he will. Have them hitched over thereat that staging area. Once he gets what we need, we will let Shale do her partso we can collect the horses and leave. The sooner the better, so be quick aboutit.”Vika gave him the kind of smooth, confident smile that few people other than aMord-Sith could do so well. “No problem. Wait here. I’ll be back as soon as Iarrange it.”"},{"pageContent":"4 [006.html#a6]Shale leaned in impatiently. “What could be taking her so long?”Richard let out a frustrated sigh. “I can’t imagine. They should have been ableto have the horses saddled and the supplies ready long ago.”“Could the soldiers or stable workers be giving her any grief?” Kahlan asked.Richard turned an incredulous look on her. “A Mord-Sith. Give a Mord-Sithgrief.”Kahlan let out an exasperated sigh. “I guess that was kind of a silly question.”It had long since grown dark. For a time, the stars had been out, but as theywaited clouds had rolled in. It was starting to smell like rain was on the way.Richard leaned out a little, scanning the area, but he still couldn’t see Vikaanywhere. What was just as troubling, he couldn’t see any sign that the stableworkers were hurrying to carry out her instructions. He had long ago expected tosee the freshly saddled horses brought out to the staging area while thesupplies were collected and loaded.Vika had walked over to the buildings, around the corner of one of them, andthat was the last they saw of her.“Maybe they’re having trouble getting supplies together,” Kahlan suggested.“Maybe they had to send someone down to the storehouses to get the kind oftraveling food we need.”Richard nodded as he watched the entire area, looking for any sign of Vika. “Isuppose that could be the case. It could be that the kind of supplies she askedfor have to be collected from a distant storehouse. But still, I can’t imagineVika not coming back and telling us what the delay was all about.”“Well, maybe she slipped and fell and hit her head or something,” Shalewhispered. “Maybe she’s hurt and needs help.”Richard bit his lower lip as he considered. The same thought had occurred to himas well, but he hadn’t heard anything. It seemed like if she had fallen, then inthe quiet of the night they would have heard her calling out, or something.Besides that, there were a few stable workers occasionally coming and going fromall the buildings. If she had fallen, it seemed like one of them would have seenher on the ground. A Mord-Sith in red leather would be hard to miss. Although,it had grown dark …An impatient Berdine leaned close. “Lord Rahl, it couldn’t possibly have takenthis long. This doesn’t make sense. She could have had a hundred horses saddledand out here by now.”“More than that,” Kahlan added, “there hasn’t been any sign that the stablestaff are seeing to her orders. They all seem to be calmly going about theirother work. No one is rushing to take care of the things she would have askedfor. Surely men would have come running when a Mord-Sith demanded horses to besaddled. Besides that, we would have seen other people rushing off to getsupplies. No one is rushing anywhere.”“You’re all right.” Richard scratched his eyebrow as he considered what to do.“Something is wrong, I can feel it. I need to find out what’s going on.”He abruptly stood up. His feet were numb from squatting down for so long. Herotated each ankle in turn to get the blood started back into his feet as helooked around. All five of the Mord-Sith stood up with him. He turned to Kahlanand Shale, still crouched down behind the manure wagon.“Berdine, you come with me. Shale, Rikka, Nyda, Cassia, Vale—in case there issome kind of trouble please stay close to Kahlan for now. For all we know, oneof the Glee could have snatched her. It shouldn’t take long to find out what’sgoing on.”The four Mord-Sith squatted back down near Kahlan. If there was any kind oftrouble, he knew that in a heartbeat they would all bring their Agiel up into afist and at the ready to defend her.Richard gestured. “Come on, Berdine. It all looks peaceful enough, so somethingis obviously wrong. Keep a sharp lookout for anything that doesn’t look right toyou. Be ready for one of those hateful things to pop out of nowhere.”Berdine nodded and then fell in beside him after he went around the manure cartand started across the open stable area. The aroma of haystacks near eachbuilding was a pleasant change from the smell of manure. They hadn’t gone farwhen some of the men saw them. They all abruptly changed course from what theywere doing and rushed over to Richard and Berdine.“Lord Rahl!” one of them called back into the quiet night in case any of theother workers hadn’t seen him. “It’s Lord Rahl!”So much for stealth, Richard thought. Men who had heard the call ran out ofbuildings. In short order there were fifteen or twenty men gathered around andmore in the distance were coming.“What can we do for you, Lord Rahl?” an older man with a flat cloth hat asked.“Do you wish some horses saddled and brought out?”“Actually,” he said, still looking around for any sign of her, “I sent aMord-Sith to do just that quite a while ago. Her name is Vika. Why didn’t youget the horses for her?”The men all shared puzzled looks.The older man pulled off his cap and smoothed back his thin crop of gray hair.“A Mord-Sith?” He frowned as he gestured at Berdine. “This would be the first ofthose ladies we’ve seen all night, Lord Rahl.” He turned one way, then theother, looking around at his men. “Anyone see the Mord-Sith?”The men all shook their heads, mumbling that they hadn’t.Richard gestured. “I thought I saw her go that way, by that building. Would someof you take a look, please, and make sure she didn’t fall and hurt herself orsomething.”“Stranger things have happened,” the older man confirmed.Men ran off to do Richard’s bidding. He saw some of then trot off to go betweenthe buildings, checking where he said he had last seen her. It wasn’t longbefore they all straggled by, looking disappointed and shaking their heads. Theyall reported that they had found nothing.Richard put his hands on his hips as he looked around. It didn’t make any sense.Vika couldn’t have vanished into thin air. A frightening thought that had beenin the back of his mind was beginning to seem like the most likely explanation.Could it be that one of the Glee had snatched her and taken her back to thegoddess? That seemed far-fetched, especially since he didn’t even know if thatwas possible. Finally, he had an idea.“I need something to see with,” he said to the gathered men. “Bring me a torchor lantern, please.”“We try not to have torches around the horses and all the hay,” the gray-hairedman said as he replaced his hat on his head. “We have plenty of lanterns,though.”When he gestured the order, one of the men rushed to retrieve a lantern. Hepulled one off a hook on the corner of the closest building and rushed back tohand it to Richard.“Thanks. You can all go back to what you were doing. I’ll take it from here.”Lantern in hand, Richard marched off to have a look for himself. Berdinefollowed close on his heels.Going around the building where he had last seen Vika, Richard started searchingthe soft ground looking for any sign. In the shadows between the buildings, andwith the clouds, it was quite dark, but the lantern gave him enough light to seewhat he needed to see. There were a lot of footprints. Most of those prints wereolder, while a few were from the men who had just checked for Richard, lookingfor Vika.Before long, the confusion of prints sorted themselves out in his mind andRichard found what he was looking for: prints from Vika’s boots. He recognizedthe size and the shape. None of the prints from the men’s boots looked similar.Had there been more light, he would have been able to also recognize Vika’sunique gait from the angle and depth of the impressions made by her boots, alongwith her height and weight.He followed her footprints between the buildings to the end where she had turnedbehind the building to Richard’s left. He also saw larger prints from a man, butit was hard to tell if Vika had been following him or he had been following her.Then Richard saw something that made the hair on the back of his neck stand onend."},{"pageContent":"5 [006.html#a6]Richard squatted down, holding the lantern out close to the ground to betterhighlight the ridges and depressions. There, in the soft dirt, he could seewhere Vika had come to a stop, and a short distance beyond that, where she hadgone to her knees.His blood ran cold when he saw that the man’s prints tracked around her whileshe had been there on her knees to turn and stand before her. In his mind, as hestared at the prints, Richard could picture a big man standing over Vika.It made no sense, but the tracks were clear in the story they told.“Someone has taken her,” he whispered to himself.Berdine leaned in with alarm. “Taken her? That’s crazy. Who in the world couldtake a Mord-Sith?”Richard gestured behind, then along the building, and finally to the prints onthe ground before him. “Her footprints came from between the buildings, where Isaw her go, then around behind the back of this building to right here.”Berdine smoothed a hand back over her hair as she straightened after peering atthe ground. “If you say so, Lord Rahl. I can read books, but I can’t readfootprints.”“Well, I can. Look,” he said urging Berdine to lean in again as he pointed. “Seethere, those impressions? That’s where Vika walked up to here and right there iswhere she knelt down.”“Knelt down?” Her nose wrinkled skeptically. “Are you sure?”“Of course I’m sure. See this?” He hovered his hand over the indentations madeby Vika’s knees. “See this depression? That’s not a footprint. It’s a kneeprint. It’s deeper where her knees bend and gets shallower as it goes backtoward her ankles. See those little round impressions? Those are from the toesof her boots as she was on her knees. She knelt down right here.”Berdine squinted in the lantern light. “I guess I can see what you’re talkingabout. It does make sense now that you explain the depressions in the ground.”He touched the edge of the indentations. “See this? You can see where thewrinkles of her leather outfit as she knelt made these rows of little marks.”Berdine leaned in, looking more closely this time. “All right, I see what you’retalking about now. But why would Vika kneel down in the dirt back here, in sucha dark, out-of-the-way place?”With his fingertips, Richard touched a couple of the other footprints. “Theseprints here are from a man who is big, but not as big as me. They come in herebeside Vika’s prints—not in front of or behind, but beside her prints—then … ”He leaned over to point out the important part. “… then, see here? He walkedaround Vika right here, when she went to her knees. Right there. See that? Seethe prints turned around right there, the toes pointing toward her, right infront of her knee prints?“That shows that he stood in front of Vika when she was on her knees.”Berdine blinked as the meaning of it all sank in.“Look at these prints here. After he stood there in front of her, she got backup. See that sideways indentation? That’s the side of the sole of her bootpushing the dirt sideways from her putting weight on her right foot as she gotback to her feet in front of the man. That’s her prints standing, then, right infront of where she had been kneeling, right in front of the man facing her.”Berdine was staring, her eyes wide. Her face had gone ashen.Richard flicked a hand. “Then, the man’s prints twist around and they both gooff in that direction, down that way, with the man leading, Vika right behindhim.”Berdine swallowed. Her blue eyes welled up with tears.“He took her,” she said in a meek voice choked with those tears. “Lord Rahl, hetook her.” She gasped back a sob. “It can’t be, but that’s the only explanationfor why Vika would leave you without her protection, and why she would go to herknees like this.”Richard finally stood. He whistled for the others; then he looked down atBerdine. “Berdine, what are you talking about? Do you know something aboutthis?”She choked back another sob as the others rushed around the building and came toan abrupt halt, looking expectantly at the two of them. Richard signaled them tobe quiet and wait.“It can’t be,” Berdine said to no one in particular as she stared off in thedirection he had taken her. “But it has to be.”She sounded forlorn and terrified. While Berdine was bubbly and cheerful, it wasalways filtered through a Mord-Sith’s iron temperament. Richard had never seenher behave in such a normal human way. Human feelings were suppressed inMord-Sith. But with Richard as the Lord Rahl, he always hoped that theirhumanity would return to them. He had seen a number of instances where it roseto the surface. This seemed to be one of those times, yet not a joyful one. Itmade him ache for all she had been through.When he reached out and gently held her by her shoulders, he could feel hertrembling. He shook her just enough to make her look up at him.“Berdine, what are you saying? Do you know who took her?”“Moravaska.”“Moravaska? Who is Moravaska?”Her big eyes brimmed with tears. “Moravaska Michec.”Richard frowned at her. The tears began to run down her cheeks as she shook. Hecould only imagine what would make a Mord-Sith tremble in fear.“Berdine, who is Moravaska Michec?”Berdine wiped tears back off her cheek as she swallowed. Her eyes turned awayfrom him in embarrassment for having shown such emotion.“A bad man. A very, very bad man.”Kahlan gently circled a comforting arm around Berdine’s shoulders as she lookedback at Richard. “What’s going on?”When Richard saw the faces of the other Mord-Sith, there was no doubt that theyall knew who Moravaska Michec was. But Berdine’s reaction was the strongest.He gestured to the tracks to explain it to Kahlan. “See here? These are Vika’stracks. She came around this building.” He pointed. “She stopped and knelt downthere. A man walked around in front of her while she was kneeling, and then thetwo of them walked away in that direction.”“Are you sure, Lord Rahl?” Shale asked, sounding more than a little skeptical.“You really believe you can tell all that just by looking at the ground?”“Richard can track a cricket through a field of tall grass in a rainstorm atmidnight,” Kahlan said to the sorceress.Shale arched a cynical eyebrow.“Figure of speech,” Kahlan said. “But Richard knows tracks. It’s what he wasraised doing, what he used to do as a woods guide. If Richard says that’s whathappened, then that’s what happened.”Richard looked around at the Mord-Sith standing in a semicircle. “Who isMoravaska Michec?”Nyda was the one who spoke up. “Michec was Vika’s trainer. She was taken whenshe was twelve and given to Michec to be trained. He tortured her for threeyears. After that first phase of her training, he eventually tortured her motherto death in front of her, but after keeping her alive for a long, long time tonumb Vika to another’s pain. As her last stage of training to be Mord-Sith, whenordered, Vika had to torture her father, keeping him alive for a protractedperiod of time to demonstrate that she could keep a captive on the cusp of lifeand death for as long as she wanted. She was finally ordered by Michec to killhim. When she completed her training, and had been broken those three times,Michec took her as his mate.”Richard knew all too well about a Mord-Sith’s training, but even so he stood inpain for a moment in the dragging silence. “Was Michec gifted?”Nyda huffed. “Oh yes. That was part of how he was so easily able to control histrainees. Michec was feared here at the People’s Palace. Darken Rahl let himindulge his sick appetites, not merely with the Mord-Sith in training but onothers as well. Darken Rahl ordinarily didn’t trust having strongly giftedpeople around him, but Moravaska Michec was so loyal and devoted to the causethat Darken Rahl trusted him.”“Then that must have been how he captured her, here,” Richard said. “With hisgift and the power he had over her.”“She would have been kneeling in front of him,” Nyda said in a flat tone thatunlike Berdine’s seemed devoid of all emotion, “so that he could have put atraining collar back around her neck and attached a chain to it.”Richard knew all too well about the collar and chain.In the terrible silence, Berdine, still turned away, said, “Vika wasn’t the onlyone Moravaska Michec trained. Not the only one he took as his mate.”Now he understood Berdine’s reaction.“But Vika was with Hannis Arc,” Richard said. “That’s where I first came intocontact with her. She was his most trusted protection, always at his side. Whenthey had me captive for a time, I told her that her life could be her own. Sheeventually came to believe me. She’s the one who killed Hannis Arc to join withus.”Nyda nodded. “Long before that, Vika belonged to Michec. He gave her to HannisArc on the condition that if and when he no longer had need of her services, shewas to be returned to him. Hannis Arc liked the status of having a Mord-Sith athis side. But Vika always belonged to Moravaska Michec. She was his property.”Richard rested the palm of his left hand on the pommel of the sword in thescabbard at his left hip. “So then when she killed Hannis Arc, she was supposedto go back to Michec.”“Yes,” Nyda said. “But she instead swore loyalty to you. Against all thetraining and despite being the property of Moravaska Michec.”Richard was incensed at such a concept. “She belongs to no one but herself.”“We have to go find her,” Berdine said, the strength returning to her voice. “Wehave to.”“What we have to do,” Shale said in a sympathetic but firm tone, “is get thehorses and supplies we need and get away from the palace. It’s dark. Sentrieswon’t be able to see which way we ride off. I can help to make sure of it.”“That would mean the death of Vika,” Richard said.“A very long and torturous death,” Nyda added.Shale didn’t shy away from Richard’s glare. “Vika knows the possible price ofher loyalty to you. She knows that her sacrifice might be necessary to protectyou. It was what she chose. For your safety, for the Mother Confessor’s safety,and for the future hope of everyone in this world carried in the gift of thosebabies, we need to get to the Keep. Delay would risk everything.”“We don’t leave one of ours behind if there is any chance we can save them,”Kahlan said with quiet authority.“I understand, Mother Confessor, but—”“We would come after you,” Richard said in an equally quiet voice.Staring up at him, Shale considered for a long moment. “I am a witch woman. Noone would come after me.”“We would,” he said without hesitation.Her brow twitched as she seemed captured in his gaze, unable to look away.Finally, her voice returned.“Let’s go get Vika back.”"},{"pageContent":"6 [006.html#a6]The eight of them hurried through the halls and corridors of the palace urgentlygoing after the ninth. Nyda and Rikka, both tall and blond, were in the lead,Richard, Kahlan, and Shale in the middle, with Vale, Berdine, and Cassiaguarding them from the rear. They took the shortest route, which necessarilymeant going through the public areas.Even at night there were quite a number of people in the sprawling corridors.When they saw the five Mord-Sith in red leather, they kept their heads down andaverted their eyes, wanting nothing to do with why they might be rushing throughthe halls. Richard couldn’t help wondering if the Golden Goddess was alsowatching them. Right then, what mattered the most was not only getting Vikaback, but stopping Michec from running free in the palace.Without the Mord-Sith saying anything, Richard knew where they were headed. Theywere going to the Mord-Sith’s traditional quarters. Vika would once have hadquarters there. It seemed unlikely but possible that Moravaska Michec would havetaken her back to her room and would be using the adjacent training room topunish her for ever thinking she could walk away from the master who owned her.In places the cavernous corridors were open to the sky in order to fill thepalace with light. Since it was long after dark, that left the lamps and theisolated, flickering light of torches the task of providing light in thecorridors. Many of the shops located in the main corridors closed down at night,but a number of others stayed open for the customers who worked in the palaceeven in the dead of night. Each of the halls and passageways they used stretchednearly out of sight. Sometimes they took to the private passageways in order totake shortcuts.Because the purpose of the shape of the palace was to function as a massivespell-form, there weren’t convenient, direct routes from one place to another.At intervals, wide marble stairs provided a quick way up or down in order to getto other passageways that crossed over constricted areas so they could continueheading in the direction they needed to go.In other places they passed statues of people in proud poses. The statues weremade of carved and polished stone with different colors of veining, though theywere predominantly white. In some areas the statues were twice life size. It hadbeen a very long time since Richard had seen those particular statues. Theyreminded him in a way of the massive statue he had once carved.Nyda led them past a sprawling square open to the sky above a small indoorforest. It was a large enough area that many of the trees were full grown, thebranches reaching all the way up through the open roof. Mosses and ferns coveredthe ground. It was a convincing imitation of being outdoors in a beautifulgrove. For a brief moment it reminded him of his forest home in Hartland.“I’ve never seen such an indoor forest before,” Shale said in amazement as theymade their way along the path of clay tiles through the center of it. “I supposethere must be many different kinds of places here that would surprise me. Iwouldn’t have believed such a place existed inside the palace. Did you know thiswas in here?”Richard nodded, not wanting to get into how he knew.Nyda and Vale led them past an official palace dining room that never closed. Itwas for the exclusive use of the many people who worked at the palace,especially those who worked at night. Beyond the dining room, they hurriedthrough the halls to another area open to the sky, with pillars supportingarches on all four sides.Instead of a forest, under the open sky was a square made of short tiled wallsfilled with white sand raked in concentric lines around an irregular-shaped darkpitted rock in the center. On the top of the rock was a bell to call people todevotion—a devotion that now was key to keeping their world safe from the GoldenGoddess and her predator race.Devotions used to be hours long. Richard thought that was a waste of time andhad shortened them to three repetitions, as was the custom when in the fieldaway from the palace. He judged three repetitions to be more than enough tosatisfy the magical connection between the people and the Lord Rahl.When Nyda turned off the main corridor, she took them down a passageway that ledthem to a place Richard knew all too well.“These are the Mord-Sith’s quarters,” Nyda said, in a quiet voice in case Michecshould be in one of the nearby rooms.“Do you know which one was Vika’s room?” Richard asked.Nyda gestured. “This one right here.”While everyone waited, the Mord-Sith with Agiel in hand and Kahlan standingbeside Shale, Richard took a lantern from the wall and went in. With one hand onhis sword, and the other holding the lantern, he checked the room. It was small,with a little training room beyond. He opened the wardrobe to be sure, but therewas no one hiding in the room, and no place to hide.“Empty,” he said when he came back out. “We need to check all the rest of therooms.”The Mord-Sith each looked in rooms, as did Richard. After checking several darkand empty rooms, he went into one with polished wood floors, a window with apointed top and trimmed with simple drapes open to the darkness outside, and abed with a blanket and pillow. Richard was abruptly staggered to remembersleeping at the foot of that bed, as well as being in it. Next to it was anightstand with a lamp. On the other side of the small room were a simple tableand chair. Next to a door into the training room were dark wood cabinets builtinto the wall. He opened the doors and found the cabinets empty.He went into the training room to check. It seemed smaller than he remembered. Apulley in the ceiling had a rope that was attached at the wall. The floor had adrain for the blood. He stood frozen for a brief moment before turning away andleaving.All five of the Mord-Sith silently watched him as he came out. They all knew ithad been Denna’s room. None of them said a word. They didn’t have to. But he wasglad they remained silent, because the last thing he would have wanted was forKahlan to know whose room that had been.“Nothing,” he said. “It’s empty. We need to hurry and check the others. IfMichec is hurting her, the sooner we can get to her the better.”By the time they had finished checking all the rooms, they had found no signthat either Michec or Vika had been there.“This is getting us nowhere,” he finally said in frustration. “Do any of youhave any idea where Michec could have taken her?”All the Mord-Sith looked equally disappointed as they shook their heads.“Do any of you have any idea where Michec’s quarters used to be?”Again, they all shook their heads.Richard paced down the hall a short distance and then back, pinching his lowerlip as he tried to think how they could find her in the enormous People’sPalace. Everyone watched in silence as he paced.His head suddenly came up.“I know someone who should know where Michec would be.”"},{"pageContent":"7 [006.html#a6]Once on the upper level, they hurried along the balcony looking out over one ofthe main corridors. Rather than a railing, it had a short wall at the edge. Theywent past side halls and room after room until they finally reached the roomRichard was looking for. He opened the door and then stood in the doorway,staring into the darkness within, his anger on a slow boil.Coming back out, he looked farther down the balcony and saw light coming fromone of the other rooms. Three soldiers of the First File on patrol coming alongthe balcony from the other way eyed the room on their way past it. Each big manhad on dark leather armor over chain mail. Each carried a sword sheathed at ahip along with knives. One also had an axe held in a leather holder that coveredthe sharp blade edges. The wooden handle hung down, swinging freely as hewalked. Each had a beard and strands of long dark hair that flowed down overbroad shoulders. Their arms looked like they could have been carved from blocksof granite. They were the kind of soldiers that no one would want to cross, thekind of men of the First File who were widely feared.Richard signaled and the three soldiers sped up a little, then came to a stopwhen they reached him and his group.“I’d like you three men to come with me,” Richard told them as he gestured backthe way they had come.They clapped meaty fists to their hearts and then fell in behind Kahlan andShale, but ahead of the Mord-Sith. The five Mord-Sith were not happy about that,but let it go for the time being because Richard had already started out andthey had to catch up as it was.Shale leaned in close from behind so only Richard would hear her. “I thought theplan was not to let any soldiers see us?”He knew what she meant. “When we leave, yes. But right now, we can’t avoid it.There have already been hundreds of pairs of eyes on us all along the way comingup here. Don’t forget, it’s not only soldiers the goddess could use. She can useanyone who isn’t gifted. For now, though, it can’t be avoided. Worse, thegoddess doesn’t need to possess the person, she merely needs to take a lookthrough any of those eyes to keep track of us. The people she used wouldn’t evenknow she was doing it. Unless, that is, she exerted control over them to makethem do her bidding, like she did with Dori—remember?”Shale nodded with a grim expression on her beguiling features.With everyone following behind, Richard hurried to the open doorway with lightcoming from inside. He paused with his hands on the sides of the doorframe.A clean-shaven, middle-aged man was sitting behind a desk, bent over his work. Alamp sat on either end of the desk. The man blindly dipped a quill pen in an inkbottle as he focused on jotting notes on a collection of papers arrayed beforehim.Richard stepped through the doorway and into the room. The Mord-Sith pushed pastthe soldiers, like going around giant oak trees, and came into the room behindRichard. The man working behind the desk finally noticed all the people andstood.“Lord Rahl, you’re out late. How may I help you?”Richard thought the man might be rattled to have the Lord Rahl and a party thatincluded soldiers and Mord-Sith show up at his door. Instead, he seemed calm andinterested in what Richard needed. His blue-edged white robes of office with thegold bands on the sleeves were lying over a chair. The man apparently didn’tcare to wear them when he was working and instead was in his shirtsleeves.“What is your name?”The man bowed his head of thick, dark hair. “Edward Harris, at your service,Lord Rahl. I am second-in-command to Mr. Burkett.”“And where is Mr. Burkett? I need to speak with him at once.”“I believe Mr. Burkett has gone home for the day. But it sounds like it’surgent.” Edward Harris gestured to the side. “His quarters aren’t far away. Ican take you there, if you wish.”Richard held an arm out behind him. “Lead the way.”Harris hurried around the desk, not bothering with his robes, and went out tothe balcony area, where he turned to his left. At an intersection he led Richardand his party down a simple-looking side hall that turned away from the balcony.A short distance down the hall, he came to a door with Burkett’s name on a smallplaque to the side.Harris lifted a hand toward the door. “These are his quarters, Lord Rahl. Do youwish me to wait?”Richard nodded to the man and then knocked. “For now, yes.”When there was no answer, Richard knocked again, more insistently, and then athird time. Finally, he tried the door and found it locked.Richard, what little patience he had now gone, threw his shoulder hard againstthe door. The door offered little resistance to his weight or mood. It stayed onits hinges as it banged back against the inside wall. Everyone stepped out ofthe way as splinters of the wooden doorjamb skittered across the floor of thehall. Knowing how upset Richard was, no one said a word.Richard charged into the room without waiting for a greeting or an invitation.Burkett, in his stocking feet and still in his official robes, looked up withbloodshot eyes, but didn’t get up from a chair at a table against the far wall.He had a bottle in one hand. The room was orderly and well-appointed with simplebut comfortable-looking furniture. A dark doorway probably led to a bedroom.Richard didn’t see a wife or anyone else in the apartment.“I knocked,” Richard said. “Why didn’t you answer?”“Because my workday is done,” he said in a slur. “I don’t like people botheringme after work.” Burkett tried to set the bottle down on the table, but it tookhim three tries to find it. “What’s the meaning of this, anyway? What is it youwant?”Richard seized the man by his tunic, lifted him out of the chair, and slammedhim up against the wall. No one, including a surprised Edward Harris, saidanything.Richard clenched his jaw with barely contained anger. “I told you that I wantedto see all the gifted. You told me that you had all the gifted in the palacecollected and sent to the library.”“That’s what I did.” Burkett licked his tongue out from under his overbite.“That was all the gifted living in the palace or staying here as guests, just asyou asked.”Richard pulled the man away from the wall and slammed him into it again, banginghis head hard enough to crack the plaster. His thin hair slipped off the top ofhis head where it had been covering his daisylike birthmark and fell down acrosshis red face.“You lied then and you’re lying right now,” Richard said through gritted teeth.“You didn’t tell me about all the gifted.”Burkett tried, as best he could what with being held up in the air and hardagainst the wall by an angry Lord Rahl, to gesture his innocence.“I didn’t lie! I told you about all of them. I had all of them collected. Allthe gifted in the palace were sent to meet you up at the library, just as youasked. I saw to it. I have them all listed.”Richard lifted him away and threw him against the wall again. By now the shockwas sobering him up a bit.“You lied and you’re lying now!”Burkett’s tongue licked out from under his overbite. “No, I’m telling you thetruth. Those were the only gifted living or staying at the palace. Why would youdoubt my word?”“You keep track of everything going on in the palace for the Lord Rahl. That hasalways been your job. Your office keeps records of the visitors, thedignitaries, and the gifted living here. Especially the gifted. That was themost important duty you had for Darken Rahl, and you have a network of peopleeverywhere who report everything to you, especially about the gifted, becauseDarken Rahl, like those before him, would not have tolerated you not reportingall of the gifted to him.“You are the spider in the center of that web, and you know when anyone plucksone of those strands. I am the Lord Rahl now, and I asked for that sameinformation you have always kept for the Lord Rahl. I asked you for all thegifted, and you deliberately didn’t tell me about all of them.”“But I did, I swear! I swear I told you about every one of them. Every one!”Richard cocked his head, gritting his teeth again as he put his face closer tothe man. “You swear?” Richard asked. “Is that right? You swear?”Burkett nodded furiously. “Yes. I swear.”“What about Moravaska Michec?”The blood drained from Burkett’s red face."},{"pageContent":"8 [006.html#a6]“Wait—what?” Edward Harris suddenly leaned in with alarm. “Do you mean to saythat Moravaska Michec is in the People’s Palace? Michec is here?”“Yes. And your superior here knew it.” Richard turned back to the suddenlysilent man he was holding up against the wall. “Didn’t you, Mr. Burkett? Youknew. Didn’t you!”The man was clearly caught in the lie, his tongue nervously flicking in and out.“I asked you a question! You knew Moravaska Michec was here at the palace when Iasked for all the gifted to be sent up to the library, didn’t you? Even thoughyour duty is to report all the gifted to the Lord Rahl, you deliberately hid thefact that he is here, at the palace, isn’t that right?”“Well, I, I, I couldn’t. You have to understand, I just couldn’t.”Richard slammed him against the wall again, extending the crack in the plasterout on either side of his head.“Why couldn’t you tell me?”“Michec was always loyal to Darken Rahl because they shared certain exotic …indulgences. As long as he left me and my staff alone, it was none of mybusiness.”“What does that have to do with you not letting me know about him or sending himup to the library with the other gifted?”“He thought you only defeated Darken Rahl because of luck. He was certain thatyour luck would run out in the war and that you would never be seen again. Hewould then step in and assume a place of power here at the palace. He said thathe would use a spell to do something horrifying to me if I told you he wasliving here.”The muscles in Richard’s jaw flexed at the thought of Vika being back in thatman’s hands. “I am the Lord Rahl. It is treasonous to deceive the Lord Rahlabout someone scheming against him in his own house!”Burkett winced as he nodded. “I know, I know, and I would have told you, but hethreatened me if I ever did.”“How many times have you been to the devotions, Mr. Burkett?”“The devotions? Why, three times a day, of course. Every day. I never miss adevotion.”“And you lied each of those times you swore loyalty to me, isn’t that right, Mr.Burkett?”“Not because I wanted to. Don’t you see? It was because I had to. Michec saidthat if I told anyone, especially you, that he was living here and planning ontaking away your power, he would kill me in the most painful way imaginable.”“I can understand people being afraid of magic, but as the Lord Rahl I am themagic against magic. You should have told me that he was here, and that hethreatened you, to say nothing of his threats against my rule. I would havehandled it and I would have protected you. That’s my duty in the oath of thedevotion. Now, because of your disloyalty, his schemes are threatening the livesof those loyal to me as well as the Mother Confessor, as well as everything wehave fought for.”“Why didn’t you tell me?” Mr. Harris asked of Mr. Burkett. “If you were afraidto tell Lord Rahl, I would have done it for you. Why didn’t you simply tell me?”Burkett stammered and flicked his tongue out, ignoring Harris, trying todownplay his breach of trust. “I, I didn’t know he would hurt anyone, Lord Rahl.I swear. I didn’t know Michec would hurt anyone.”Richard was not about to argue so obvious a lie. “What kind of gift does Michechave?” Richard demanded. “What kind of things can he do?”Burkett looked past Richard to all the people watching him—the Mother Confessor,the soldiers, and the Mord-Sith. “Well, I, I, I’m not sure.”“I know all too well who Moravaska Michec is,” Harris said when Burkett wouldn’tadmit what he knew. “I thought he fled long ago when you defeated Darken Rahl. Inever expected to see that wicked man again. I had no idea he had returned.”Richard turned to him. “Do you know what kind of gift he has? Is he a wizard?”Harris shook his head. “No, Lord Rahl, not a wizard. Moravaska Michec is awarlock. You know, a witch man.”“A witch!” Shale exclaimed as she stepped forward. With a finger, she pokedRichard’s shoulder. “That was what I smelled!”Richard frowned back at her. “What?”“At the stables, remember? I told you I smelled something that I thought Irecognized. I did. I smelled a witch.”Richard turned back to Edward Harris. “Do you know where he would be?”“Sorry, Lord Rahl, I don’t.” He lifted out his hands in frustration that hedidn’t have an answer. “You know how big the People’s Palace is. There areprobably a thousand places he could be living and we would never know about it.”Richard turned back to Burkett. “Where are his quarters? You knew he was here,so you would know where he is staying in the palace, or should I say where he ishiding. Now, where is he?”Burkett licked his lips. “He said that if I told anyone he was here, he would dosomething terrible to me, something that would make me suffer before I died.”“You don’t need to worry about a spell from Michec. He’s not here. You need toworry about me. Once I find him, he won’t be putting any spells on anyoneanymore, because he will be dead.” Richard shook the man again. “Now where ishe!”Burkett trembled as he panted. “He’s, he’s in a remote place where no one evergoes, down a level below where the tombs of your ancestors are located, in anarea called M111-B.”“M111-B,” Richard repeated, keeping his focus on Burkett although he sensed theMord-Sith shifting uneasily and sharing a look.Burkett nodded. “That’s right, M111-B. But a witch’s lair down there will be avery dangerous place. You won’t be able to get him out, not out of that place.”Richard dropped the man down in the chair. “Mr. Burkett, you are relieved ofyour position.” He turned to the dark-haired man. “Mr. Harris, you are second incharge, under Mr. Burkett?”“That’s right.”“As of this moment, you are promoted to Mr. Burkett’s former position.”“You can’t do that!” Burkett cried out from the chair. “I know more about thepalace workings than anyone! I have years of experience!”“What good is any of it if you take orders from someone working against my rule,working against the peace of the D’Haran Empire? I came to you before and askedyou for all the gifted, expecting you to be truthful. You schemed to deceive me.You lied to me.”“But I had to! I told you, Michec threatened me if I told anyone, especiallyyou.”“It’s done,” Richard said, incensed by the excuses. “You are relieved of yourposition.”The man’s fingers took refuge on the gold bands on the sleeves of his robes.“What position will you put me in, then?”“None.”“You can’t do this!”“We fought a long and terrible war. Many, many people sacrificed their lives sothat other people could live in peace and freedom. Even though I have fought andbled for them, everyone is free to dislike me if they so choose. But no one canbe here if they are disloyal to the empire and plot against me or the MotherConfessor. No one.”Richard turned to the grim-faced soldiers. “See to it that Mr. Burkett isescorted from the palace as soon as he can pack his belongings. Watch over himas he does so. Come sunrise, I want him gone. He is banished from the People’sPalace forever under penalty of death if he ever tries to sneak back in. Letyour officers know my orders.”As one they all clapped fists to hearts.“But Lord Rahl, I made a mistake,” the man pleaded. “That’s all, just amistake.”Richard turned back to Burkett. “We all make mistakes. I can understand andforgive mistakes. But this was not a mistake. You acted deliberately. Thisbetrayal cannot be forgiven.” The man started to speak, but Richard held up afinger, warning him not to say anything. “Count your blessings that I don’t haveyou beheaded for treason.”Richard turned to the dark-haired palace official. “Mr. Harris, you are incharge now.”Edward Harris clapped a fist to his heart. “I will not betray your trust, LordRahl.”Richard briefly smiled his appreciation and then turned to the Mord-Sith. “Doyou know this place called M111-B?”All five of them again shared glances.Richard couldn’t miss the troubled expressions. “Obviously, you do. What do youknow about M111-B?”“Darken Rahl used to call it the Wasteland,” Rikka said.Richard had never heard of an indoor place with such a name. “The Wasteland? Whydid he call it that?”Rikka shared another look with some of the others. “He didn’t understand theplace and didn’t care to. It’s a vast, remote, isolated area. He didn’t know whyit was here in the palace. He rarely if ever went down there.”“He was afraid of it,” Nyda added when Rikka didn’t say it.Richard’s gaze shifted to her. “Why?”For a moment, Nyda seemed to search for a way to explain it. “M111-B is astrange, surreal place. It’s kind of self-contained labyrinth of confusingpassageways and dead ends. It would be easy to become lost in there and neverfind your way out.”“It’s so dangerous that it’s not merely restricted,” Rikka explained. “The wholearea is closed off behind a series of locked doors. We can take you there, butif there is a witch man down in there, it is going to be beyond merelydangerous. Unlike Darken Rahl, Michec had a certain … fascination with theWasteland. He used it often. As Berdine can attest, Michec is a very sadisticman. Some called him Michec the Butcher.”When Richard looked to her, Berdine reluctantly spoke. “The Wasteland is a placeyou wouldn’t ever want Moravaska Michec to take you. When Darken Rahl ruled, theWasteland was a kind of refuge for Michec. He used to take people in there wherehe wouldn’t be disturbed. None of those people he took in there ever came back.If he took Vika in there…”Richard gripped Berdine’s arm and leaned close. “We’re going to get Vika back.That’s a promise.”Berdine swallowed her emotion. “I know you will try, Lord Rahl. But you don’tunderstand Michec … or the Wasteland.”“Lord Rahl,” Harris said, “M111-B is more than a confusing and simply dangerousplace. I can’t imagine the purpose of it, or why it’s down there, but I’ve heardthat in the past somehow people have accidentally managed to get in there. Onlya couple ever made it out. I don’t really know about them, but the rest musthave died in there. Anyone who knows it fears that place.” He gestured at theMord-Sith. “As they say, Darken Rahl may have been afraid of the place, butMichec used to go in there.”Richard wondered why there would be a labyrinth of any kind down in the lowerreaches of the palace. In the Keep, yes, there were any number of such places,some of them so complex that it had been a thousand years since people had setfoot in some of the confusion of rooms, but those areas had a defensive purposeas traps for intruders. He had never seen anything of the kind at the People’sPalace, and even if it was somehow meant to be defensive, he couldn’t imagineany strategic reason for it to be down in a lower area of the palace.“With a witch man casting webs down there,” Shale said, “that is only going tomake it all the more dangerous, especially when we don’t know the layout of thisWasteland place. He would be able to use that to his advantage to trap us andkill us.”Richard tapped his thumb on the scabbard at his hip. “A labyrinth of confusinghalls and rooms is a real problem by design. We could get really lost in there.Since we don’t know the layout of the maze, we won’t know where we are oncewe’re in there.”“I can help with that much, at least,” Harris said, lifting a hand to break intothe conversation. “We have maps of every area in the palace. There would bediagrams of M111-B. That number is a charting designation.”Richard frowned. “You think you have a diagram showing a layout of that place,M111-B? The Wasteland?”Harris nodded with conviction. “I haven’t seen that specific one myself, butthere are plans of every part of the palace. They are necessary for a variety ofreasons, from repair work to locating sources of leaks and every other sort ofmalfunction that needs to be addressed. I’m sure there would be one of M111-B.”“Show us,” Richard said.Going for the door without a word, Edward Harris wove his way among the soldiersas they started for Mr. Burkett."},{"pageContent":"9 [006.html#a6]As they left Mr. Burkett’s apartment, Kahlan felt shock and dismay over thediscovery of how disloyal the man had been. In his position he had uncaringlyput the lives of everyone in the palace at risk. His betrayal had led to Vikabeing taken, and she was now in the hands of the shadowy Moravaska Michec. Witha gifted man possessing such powers holed up inside the palace, and in aperilous place, no less, it was now a situation beyond merely dangerous.Kahlan knew that, in a way, Shale had been right that their purpose of gettingto the Wizard’s Keep overrode the life of one person who, after all, had swornto protect them with her life. Vika was doing just that. She would want them toleave her and get to the safety of the Wizard’s Keep.The Mord-Sith always came after her and Richard without question or hesitation.Kahlan hated the thought of her in silent terror, thinking no help would becoming.But at the same time, this was also about much more than saving Vika’s life.Evil could not be left to fester and grow inside the House of Rahl. There was notelling what Michec would do once they left for the Keep.As they reached the end of the hall where it came out to the balcony area, withMr. Harris leading the way, Kahlan heard a commotion behind her. Along witheveryone else, she turned to look back down the hall. Mr. Burkett suddenlybolted out of his room. Unbelievably, he ran toward them in his stocking feet,fist raised in the air, the three soldiers chasing after him. One of the menstretched out, snatching for Mr. Burkett, but the wiry man twisted away. He wasyelling drunken curses at Richard.As the four of them raced out into the balcony, everyone turned to the threat.It wasn’t much of a threat, though, so Richard didn’t bother drawing his sword.He looked like he intended to simply hook the man with an arm and turn him overto the soldiers.The Mord-Sith weren’t so casual about the threat from an unarmed, skinny, olderman. They all had their Agiel to hand and looked like they intended him greatviolence. As Mr. Burkett charged out of the hall, yelling that Richard had noright to remove him after his years of service, something out of the corner ofher eye caught Kahlan’s attention.She heard their howls at the same time that she turned and saw them. Four orfive Glee, in a tight group, had already materialized and were racing down thehall toward them with alarming speed, steam still trailing off their dark, wetbodies.Just as they all turned to confront the threat, another group of the creaturesthey hadn’t seen materialize crashed through the center of their group from theopposite side, catching them all by surprise. Everyone ducked as claws flashedby and wicked, pointed teeth snapped. With Glee converging on them all from bothdirections at the same time, several of the Mord-Sith were blindsided andknocked to the floor by the tall, dark creatures going for Kahlan.Richard’s arm swept behind, circling Kahlan’s waist. As he spun around, he tookher from her feet and to the floor just as a claw swept by right over theirheads.A claw did catch one of the soldiers by surprise as he charged out of the hallafter Mr. Burkett. It ripped through the leather armor and the flesh and boneunder it.Another one of the dark creatures swung at Mr. Burkett, ripping out his throatso deeply and with such force that the claw hooked his spine and threw the manflying. When he slammed into the short wall, his upper body flipped backwardover the wall. Mr. Burkett plummeted to the stone floor far below.As the dark, slimy creatures attacked from both sides, the Mord-Sith, afterhaving scrambled to their feet, rammed their Agiel into the center of the tallmonsters. Kahlan knew they bled; when she heard the shrieks, she knew that theyalso felt pain. By the sound of their shrieks, they felt no less pain than anyhuman would under an Agiel.Richard grabbed the arm of one as it stormed through the midst of the group,clawing wildly at them. He twisted the arm around as the creature’s weightcarried it on past. Its arm wrenched around with enough force to partially ripit off. When it smacked the floor, the Glee began to dissolve into scribbles. Inan instant it had vanished. Others the Mord-Sith caught also vanished before anymore damage could be done.A soldier swung his sword, taking the head off one Glee just before the wickedclaws of another hooked his arm, tearing flesh from bone. Another claw rippedopen his middle. The soldier fought in vain as he was being taken down andmauled to death.Richard circled a powerful arm around the head of one of the creatures attackingthe soldier. With a violent twist, he broke its neck. In such a sudden death, itfailed to vanish back into its own world and instead fell sprawling on thefloor.Some of the creatures went into deep, froglike squats and then sprang up towardthem with frightening speed. There seemed to be black shapes flying at them fromeverywhere. Kahlan ducked back just as jaws snapped, and the creature’s pointedwhite teeth barely missed her face. She pulled her knife and hooked its leg,slicing to the bone. When it fell, Richard drove his sword through its spine.Berdine jumped onto the back of one of them leaping for Kahlan and pressed herAgiel to the base of its skull. The slimy monster screeched, tipping its headback in agony at the same time as it turned to scribbles. Berdine, on its backwith her legs around the middle, suddenly tumbled to the floor when it vanishedfrom right under her. Another one of the monsters saw her at a disadvantage andjumped for her. Berdine managed to flip onto her back on the floor and strike upat the dark shape closing down over her. Caught on her Agiel, it, too, shriekedas it vanished.Richard lopped off arms reaching for Kahlan. She could see the rage in his eyes,both his own and the power from the sword. As one of the tall creatures dove forKahlan, he took a mighty swing at it, slicing it clean in two from one shoulderto the opposite hip. The two halves tumbled across the ground, one to each sideof Kahlan. The insides spilled across the marble floor, spreading yet more bloodand viscera underfoot.Another one of the big Glee, running in with claws held high for a swing atEdward Harris, slipped on the blood. Instead of taking a lethal swipe at theman, it fell and crashed into him. The impact knocked him over the waist-highwall at the side of the balcony. Harris cried out as he tried to grab the edge,but he only was able to catch it with one hand as he fell.Richard dove for the wall. At the last instant, as the man’s fingers slippedoff, he snatched Edward Harris’s wrist, keeping him from a fall that would havekilled him. As Richard held on to the man hanging down over the side of thewall, he stabbed at a Glee coming for him. Kahlan saw the sword erupt from itsback. Richard pushed it off the blade with a foot. As the dying creature fell,another going for Richard tripped over it and met the same fate.Kahlan reached for a nearby Glee to unleash her power on it. While she didn’tneed to touch a person, not knowing how it would work on these creatures, shewanted to make contact with it. Cassia slammed into it first, ramming her Agielinto its middle. The creature shrieked in agony, its head twisting violently,its long, dark, almond-shaped eyes going wide. Even as Cassia twisted her weaponto increase the pain, it was already dissolving back to its own world. Cassiascreamed in rage that it got away before she could do more damage.The slime from the creatures, which not only dripped off their smooth black skinbut splashed across the floor when they fell and smacked down hard, was mixingwith the blood to make for slippery footing. In their frenzied attempts to getat them, some of the Glee slipped and fell.Richard swung his sword as two of the monsters feinted one way and then theother, trying to find a way past his blade to get at him, knowing he was pinnedto the short wall as he held on to the wrist of the man over the edge.Shale slipped and fell just as she cast an arm out, sending out another waveringcrack of power. It blew the shoulder and arm off one of the creatures trying toget at Richard, throwing black flesh and bloody bone up high into the air. Thedark shape stumbled around in shock as it dissolved into scribbles and vanished.The remaining soldier slashed through several more of the tall, dark Glee tryingto get at Richard. The Mord-Sith had formed a defensive ring around Kahlan. Theway Richard was holding on to Edward Harris had him pinned to the short wall sothat he couldn’t fight effectively, but he couldn’t let go or Harris would die.The Glee all knew it.“Help him!” Kahlan screamed.The Mord-Sith reacted to her order and attacked the creatures from behind asthey tried to rip into Richard. Here and there the victims screeched in painbriefly before they vanished. Their numbers were being whittled down, making iteasier to fight back against them, but if they connected with either claws orteeth, they could do lethal damage.Everyone, it seemed, was frantically fighting for their lives. Then, almost assoon as the battle had started, it ended with the last two creatures escaping byvanishing into thin air.The bodies of several mangled or decapitated Glee lay sprawled on the floor.Everyone panted in exhaustion after the brief but frenzied fight.Richard sheathed his sword as he turned to the man over the edge of the wall toget another hand on him.A soldier stood in front of Kahlan with his feet spread, ready to protect herwith his life. When he saw that the attackers were gone, the soldier ran to theshort wall and leaned over, grabbing the man’s arm to help Richard hold on tohim. Together he and Richard hauled Edward Harris up and back over the wall. Hisshirt soaked with sweat, he flopped down, leaning against the wall to catch hisbreath.Across the broad corridor, on the balcony that mirrored the one they were on,some people were running for their lives while others stood pressed against theshort wall, where they had been anxiously watching the fight. People wererunning for safety down in the expansive corridor below, too, while many morewere gathering around the crumpled body of Mr. Burkett and a severed black armfrom one of the creatures.Kahlan rushed to Richard. Like everyone else, he was breathing heavily.She put a hand on his chest, thankful that he was all right. “I think that musthave taken a few years off my life.”He gave her a knowing smile. “Me too. For a moment there, I thought they hadus.” He gestured to the two downed soldiers. “Unfortunately, not all of ussurvived the attack.”Shale shook gore and slime from the hem of her dark dress as she came closer.“I’ve been righteously frightened often enough in the Northern Waste, but lifehere at the beautiful, glorious People’s Palace is a lot scarier. Those of usstill alive still came very close to death today.”Richard seemed to understand her meaning. “As soon as we can leave we’ll be alot safer. Right now the goddess can look through the eyes of any of thethousands of people here and know where we are at any given moment so she cansend attacks when we are vulnerable.“But we can’t simply leave a threat here that is just as deadly. If we left now,Michec could stab us in the back, so to speak. If he cast a lethal spell thatkilled Kahlan, hope for the future would end right there. Just because the Gleeare a threat doesn’t mean this one isn’t just as dangerous and we can ignoreit.”Shale nodded with a sigh.Kahlan saw soldiers of the First File running in from both directions, weaponsdrawn.Just as Richard turned back to Kahlan, the air of the hall not far off shimmeredwith a mass of swirling lines that could mean only one thing.Kahlan’s eyes went wide. There had to be well over a hundred of them, the steamrising off their glistening black bodies as they suddenly materialized, itseemed, at a dead run."},{"pageContent":"10 [006.html#a6]In a heartbeat, from not far off down the corridor, a massive mob of the huge,dark creatures with steaming, soft, dark, slippery skin raced toward Richard andhis party. They had materialized all bunched together in a writhing, howlingmass. At first, all the waving arms reminded him of nothing so much as a darkmass of wriggling worms. As they ran, gelatinous globs slid off their nakedbodies to drip and drop all over the floor.Mouths wide, they roared with ravenous intent, their howls echoing through thevast, multilevel corridor.Their large, glossy, almond-shaped eyes seemed nearly as black and wet as theirsoft, moist flesh. When a thin, semitransparent third eyelid blinked in from theinside corner of each eye, the membrane gave their eyes a slightly milkyappearance.In an instant, Richard’s emotions went from exhausted relief to full fright. Hehad thought it was over, but now there were suddenly many times the number ofGlee as in the attack that had just ended. He took a quick look over hisshoulder. None were coming from behind. At least not yet. The soldiers back inthat direction were still a long way off. They would never reach Richard andthose with him in time.All of those claws were terrifying enough, but even more frightening were thenasty, oily faces of the creatures. The thin wet skin wrinkled as their widemouths gaped open, lips pulling back from long, needle-sharp teeth thatglistened with stringy slime. The mouths full of white teeth stood out all themore against the dark mass of the creatures.The few dozen soldiers racing to Richard and Kahlan’s defense from that samedirection were suddenly beset by the tall dark shapes slashing away at them withhooked claws. They ran through the midst of the soldiers, overwhelming them withsheer numbers and brute force. The soldiers tried to fight back—even taking downa few of the Glee, which were then trampled underfoot—but they were beinghopelessly engulfed and overrun.Before the Mord-Sith could launch toward them, before Richard had time to thinkabout it, he reacted out of instinct born of white-hot rage.He thrust both hands toward the threat.Clarity came to him in a frozen instant in time.His birthright, that core of his gift deep within that he hadn’t been aware ofgrowing up, but that he had come to know intimately when in the underworld,erupted forth as if it were wild fury brought to life.In that fraction of a second, everyone seemed to be moving in a dreamlike stateso slow that he could see the shock on every face as this sudden new threatmaterialized out of thin air. The fear and stark terror of what was coming forthem was clearly evident on each of those faces. The Mord-Sith, though, lived todefend Richard and Kahlan with their lives, so their fear was layered over withgrim resolve, a kind of acknowledgment that they were already dead, so theymight as well take down as many of the enemy as they could before there was nopower left in their muscles or blood in their veins.Richard had time to look at each of their beautiful faces, each an image ofintelligent beauty, reflecting what could have come of these women had they notbeen taken at a young age and twisted into killing machines. But now that waswhat they were, and that visage overlaid whatever else might lie beneath.In that silent, otherworldly state, everyone seemed to Richard to be moving soslowly so as to almost be statues. He could see the fiercely determinedexpressions on all of the soldiers as the Glee around them ripped at them withclaws and teeth. The whole scene, that instant in time, seemed frozen in midair.At the same time, Richard could see all the ravenous, wrinkled faces of theGlee—big eyes, small nostril holes, enormous mouths and teeth—all of themstruggling in the thick mass, tumbling over one another to be the first to getat Richard and Kahlan. It wasn’t a drive for glory, as a soldier in battle mighthave, but rather a voracious, communal hunger to kill, like beasts needing tofeed.Richard knew without a doubt by seeing their big, almond-shaped eyes that theirgazes, frozen in that moment in time, were mostly fixed on Kahlan. They had alsobeen sent for Richard, but more importantly, for her first. Their claws were allreaching out, trying to be the first to hook her, to be the first to rip heropen, to sink those needle-sharp teeth into her flesh.They had been sent to eliminate not merely Kahlan, but the children she carried,the hope she carried.He could see in her face that Kahlan knew it as well.From within the crackling cocoon of power, Richard could see it all, watch itall, as everyone moved only the width of a hair with each lazy tick of time.A kind of sparkling, spiraling, hissing haze swirled up around him, colorsflashing up and down within it. Eddies of light rippled through it. Tinyflashes, sparks of energy, ignited all throughout that haze, uncountable numbersglowing with glittering fluidity. Each of those embers sparked out, only to bereborn and set off yet another cascade of glimmering flashes. It was dazzling.The center of the vortex was warm and protective; it was the energy of his owngift expanding outward.It reminded him of the first time he stood on Zedd’s wizard’s rock, the way thelight threatened to ignite the air around him and the air itself rotated with adull roar as it swirled like smoke. It engendered that same sense of wonder,that same recognition of unimaginable power being gathered together, of a worldhe had never known existed coming into being.He could just see in his peripheral vision that Kahlan, knowing they were comingfor her, had straightened her back, the Mother Confessor ready to release herown power. But Richard knew beyond any doubt that in this case, with as many ofthe dark creatures as there were charging through the soldiers to get at her,she didn’t stand a chance.None of them did.Only one thing could stop what was but a heartbeat away from becoming reality.He knew that in two heartbeats, they would all be dead.Unless he stopped them.Power, ignited by the spark of his rage and fuelled by the singular gift hecarried, filled every fiber of his being, swelling through him, around him, asummoned haze of lethal force. It felt hot, sharp, and violent, as if it wereerupting from his very soul and tearing its way through him, eager to get to hishands, eager to do his bidding.In that quiet, clear instant of inner cognition, of wild rage and hatematerialized, he also had time to reflect on everything he had been taught,everything he had read, and everything he had seen about the use of the gift. Itwas all there in his mind, the memories ready to serve his need. In thatinstant, it felt as if Zedd were there with him, because this was something Zeddhad intimately known and understood.Now, Richard felt it. It was him. It was wrath itself.Through it all, even as memories of Zedd warmed him, the thing that stood out inhis mind, the thing that mattered, was that he was a war wizard, born of a longline of those rare men.He had always fought that reality. He had always tried to both master it andavoid it, never comfortable with who he was. But in that crystal-clear instantsparked by raw danger, it all came together.This was his purpose, his calling, his need.To his other side, Shale was also lifting a hand to use her power. He knew, inthe silence of that soft yet unborn instant inside the swirling haze of ragesparkling all around him, that not only was it not enough, but it wasn’t goingto be fast enough. What she was able to do couldn’t begin to match the speed andenormity of the threat. At most, she would only have time to take out one or twoof what looked like well over a hundred attackers before the attackersoverwhelmed and killed them all.As much as he admired her courage, this was not for her to do. This was not forthe soldiers to do. This was not for the Mord-Sith to do. This was not for theMother Confessor to do. This was vastly more than any and all of them couldbegin to do.This was for Richard to do.In his mind he realized that the totality of it, while at first seemingoverwhelming, simply required a computation of position, distance, degree ofangles, numbers of each threat, and their rate of speed as they closed the shortdistance to their victims.While the entirety of it was a complex algorithm of various factors, it was, atthe same time, a known equation. He knew the foundational formulas from thelanguage of Creation, from notes in a book he had found by First WizardBaraccus, Secrets of a War Wizard’s Power, written expressly for Richard threethousand years before he had been born. There was also the underlying work doneby Baraccus on azimuth observations, and what Richard had learned from the manyother books he had read—even The Adventures of Bonnie Day, written by NathanRahl—as well as a variety of formulas in the Cerulean scrolls, and severaluseful ratios from a book his grandfather had once found in the Keep, ContinuumRatios and Viability Predictions. There were computations of gradient anglesaffected by speed that Richard had already made the same instant he saw theperspective and distances while computing reflective effects of what heintended. He had to factor in the power that he would bring to bear and how itwould affect every one of the calculations.He saw all of those calculations and computations in his mind’s eye in a flickerof time. They were done almost as soon as he saw what would be necessary.Those calculations came together with instinct honed from every experience inhis life, from every battle he had fought, every person and creature he hadkilled. He wondered why he had never realized it in quite that same way before.Even as he wondered, he knew that his time spent in the eternity of theunderworld—when he had straightened out tangled connections in his gift—hadgiven him inestimable insight he could have gained nowhere else but in the worldof the dead.All of that power crackling around him, was him. It was a creation of his gift.He had brought it into being. It was his to direct. It was his to wield. It wasan extension of his fury.In that instant, at the peak of the swirling haze of colors and flashing pointsof light surging up from his soul, Richard unleashed his rage.The air between him and the creatures distorted as it was violently compressedto an infinitely small point. Throughout the palace, through every open windowand door, every place open to the sky, air rushed in to fill the void he hadcreated up on the balcony by that sudden compression. It abruptly sucked the airfrom the lungs of everyone around him, instantly forming ice crystals aroundtheir noses and mouths. Their eyes bulged from the sudden pressure difference.Richard leaned his body forward, arms out, projecting and directing his giftthrough his hands to push that point he had created toward the enemy. It shiftedin among them as they were helplessly suspended in that moment frozen in time.Near the focal point of that pressure gradient some of their chests ripped openfrom the internal pressure of the air violently escaping as it tried to equalizethe pressure in the vacuum around that compression point. Some of their eyesburst.As Richard pushed that compression point through their midst to position itwhere it needed to be in the center of the mass, the tissue nearest the steepestportion of the pressure gradient vaporized. From his point of view, what Richardsaw was a hole being tunneled right through the creatures, and unfortunately thesoldiers, through flesh and bone and steel as he pushed it to where it was goingto need to be. Flesh around the vaporizing tissue shredded as it was sucked intoward the point.But that was only in the first infinitesimal fraction of time before he releasedthe heat and energy he had pulled from the air he had compressed into thatpoint.Richard, that power’s origin, its genesis, its creator, its commander, gave itwhat it needed: command.He pushed his hands out with the effort of pressing that point of concussion notonly tighter but also into the midst of the Glee.When he at last released that compressed energy at that central, infinitesimallysmall point, it expanded with such a violent detonation that it shook the palaceand knocked everyone except Richard from their feet.The heat of the explosive expansion ignited the air itself. Countless shards ofelemental fire, like splinters of white-hot burning glass, tumbled, spun, andflew everywhere inside the expanding discharge of energy. Those glowingsplinters of heat flared through everything within the shell of the expandingcentral point. Flesh, bone, blood, even the steel of the soldiers’ weapons, allfragmented into burning particles that blazed from white hot, to red, to ash,all in one explosive instant.Richard, though, could see it all drawn out in its full dynamic display.The air that had been sucked into the palace now had to leave, driven before aviolent shockwave. The pressure that had built up broke windows in its brutalrush outward. Air that had been sucked from lungs suddenly rushed back in with athump and an involuntary gasp.In that instant of release—the center of it located in the center of the mass ofGlee—the concussive energy violently reoccupied the void around the centralpoint with such force that everything ignited in something akin to wizard’sfire, but not concentrated and not actually fire in the same magic-generatedsense. This was something else entirely. This was elemental heat and force, aforge of a war wizard’s power unleashed.To Richard it all was a predetermined, programmed formula unfolding indeliberate stages that he had calculated the instant before releasing the energyhe had gathered. To anyone else seeing it happen, it was a sudden detonationthat filled the corridor with a blinding flash and thunderous blast, and in thatpristine instant of release, they would have felt the hammer of force againsttheir chest as they saw the Glee explode into ash.Richard felt it all as an extension of his rage unleashed, exquisite, pure, andprofoundly violent. It was glorious.In the ringing silence that followed, the greasy cloud of ash that had been theGlee floated through the air, gradually drifting down.There were sooty piles of it similar to the ones left in the library’scontainment field, even if created in a different manner. There were splattersand smears of it against the walls, the pillars, and on the short wall at theside of the balcony. It covered the floor in a thick mass like the aftermath ofa black blizzard.Amid that devastation were also the gray, ashen remains of the soldiers of theFirst File who had been coming to protect them. They had been there, caught upin the center of that maelstrom of energy Richard had released.He had ached with sorrow, even as he had released his power, knowing it wouldalso kill those brave men."},{"pageContent":"11 [006.html#a6]In the hush as time returned to normal, those with Richard slowly tried togather their senses. The ones still conscious held their heads, groaning in painfrom the pressure he had created both in the compression of the air, and in itsexplosive expansion.Richard alone stood unaffected, gazing first for a time at the ashen remains ofthe Glee and the soldiers, then around at everyone else.Rikka and Cassia looked to be unconscious. Nyda, Vale, and Berdine were justsitting up, holding their heads and taking deep breaths. Shale put a knee to thefloor as she steadied herself before trying to stand.Richard bent to help Kahlan get up. Like everyone else, she looked stunned. Asconsciousness gradually returned, she blinked, trying to collect her wits. Helifted her to her feet. Still trying to get her balance, she leaned against himfor support.“Richard,” she managed as she winced, panting to catch her breath, her handsgrabbing hold of his arms, “what … what just happened? I thought we were alldead. How can we be alive? What did you do?”“Not the kind of thing I would want to do outside a containment field, but I hadno choice.”“Where are we?” Rikka asked, sounding groggy and only half awake.“It’s all right,” Richard said as he grabbed her hand when she lifted it andthen helped pull her to her knees.Shale, still on her knees, gestured. “You destroyed them all.” She squinted atthe mass of black ash not far away. “You destroyed them all?”She seemed confused. People down on the main floor who had also been knockedfrom their feet were groaning as they began to get back up. Being farther away,they didn’t feel it with the same severity, but they were still affected by whathad happened. Such an event expanded for quite some distance beyond the lethalradius.When Richard looked up, he saw that across the vast corridor, on the balconythat mirrored theirs, a lone Glee stood motionless, claws at its sides,watching.Richard stared across at it. The lone Glee stared back. For a long moment, theyjust stared at each other. It didn’t try to come closer, or for that matter, doanything. It appeared that it was simply observing.And then, as the tall black creature and Richard stood gazing at each other, itdissolved back into its own world.Richard couldn’t begin to imagine what that had been about.*Kahlan looked around and saw everyone finally getting to their feet. With theirhands, they felt their chests, checking themselves over, expecting to findinjuries, but there were no injuries to find. Back down the corridor behindthem, the soldiers that had been rushing to their assistance were likewise alltrying to regain their senses. Some had to steady themselves on a hand and aknee as they pulled themselves together. Some of the men helped others up.Kahlan looked around, surprised to see that everyone was alive. The Mord-Sithappeared unhurt. Edward Harris leaned back against the short wall a moment,catching his breath. The remaining soldier of the three shook his head, as ifclearing the cobwebs.Kahlan’s thoughts seemed to tumble in fragments as she tried to piece togetherwhat had just happened. She had seen the mass of Glee materialize, and she hadknown they were all going to die.It almost felt as if time itself skipped a beat, then something violenthappened. It felt to her like it had been a dream. For a moment she couldn’tbreathe, as if the wind had been knocked out of her, then she rememberedsuddenly gasping in a breath and feeling life return to her only to loseconsciousness.In a way, there were elements of what had just happened that reminded her ofwhen she released her power. But this time, she knew that it was quitedifferent, and that somehow, in some way, Richard had just used his gift to savethem all.One instant they had been about to die, then the next instant, it seemed, shewas waking up on the floor. Down the corridor she could see that the Glee wereno more. There was only the greasy ash remains similar to what she had seen inthe containment field in the library. She knew without a doubt that these Gleehad not had the chance to return to their own world.She finally hugged Richard, laying her head against his shoulder. “You saved us,Richard. You saved us all. I don’t know exactly what just happened, or how youdid it, but you saved us.”Richard, staring off at the ashen remains of the soldiers who had died with theGlee, nodded.“Sometimes,” he said in a soft, intimate voice, “I wish I didn’t have suchability and everyone else wasn’t depending on me to protect them. Sometimes Iwish I didn’t know the things I know or couldn’t do the terrible things I cando.“Sometimes,” he said, staring off at nothing, “I wish I was just like everyoneelse.”“But you’re not, Richard. You’re not. Remember what I’ve always told you? Youcan be no more than who you are, and no less.” She put a hand to the side of hishandsome face. “Remember?”He smiled a little as he nodded.“I know what you mean, though. Growing up I often wished I hadn’t been born aConfessor, that I was just like everyone else, that I was simply a normal girl.I’ve had to do terrible things with my ability. I’ve had to unleash my poweragainst people I wish I hadn’t needed to kill. So I understand what you’refeeling. But with me, I’ve had a lifetime to come to terms with it. You will,too.”Richard touched the side of her face, gazing into her eyes. “I know.”He sighed as he seemed to remember himself again and all the others. “Berdine?Are you all right?”Berdine, bending to retrieve her Agiel, grinned at him. “I knew you would saveus, Lord Rahl. I wasn’t worried at all.”“Well, I was worried enough for all of you,” Shale said. “If you had any sense,you would have been scared witless.”“If it’s any consolation,” Cassia said with a smile, “I was just a little bitworried.”Shale harrumphed. She came closer and peered up at Richard, as if seeing him ina new light. “Lord Rahl, someday when we have the time, I would like very muchfor you to explain to me precisely what you just did.”Richard, one arm still around Kahlan, holding her close, shrugged. “It was justsome simple calculations.”“Uh-huh.” She cast a critical look over at the greasy, black, ashen remains.“Simple calculations. Yes, of course. I can see that.” She planted a fist on herhip. “Then how is it that you can turn a raging mob of monsters to ash, and yetyou can’t seem to light a lamp with your gift?”Richard shrugged. “The lamp isn’t trying to kill us all.”He turned to the soldier still with them. “When those men down there gathertheir senses and get over here, they can help you take care of this.” Hegestured around at the carnage still left all over the floor from the previousattack. The remains continued to leak blood and fluids in ever-growing pools. “Ineed to see to some urgent business.”With a steely look, the man clapped a fist to his heart.Richard gestured off at the destruction he had created. “I’m truly sorry aboutthose men. They didn’t deserve to die. They especially didn’t deserve to die bymy hand.”The soldier glanced briefly at the ashen remains. “You had no choice, Lord Rahl.You just preserved any hope we have for all of us to survive, for all of us tohave a future. These monsters want to hunt and kill us all. Grieve for thosefallen men of the First File but know that they were doing what they believed inand what they chose to do.”Richard gripped the man’s shoulder. “Thank you. You got some of them, too. Youdid good, too.” He gestured to the remains of the two who had fought off theGlee when Mr. Burkett had been fleeing. “You and your two brothers-in-arms.”The soldier nodded his appreciation.“Mr. Harris,” Richard said, as he took Harris’s arm and helped pull him the restof the way upright, “take us to the place with the maps of the palace you toldus about.”“At once, Lord Rahl.” He hesitated. “And thank you, Lord Rahl, for before.” Hepointed over the side. “For catching me.”“‘Master Rahl protect us,’” Richard quoted from the devotion. “Just doing myjob. Now let’s go.”"},{"pageContent":"12 [006.html#a6]Edward Harris wasted no time as he led Richard and everyone with him to one ofthe grand marble staircases to begin their descent from the upper level to thesecure lower vault where the palace design plans were located. Because it was soopen, this was one of the few staircases that didn’t echo with all theirfootsteps. Instead, the whispers of conversation drifted up to them.When they reached the main floor, Richard saw large numbers of people gatheredin small groups all around the expansive corridor, engaged in worried talk aboutwhat had just happened. Richard could see soldiers and workers in the distancedealing with the remains of Mr. Burkett as well as a broad area covered withgreasy ash—the remains of the Glee Richard had killed.The hushed conversations, fearful talk, and tearful stories tapered off and diedout when the Lord Rahl, the Mother Confessor, and the alluring Shale marchedthrough their midst with five Mord-Sith in red leather escorting them. The eyesof hundreds of people watched them making their way along the corridor. Somewere probably surprised to see the Mother Confessor in traveling clothes andwearing a long knife at her belt. Business at the shops had come to an end aftermany of the customers as well as the people working in the shop had fled in fearfor their lives.Richard wondered if the Golden Goddess was watching through any of those eyes,and if another attack would suddenly appear out of nowhere, possibly with manytimes the numbers sent for the last attack. He hoped the goddess had beenwatching through someone’s eyes and had been discouraged from the notion thatsimply sending large numbers would bring her success. Richard feared it would,but maybe if she saw the ashes of hundreds of her kind up on the balcony itwould discourage her.Everyone with him watched nervously for another attack. Down in the corridor theGlee could kill hundreds. For the time being, though, they seemed to be focusedon killing Richard and Kahlan, not the people in the palace.Richard knew that by now a great number of people—both those seeing the battlesplay out up on the balcony, and others watching from the upper galleries—wouldhave finally seen the frightening Glee. There was no more keeping it secret.Talk of such sightings, the deadly battle, and power unleashed by the Lord Rahlagainst the howling monsters would be spreading to every corner of the palace.By morning, everyone would have heard about it. Everyone would be talking aboutlittle else.He knew that fear would have many people either holed up in their quarters orfleeing the palace. There was no safe place anywhere in their world, of course,but the people didn’t know that. As far as Richard was concerned, his job was toworry about finding a way to stop the threat, not to give them comfort andassurances.As they quickly moved down the corridor, he wondered about the lone Glee he hadseen off on the opposing balcony, just standing there, watching him. Richardfeared to imagine what that was about. Something about the look they sharedstill haunted him.At the least that silent observer had seen Richard turn more than a hundred ofits kind to ash. If it had been there as a spy for the goddess, then it had somebad news to report back to her. He didn’t know if such a report would strikefear into her heart, or merely make her angry and even more determined. What hedid know was that appeasement wasn’t an option.Turning off the main corridor, Harris, in the lead, finally took Richard andcompany out of the public areas and out of the sight of so many people. Hewondered if she would think of watching them through Harris’s eye. Once theywere in the restricted areas, he took them down a series of hallways andcorridors.Kahlan, almost having to run, put her arm through Richard’s as she leaned close.“We will get her back, Richard.”Richard nodded. “As long as I’m alive, we will.”“Don’t put it that way,” she admonished. “Not after what just happened backthere.”Richard forced himself to show her a smile as he briefly hugged her close withone arm.Four soldiers standing guard over an even more highly restricted area saw himcoming accompanied by Mord-Sith. They saluted with fists to hearts. Richard wasaware that it would only take one ungifted person, like one of those foursoldiers, for the goddess to see where they were going.Richard didn’t have any idea how the goddess selected a person to use as anobserver. He hoped that maybe it took her a bit of time to find a new person.“Just because we’re in the restricted corridors,” he told the rest of those withhim, “doesn’t mean we’re safe. The Glee can show up in here just as easily asthey did up on the balcony. Stay alert.”The Mord-Sith, all spinning their Agiel at the end of the fine gold chainsaround their wrists, nodded.Inside the next set of doors was a simple stone service stairwell that did echoall the way down four flights of stairs. At the bottom there was a small roomwith a locked door. Harris, who fortunately had keys for such doors, hurriedlyunlocked it. Beyond, a broad hallway stretched off into darkness.“People don’t have any reason to regularly come down here, so it isn’t keptlighted,” Harris explained. He gestured to shelves. “We’ll need to take some ofthose lamps.”He collected one of the dozens from the shelf, then lit it with a splinter hecaught to flame from another lamp mounted to the wall outside that door. Each ofthe Mord-Sith collected a lamp and let him light theirs from the same splinter.Harris pointed off into the darkness. “Down that way is where all of the palaceplans are kept.”Nyda stepped out in front of the group. “Wait here. Let me and Vale go check,first.”Richard was in a hurry, but considering how many surprise attacks they hadexperienced, he decided to let them do their job. He tilted his head for them togo on ahead, then watched as the bubble of light moved with them down the long,dark stone passageway until they reached double doors the end.Nyda’s voice echoed when she turned and called back to them, “Clear.”Richard knew that there was no such thing as clear. The Glee could show upanywhere, but at least he knew they weren’t waiting for them down in thedarkness. At least, not yet.“Let’s go,” he said as he started out.The rest of the group followed down the passageway of gray stone to thegray-painted, broad metal door. There was an odd kind of lock built into thedoor that required moving a series of five levers sticking out of the metalcovering up or down to one of several dozen specific, marked positions. Once theman had the levers properly positioned, he pulled up on a heavy lever to drawthe bolt back. The hinges squealed in protest as it swung open. The air thatescaped smelled musty.“What do you do if you forget the lock sequence?” Richard asked. “Or if you gomissing and they need to open the door?”Harris shrugged with a smile. “There are a half-dozen palace officials who knowthe lock sequence, but if none of them could be found and if it was importantenough, then I guess the soldiers would simply break it down. It’s not like avault door, such as the one to get into the inner shaft of the plateau, and it’snot protecting a treasure of gold. It’s a strong metal door, but with enougheffort I would guess it could be broken down. The lock is basically meant tokeep out people who might be snooping around where they don’t belong. An enemywho wanted to attack the palace, for example, could make good use of all theplans and diagrams in here. That’s why it’s locked.”“I guess that makes sense,” Richard said as all of the Mord-Sith rushed inbefore the door was even fully opened.“Did Mr. Burkett know the sequences for the lock levers?”“Of course. Him and then six of his assistants, including me.”Richard didn’t say anything, but Mr. Burkett had already proven he was willingto betray the interests of the palace. Richard had wanted him out of the palaceand banished forever. But considering that he knew the lock combination, notonly to this place but, Richard had to assume, to many others, it was probably agood thing that he was dead.Once inside, Shale swept out her arm to light all the lamps placed liberallyaround the surprisingly vast room. It was a lot bigger than Richard hadenvisioned. Arches all around the outside walls were held up by unadorned stonepillars. Three more substantial pillars down the center of the room held up therow of arches that in turn held up the vaulted ceilings.Between each pillar against all the walls, crosshatched boards created what hadto be thousands of uniform, diamond-shaped cubbyholes for all the rolled-updiagrams. A series of at least a dozen large tables sat in the center of theroom, each big enough to spread out one or more of the diagrams. Richardcouldn’t even begin to guess at the number of rolled-up plans.Harris went to the right, to the nearest series of cubbyholes holding rolledplans. He pointed up at the label in the top of the arch.“See? Everything is numbered and labeled so you can find the plan you need ifyou know the section name in the palace. If you don’t, there is a map of eachfloor over there where each section is labeled. This section between pillars andthe ones next to it are all ‘W.’ We need sections with ‘M’ at the top.”The five Mord-Sith spread out, going around the room, looking at the letter atthe top of each arch.“Here they are,” Cassia called out from the far-right corner. “Section M.”“See here?” Harris asked when they reached the section she had found. “They’reorganized in vertical rows. Here are rows A and then rows B and so on. Dependingon the number of areas with rolled plans, those rows might continue on the otherside of the pillar.”He trailed his finger down one row and then down two more before he leaned in tocheck the numbers on the bottom of the cubbyholes. He had to go to the end ofthe section they were in; then he pulled out a long, rolled plan. At the nearesttable he spread it out, putting weights each table had on the sides to keep theplans from rolling back up.He pointed. “See, it’s written here, down at the bottom. ‘M111-B.’”Richard, standing at the edge of the table, looking down at the diagram, leanedin a little. Everyone to either side leaned in, looking with him. Richard wasthe only one who actually knew what he was looking at.He stared at what he was seeing, hardly able to believe it.“What’s wrong?” Kahlan asked. “Your face just turned white.”“Lord Rahl, what is it?” Shale asked in the dragging silence.Richard’s gaze traced all of the passageways, the rooms, the circular halls, thedead ends, the entrapments, the false helix, the lateral routes, the complex oftwinned and tripled passageways, checking, hoping he was wrong.He wasn’t.“We’re in trouble,” he said, not really having intended to say it out loud."},{"pageContent":"13 [006.html#a6]“Why are we in trouble?” Kahlan asked, alarmed by the way he was acting. Heseemed not to hear her. “Richard, why are we in trouble?”She finally had to put a finger on the side of his jaw and turn his face towardher to get him to pay attention.“What?”“You said we’re in trouble. Why are we in trouble?”Richard straightened and took a step away from the table as he raked his fingersback through his hair.“Richard,” Kahlan said again, this time with exaggerated patience, drawing hisname out to make him look at her, “what do you see? What is it?”He stared at her for a long moment. “It’s a complication.”“Well, I can see by the weird and confusing design of the place that it looksincredibly complicated. But what do you see?”He was shaking his head even as she was talking.“No. You don’t understand. It’s a complication.” He swept a hand out over theplan. “This kind of design is called a complication.”Shale looked exasperated. “You mean it’s an exceedingly complicated maze? We allcan see that. Is that what you mean to say?”“No,” Richard said, irritably, as if no one was really paying attention to whathe was saying. “No. I mean it’s a complication.”“Richard,” Kahlan said, pinching the bridge of her nose with a finger and thumbas she let out a composing breath, “I know you think that should explain it, butwe don’t understand what that means to you. You need to tell us what you mean bythat. What are you trying to say?”Kahlan knew that Richard’s unorthodox way of thinking often galloped so far outahead of what they saw, taking into account things only he knew about orunderstood, that he often seemed to make no sense. It was one of the reasons theMord-Sith, along with others, sometimes said he acted crazy. It seemed that wayto people because they didn’t understand what was in his head.“It’s a complication. That’s what this kind of design is called. That is thename for it: a complication.” Richard lifted an arm, indicating everythingabove. “This whole place is laid out atop a spell-form drawn on the ground.”“The People’s Palace,” Kahlan said, nodding, “yes, we know that. We know thepalace is a spell-form.”Shale leaned in, holding a hand against her arm. “A what? A spell-form? Now whatare you talking about? You’re beginning to sound as crazy as him.”Richard squinted at her in a way that told Kahlan he was having a hard timebelieving Shale would ask something so basic. “You know … a spell-form.”Shale folded her arms and straightened without saying anything, clearly notunderstanding and expecting him to explain.Richard took a settling breath to back himself up. “Well, you know what a Graceis, right?”“A Grace?” Shale squinted with uncertainty at what we was getting at. “Well yes,my mother and father taught me to draw a Grace when I was little. I know what aGrace is. What does that have to do with anything?”Richard leaned toward her a bit. “A Grace is an example of a spell-form. Thelines that make up the Grace, the design of it, is called a spell-form.” Hemoved his finger around in the air before him as if drawing a Grace. “When youdrew the Grace you were drawing one example of a spell-form.”It was Shale’s turn to frown. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. A Graceis a Grace is a Grace.”Richard threw up his hands in exasperation. “A Grace is a spell-form! Like anyspell-form it can be drawn in different ways for different purposes.”“Different purposes? Now what are you talking about?”“Think of the spell-form this way. Imagine a plan drawn for a building. That’scalled a building design, right? But the resulting building can be different,depending on how you draw the design. Do you see what I mean? It can have morerooms or more floors drawn on the design and the resulting reality in brick andmortar will be a reflection of how the design was drawn.”She stared openly at him a moment. “So, a spell-form, such as the Grace, can bedrawn in different ways?”“Of course. Didn’t your parents warn you never to draw it in blood? Or out oforder?”“Well, obviously.”“That’s because a Grace is a spell-form, and like all spell-forms, since theyinvolve magic, if not drawn correctly they can cause great trouble. There arecertain spell-forms that are lethal if drawn incorrectly or in the wrong order.Some, like the Grace, if deliberately drawn by a strongly gifted person incertain ways other than the formal procedure like you were taught, can be usedto invoke any number of things.”“Any number of things?” Shale was still frowning as she watched him. “Likewhat?”“Well, drawn by the right person, in a specific order and manner, a Grace canconjure up the world of the dead. The Grace is only one of many examples ofspell-forms, some of them very minor and relatively unimportant and some quiteconsequential.”Shale shook her head to herself. “I’m afraid that where I grew up the giftedwere few and far between. I never learned anything about spell-forms, other thanwhat my parents taught me about how to draw the Grace.”Richard cooled a bit, turning sympathetic. “I understand. I grew up in a placewithout magic. I’ve since had to learn about it. One of the things I had tolearn is the language of Creation. The language of Creation actually uses someelements of spell-forms because it’s representational language.”“Representational language?”“Sure. If you see a simple drawing of a bird, it conveys a whole array ofmeaning—a concept—without needing words, right? That’s how the language ofCreation works. It conveys meaning and concepts through symbols, designs, andemblems rather than words.”She looked intrigued. “Someday you will have to tell me more about the languageof Creation, but for now, what is the important point about this particularspell-form?”Richard pointed a finger toward the ceiling, rotating his hand around toindicate everything above them. “The People’s Palace is laid out in the shape ofa giant spell-form, the purpose of which is to give the Lord Rahl more powerwhen he is here, in his home, also called the House of Rahl. That makes thePeople’s Palace a place of power for the Lord Rahl.”“More power? More power like what?”“Like when I turned all those Glee to ash. I was in part aided by the power ofthe spell-form of the palace itself. It helped me by adding energy to what Idid—because I am the Lord Rahl. That’s the purpose of the way the palace wasoriginally designed. Like a castle has thick walls and defensive parapets andramparts, the People’s Palace was built on a giant spell-form drawn on theground. That spell-form gives it its shape and is its means of defense for theHouse of Rahl by augmenting their magic.”Shale blinked as she thought about it. “No wonder the halls are so confusing.”“Not if you know the specific spell and the language of Creation. If you do, thelayout of the palace makes perfect sense. It’s elegant in its simplicity … as aspell-form.”“Sure, perfect sense,” she mocked. She gestured at the plan on the table. “Sothen what’s this business about a complication?”Richard turned back to the diagram as he let out an unhappy sigh. “Acomplication, which is a spell-form, is an ancillary element of the principalspell-form to which it is attached. In this case, it’s a subordinate, supportingspell-form, meant to add power to the rest of the spell-form that is the palace.You might say it’s like extra descriptive words in a sentence.”“So it is a spell-form that exists on its own and it can also be a supportingelement of another spell-form?”“Yes and no,” Richard told her. “This is a specific type of spell-form called acomplication. It’s not meant to ever exactly exist on its own. Its purpose is toadd capability to the spell-form to which it is attached.”“Then it has a purpose for being here, for being built into the palace,” Kahlansaid.“Yes.”“So then why does it have you so worried and upset?”Richard took a deep breath. “The simplest way to explain the problem is that inthe language of Creation, the primary elemental component of this particularspell-form means ‘chaos.’ That means that this spell-form adds an element ofchaos to the power of the palace spell.”"},{"pageContent":"14 [006.html#a6]“Chaos,” Kahlan repeated. “In what way?”Richard lifted a hand as if to say that it was unknowable. “It adds its power tothe main spell to which it is attached in chaotic ways, meaning there is no wayto predict what it will do. That makes the primary spell-form of the palace moredangerous to enemies of the House of Rahl.”Kahlan wasn’t at all sure how such a spell would work. “Why would a chaoticelement make the main spell-form more dangerous?”“Because if a wizard—a Rahl here at the palace—uses his magic against a giftedenemy, the palace spell-form amplifies the power of the web he casts.”“All right,” Kahlan said. “That makes sense.”Richard held up a finger. “But a dangerously gifted enemy will know how tocounter magic. See the problem?”Kahlan, trying to follow, frowned in concentration. “No.”“The spell-form of the palace is a known, specific spell-form and for someonepowerfully gifted and experienced, it is therefore predictable in how itamplifies a Rahl’s power. Predictability means it can be anticipated and if itcan be anticipated it can be countered. If a Rahl’s magic is countered, then itis rendered ineffective against the enemy, right?“To solve that predictability problem, what the creators of the People’s Palacedid was to add in this chaotic complication.”“You mean it’s like gravy on a meat pie?” Shale asked.Richard smiled at her sarcasm. “Sort of. Lumpy gravy, and you don’t know what’sin the lumps.”He held out a hand toward the plan on the table. “In this case, thiscomplication’s function is to make the web cast by the Lord Rahl and amplifiedby the primary palace spell chaotically unpredictable. That makes it nearlyimpossible for a gifted enemy to defend against. See? It’s hard if notimpossible to put up a defense if you don’t know what’s coming.”“That’s incredibly devious,” Kahlan said as she thought about it.“Indeed it is,” Richard said with a nod.“Then having it here within the palace must not be so dangerous,” Shale said asshe paced off a short distance, considering, and then returned. “After all, it’sbeen here for millennia, hasn’t it? And it was meant to help a Rahl. So why doyou all of a sudden think it’s such a problem?”Richard wiped a hand back across his face. “Well, because it’s not simply acomplication drawn in sand or blood meant to attach to another spell-form drawnin sand or blood to cast a web. This one is huge, and it exists in stone andmortar, not in the dirt drawn with a stick. That means we’re going to need toactually go inside the complication.” He leaned closer to her. “Inside it.”“We’re inside the palace spell-form right now,” Shale said with a shrug.“Hens and hawks. Both birds, not the same animal.”Kahlan was beginning to grasp his concern. “So that’s why Moravaska Michec wouldhide in there? Because it’s like he’s hiding in a giant thorn hedge?”Richard nodded. He turned to Edward Harris. “Could you please get me the plansfor this region of the palace—the surrounding areas? And the levels above andbelow?”After consulting the palace map, the man went around the room, pulling rolls ofthe appropriate plans out of their cubbyholes, holding them under an arm as hecollected all the ones needed. Once he had them all, he spread them out on theadjacent tables, putting weights on the sides to hold them open. Following alongbehind him, Richard reviewed each one, looking increasingly upset witheverything he saw.“What?” Kahlan finally asked as he silently studied one, then another, then wentback to the first, then to the last. “What do you see?”His brow lowered as he leaned in over the plans laid out on all the tables.“This thing is even more extensive than I thought at first. This complicationspell isn’t technically two-dimensional, so it’s not a single floor, butactually a number of floors that are involved, all of it self-contained in itsown compartmentalized, separate location. Look here,” he said, pointing, “thisis the whole restricted wing of the palace where the complication is located,and all of this is the complication. It’s enormous. I mean, really enormous. Notsimply in terms of length and width, but on multiple levels.“It’s one gigantic, three-dimensional labyrinth. I can easily see why people whowent in there became lost and were never seen again. If you became disoriented,and didn’t understand the nature of the layout, it would be easy to get lost andnever find your way out. That’s why I needed the plans. I need to understandthem so that we’ll know where we are once in there.“This kind of spell-form, being chaotic, is naturally unpredictable, so thebuilders deliberately kept it totally isolated. When the palace spell uses it,it becomes involved and has purpose.”He gave both Shale and Kahlan a deadly serious look. “But when it’s idle andleft to its own devices, since it’s a chaotic element, it’s unpredictable.”“Unpredictable,” Kahlan repeated, folding her arms as she looked from his raptorgaze down at the plans, seeing the maze of halls and rooms and staircases in anew light. “We get the concept. It adds chaos to the palace spell.”Richard was shaking his head. “No, I mean it’s unpredictable in and of itself.”Kahlan frowned her skepticism. “Are you saying this place made up of confusinghalls and rooms can do things on its own, independent of the palace spell?”Richard nodded. “Exactly. In the right circumstances, this kind of spell-formwould be semi-sentient.”Shale’s jaw dropped. “What! Are you actually suggesting that it’s alive?”Richard waved a hand, dismissing the notion. “No, no, it’s not alive. Ioversimplified what I meant. Its specific purpose is to decide on its own,because it’s a chaos spell-form, how to add power to the primary spell-form. Seewhat I mean? Because it has the power to decide what to do and when, thatprocess makes it seem to mimic life. When I used my power, and the palace’sspell added power, this complication likely added some unpredictable, violentelement, making what I did to the Glee functionally more lethal. That makes itvirtually impossible to defend against.”Richard leaned in, giving them both a serious look again. “But when idle andleft to its own devices, a spell-form of this nature doesn’t simply sit there.It’s always active, a pot always on the boil, so it can do dangerouslyunpredictable things, such as entice people in.”Shale made a face. “Why? Why would it entice people in?”Richard stared at her for a long moment. “As a self-generated activity—asentertainment, you might say. Not exactly, but that’s the best way I can explainhow its function appears to us. Absent direction from the primary spell-form, itboils up and acts on its own, kind of like a curious child when left alone. Itstarts doing things as a way to fulfill its primary purpose. It’s a hammer, andpretty soon, if not used, it starts to think everything is a nail. When we go inthere, we are the nail.”“Dear spirits.” Kahlan put a hand to her forehead. “Why in the world would theybuild something that dangerous into the palace?”“Because it has a valid purpose,” Richard said. “If left entirely isolated, it’snot an issue, and that is what was intended. See here? The complication is notonly off-limits, but completely isolated. The builders put it on dedicatedlevels off to the side, diagonally, under the tombs. To further isolate it, theybuilt in locked doors preventing people from even getting to the stairs down tothe complication. It can’t hurt you if you don’t go near it.”“How can it hurt us?” Kahlan asked. “What can it do to us if we go in there?”Richard shook his head. “I don’t know. All I can tell you is that whatever itdoes will be unpredictable.”“Then we should leave,” Shale announced. “You’ve just done a thorough job ofexplaining why this complication spell is incredibly dangerous.“This isn’t your primary objective,” she reminded him with a shake of herfinger. “Your duty is to get yourself and the Mother Confessor to the safety ofthe Wizard’s Keep. The future of magic and the lives of everyone in our worlddepend on it. The safety of children yet unborn depends on it. Your gift, theMother Confessor’s gift, your unborn children, are more important than gettingVika out of there.”“I hate to say it,” Rikka said, “but the sorceress has a point. Like all of us,Vika knows the risks of protecting you. As terrified as she rightfully is ofMichec, she would want to die at his hands rather than have you put your lifeand the life of the Mother Confessor at risk to come in there after her.”“I agree,” Vale said. “Your safety and the Mother Confessor’s safety are whatmatters. We should avoid this danger and get to the Keep.”Nyda nodded her agreement. Cassia did so next. Berdine turned her face away andnodded.“You don’t understand,” Richard said. “Yes, I want to get Vika out of that man’sclutches, but this is about something more important. If Moravaska Michec iswhat you all say he is, then once we leave, he will undoubtedly strike at ourbacks when we least expect it. He could sabotage our cause just as effectivelyas the Glee in ways we can’t even imagine. He doesn’t want me to rule as theLord Rahl. If we leave and he takes over the palace …”“Richard is right,” Kahlan said. “You don’t leave a powerful enemy hiding inyour home to come at you when you’re asleep.”“Why would Michec be hiding in this complication thing?” Shale asked. “Wouldn’tit be dangerous to him as well?”“Not if he understands it,” Richard said.“He did,” Nyda confirmed. “He often took captives in there.”“He’s hiding in there, waiting for the right time to kill you,” Berdine said.“Taking Vika proves it.”“Well, that place down there isn’t called the Wasteland for nothing,” Harrissaid. “We always did our best to keep people away from the section. Somehowpeople still got in.”Richard nodded. “The spell-form self-generates things to act on as a way tocarry out its destructive, defensive function. I guess you could say itpractices killing by enticing unsuspecting people in there and killing them.Moravaska Michec isn’t unsuspecting, so the spell-form is in a way hisprotection.”Harris shook his head. “I just don’t see how, with it being behind all kinds oflocked doors and guard posts, people still manage to wander in there.”“The complication has the ability to undo locks,” Richard said. When they allstared at him, he added, “Because locks are part of the palace, and so is thecomplication, it’s very possible it can unlock the doors.”“If people die in there,” Shale asked Harris, “then how do you really know thatpeople find their way out there? I thought that people never returned from thatplace.”“Well, over the years a few people have wandered out,” he said. “They all died,however, shortly after escaping. But before dying they reported seeing corpsesin there, or human bones. I’m not sure what they died of because the First Filewas responsible for such things, but I know that since it’s their responsibilityto keep everyone away, the soldiers were quite alarmed to discover people comingout.”Shale finally let out a deep sigh. “I can see that I’m not going to be able totalk you out of going in there, and probably for good reason. But if it’s thatdangerous, then I think the Mother Confessor shouldn’t go in. I will protect herwhile you go in and deal with Michec.”Richard shook his head. “I appreciate the thought, but that’s not a good idea.For all we know, he could be expecting that and while I’m in there trying tofind him, he could actually be lurking out here in order to strike at Kahlan.Besides, as you said, he’s a witch man. You’re a witch woman.”Shale arched an eyebrow. “You seem to know everything, so now you need me?”“I hardly know everything, Shale. I do know I need your ability. We’re strongertogether. In our own way, we each help fill in the blanks. I agree that it’sdangerous for all of us to go in there, but the situation we have on our handsnow is that it’s more dangerous for us to split up and more dangerous yet tosimply leave this witch man lurking in the maze down there. Taking Vika was hisfirst act of war against us. He very well might have done it to get us to run.”Shale folded her arms as she looked away in thought. “I hate to admit it, but Ithink you may be right.”“So how are we going to deal with him?” Kahlan asked. “He is a witch man. Weknow all too well how dangerous witch women, like Shota, can be. For all weknow, he could be much more powerful. Plus he has us at a disadvantage becausehe has been living and hiding in there for a very long time. He knows the layoutand how to use the complication to his advantage. He’s had time to plot hisrevenge. How are we going to be able to deal with someone like that?”Richard gazed into her eyes. “If I have to, I will strangle him to death with mybare hands.”"},{"pageContent":"15 [006.html#a6]“That’s the passageway, there, Lord Rahl,” Nyda said in a low voice. “Beyondlies the Wasteland.”“Just so you understand,” Rikka told him, “Vika is most likely dead by now.Michec would not want to let you have any hope of saving her. He would want touse her death to make you feel powerless against him. His specialty is makinghis victims feel helpless.”Richard shook his head as he stared off into the darkness. “A man like Michechas bigger designs than killing Vika. His desire is to eliminate me. To do that,he will need her alive as bait.”Rikka let out a deep breath. “I have to admit, that’s a possibility. He mustfeel you are vulnerable.”“You mean because of the goddess?” Kahlan asked.Rikka nodded. “He has a way of knowing things. He would have chosen this time tostrike while you already have an incredibly difficult situation on your hands.He came and took Vika before we could leave in order to keep you here.”Richard checked a side hall as they went past. “All the more reason we can’tleave and allow him to have free run of the palace. There is no telling whatsort of treason he could be up to.”While Richard and those with him were on their way to find Michec, he had sentEdward Harris back. Harris swore that he would oversee the staff until Richard’sreturn.He also swore to investigate any influence by Moravaska Michec among the palacestaff. Richard told him that if he found any connections, to have the First Filedeal with it harshly.It had been a long way down to where the tombs were located, and then anotherlong journey to the isolated section M111-B. The eight soldiers at the guardstation at the first of the locked doors reported no activity.They admitted that in the past people had been discovered beating on the lockeddoors from the other side. The doors were opened to release those people, butstrict orders said that under no circumstances were they to go in beyond thefourth locked door, even to look for others.When the soldiers opened the first massive door and Richard stepped inside,glass spheres in brackets began to glow. The soldiers, carrying lamps, weresurprised. Richard wasn’t.The soldiers weren’t the only ones surprised. Shale gaped at the glowing glassspheres. “What in the world … ?”“Light spheres. They were created by ancient wizards,” Richard told her. “Theycan still be found in a number of isolated places, not only here at the palace.”Standing beyond the first door, inside the lighted area illuminated by thespheres, Richard turned to the soldier.“Do the other men also have keys?”The soldier looked a little puzzled. “Yes, Lord Rahl.”He really didn’t want any of the men getting any closer than necessary to thespell-form of the complication that waited beyond the fourth locked door.“Then give me your keys. I’ll return them when we come back out.”The man looked apprehensive. “Lord Rahl, we have men here who can escort you forprotection.”Rikka gestured around at her sister Mord-Sith. “What do you think we’re herefor? Just to look pretty?”“That’s not …” The big soldier took one look at her glare and cleared histhroat. “I can see that you have adequate protection with you.” He glanced backat Richard, eager to look away from the displeased Mord-Sith. “We will be at ourpost should you need us, Lord Rahl.”“Have you or the others seen anything out of the ordinary recently?” Richardasked the soldier.“Out of the ordinary? No, Lord Rahl. It’s been as quiet as a tomb down here.Always is.”Richard nodded, thanking the man, and then closed and locked the first door. Itfelt ominous being beyond that first barrier on their way into what he knew tobe a dangerously unpredictable spell-form.“What really bothers me,” Richard said as he pulled the key from the lock, “ishow Michec was able to come and go from this place. It appears he may have beenhiding down here for a long while, waiting for the right time to strike. But nomatter how long he’s been here, he would need to come out from time to time forsupplies. And, he obviously went up to the stables to capture Vika and take herback in there with him.”In the silence, Richard turned back to look at the rest of them. “So, how wasMichec coming and going?”“Maybe there’s another way in and out,” Kahlan suggested as they reached thesecond vaultlike door. “You know, a secret entrance of some kind. Maybe aservice entrance.”“That wouldn’t be necessary,” Shale said.Richard had to turn keys in two sets of locks in the second door, and then lifta long lever to draw back heavy bolts.He turned back to Shale. “What do you mean? Why wouldn’t it be necessary?”He pulled open the second door. Beyond was another small, empty room made up ofrough stone blocks. Light spheres in four brackets began to glow as they allstepped into the room.“This Michec character wouldn’t need a secret way in and out. He’s a witch man.”Shale shrugged, as if that should explain everything. She glided a hand over thetop of one of the glowing glass spheres. “These light spheres, as you calledthem, start glowing a faint green, getting brighter as we get close, to thenglow with a warm yellow-white light when we’re even closer and like now, when Iput my hand on it.”“They react to the presence of the gift,” Richard said as he unlocked the twolocks on the third door. “Between you, Kahlan, and me, they have what’s neededto make them glow. Now, what do you mean about Michec not needing a secret wayin and out?”Shale’s brow twitched. “I told you. He’s a witch man.”“So?”“Witch women are masters of illusion. As a witch man, I can’t even imagine howpowerful he might be. That kind could easily create an illusion that he wasn’tthere. That’s how I intend to get us away from the palace without the soldiers,and thus the goddess, knowing we are leaving or which direction we were going.Don’t you remember that I said I would take care of it?”Everyone stared at her. Richard pulled open the door, revealing the same sort ofplain room and the substantial fourth door on the opposite wall. That last onehad four locks—two on each side. Instead of a lever, it had a wheel in thecenter.“You can do such a thing?” Kahlan asked.“I’m a witch woman. Of course I can. If I can make snakes appear and disappearfrom around your ankles, don’t you suppose I can make people not see usleaving?”“Snakes?” Richard turned to Kahlan. “What’s she talking about?”Kahlan waved off the question. “So then Michec could cast a web so that thesoldiers wouldn’t see him coming and going?”Shale frowned her incredulity. “You two really don’t know much about witchwomen, do you?”“What about the locks?” As soon all of them had stepped into the little roomRichard pulled the third door closed and then locked it.“I’m not sure.” Shale’s face twisted in thought a moment. “Could be any ofseveral methods to defeat them.”“Like what?” Richard pressed.“Well, one simple way would be to cast a web to make the guards curious enoughto come to check on things and unlock all the doors, giving him the chance toslip in before they are satisfied there was nothing there, and lock the doors.”Richard didn’t like to think how easy it would be for someone gifted in such away to create trouble. “But to get back out, would he be able do that frombeyond four locked doors? Could he somehow make the guards come back to unlockall the doors so he could get out? And wouldn’t they get suspicious when theywere unlocking the doors so often over nothing?”Shale looked back at the third door Richard had just locked as she considered.“I’m not sure, but there’s an even simpler explanation.”“Like what?” Kahlan asked.“He could have used a concealment spell so the guards wouldn’t see him and thensimply taken a set of spare keys, like the ones you borrowed.”Richard grunted unhappily. “You’re right. That certainly would be easier. Then,all he would have to do is cast a concealment web to go unnoticed as he came andwent?”Shale nodded. “That’s the idea.”Richard unlocked the locks on each side of the final door and then startedspinning the wheel in the center. As he did, it drew the heavy bolts back fromthe iron doorframe set into massive stone blocks to each side.“It certainly looks like the builders went to a lot of trouble to make sure noone got in here,” Kahlan said.Richard pulled on the door. “Unfortunately, they didn’t take witch men intoaccount.” The door was so heavy that he had to tug on it several times to startit moving. Once it did start, it slowly glided open on silent hinges.With the door standing wide open, they all stood and stared in amazement at whatlay beyond."},{"pageContent":"16 [006.html#a6]There before them, beyond a wide space that stretched off for quite a distanceuntil it vanished into darkness on each side, stood a tall wall made up of hugeblocks of age-darkened stone. As with the sides, the light failed to reach farenough up for them to see the full height, but from remembering the plans,Richard thought it rose possibly three stories high. The width of it was fargreater.It almost appeared as if they were standing before a massive castle, as imposingas any Richard had ever seen, as if it had already been there for eons when theHouse of Rahl came along, and then it had been left in place and the palacebuilt around it. He knew, of course, that wasn’t the case, but that was theimpression it left him with.In the center of the wall was a great doorway surrounded by a series of steppedstone arches jutting out from the face of the wall. Each of those stone arches,some carved to look like rope, some with repeated designs, was layered on top ofa broader one behind. The mass of those intricate, layered arches was so thickthey stood out several feet from the wall. The stacked arches surrounding thewooden wall with the door had to be a couple of stories tall.A wall of age-darkened oak with large, hammered iron studs laid out in a gridpattern was set back far enough in the deep opening of the enormous arches thatit almost made it look like a vestibule. Iron straps crisscrossed over the faceof the heavy oak door in the center of that wall. Iron studs pinned where eachof the straps crossed connected them solidly together. The strap-hinges lookedlarge enough to easily to hold up the weight of the door. There were no locks inthe door; there was simply a big iron ring in the center, held out in the hookedbeak of a cast bronze eagle head, presumably used to pull open the door.“Why do you suppose there would be such an elaborate and imposing entrywaybeyond the four locked doors?” Kahlan asked. “After all, who is going to seeit?”Richard shook his head as he studied the wall and the entryway, looking foranything suspicious. “I can’t imagine.” His brow twitched. “Unless it’s to payhomage to the spell.”“You have to be kidding,” Shale said.Richard merely flashed her a brief smile.They all shared looks before Richard finally ascended three monolithic slabsmaking up the stone steps to get up to the door. He hesitated, wiping his palmson his pants before using both hands to grip the big iron ring held in theeagle’s beak. The door glided open, almost willingly, to reveal just thebeginning of a dark corridor beyond.“Are you sure about this, Lord Rahl?” Rikka asked.Rather than answer, Richard walked through the doorway and into the darkcorridor. As glass spheres to each side began to glow, he could see that it wasa vast passageway that stretched off into darkness in a gentle curve to theright. He was pretty sure he knew which curved element it was from thespell-form of the complication. Grimy-looking stone walls rose up high to eachside. Ornate crown moldings at the edge of the ceiling appeared to be carvedfrom stone as well.The corners of the ceiling and even joints in the stone of the walls had layersof dirty cobwebs that waved slightly as the air moved when they walked in.The floor was covered with of a variety of darker marble tiles in a spiraledgridwork pattern. Big squares holding stone mosaics were set into frames oflarge marble tiles. The designs of the floor swept off into the distance,elaborate, yet dimmed over time by dust and dirt. The gloomy stone making up thewalls appeared to be just as grimy from many centuries of accumulated dust. Thewalls and the floor were so dark they seemed to suck up the light. All the groutlines in the marble floor were packed with millennia of dirt that helped todarken the whole floor.Michec might have been a warlock who could cast concealment spells, but as faras Richard knew, he couldn’t fly, so he had left footprints in the dusty floorjust like any mortal. A pathway through the dirt and dust told Richard that theman had probably been hiding down in section M111-B for some time, since hiscoming and going had nearly cleared the grimy dirt away down the center of thebroad passageway.Richard spotted smaller footprints near the side, as if a lost woman had kept ahand on the wall for guidance as she walked haltingly on her way farther in toanswer a calling from the complication spell. The light spheres wouldn’t workunless you were gifted, so unless she carried a lamp, she would have been blindin the total darkness, driven on by a compulsion she didn’t understand.From the well-worn path through the dust, Richard couldn’t help but wonder howmany times Michec had gone up into the palace proper and what he done on thoseoccasions. He did know that one of those times he had captured Vika.As Richard moved farther into the corridor, everyone followed silently. Richardheld a hand back, touching Kahlan to make sure she stayed close. Nearby glassspheres in iron brackets all the way down the corridor began to glow when theygot close enough, making it seem almost as if they were alive, the lightwelcoming and escorting them in, but the somber stone passageway was so murkythat the glass spheres didn’t do much to illuminate anything beyond theirimmediate area.Before long, as the corridor curved off into the distance, they encounteredrooms randomly placed to each side. At each room, since they had no lightspheres, Richard took one of the plentiful spheres from a bracket in the halland carried it with him. The rooms were various sizes, dark, and all were empty.They were elaborately trimmed with complex molding, some with patterned stonepaneling, but there was no furniture.“Why in the world are there rooms in here?” Shale asked, sounding annoyed by theuncanny uselessness of the rooms.“They’re actually representations of nodules in the complication,” Richard toldher. “If you were to draw this spell-form in the dirt with a stick, these wouldbe little tick marks you would make along the main, sweeping line of the spell.Their number and spacing has meaning to the complication. But since thespell-form is so big, it appears that rooms serve that purpose.”“The rooms aren’t close enough to share walls,” Kahlan noticed. “So what’s inthe space between the rooms?”Richard peered around in another of the empty rooms. “Good question. I have noidea, but since the empty space between the lines and nodes of the designdoesn’t serve a function, I suspect those spaces are simply filled in withrubble or possibly stone blocks.”When they finally came to a closed door on the left, Kahlan stopped and pointedin alarm. “Look. There are fingers sticking out from under that door.”Richard turned the latch and pushed the door partway open against the weight ofa desiccated corpse of a woman lying on the other side. The body looked like itmight have been there for many decades, possibly centuries. Coils of long hairwere still attached to the almost black, leathery skin of the skull. The fulldress was so layered in dust that it was hard to tell what color it had been.The arms sticking out from the sleeves were bones covered in thin, leathery skinthat was just as dark as that on the skull.The delicate, dried-out fingers of one hand were extended under the door in afeeble, dying effort to somehow open the door. The woman, probably dying ofthirst, had given up in that spot as the life went out of her.“Why would she be doing that?” Kahlan asked. “Reaching under the door likethat?”Richard leaned in far enough to look at the other side of the heavy door toconfirm what he suspected. “This branch of the spell-form, behind the door,flows in only one direction: in this way.”Kahlan gave him a questioning frown. “So?”“So, because it’s a one-way element, you can go into the room because that’s thedirection of the flow. The door doesn’t have a handle on the other side, so onceyou go in and the door shuts, you can’t open it to come back out.”“Why wouldn’t she break the door down?” Shale asked.Richard arched an eyebrow. “It’s a one-way element of the spell-form. Besideshaving no handle on the other side, this is an awfully heavy door for a smallwoman to break down. But even if she had been strong enough, it would alsolikely be blocked by the spell’s magic to prevent anything flowing out.”“Such a trap door is dangerous!” Shale objected. “Why in the world would thebuilders have put that in here?”“They were building a complication, not a palace attraction for visitors,”Richard said. “No one is supposed to come in here. People aren’t safe anywherein here.” He leaned in a little, giving her a look. “Not anywhere. That’s whythere are four locked doors protecting the place. That alone should tell yousomething important.”Shale’s mouth twisted a little in concession. “I guess you have a point.”“Just keep that in mind,” Richard told them. “Everywhere in the complication isdangerous in ways that we often won’t even realize. So don’t wander off to lookat anything. Stay close and keep a sharp lookout.”"},{"pageContent":"17 [006.html#a6]After the heavy door pulled closed on its own, like the lid on a coffin,Richard, Kahlan, Shale, and the five Mord-Sith continued on in silence untilthey finally reached the end of the long, curved corridor. There was apassageway going off to the right and another to the left. The way straightahead was blocked by a tall, flat metal door.“How do we know where we need to go from here?” Kahlan asked.“Since I don’t know where Michec would be, or where he has Vika, I don’t,actually,” Richard told her, “but since we haven’t come across any sign ofeither one, yet, we have no choice but to go farther in and keep looking.“The hall to the left is essentially a dead end unless you correctly make acomplicated series of choices necessary to get through the maze to an openelement in the spell-form. If you make a wrong choice, you could wander aroundin there for a very long time before finding your way out, if ever. From knowingthe complication and having studied the plan Harris showed us, I can tell youthat this hallway here, to the right, if you make the correct turns, goesthrough a series of intersections until it eventually connects to the way aheadon the other side of the node behind this door and then deeper into thecomplication.”“So both the hall to the right and this door eventually meet back up?” Kahlanasked.Richard nodded.“What’s behind the door?” Shale asked.“If we’re where I think we are in the complication, it’s a node that shouldeventually link to a convergence of branches. In the spell-form as you woulddraw it, it’s made as a circle with a line through it. That hall to the right isa way to get around this constricting node, but it’s a lot longer way around.The quickest way into the heart of the spell-form is straight ahead through thedoorway and across the node. Although it’s longer, I think the safer way wouldbe the hallways to the right.”“So if this isn’t a room, then why is there a doorway here?” Kahlan asked.“I don’t know for sure, but I imagine it’s a way to physically complete thecircle of the node to match the way the spell-form is drawn.”Kahlan eyed the dark passageway to the right. “Well, I get a bad feeling aboutthis hallway, here, to the right.”Shale looked from Kahlan to Richard. “Pregnant women have good instincts. Isuggest you pay attention to them.”“I always trust Kahlan’s instincts.”Richard opened the tall, heavy, flat metal door in front of them. As he did so,light spheres to either side beyond began to glow. They all stepped in and stoodin a tight cluster on a small landing inside the doorway and stared out at thecolossal octagonal room that came into view as the light spheres brightened.The vast space stretched high up into darkness. There were no windows Richardcould see. As soon as he realized that he was reflexively looking for windowseven though windows would be pointless down here, he became newly aware of howdeep underground they were, below even the tombs of his ancestors. Thatawareness brought back his old dread of being trapped in confined spacesunderground.A broad stone walkway built in the form of an arched bridge spanned across toanother door on the opposite side of the octagonal room. The walkway was six oreight feet wide. Richard leaned out and looked down at the drop-off under thebridge. He couldn’t see a bottom in the darkness below.There was no walkway around the perimeter of the room to the other side. If theywanted to proceed, they would have to cross the bridge over the ominous pit.Kahlan pressed a hand over her nose. “The smell of death is awful in here.”Richard took a light sphere from a bracket on the wall, held his breath, andleaned out, looking over the edge again. Even with the light sphere it was stilltoo dark to see anything.“The stench is too powerful to merely be some dead rats or small animals. It hasto be the rotting corpses of people.”“How do you lose your balance on a walkway that wide and fall off?” Shale asked.“There is no railing, but still …”Richard gave her a worried look. “Well, if they were moving through here indarkness, they could have simply stepped off the edge without realizing it.”Because of the smell of rotting flesh, and their need to get on with findingMichec, Richard didn’t want to spend any more time in the octagonal room than itwould take to get across.Even though the bridge was plenty wide enough, everyone stood pressed up againstthe door at their backs. The gagging stench of death was so oppressive it madethem all hesitant to proceed.“Maybe we should go around after all,” Kahlan said.The landing they were on had a twin across on the other side of the bridge.There was a closed door at the other end of the bridge that looked the same asthe one at their backs. On the walls all the way around the octagonal room werestacked stone moldings, as if at the base of the wall, as well as crownmoldings, but there was no floor or ceiling. They were merely decorative. Theunpleasant thought occurred to him that tombs were also decorated.Carved medallions stood out on each facet of the octagon-shaped room. Richardleaned over the edge to peer down the walls. He could see that there weresimilar carved medallions far below, and also up high on the walls, both almostin darkness, both denoting other levels of the complication. The stone of theroom, like the rest of the place they had seen so far, was covered in dark,dirty, gritty, mottled splotches, almost like lichen that grew on rocks. In someplaces it was draped with filthy cobwebs.“I think we should trust your first instinct,” Richard said. “After all, theother way around could have even worse things than this.”“Well, this is just ridiculous,” Shale huffed, obviously nervous about the stonebridge. “Do you mean to tell me that this is part of a spell-form? Like youwould draw in the dirt with a stick?”“Actually, yes,” Richard said. “Like I explained before. It’s a kind ofdecorative element in the complication.”Shale’s hands fisted at her sides. “Why in the world would the builders decoratethis spell-form?”It was clear that she didn’t like the place one bit. Richard couldn’t say thathe blamed her. But it wasn’t like they had a choice.“Well, the People’s Palace is similarly built in the shape of a spell-form laidout on the ground. It has a lot of beautiful, grand decorations—columns, arches,statues—that aren’t needed for that spell-form. Things like that aren’t really apart of the spell-form, so I can only assume the builders wanted to make itbeautiful or interesting.”Shale scowled. “You call this beautiful?”“No,” Richard admitted. “I’d say this place looks—”“Dangerous,” Kahlan said as she stared out across the bridge.Richard squeezed her hand. “The whole complication is dangerous, so that wouldmake sense.”“Do you have any idea where Michec would be?” Shale asked.When Richard gave a questioning look to the Mord-Sith, they all shook theirheads.“I don’t either,” Richard told her. “From the plans, this place is enormous. Ican tell you that this is only the very tip of one edge of the spell-form, andit comprises several levels. Michec wasn’t in any of those rooms behind us, soobviously he has to be deeper in.” Richard pointed down. “By the footprints inthe dust, he comes and goes this way, across the bridge. That would make sense,since the most straightforward way deeper into the heart of the spell-form isstraight ahead across the bridge.”Nyda stepped out past Richard. “We’d better go across first and check, then.”Richard was about to object, but all five of the Mord-Sith pushed between him,Kahlan, and Shale and started across the bridge before he had a chance to argue.Vale was the last one in line. She looked back over her shoulder. “Just waitthere a minute until we check out what’s beyond the door.”As she turned back to catch up with the others, the stone in the middle of thebridge abruptly shattered and began to fall away. Loud cracking noises came fromthe rest of the stone. Vale had to leap off one of the big blocks as it tippedand began to tumble into the darkness. Nyda and Cassia grabbed her arms andpulled her onto the far landing with them just as the rest of the stone bridgegave way underfoot and all dropped into the pit.Clouds of dust rose up as the stone fell with a roar. Large blocks of stone,parts of blocks, chunks, lumps, and flakes all cascaded down into the blackabyss.The Mord-Sith all pressed their backs against the door as even the edge of thelanding they were on began to crumble. To keep from falling, they opened thedoor and stepped back into the dark doorway.Shale, Kahlan, and Richard backed up against their own door in disbelief as theywatched the dust billowing up. They could hear the large blocks hitting thebottom somewhere far below in the darkness.The five Mord-Sith stood in surprise across the room, in the dark doorway,staring back through the clouds of dust at Richard, Kahlan, and Shale. He was atleast relieved that they all made it safely to the other side.Shale was beside herself. “I thought this was a spell-form! How could thathappen? It’s obviously not drawn in the dirt collapsing into a big hole in themiddle of it, is it?”“No, it isn’t.”“Then what just happened?” the sorceress demanded.“Chaos.” Richard drew his lower lip through his teeth. “The complication justdid something chaotic.”Shale stared back at him. “Or it was a trap laid by Michec.”“Either way,” Kahlan said, “we can’t leave them over there and us over here. Weneed to all stay close together.”“You’re right,” Richard said. “All of you … wait there,” he called across to thefive Mord-Sith. “We’ll go around and come meet you over there.”"},{"pageContent":"18 [006.html#a6]Kahlan followed closely behind Richard as he moved quickly down the sidehallway. Shale brought up the rear, watching over her shoulder so that theywouldn’t be surprised from behind. None of them said anything about it, but theywere all worried about what could have caused the stone bridge to collapse.After all, it had been there since the palace had been built, and it certainlyhadn’t looked like it was weak.They were even more worried, though, about the Mord-Sith being separated fromthem. After all, Michec had separated Vika from them. The bridge giving way felttoo much by design.Despite being in a hurry, Richard stopped briefly at each room they encountered.Each time he took a glass light sphere from a nearby bracket and used it so hecould quickly check inside the dark rooms. Most were empty. Several were not.The first one they found that wasn’t empty had a mummified corpse of a man. Eventhough his clothes were covered with a thick layer of gray dust, they couldstill see that the dead man was wearing a fancy outfit. Under his embroideredcoat there was a shirt with ruffles at the neck and cuffs, that Kahlanrecognized as likely a sign of nobility. Expensive-looking rings were still onthree of his fingers.“Do you think,” she wondered aloud, “that some of your wicked ancestors mighthave put people they didn’t like behind the locked doors of this complication tolet them wander around, looking for a way out, only to eventually die a slow andterrifying death in the darkness?”Richard, on a knee taking a quick look at the dead noble, looked back over hisshoulder. “I never thought of that, but you certainly could be right. Whatbetter way to rid yourself of a pesky detractor vying for power than to put themdown here where they would never be found? I think that Darken Rahl, though,favored more public demonstrations of his displeasure.”Kahlan nodded. “He liked to make examples of people, so these bodies are likelyfrom long before his time. The ones we’ve see so far look to have been down herefor hundreds of years.”In several places on their way down the hall, they came across yet moredesiccated remains with leathery skin, and a few that were mostly bare bones.All the bodies, though, were still dressed in clothes. They found both men andwomen where they had finally collapsed and died. It was surprising to Kahlan tosee how many people had managed to get into the remote place. Or were locked in.Despite the numbers they had found, she supposed that given the timespan it wasrare for anyone to find their way in.When they reached an odd-shaped room, Richard stopped to look in with the aid ofthe light sphere. Kahlan saw skeletal remains in a far, acutely pointed corner.Before Richard saw the remains, Kahlan was sure she saw the bones move.“Look,” she said, pointing.Richard took the light sphere closer. He bent over at the waist to look, thenstraightened.“Just bones. Did you see something?”“I saw them move,” she said.“Did you see what Kahlan saw?”Shale shook her head. “I didn’t see them until she said to look.”“Might have been a trick of the light. The light the spheres give off can bestrange at times.”Richard turned back and with the toe of a boot pushed at the bones. Theycollapsed inward with a hollow clacking sound. The skull toppled off the spineand rolled a short distance. Richard used his boot to push it back toward therest of the remains. After it stopped, facedown, it slowly rolled back over, asif to look up at him.“Whatever did that, we don’t have time to worry about it,” he said as he leftthe room. “We need to get to the Mord-Sith.”Kahlan knew she had been right about the bones moving, and the way the skull hadrolled back over was creepy, but she was more worried about getting to theMord-Sith before Michec did. He had already captured Vika, so he obviously hadthe gifted ability to deal with Mord-Sith.As they took a turn at an intersection and rushed onward down yet anothergloomy, filthy stone corridor, Richard abruptly stopped. Kahlan noticed a roomto the right. The door was closed, but Richard hadn’t stopped to look in theroom.He instead stood frozen, staring ahead at something.“What is it?” Shale asked from behind his left shoulder.“I thought I heard something …”All of a sudden, Kahlan heard a roar from somewhere off down the corridor.Blinding light ignited in the distance and rushed out from around a corner.Richard drew his sword. The sound of the steel being freed from the scabbard wasdrowned out by the wail of the fearsome fireball as it grew in size and speed.Richard dropped to his left knee. Holding the sword’s hilt in his right fist, hegrabbed the tip of the blade with his left hand.“Get behind me!” he screamed at them. “Get behind me!”As he was saying it a second time, the corridor out ahead filled with a biggerexplosion of expanding, whirling fire. The yellow-orange flames boiled up as theblaze spilled over the top of itself in its reckless, onward rush. The firecompletely filled the corridor as it raced toward them.Kahlan could feel the heat given off by the inferno. Black smoke swirled ingreat swaths with the flames breaking through as the fire erupted and rolledtoward them down the hallway.Richard held the sword up like a shield. “Get behind!”Kahlan crouched down behind him. She had seen Richard use the sword veryeffectively as a shield against conjured fire.Shale obviously had not.As Richard again yelled for them to get behind him, Shale charged at Kahlan,ramming a shoulder into her middle, colliding with such force that it liftedKahlan from her feet and drove them both into the closed door to the side. Theircombined weight smashed the door off his hinges. It fell out ahead of them astogether they both flew through the doorway.Rather than hitting the floor, Kahlan felt herself falling through space.She realized as she saw the yellow-orange light through the doorway far aboveher that there was no floor in the room.Kahlan had just started to scream when she hit the water."},{"pageContent":"19 [006.html#a6]Hitting the water was an icy shock that helped drive out what little air Kahlanstill had in her lungs from Shale crashing into her.Shale still had her shoulder in Kahlan’s middle with an arm around her waist asthey plummeted down underwater. Shale had thought she was saving Kahlan from theblast of conjured fire. Instead she had driven them both into the unknown.As they hit the water, Kahlan heard Shale’s head hit something hard. It made aterrible clonk of skull bone on something just as hard.As Shale went unconscious, she lost her grip on Kahlan. Kahlan tumbled under thewater, unable to get a breath, and lost track of up and down. She panicked withcomplete disorientation, not knowing which way was up toward the air. Shethrashed at the water but, being underwater, her arms couldn’t move very fast.She felt something slimy slide past her arm.She was desperate to pull in a breath, but she knew that if she tried tobreathe, her lungs would only fill with water and she would drown. Her throathad clamped closed with the terror of being underwater. She didn’t know whichway to swim to get to the surface.Thrashing wildly, blind, desperate for air, Kahlan thought suddenly of her twobabies. Were they to die in this forsaken place? Was she to be yet anothercorpse left for good in this awful place? Were her two babies to die before theyhad a chance at life?As her mind started going black, her arms and legs lost their power and slowlystopped their frantic thrashing. As her body went still, she finally bobbed tothe surface. When the air hit her face, she gasped it in. She was horrified bywhat else she gasped in. Coughing, she had to spit out a mouthful of bugs. Thesurface was covered with floating mats of beetles. They crawled up onto her faceas she struggled to keep her head above water.As she swiped the fat bugs off her face, she saw that light came from thedoorway, but it was up above her. It was too high up for her to reach for thethreshold. She could feel the legs of the beetles getting tangled in her hair asit floated out on top of the water. They clung to her floating hair as if itwere a raft.Kahlan gasped and gulped air as she struggled to tread water enough to keep herhead above the surface. Big, glossy, hard-backed bugs swam into her mouth. Shespat them out and tilted her head back to get a breath. The surface of the waterwas covered with the beetles. More scrambled up on her face as soon as sheswiped them off.Overhead, she saw fire roaring past the doorway, sending flickering red, orange,and yellow light down into the dark place where she struggled to keep her headabove the choppy surface of the water. She couldn’t seem to stop the beetlesfrom crawling over her eyes. They tried to burrow into her nose.As she got more air and was able to think more clearly, she jerked around, left,then right, looking for Shale. The raft of black bugs floated over her face onwaves she stirred up. She didn’t see the sorceress anywhere. She knew that assoon as the fire above stopped, it would be pitch black.Fearing to lose a second of the light, Kahlan upended herself and dove under thewater to try to find Shale. The water was murky, so she couldn’t see far, but atleast it got most of the bugs off her. With her eyes open under the water, eventhough the visibility was poor, she could see that the water was full of allkinds of debris. She had to push things aside as she searched.Kahlan had to surface, gasping in air for a moment, more beetles trying to clingto her face when she came up; then she upended and returned to searchingunderwater. She swam down and down, thinking the sorceress might have sunk tothe bottom, but she didn’t have enough air to reach the bottom and she didn’thave any idea how deep the water really was. She desperately raced up to thesurface again and gasped in some more air, swiping the clinging bugs from herface before getting a big breath and then going back down.As she pushed the underwater debris aside, she saw that some of it was thehandle and hinges of the door they had broken through, slowly sinking with woodstill attached.Then, when she grasped something to get it out of her way, she suddenly realizedthat she had her fingers in the eye sockets of a partly decomposed skull. Shepushed it away as forcefully as she could.As she did, something long and dark slid through the water close by.Just as she was starting to head for the surface again, she spotted Shale’shand. Kahlan grabbed the arm floating motionless in the water and with all herstrength swam upward toward the light.She broke the surface just as she was running painfully out of air. She pulledin lungful after lungful of air as she worked to paddle with her feet and onearm, trying to keep Shale’s face above the water. Wooden chunks of the brokendoor, covered with the beetles, floated nearby. The big black bugs crawled uponto Shale as if she were an island. Kahlan spat out more of the fat beetles.“Breathe! Breathe! Shale! Breathe!”Kahlan thought that the sorceress might have gasped in some air and spat outsome water, but as the light faded, it was hard to tell.And then, the fire above was completely extinguished, leaving them alone in thedark, dirty water with the big beetles crawling all over their faces. The soundof Kahlan’s splashing echoed around her. It stank so bad that she was reluctantto breathe in the air, but she desperately needed it.“Richard,” Kahlan cried out. “Richard! Help!”He suddenly appeared in the doorway up above. He was on his hands and knees,peering down into the darkness.“Here,” he called down. “Catch this.”He tossed a light sphere down toward her. Kahlan held Shale’s head above waterwith one hand and struggled to keep her own head above the surface, having toswipe the bugs away from her mouth and eyes as best she could. The sphere wasn’twhat she needed. She let it splash down close by and sink.“Shale’s unconscious!” Kahlan called up. “We’re in water! I can’t hold her upmuch longer!”As the light sphere Richard had tossed down sank, it lit the water under herwith eerie green light. When it did, Kahlan saw a long dark shape glide silentlypast.“Richard!” Kahlan yelled, on the ragged edge of panic. “Help! There’s somethingin the water!”Once he realized the situation, Richard pulled the baldric off over his head.Gripping the empty scabbard in one hand, he leaned out and held the rest of itdown toward her.“Grab hold!” Richard called down.Kahlan turned over and backstroked with one arm to try to pull Shale closer tothe dangling loop of leather that was the baldric.Splashing the water as she reached for it, she missed it over and over as itswung back and forth just out of reach. She suspected that up in the hallway litby the light spheres, he probably couldn’t see down where she was and didn’trealize that he wasn’t holding it still enough.When she finally reached the vertical wall below the door, she managed to hookan arm through the baldric. The fat black beetles scuttled up her arm and ontothe baldric. For a moment, she simply held on and panted from the effort ofkeeping Shale’s head above the churning surface of the water. Large, floatingmats of the hard-backed bugs collected around her. Kahlan had never felt sodirty in water before.“Can you put the loop of the baldric around her?” Richard called down. His voiceechoed around the empty space above the water. “See if you can put her arms andhead through and I’ll pull her up.”With great effort, Kahlan managed to slip the broad leather baldric over Shale’shead and then, one at a time, under both arms so that she finally hung limp inthe sling. As soon as she had the loop of the baldric around her, Richard pulledup on the scabbard, taking up the weight of the unconscious woman. Slowly, handover hand, he pulled the scabbard up, lifting Shale’s dead weight. Water and bigbugs sluiced down off her. Finally, Richard was able to get a hand on thebaldric. Once he did, he was able to grab it with both hands and lift. Hemanaged to pull the unconscious sorceress up to the doorway’s threshold and dragher in.As soon as Richard was able to pull the loop of the baldric off her, he lay backdown and, holding the scabbard, lowered the loop of the baldric down to Kahlan.Kahlan frantically reached for it. Bugs tried to crawl up her nose. She had toswipe them away.As she reached for the baldric again, the slimy thing under the water coiledaround her legs and abruptly pulled her under. She only had time to gasp in halfa breath. It filled her mouth with wriggling bugs."},{"pageContent":"20 [006.html#a6]As she was pulled under, Kahlan sacrificed some of her air to blow out themouthful of clawing, clinging bugs. She could see ghostly, glowing green lightbelow from the sphere that Richard had thrown down.The thing compressing around her legs suddenly spun her around, over and over,making her dizzy and nauseous. Then it began whipping her around under the waterlike a rag doll. She was helpless to fight against the power of it.Kahlan thought of her two babies. At the thought, terror for them, more than forherself, overwhelmed her. This wasn’t only attacking her; it was trying to killthem as well. She tried to swim toward the surface, but each time she did, thething that had her by her legs tightened forcefully and yanked her back under.It was hard to keep her eyes open to see because the water burned. Things underthe water, some hard, some squishy-soft, bumped against her as she was flunghelplessly about.She saw torn parts of bodies suspended in the water as she was dragged past. Shesaw an arm still attached to a shoulder with a couple of rib bones and danglingflesh. A hand, the tissues where it had been ripped off at the wrist wavinggently in the water, floated past her face when the thing that had her pausedfor a moment. She also saw other, unidentifiable meat with patches of skin orhair drift by under the water. She just wanted air.Desperate to get away, Kahlan pulled the knife at her belt. With all herstrength, she bent herself over to reach the thing that had her legs. Every timeshe stabbed it, it tugged her, jerking her straight as it dragged her throughthe water. As the thing thrashed, spinning and pulling her around in dizzyingloops, she briefly broke the surface of the water.Gasping in air, she saw Richard dive off from the doorway above. She heard himhit the water just as she was violently yanked back underwater so hard shefeared it might rip her legs off. She wondered if that was what had happened tothe disembodied limbs she’d seen floating in the turbid water.With the way the thing sharply whipped her around, Kahlan again began havingtrouble telling up from down, and even more trouble holding her breath. She wasexhausted, making it more difficult all the time.Each time it slowed, giving her some slack, she frantically swam for thesurface. She managed to break above the water for just long enough to gulp inanother breath before the coil around her legs tightened painfully and submergedher yet again. It almost seemed as if it wanted her to get a breath to keep heralive so it could continue to play with her, like a cat playing with woundedprey, encouraging it to try to get away so it could pounce again.As she was pulled back down with frightening speed, she suddenly felt Richard’shands grab on to her. He dragged himself downward along the length of her,clutching at her clothes hand over hand to pull himself down far enough to reachthe muscly body coiled around her legs. She saw that he had a knife between histeeth. The powerful thing that had hold of her effortlessly dragged them boththrough the water, Kahlan feet-first, Richard, holding her leg with one hand,face-first, as they were both twisted around and around.As the snakelike tentacle flexed, tightening painfully, she saw Richard start tohack away at it with his knife. He stabbed the fat gray tentacle over and over.With each stab she could feel the thing flinch and twist, its powerful musclesconstricting more each time.Since it still wouldn’t release her, Richard sawed at it with his blade, tryingto cut it off her. The blade opened great, gaping wounds, but the creaturepulled away before he could finish cutting it off her. Gouts of dark bloodpoured out, filling the water with inky clouds. Richard clung to her leg andkept stabbing away, over and over and over, desperately trying to get it offher.Then he was gone, shooting toward the surface for air. In what seemed like onlyan instant, he was back with renewed determination, hacking away more furiouslythan ever as Kahlan could feel herself going limp, her vision dimming from lackof air.At last, with the slimy tentacle slashed and cut nearly in two and bleedingprofusely, the pressure on her legs flexed once more and then finally relaxed.Richard kept cutting and stabbing until it finally fell away, freeing her legs.Once it did, with him helping her, Kahlan swam for the surface. She broke aboveit, her lungs burning, finally able to gasp in air, bugs clinging to her faceand hair. She didn’t care anymore. She just wanted to be able to breathe.Richard surfaced beside her, gasping for air along with her. “Let’s get out ofhere.”Kahlan wondered how, but she didn’t have the energy to ask.With an arm around her, under hers, Richard helped her swim over to the side. Hehooked the baldric with a hand. “Can you climb up.”Kahlan was gulping air, too exhausted to answer or even swipe the crawling bugsfrom her face, nearly too spent to tread water enough to stay afloat. She shookher head.“All right,” he said. “I’m going to climb up. As soon as I start up, put yourarms through the baldric, like you did with Shale. Once I’m up, I’ll pull you upafter me. Do you think you can at least do that much?”Kahlan nodded, unable even to say “Yes,” unable even to use her fingers to rakethe hard-backed bugs from her face.She managed to grab the dangling leather strap with a hand as she watched himclimb up the baldric and leather belt until he reached the doorway and then draghimself the rest of the way out. He immediately turned around, his head and armshanging over the edge, water and big black beetles pouring off his hair, to grabthe leather belt.“Put your arms through the loop. Kahlan—you have to put your arms through so Ican lift you. You won’t be able to hold on, otherwise. You need to loop it underyour arms.”Kahlan tried. Her arms wouldn’t respond to her wishes. She was so spent fromfighting for her life as she was being dragged under the water and whippedaround when she tried to stab the thing that her arms felt as heavy as lead. Shetried, but she couldn’t lift them.“Kahlan! Put your arms through!”She felt numb. It was starting to seem unimportant. She didn’t even have thestrength to claw at the bugs trying to crawl their way into her nose. She triedto blow them out, but that didn’t work. She just wanted to drift into eternalsleep and not have to fight any longer.“Kahlan, do it for our children!”She looked up at his face in the dim light. “What … ?”“Put your arms through. You have to do it to save the twins!”The twins … that thought sent a searing jolt of panic through her. She couldn’tlet them die before they had even been born just because she was exhausted. Thatwas no excuse.With a final effort, she struggled awkwardly to flop her arms through the loopof the baldric, finally lunging up enough to hook it around her under her arms.That was all she could do. The big black beetles scurried up her arms and up thebaldric.As she hung limp in the leather strap, she could abruptly feel herself beinglifted. Water and bugs sluiced off her body. The toes of her boots draggedslowly up the stone wall as she was pulled up clear of the water. She could hearRichard grunting with the frenzied effort of pulling her up as fast as he could.In her mind, she was helping him, but her body wasn’t actually doing anythinguseful to help.The loop of the leather baldric lifted her until she saw over the threshold ofthe doorway. Richard gave another mighty pull, lifting her another few feet,then managed to get first one arm around her, then another. Once he had her inhis arms, he straightened to lift her up and out. He fell back with her throughthe doorway, hugging her tightly to him, him on his back, Kahlan sprawled atophim.What looked like hundreds of fat black beetles fled off them both and scurriedacross the floor, going for cracks in the stone walls at the sides of thehallway.Kahlan could feel his heavy breathing and her own as she clung to him, thankfulto be alive. He had saved her. He had saved the twins. The terror leaving herbody left her trembling.After she had recovered for a moment, she pushed away and frowned in confusion.“Who held the scabbard for you to climb back up? Did Shale wake up and hold it?”Richard sat up with her. “No.” He gestured. “I saw that something had to haveahold of you because you kept being pulled under with such force. I put theblade through the metal loop where it attaches to the scabbard, then I stuck thesword in the stone floor for an anchor point. After that, I tossed the rest ofthe baldric over the edge and jumped in. I was hoping it would be long enough.Fortunately, it was.” Then he said, “By the way, here is your knife back. Youmanaged to stick it in that thing.”"},{"pageContent":"21 [006.html#a6]Kahlan crawled over to Shale. The soaking-wet sorceress was lying on her back ina puddle of water. Her face was ashen. Kahlan felt the side of her neck and wasalarmed to find that while the sorceress still had a pulse, her breath gurgledwith water.“She thought she was saving me from the fire,” Kahlan told Richard. “That’s whyshe pushed me through the door.”Kahlan slapped the woman, hoping to revive her. She shook her shoulders, butShale still didn’t respond. A few bugs hiding under her collar and hair ran out.At the sides of the hall, there were masses of the glossy black bugs trying toget into the spaces between the stone blocks and the floor. Kahlan pulled outone tangled in her own hair and tossed it against the wall. She flicked one offas it crawled across Shale’s face.“She risked her life thinking she was saving me and the babies from that fire.We have to help her. It doesn’t sound like she’s breathing right. It sounds likemaybe she has water in her lungs. What can we do to help her?”Richard leaned over, putting his ear close to her mouth for a moment, listeningto her breathing. “You’re right, she’s in trouble.”He quickly placed a hand in the center of her chest and another on her forehead.He closed his eyes as his head lowered in concentration. For a time, as Kahlanwatched, nothing seemed to be happening. Each of Shale’s breaths gurgled withwater.Kahlan then saw a warm glow around each of Richard’s hands. It lit his veins,pulsing with each of his heartbeats. The glow warmed in color as it began toflow through into the sorceress, pulsing with the power of Richard’s gift. For along time, Richard didn’t move and neither did Shale.Richard had healed her before, so Kahlan knew how good he was at using his giftto heal. When he had done it to her, it had brought her back from the cusp ofdeath. She hoped it could for Shale as well.Then, after a time, Shale abruptly gasped in a deep breath. She rolled to herside, hoarsely coughing out water. Richard put both hands on her back, lettinghis power continue to flow into her, helping her clear her lungs of the wateruntil she was finally able to take in breath after breath more normally. Betweenbreaths, she spat out more water.Richard finally sat back on his heels as they waited, giving the sorceress thetime she needed to recover and gather her wits. After a short time, she wasfinally able to get air free of water in and out of her lungs.“What happened?” Shale managed to ask in a grating voice as she panted. Shelifted both arms, looking at the sleeves of her dress as they dripped water.“Why am I all wet?”Richard stood and retrieved a glowing sphere from a nearby bracket on the wall.It grew even brighter in his hands. With one hand, he held the light sphere outthrough the doorway to show her.Shale staggered to her feet, finally standing with Kahlan’s help. Once she hadher balance, she went to the doorway to see what he wanted to show her. She puta hand on the doorframe for support as she leaned in a little and looked downinto the gloom.“Water? Why is there no floor? What is water doing down in there?” She shotRichard an angry look. “Why would there be water in there? That’s just crazy!”“I don’t know,” he said. “What I do know is that the complication spell-formdoesn’t call for it. It could simply be a deep pit that over time filled withwater.”Kahlan wondered if it could be something else.“Well, that’s just—”“I told you to get behind me,” Richard said, cutting off the sorceress’s heatedrant before it could get a good start. He lowered his head, giving her a seriouslook from under his brow. “You should have listened to me. I knew what I wasdoing. My sword acts as a shield against conjured fire. You would have been safebehind me, but instead, thinking you were protecting her, you dove with Kahlanthrough this doorway. I appreciate that you thought you were saving her from thefire, but as you can see, there is no floor and you both ended up nearlydrowning. Had it simply been a deep pit, you both could have fallen to yourdeaths. In a way, it’s fortunate that the pit is filled with water.”“Very foul water,” Kahlan added. “We both were fortunate that Richard was ableto help us get back out. He pulled you up while you were unconscious. He savedyour life.”Shale looked between the two of them, appearing mortified. “I could sense myselfat the veil. How did you manage to bring me back from the brink of death? Whatdid you do?”Richard arched an eyebrow. “You aren’t the only one who can use your gift toheal.”Shale had calmed down considerably. “Thank you. None of that could have beeneasy.”“It had to be Michec who conjured that fire. We must be getting close, so hetried to kill us. Fortunately, you and Kahlan survived your little swim.”Shale put her hand to her head and winced. “Why does my head hurt?”“You hit your head on something down there when we fell in,” Kahlan told her. “Ithink you cracked your skull on a decapitated head that was bobbing in thewater.”Shale made a face that revealed her disgust. “There are human remains downthere?”“Yes.” Kahlan shuddered as she flicked a waxy white chunk of flesh off her leg.She could see that it looked like human skin on one side of it. “But what Idon’t understand is how some kind of creature could be living down there.”“Creature?” Shale asked, her alarm rising again. “What creature?”“I don’t know. I thought it might be a snake nearly as thick as my leg that hadme, but with the way it whipped me around under the water, I think it had tohave been something big and powerful that grabbed me with a tentacle. Richardattacked it with his knife and managed to get it off me. But how could somethingthat big live down there? Other than the random person who fell in, and a lot ofbugs, what would it eat?”Shale considered briefly. “I suspect it might not have been a real creature.”Kahlan’s jaw dropped. “Not real? Are you kidding me? It was real enough to whipme around underwater and nearly drown me.”“I think you must be right that a monster of that size couldn’t live downthere.” The sorceress gazed off down the hall. “A witch man could have conjuredsuch a thing. Michec probably knew we fell in and conjured it. That’s the mostlikely explanation. It had to be him trying to kill you.”“Considering how real it behaved, how powerful it was, and how it reacted andbled when Richard cut it, if it wasn’t real then how are we to be able to tellwhat’s real from what’s not?” Kahlan asked.Shale regarded her with a grim expression. “With any kind of witch thatpowerful, you often can’t.”“Then how can we possibly fight back?”“When you are fighting the illusion, you are, in a way, fighting the witch. Whenyou cut the thing attacking you, slashing it as Lord Rahl apparently did, youare, in a way, harming the witch, because the illusion is partially an extensionof them. Odd as it may seem, it’s not entirely an illusion, not an independentcreature. It’s conjured but also real and as such, in certain aspects, connectedto them.”“We don’t have time to discuss it right now,” Richard interrupted. “We’re allalive. We need to go after Michec. I have a feeling that Nyda, Cassia, Vale,Berdine, and Rikka don’t have any defense against the man, otherwise he wouldn’thave been able to capture Vika. Come on. Conjured fire and creatures, real ornot, I need to catch him before he can get far.”“What are we going to do when we catch him?” Shale asked.“Kill him,” Richard said without pause as he started out."},{"pageContent":"22 [006.html#a6]Richard lifted his arm out to the side to keep Kahlan and Shale back. He couldtell by the route they had taken that they were near the heart of thespell-form. They all felt the increased sense of danger.He wanted to carefully peek around the corner to see what lay ahead, and hedidn’t want either Shale or Kahlan showing themselves. Not that they were goingto be able to sneak up on the witch man. He obviously knew they were comingafter him. Besides whatever gifted ability he might have, their mere presencemade the light spheres begin to glow. Even with their faint green glow off downthe halls, it was hard to see, because the stone walls of the passages in thecomplication were so dark it seemed to suck up the light.While the lights beginning to illuminate made it possible to see, it would alsoalert anyone to their presence, which made stealth impossible.Even before looking, Richard felt something. He couldn’t quite determine what itwas he felt, but it gave him a feeling of dread in the pit of his stomach. Hedecided that the feeling had to be from the continual state of heightenedtension. His grandfather would have told him to fear what he knew, not what hewas afraid of. But Zedd hadn’t ever given him any advice on complication spellsor witch men.Richard slowly moved his head out just enough so that he could see down the darkpassageway with one eye.In the faint green glow, he saw something down low far off down the dark stonehallway. He couldn’t quite figure out what it was.As he squinted, he suddenly realized what it was he was looking at.Richard let out a curse under his breath. He held up a finger without lookingback to prevent Kahlan asking what would have made him use that kind oflanguage.As slowly and quietly as possible, Richard drew his sword. The gleaming blackblade hissed with lethal fury as it came out of the scabbard, its power joiningwith his own rising anger, eager to be unleashed on the enemy. It was a contestas to what lusted to kill Michec more, Richard’s rage or the sword’s.Kahlan leaned in close behind him. “What is it?” she whispered.He looked back over his shoulder. “I think I see the Mord-Sith.”“You think?” Shale asked.“What about Michec?” Kahlan whispered. “Do you see him?”Richard peered into the distance, then looked back over his shoulder. “No. Thereis a broad opening of some kind. It’s a lot wider than a doorway or anintersection with a hall. There is light coming from inside—light from lightspheres. That means there has to be someone inside. I’ll give you one guess asto who that would be.”“No need to guess,” Shale said. “Not only can I smell him, I can sense him withmy gift. I can sense how powerful he is. Let me tell you, it’s an uncomfortablefeeling.”“I know,” Richard said. “I feel it too. Stay behind, and out of the way of mysword. If I can get close enough, I intend to separate Michec’s head from therest of him.”“Do you think it’s a good idea to simply go in there?” Kahlan asked.“Not really, but I doubt he is going to come out and surrender. I don’t know howelse we will have any chance of eliminating him other than going in there afterhim. Since he conjured fire, that means he can defend against it, so I can’tburn him out.”With Kahlan and Shale following close on his heels, Richard came out from aroundthe corner and moved carefully but swiftly down the hallway. He looked back fromtime to time, as did the other two, checking for any threat from the rear. Hedidn’t see the witch man anywhere, but he couldn’t yet see into the room. It waslikely he was hiding inside.As they reached the broad opening of the vast room, lit from within, they foundwhat Richard feared he had seen.The five Mord-Sith were lined up on their knees just in front of the broadentrance, each with both hands held out, their Agiel resting in their upturnedpalms.Keeping an eye on the room beyond, Richard touched Berdine’s shoulder, the firstof the five kneeling side by side in a row. She didn’t react. He urgentlywhispered her name as he waved his hand in front of her eyes. She didn’t so muchas blink. He shook her shoulder; she didn’t react.“Any idea what he’s done to them?” he asked Shale.Shale knelt in front of Berdine and placed her hands to either side of her head.Berdine stared ahead without seeing, without blinking, without moving. Afterbowing her head a moment, Shale finally stood and let out a troubled sigh.“Nothing. I sense nothing. They might as well be statues.”“How is that even possible?” Richard frowned at her. “What does it mean?”Shale regretfully shook her head. “He has somehow blanked them out. That’s theonly way I can explain it. Berdine doesn’t give off any sign of life. I can seethat they are alive, but I can feel no sign of life in her. Despite their eyesbeing open, they are not conscious.”Kahlan gently shook Berdine’s shoulder. There was no reaction from theMord-Sith.“The only way you are going to get them back is if you can get Michec to releasethem,” Shale told them. “They are captives of his power.”“What if I simply kill him?”Shale shrugged. “That would work.”Richard couldn’t imagine what the witch man could have done to make the fiveMord-Sith kneel and offer their Agiel.He really didn’t want Kahlan coming with him, but there was little choice—hejudged it more dangerous to leave her behind. Michec would probably love tocatch her alone and capture her. That would give him even more power overRichard.“Can you do anything to block what he can do?” he asked Shale.Her hopeless look told him all there was to know.“If I can get close enough, I can use my Confessor’s power on him,” Kahlan said.“That would render him harmless.”“With his ability, he’d likely incapacitate you the way he did the Mord-Sith,”Shale told her. “I don’t know if it would even work on him, but you would neverget the chance to try.”“Just stay clear of my sword,” Richard said as he made his way past the fiveunmoving, kneeling Mord-Sith. “Shale, if you can do anything to slow him orhinder his ability, please do.”"},{"pageContent":"23 [006.html#a6]As he moved between the five Mord-Sith and through the opening, the glassspheres inside brightened enough to reveal what was in the room. As he took inwhat he was seeing, it felt like Richard’s heart came up in his throat.The room was a central complex in the complication spell. Because of that, itwas huge. But that was not what was so terrifying about the room.In a gridwork pattern about eight or ten feet apart, throughout a large portionof the room, in row after row, bodies hung on chains by manacles on theirwrists. In the ghostly green glow from spheres around the room, it almost lookedlike a forest in an eerie fog; the bodies resembled tree trunks. The silence washaunting.Besides the gagging stench, it was clear from their condition that the peoplehanging from chains hooked to the beamed ceiling were long dead. Some of thebodies were charred a bubbled black from head to foot. Most, though, had beenskinned alive, their flesh in a bloody pile beneath their feet. The heads, fromthe neck up, still had their skin, presumably to preserve the expressions ofstark terror and pain frozen on their faces. Their hands, held by manaclesaround their wrists, also had skin, making it look like they were wearing palegloves. Everything else had been carefully skinned, even the toes. With the redmuscles and white tendons exposed, the figures all looked grotesquely naked.Her face contorted in disgust, Kahlan held a hand over her mouth and nose, thesame as Shale. The stench of death was overpowering.Richard’s rage relegated the smell to a distant distraction.All those bodies hanging motionless above bloody piles of their skin, a mistdrifting among them in the near darkness, with the faint green light from allthe light spheres filtering among the carcasses and casting multiple fingers ofshadow across the floor, was just about the creepiest thing Richard had everseen. This had obviously been done by a deranged person who very much enjoyedthe grisly work.As Richard moved into the kill room, through the forest of motionless, hangingbodies, he spotted a faint movement in the distance. He wove his way quietlyamong the hanging corpses, sword held in both hands, ready to kill Michec.As Richard came around one of the stiff corpses, he suddenly came face-to-facewith Vika. His breath caught and he froze in his tracks.She was naked, hanging in manacles hooked by a chain to a bolt in one of thebeams of the ceiling. Her red leather had been thrown aside. Unlike all theothers hanging in the room, she was still alive, if barely, and still had herskin. Her brow tightly bunched, her eyes tracked him as he moved in among thecorpses.Tears streamed down her cheeks, blood down her chin.She had obviously been beaten to within an inch of her life, but far worse,there was a knife slit that had opened a wound in her belly. A long length ofintestine had been pulled out of that incision. It hung down in front, along onebloody leg, some of it at the end coiled on the floor in a puddle of bloodbeneath her feet.The end of Vika’s Agiel was sticking out of the open wound in her belly, thefine gold chain hanging down from the end.Had Richard not been so enraged at what had been done to her, he might havethrown up.“Please,” she whispered, hardly loud enough to be heard. “Please, Lord Rahl …kill me. Please …”He stepped close. “Stay with me, Vika. I’m going to take care of you.”Her whole body shook slightly, partly from the beating and the open wound in herbelly, but mostly from the pain her Agiel was giving her. It had been pushedinto the wound, into her exposed insides, to add unrelenting agony to everythingelse he had done to her.Through her pain, she managed to whisper, “Lord Rahl … run …”Richard started to reach for the Agiel, to pull it out and at least stop thatmuch of her pain, but he stepped back when he heard a soft chuckling. With ahand, he urgently shepherded both Kahlan and Shale around behind him, backingthem up to give himself room to use his sword.He couldn’t tell where the chuckling was coming from. It seemed to echo out fromeverywhere. As he looked all around for the threat, dark smoke, clinging low tothe floor, glided in under the hanging corpses. It snaked slightly as it movedamong the bloody piles of skin. It seemed almost alive, the way it moved.As it came close, it gathered into a thick, greenish-gray cloud. That increasingmass of murky smoke rose up, so heavy it obscured everything beyond it.Richard took a mighty swing with the sword through the smoke. Wisps of it curledaway when the blade passed through and disturbed the air, but there was nothingsolid in it.He heard the soft chuckling again. He gripped his sword tighter as he steppedback from the tall, hazy mass of smoke.The smoke seemed caught up in a sudden wind, and with a swirl, as if somethinghad passed close by, it spun as it faded away into the air.When it was gone, there was Moravaska Michec standing before them.He was a big, barrel-chested man past his middle years. His face was coarse, asif made up of chunky blocks of clay that had hardened together before beingrefined into proper features. His heavy brow nearly obscured dark eyes peeringout from narrowed eyes. A dark, pockmarked complexion scarred his cheeks andbulbous nose.He wore what had once been white robes, similar to the white robes Richardremembered Darken Rahl always wearing. But Michec’s white robes were stainedwith what looked like years of blood and gore, as if they had never been washed.Richard could understand why Nyda said that he was called the Butcher. It lookedmuch like he was wearing a butcher’s apron.Richard could easily understand the other reason, hanging all around the room,he was called Michec the Butcher.There was a cloth stole, such as a priest would wear, around the back of hisneck and draped down over the front of his shoulders. It was embroidered withlayers of designs in golds and purples. Richard guessed that it had denoted hishigh rank back when Darken Rahl ruled. But like his robes, it was soiled withblood and dark stains.The man’s full head of short hair was salt-and-pepper, and stuck up from hisscalp in greasy spikes. The thick mass of his beard, confined for the most partto the rim of his broad jaw and chin, had been braided into dozens of long, fatstrands hanging to mid-chest. They looked like nothing so much as snakes hangingfrom the rim of his face.His fat fingers, ending with jagged, broken nails, were stained with messy blackmuck under the nails and in the crevices and wrinkles, obviously from many yearsof his sadistic fixations.His sly smile conveyed abject cruelty.“So tell me,” he said as he gestured all around. “Really, was this your plan? Tosimply walk in here and kill me? That was your plan? You think yourself thatpowerful? Powerful enough to rule, to protect those loyal to you?” He cluckedhis tongue with amusement. “My, my. Such arrogance.”Richard didn’t answer. His mind was spinning with a thousand thoughts. For somereason, though, it felt like he couldn’t connect those fragments of thoughts,couldn’t make his mind work.The man’s cunning smile widened. “You all are probably are wondering why yourmeager abilities aren’t working. Well, I must confess: I spelled this room. Andyou simply walked right in here, distracted by my collection of pretty people.So you see, like the Mord-Sith, you three aren’t as powerful as you imagineyourselves to be, because in here, even what powers you do have are blocked.” Helifted his heavy brow. “Just like all your pretty little Mord-Sith. Not evenyour bond protected them.”Richard tried to summon the gift he knew was there, somewhere, deep inside, butit simply didn’t respond. By the look on Shale’s face, she was having the sameproblem.Michec gestured to Vika. “She’s mine, you know. Darken Rahl himself assigned herto me for training. After that, she was given to me. I only loaned her to HannisArc. He was supposed to return her. When he died—because of you—she wasobligated to come back to me. An inviolable duty she chose to ignore.” A darklook came over his features. “I am seeing to it that she fully regrets herdisobedience.” He reached out and with the tip of his first finger pushed theAgiel a little deeper into the gaping belly wound.Vika’s eyes rolling back in her head; her chin quivered as a shudder of agonywent through her.“I will similarly deal with her equally disloyal sister Mord-Sith.” He glancedtoward the opening into the room where they were kneeling before looking back atRichard. He smiled with menace. “Once I deal with you and your lovely wife.”He lifted a hand as he walked off a few paces, then turned back. “Once I do, Iwill be richly rewarded. You see, the Golden Goddess has become … annoyed, shallwe say, by your stubborn resistance.” He stepped closer. “I assured her I couldhandle the situation. We came to … an arrangement.”Richard was horrified to learn that Michec was working with the Goddess. Eventhough he was filled with rage, he couldn’t make his gift respond to that fury.Try as he might to call it forth, it felt like there was nothing there. Whateverkind of spell the witch man had used, besides blocking his gift, it also madeRichard’s thinking foggy.Michec swept a hand around in a grand fashion, as if proudly showing off hisyears of dedicated labor.“As you can see, my work continues. It was interrupted by you, Richard Cypher,the pretend Lord Rahl. For that, you will suffer, I can assure you.“But the goddess, you see”—he smiled with meaning at Richard as he pointed afinger toward Kahlan—“wants more than anything to hold the bloody remains of thetwo children growing in her belly. I assured her she will have her wish.”Richard came unhinged.With a cry of rage, he abandoned his attempt to use his gift and instead wentfor the man, sword-first."},{"pageContent":"24 [006.html#a6]It felt to Richard like they must have been walking for days. The Azrith Plainseemed endless. Richard’s mouth was so dry from thirst that he could hardlyswallow anymore. His tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth. The air felt hot,but there was no sun. He judged that it must be sometime after twilight by theodd, purplish light laced with streaks of green. He was glad to finally be gonefrom the People’s Palace and on the way, but he was so thirsty he could hardlythink of anything else.“Is there any water left?” he asked Kahlan.“No.”He seemed to remember, then, that he had told her to have the last few swallows.But why didn’t they bring more?For what seemed hours, they trudged on across the parched ground. Despite howlong they walked, it never seemed to get any darker. The sky was black abovethem, with the color of a purple bruise farther down where it met the horizon.“Why didn’t we bring horses?” he asked. “This would be easier if we had horses.”“You said we didn’t need them,” Kahlan said in a flat tone from behind himsomewhere.Richard squinted, trying to remember why he didn’t think they should bringhorses. That seemed strange. It was going to be a long journey. Horses wouldhave made it easier, and they could have carried more water.They had already been traveling for what seemed days and days. As they marchedever onward, the night seemed endless. The Azrith Plain, so barren and empty,seemed endless. He wished they had brought horses. And more water.“Do you want to stop?” he asked.Kahlan didn’t answer. She was probably so thirsty she didn’t want to talk. Hefelt too thirsty to bother asking again, so he slogged on.It was hard to walk, because his legs hurt. His back hurt, too, but more thananything, his shoulders ached something fierce.After endless walking, he at last began to see trees out ahead. He did his bestto pick up his pace. He started to run for them, because trees meant water.Despite how hard he tried, his legs moved like they were mired in molasses.When he finally reached the trees, he found a brook, as he had known he would.The water looked clean and cool. He fell to his knees and started scooping upwater, drinking and drinking and drinking from his hands.But the water, no matter how much he drank, didn’t do anything to quench histhirst.Kahlan and Shale stood watching him, as if he had lost his mind.“Aren’t you thirsty?” he asked as he looked back over his shoulder at them.“Don’t you want to get a drink?”Kahlan shrugged and knelt then. She cupped her hands, bringing water to herlips. She drank and then scooped more water, to drink that as well. It ranbetween her fingers. He watched as she drank, wishing that he could satisfy histhirst the way she seemed to be able to do.He tried it again. Nothing. No taste, no wetness. Nothing. He put his face underthe water, guzzling. It simply wouldn’t quench his terrible thirst. It angeredhim, because it looked so good and felt so good in his hands, so good againsthis lips. But he might as well have been drinking sand for all the good it didhim.He rushed to his feet when he saw Kahlan walking on ahead. He had to protect herand the twins. Even if he couldn’t get a drink to satisfy his thirst, he had toprotect her.That was all that mattered: protect Kahlan.Richard saw that his wrists were bleeding. He stood and stared at them. Hecouldn’t make sense of it.When he looked up, he saw his skinny grandfather standing on a rock in among thetrees.“Zedd?” Richard blinked. “Zedd, is that you?”“Indeed it is, my boy.”His familiar, wrinkled face, his skin and bones under his simple robes, lookedso good that it made Richard ache.“Zedd … what are you doing here?”He peered at Richard in that way that Richard knew well. “To help you, ofcourse, my boy. I have come to help you.”Richard suddenly broke into tears of joy at seeing his grandfather. He hadthought he was dead, but here he was, alive.“Listen to me,” Zedd said.Richard nodded, still choked with tears. “I’m listening.”“You have to get out of here, Richard.”Richard looked around. In the dim, greenish-purple light, he couldn’t see much.“Get out of here?” Richard frowned at the warm and familiar face of his belovedgrandfather. He loved the old man so much. “What do you mean, I have to get outof here? We’re on our way to the Wizard’s Keep. We have to get to the Keep whereit’s safe while I figure out a way to stop the Glee.”“You’re not going to get there this way. You have to get away from here, first.”Richard glanced around and then took a step toward his grandfather, so close heknew he could reach out and touch his wild, wavy white hair if he wanted to.“Get out of here? Why? Where are we?”Zedd smiled in a sad way. “Don’t you know, my boy?”“No,” Richard said, his mouth so dry he could hardly talk. “What is this place?”Zedd looked at Richard in silence for a long, loving moment.“Richard, you are in the Wasteland.”The word “Wasteland” jolted Richard so hard that he gasped and opened his eyes.He saw blood running down his arms from the manacles clamped tightly around hiswrists. His shoulders were in terrible pain. With a sense of dread and alarm, herealized he was hanging from the ceiling among the corpses.He had been hung from the ceiling gridwork of iron pins, facing Vika. Barelyconscious, she trembled in agony as she watched him through slitted eyelids. Hecould read the look on her face. It said he shouldn’t have come after her.Richard twisted and looked over to see Shale on his left, hanging unconscious inmanacles.He looked to his right, then, and was horrified to see Kahlan also hanging inmanacles chained to the ceiling. Unlike Richard and Shale, she was naked. Herface had lurid bruises on it. Her left eye was a painful-looking shade of purpleand almost swollen shut. Blood from her mouth dripped in strings from her chin.She was trembling as tears ran down her cheeks. She didn’t look over at him.At the sight of Kahlan hanging helpless in the forest of dead bodies, Richardwent wild, thrashing around, trying to break free. He drew his knees up, benthimself in half, gripped the chain and lifted his legs up over his head to pushhis feet toward the ceiling to try to pull out the anchor bolt. The ceiling wastoo far to reach. His legs flopped back down and he swung helplessly. Theattempt extended the wounds in his wrists. Fresh blood ran down in littlerivulets. He had no idea how long they had been unconscious and hanging from theceiling.Michec stepped into his field of view. “My, my. The Lord Rahl himself, the manwho defeated the great Darken Rahl. You hardly seem so big and important now, doyou?”Richard gritted his teeth in rage at himself, at how stupid he had been tounderestimate Michec and let them be captured. He desperately wanted to kill thewitch man. He struggled to pull his bloody hands through the manacles so that hecould get them around the man’s throat. Despite how slippery the blood was, theiron bands were far too tight for that to work.“I was more than angry that you ruined the empire that Darken Rahl was building.It was going to be grand. You only defeated him through trickery, not throughstrength. You are weak and undeserving to take such a great man’s place.” Michecsmiled with hate. “But now, the Golden Goddess and her kind will build a betterempire, a world that will serve as their hunting ground. I will run it forthem.”When the man lifted a hand back, Richard was horrified to see the tall, darkshapes of at least a dozen Glee step out of the shadows of the hanging, skinlesscorpses.Michec twined one of the beard braids around a filthy finger as he stepped awayfrom Richard to stand in front of Kahlan. He grabbed her face, gritting histeeth, squeezing so hard she cried out.“For your husband to truly understand how worthless and undeserving he is as aleader, I am going to let him watch me skin you alive.” He pulled out a knifeand as he looked into her eyes, he licked the blade. “Please do scream for him,would you? As soon as I finish, these Glee will claw those two babies from yourwomb as you hang helpless and watch them do it.”Three of the glistening Glee came forward on their long, muscular legs, clackingtheir claws, eager to get at her. Kahlan’s eyes went wide in terror as one ofthem pressed its sharp claw against her belly and hissed in her face.Michec used the back of his hand to urge the dark creatures back. “Not yet, myfriends. You must wait until I finish.”The Glee reluctantly stepped back.“After I have skinned her, then you may rip out her babies. You have my oath,the oath of a witch man.”That seemed to satisfy them and they retreated farther back into the shadows towait until he was done.Michec leaned in close to Kahlan, smiling at her, inches from her face, as hecut through the skin along the side of her throat.“Shall we begin, Mother Confessor?”Gazing into her green eyes, Michec worked two fat fingers in through the pockethe had cut and under her flesh to get a good grip on her skin. Panting interror, Kahlan let out a shriek that felt like it ripped Richard’s soul."},{"pageContent":" The story continues.Episode 4 of the Children of D’HaraWITCH’S OATHcoming soon..."},{"pageContent":"ABOUT THE AUTHOR [006.html#a6]img1.jpg [../Images/img1.jpg]TERRY GOODKIND is a number one New York Times bestselling author.
